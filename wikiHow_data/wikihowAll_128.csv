Puree butternut squash.",How to Buy Butternut Squash," Butternut squash should be a uniform tan color on the outside and bright orange on the inside. Since most butternut squash is sold whole, you'll need to look at the skin when choosing your squash. The skin should be hard and dull. You should also see at least 1-inch of stem on the squash.If the butternut squash is shiny, it may have been coated with wax to make it last longer or it may not be ripe yet.;
, You'll probably notice that butternut squash come in a variety of sizes. Because of this, there's no exact weight that the squash should weigh. Instead, the squash should feel heavy for its size.For example, a small or skinny butternut squash that's ripe might only weigh a pound while a large, rounder squash might weigh more like 3 or 4 pounds.

, Look over the entire squash to make sure there are no cracks or soft spots. Soft spots means that the squash is overly ripe and may start to mold. You should also make sure there is no visible mold on the outside of the butternut squash.The butternut squash should be perfectly smooth, although you may be able to find a slight rough spot where the butternut squash rested on the ground as it grew.

, Once you've bought a ripe butternut squash, keep it in a cool, dark place that's around 55 °F (13 °C). Try to find a storage place like a basement or closet where it won't be exposed to sunlight or high humidity.

Even smaller types like acorn and spaghetti squashes should feel dense for their size.If the squash seems a bit light, it’s either underripe or rotten.;
, Take a look at the stem to see if the squash is in good condition. Healthy winter squashes will have hard, dry stems with a uniform light brown or grayish hue. Soft, discolored spots are typically a sign that the squash is diseased, or that insects have been feeding on it.Pass up a squash if the stem is not intact. You might get it home only to discover that it’s bad.
Squashes that still have green stems should be given more time to mature, as this means they’re not completely developed., Turn the squash over and appraise its color and surface texture. Every species of squash will be a little different—butternut squashes are a faded tan shade, while kabocha look like unripe pumpkins and acorn squashes have dark green, mottled rinds. It’s important that the color of the squash be consistent all over, and for the skins to have a dull matte appearance.Test the freshness of a squash by rapping it a few times with your knuckle. It should make a dull thumping sound.
Waxy, shiny skin means the squash has been picked too early., Don’t buy a squash if it has any visible signs of damage, such as nicks, cracks or splitting. Mushy spots might be a sign of mold, so stay away from squashes that feel soft to the touch. If it has an unpleasant odor or a sickly color, it’s most likely going bad.Dark, slimy seeds and a rank smell are the most common characteristics of a squash that has gone bad.
If you’re not sure if a squash is still good, dunk it in a container of water. If it floats, it’s past its prime., Though it is sometimes classified separately of other winter squashes, pumpkin originates from the same family, and is close enough in appearance, flavor and versatility to include. Pumpkin is most commonly a brilliant orange and grows to be big and round. It is beloved enough to be the key ingredient in dozens of different treats, from pies and stews to candies and even lattes.Everyone's favorite fall gourd, the pumpkin, is grown in over a dozen varieties of its own.Once you scoop out the pulp and seeds inside the thick shell, just about anything can be done with a pumpkin's sweet, tangy, moist flesh.

, Butternut squash is the quintessential winter squash for many people. It can be identified by its long, bulbous shape and pale color. When cooked, butternut squash takes on a delicate, creamy texture and is extra flavorful when caramelized. It’s especially good when incorporated into sweet desserts.Butternut is arguably the most popular winter squash. It is an essential ingredient in countless seasonal recipes, and when preserved can be used to make decorations, containers and even musical instruments.Butternut squash is usually peeled, seeded and cut into small sections before it is cooked. You can also cut it in half and roast it with the skin on to make preparation easier.

, As their name suggests, acorn squashes are small and plentiful. Since they’re so compact, you can grow or store a lot of them at once. Their skins feature wide ridges of a deep green color. Underneath, the flesh of an acorn squash is firm and has a dry, earthy taste. Due to their complex flavor, acorn squashes are some of the most versatile winter squashes. They can be whipped into a confection or savory side dish with equal success.
This sort of squash has a thick, hard shell under which most of the meat lies. To make things simple, core and cut it into slices the way you would a zucchini or melon.
Try splitting acorn squash in half and baking it like a sweet potato., Kabocha is a somewhat less common winter squash that is becoming better known. Much like a pumpkin, they grow smooth and round with green or dusty orange shells and bright yellow-orange pulpy flesh inside. Kabocha squash can be used as you would a pumpkin or butternut squash to make rich soups, purees and desserts.Also like a pumpkin, you’ll have to scoop out the seeds and pulp before cooking with it.
Since its skin is so tough and dense, kabocha will usually have to be roasted before you can slice it and remove the innards., These moderately-sized squashes are oblong and yellow, and look something like a mango. They take their name from the fact that their flesh can be shredded into strips and cooked like pasta. Spaghetti squashes are soft and fibrous with a mild flavor that makes them perfect a wide variety of dishes.Spaghetti squash can be prepared using a mandoline slicer, or simply cooked and shredded with a fork.Try it with fresh marinara or cream sauce as a healthier alternative to pasta.

, Cut the squash in half lengthwise. Place the halves skin-side down on a baking sheet and drizzle them lightly with canola oil. Bake the squash at around 400 degrees for 45 minutes to an hour, or until the flesh is tender enough to be scooped out with a fork. If you want, top the squash with butter and brown sugar for a sweet finish, or sea salt and cracked pepper for a more savory dish.Sweet, creamy squashes like butternut and kabocha are some of the best for roasting.
Cutting the squash into cubes will help it cook faster.

, Take an acorn or spaghetti squash and cut it into thin slices or inch-sized cubes. Then, throw it on the grill or pop it in the oven or steamer with other hearty vegetables like carrots, onions and bell peppers. The soft texture and subtle earthy notes of the squash will add a little complexity to the crunchy, savory veggies.Season your vegetables of choice to taste, or make a flavorful marinade with soy sauce, garlic and lemon juice., After removing the skin and seeds, place the flesh of a butternut, acorn or kabocha squash in a food processor and pulse it until it’s a thick paste. You can then use this puree to flavor cakes, pies or stews. When combined with other ingredients, it could even be turned into compote or autumn-inspired dip.Be sure to blend the squash until its a smooth, even consistency. The amount of time this will take may vary, depending on the type of squash you’re using and how ripe it is.
Freeze leftover puree and break it out later on.

, If you have no immediate use for the squash, stow it away somewhere cool, dark and dry. The bottom of a cupboard or a shelf in the basement will work just as well as the produce crisper drawer in your refrigerator. When stored correctly, most winter squashes will stay ripe for up to three or four months.Humidity and lack of airflow can cause squash to go bad faster.
Throughout history, winter squashes have been prized for their ability to keep throughout the long, cold winter months.

Pick or purchase ripe plums.,
Wash the plums.,
Slice the plums into wedges.,
Lay the plum slices on a baking sheet.,
Freeze the plum slices until they're firm.,
Put the plum slices in a freezer storage bag and freeze.,
Reconstitute the plums.",How to Freeze Plums1," Look for plums that are in good shape, free of blemishes, wrinkles and spots. Plums should be frozen when they are at the peak of their ripeness, deliciously sweet and flavorful. Don't freeze plums that are a little green or overripe, because they won't have good flavor or texture when you thaw them out.


Do a taste test before freezing a batch of plums. Bite into one of the plums. If purply-red juice drips down your chin, and the plum is sweet and flavorful, the rest are probably good to freeze. If it's too tart, or too grainy, you might not want to freeze this batch of plums.
If the plums are a little hard, you can leave them at room temperature for a few days to ripen. Freeze them when they are just ripe.;
, Run them under cool water and use your fingers to gently rub their skin. Rinse away any dirt or debris.

, Use a sharp paring knife to slice them into wedges about an inch thick. Discard the pits and stems. Continue slicing the plums until you've processed the whole bunch.

, Spread them out in a single layer, with no overlapping, so that they don't stick together when they freeze. Cover the baking sheet with a layer of plastic wrap.

, Put the whole tray of plums in the freezer and leave it inside until the plums are firm and dry, and no longer sticky. It should take about an hour to get them to this stage.

, Fill the bag to within an inch of the top, and squeeze out as much excess air as possible (or use a vacuum sealer, which sucks out the air for you). You can use a straw to suck out the extra air and close the bag tightly. Air trapped in the bag will cause the plums to get freezer burn more quickly.


Dry-frozen slices of plum will keep in the freezer for up to 6 months.
To keep plums for longer than 6 months, you need to pack them in syrup to prevent freezer burn.

, Frozen plum slices are perfect to add to smoothies or use in cobblers and other desserts. They also add a cute decorative touch when added to cocktails or fruity drinks in place of ice cubes.

If the plums are still a little green, ripen them on your counter for a few days before freezing them.

, Packing plums in syrup and freezing them, then reconstituting them causes the peels to lose their pleasant texture and get a little mushy. You can skip this step if you prefer to keep the peels, but it might be worth the extra effort in the long run. You can peel plums using the same technique that is used to peel tomatoes:


Bring a large pot of water to a rolling boil.
Fill a large bowl with ice and water.
Use a knife to make an ""x"" in the skin at the tip of each plum.
Place the plums in the boil water and blanch them for 30 seconds.
Remove them from the boiling water and plunge them in the ice bath for 30 seconds.
Remove them from the ice bath and pull away the skin in strips to peel the plums. Blanching the plums loosens the skin, making it easy to peel.

, Use a sharp knife to slice the plums in half, working your way around the pit. Pull the halves apart, then remove and discard the pit. Continue until you've sliced and pitted every plum.


If you wish, you can cut the plums into smaller slices. The plums will retain their texture better if they're left in halves.
If you're worried about the plums darkening in the freezer, you can toss them with lemon juice, coating their surfaces. The citric acid preserves their color. You may also buy a product you can sprinkle on the fruit to achieve the same effect.
If you'd prefer not to cut the plums in half, you still need to remove the core. Buy a plum or peach corer, which easily pops out the core without cutting into the rest of the fruit's flesh.

, Preserving the plums in a sweet solution enhances their flavor and also keeps them fresh longer (up to 12 months). Put the plums in a bowl and pour in just enough solution to cover them completely. Here are a few options to use as a sugar solution:



Light syrup. To make this, just heat 3 cups of water and add 1 cup of sugar in a saucepan. Stir the mixture until the sugar dissolves, then cool the solution before you pour it over the plums.

Heavy syrup. If you want a very sweet solution, heat 3 cups of water and 2 cups of sugar in a saucepan. Stir until the sugar dissolves, cool the syrup, then pour it over the plums.Fruit juice. Try plum juice, grape juice or apple juice. There's no need to heat it; just pour enough over the plums to cover.

Plain sugar. Some people use plain sugar to draw out the plum's juices. This is a delicious, but extremely sweet and sugary choice. To do it, pour white sugar into the bottom of your freezer container. Add a layer of plums. Sprinkle more sugar over the layer. Continue layering plums and sugar until the container is full.

, Pour the plums and sugar solution into freezer bags, filling each one to within an inch of the top. Use a vacuum sealer or a straw to remove excess air from the bags, then seal them tightly. Label and freeze the bags. You can stack them in the freezer for easier storage.

, When you're ready to use plums, simply remove them from the freezer and thaw them in the refrigerator or on the counter. The plums are ready to eat directly from the bag. Syrup-packed plums are delicious as a topping for vanilla ice cream or on their own with some whipped cream.

Eat the frozen plums.",How to Freeze Plums3," When you're freezing whole plums, it's especially necessary to choose fresh, ripe plums that that are sweet and juicy. The better they taste before you freeze them, the better they'll taste when you thaw them. Rinse the plums under cool water to remove any dirt or debris.


If the plums are still a little green, ripen them on your counter for a few days before freezing them.

, Simply place the whole, fresh plums in a freezer storage bag, filling it as close to the top as possible. Use a straw or a vacuum sealer to remove as much air as possible from the bag. Label it and pop it in the freezer., When you want a burst of icy, sweet goodness, just take a plum from the freezer and eat it right away. The texture of a frozen plum is surprisingly scrumptious, especially when it's hot outside. If you'd prefer, you can thaw out the plum on the counter for a few minutes before eating.

Know the basic ways in which you can eat and cook plums.",How to Cook Plums1," Plums come in all sorts of different colors, including yellow, so (unlike other types of fruit) color alone isn't really useful when it comes to picking a ripe, juicy plum. Instead, look for firm plums that give a little when you squeeze them. The skin should be smooth and somewhat foggy. Here are some things you should avoid:Plums that are too soft where the dimple and stem meet. These plums are too ripe.
Plums that are split or brown may be rotten or wormy inside.
Plums that are shrilled are old, rotten, and dry.;
, There are some varieties of plums that have a dry, tart flavor. They are usually too sour to eat raw, but they are perfect for roasting, poaching, or stewing. Consider any of the varieties listed below:Cherry
Czar
Mirabelle
Quetsch

, Some plums are really sweet, and it would almost be wasteful to cook them! Try any of the following plums raw or in salads:Black Amber
Burbank
Denniston's Superb

Select ripe peaches.,
Rinse the peaches.,
Boil a big pot of water.,
Prepare an ice bath.,
Score the peaches with an X.,
Blanch the peaches.,
Transfer the peaches to the ice bath.,
Peel the peaches.,
Process the peaches according to your recipe.",How to Peel Peaches," Peaches that are at their ripest are much easier to peel. When peaches are ripe, the skin tends to fall off without taking any of the fruit with it. Choose those peaches that are highly fragrant and indent only slightly when pressed with your thumb.


If a peach feels hard as a rock, it's not yet ripe, so it is best to avoid those that are still a little green.
If you easily break the skin when you press it with a finger, it's overripe. Overripe peaches are still good for making cobblers and other dishes.


Just make sure the peaches you're using aren't rotten:On an unripe peach, avoid small circular spots that get bigger or join.
On a mature peach, avoid deepish lesions. These may grow rapidly.
Avoid tannish-gray spore masses that are sometimes found upon close examination. (These are sometimes found all over the skin and sometimes in localized patches.)
Avoid shriveled brown, black, or brownish-black fruits.;
, Give the peaches a quick rinse under cool water before proceeding, especially if they have visible dirt or other debris. You don't want dirt (or bacteria) ending up in your finished dishes.

, The vessel should be large enough to comfortably fit three or four peaches. Don't try to blanch more than four medium-sized peaches (or three large ones) at a time.—Putting a larger mass of peaches into the water will lower its temperature and disrupt the blanching, making the process less effective.


Choose a Dutch oven or large pot (or saucepan) and fill it three-fourths the way with water, then bring the water to a rolling boil.

, Fill a large bowl three-fourths full of ice cubes in water. This ice bath will be used to quickly cool the peaches after blanching.


Quenching in the ice bath, arrests the cooking process and assures that the peaches don't end up mushy.

, Use a sharp knife to make an ""X"" shape at the pointy tip of each peach (not at the stem cavity). When the peaches are being blanched the fruit expands, stretching the skin, then, when the fruit is iced, the fruit shrinks leaving loose, easy-to-peel skin.


Don't score the peaches too deeply, or make the Xs too big or the peaches may fall apart in the hot water. Medium length incisions 1-2"" (3-5cm) long which just break the skin are all you need.

, Place three or four peaches into the boiling water. Allow them to cook for 30 to 40 seconds (depending on how ripe they were to begin with). During this time, the skin on the peaches will loosen quite quickly.

The riper peaches won't need to stay in as long - take them out after 30 seconds.
Don't leave any of the peaches in for longer than 40 seconds, or they'll get mushy.

, Use a slotted spoon to lift the peaches (one by one) from the boiling water and immerse them in the ice bath. Keep them in the ice bath for about one minute, then put them on your work surface.


In the meantime, you can start the blanching process with another mini-batch of three or four of the remaining peaches.
Don't over-ice the peaches.—You want to cool them for just a minute. Icing them for a longer period of time can affect the texture and flavor of the peaches.

, Take a cooled peach and grasp the skin at one of the corners formed by the ""X"" you made. Pull the skin lightly - it should easily peel off. Keep peeling until all the skin is gone, then discard it.


Peel carefully and steadily, so you don't pull off fruit with the skin.

, Now they're ready to be sliced, diced, or pureed. The peeled peaches will be easy to pit, too. Here are a few delicious ways you can use up your peeled peaches:



Peach cobbler. This classic summer dessert is wonderful hot out of the oven with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.

Peach pie. If you're up for a challenge, this homemade dessert is sure to be a hit with your family and friends.

Peach jam. Make jars of peach jam so you can enjoy the taste of summer during the months when peaches aren't in season.

Peach chutney. This delicious condiment goes well with fish and pork.

Peach salsa. Try something a little different next time you have a bag of tortilla chips to use up.

Peach smoothie. This healthy drink is perfect for breakfast or a light dessert.

",How to Make Pastry Cream," Place the milk or cream in a small saucepan and set it on a burner. Turn the burner to medium heat and allow the milk or cream to warm. Do not let it come to a boil; warm it just until you see steam rising from the saucepan.;
, In a small bowl, whisk the egg yolks until they are well beaten. Whisk in the sugar, flour and salt until they are fully combined with the yolks.

, Slowly pour the warmed milk or cream into the egg mixture with one hand, while whisking constantly with the other. When you've finished pouring the milk or cream in, transfer the whole mixture back to the small saucepan. Place the saucepan back on the stove.This process tempers the eggs and prevents them from getting cooked by the warm milk.
If you can't use one hand to pour and one to whisk, it's fine to switch back and forth until the milk has been poured out.

, As the pastry cream slowly heats, keep whisking it constantly to remove any lumps and prevent it from burning or sticking to the pan.

, As you whisk the pastry cream, it will begin to thicken. It will take on a heavy cream-like texture, then begin to look custard-like. When this occurs, take the pastry cream off the burner and stir in the vanilla extract.Continue whisking constantly, until you can see drag marks when you pull the whisk through the pastry cream.
Another way to check to see if the pastry cream is finished cooking is to stop whisking for a second and look for bubbles popping. If you see a few large bubbles rise to the surface and pop, it's time to remove the pastry cream from the heat.

, Place a strainer over a large bowl and pour the pastry cream from the saucepan through the strainer. Use the back of a spoon or a spatula to help push the pastry cream through the strainer into the bowl.

, Cover the bowl of pastry cream and place it in the refrigerator to cool. It's ready to use when it has completely cooled.To keep a skin from forming over the cream, place the plastic wrap directly on the surface of the cream.

, Also called profiteroles, this delicious treat consists of a light dough baked and stuffed with plenty of pastry cream. The puffs are then stacked and drenched in a rich chocolate syrup, caramel sauce, or powdered sugar.


Try making a cinnamon pastry cream and topping your cream puffs with caramel sauce for a unique treat.
In place of a birthday cake, you could stake cream puffs in a pyramid and pour chocolate sauce over the top, allowing it to drip down.

, Éclairs are made of choux dough that is formed into tiny (or large) logs, filled with pastry cream, and slathered in chocolate icing. It's a popular French treat that has rightly gained a place in bakeries across the world.

, Cannolis originated as an Italian treat and they're much enjoyed around the world. To make a cannoli, a rich dough is rolled into a hollow log shape and fried, then filled with cinnamon-spiked pastry cream. The cream is often mixed with pistachio bits or mini chocolate chips for added texture.,"

, You will need 2 tablespoons (30 grams) of sugar for every 1 pound (500 grams) of plums. If the plums are very sweet, or if you don't have that give of a sweet tooth, you might want to use only 2 or 3 teaspoons instead., You will need 2 tablespoons (30 milliliters) of water for every 1 pound (500 grams) of plums. This may not seem like enough water at first, but the plums will release more juices as you cook them.At this point, you may also add a squeeze of lemon juice. This will help cut the sweetness.

, How fast the plums cook will depend on how ripe they are. Very ripe plums may only take 5 minutes to cook, while not-so-ripe plums may take up to 15 minutes., This will only take a few minutes. If you do not intend on serving the plums with the sauce, then you can skip this step.

, Scoop the plums out using a slotted spoon, and transfer them to a plate. Cooked plums are typically served with ice cream, but you can also serve them with other things, such as yogurt, oatmeal, or roast pork.You can ladle the sauce over the plums, or save it for another recipe.

Serve.",How to Make Frozen Custard1," Before we can toss everything into the ice cream machine, we'll need to turn them into a custard. Whisk together all of these ingredients in a medium saucepan. Heat over low heat, constantly whisking to prevent a skin from forming. Bring almost to a simmer, then remove from heat immediately. When it's ready, the mixture should coat the back of a metal spoon.The light corn syrup makes the end result denser and fudgier than a regular ice cream recipe that only uses sugar.You could use honey instead, but use a little less to avoid overpowering the other flavors.;
, Separate the egg yolks. Beat them in a separate bowl or mixer until slightly thick.


The main difference between a custard base and an ice cream base is the number of egg yolks. If you enjoy extremely rich, smooth, eggy custard, you can increase this to six or seven egg yolks.

, Pour a thin stream of the hot milk mixture into the eggs, whisking constantly. You must pour very slowly and whisk vigorously to avoid cooking the eggs. You can stop once once the eggs are thoroughly combined with about half of the milk mixture.


Alternatively, pour a small spoonful of milk into the eggs, whisk while counting to ten, and repeat. This is slower, but less likely to cook the eggs.
Keep the bowl stable by placing a rolled-up towel around it. This allows you to whisk with one hand while pouring with the other.
If you notice any bits of scrambled egg, strain them out and temper the rest more carefully.

, Pour the tempered mixture back into the saucepan with the rest of the milk. Heat over medium-low heat, stirring frequently. Remove from heat once the mixture thickens enough to coat the back of the spoon, and leaves a line behind when you run a clean finger through the coating. If you have a cooking thermometer, bring the mixture to 170ºF (75ºC).Again, if you notice any lumps, strain them out before you continue. Remove the vanilla bean pod as well, if using.

, Pour the custard into a bowl and stir in the heavy cream until combined. Stir in a little salt as well, less than you would for a regular ice cream base. Frozen custard is warmer than ice cream, which makes salt and sugar seem stronger-tasting., Press a sheet of plastic over the custard to prevent a skin from forming. Chill the bowl in a cold refrigerator, and/or in an ice bath as well. For best results, chill for 4–8 hours. You can continue after an hour or two as long as the custard is cold to the touch, but the end result will be chewier.Keep the custard in the coldest part of the fridge. This is usually the back of the lowest shelf, or the back of the top shelf if your fridge has an ice-making component.A wide, shallow bowl will chill more quickly than a deep one.

, Commercial manufacturers use a special frozen custard machine, but this recipe is intended for a regular, home ice cream machine. Follow your machine's instructions to freeze the custard base, or set it to churn for 20–40 minutes.


If your ice cream machine allows you to control the churning speed, reduce it to the minimum setting. (Most do not have this option.)
To make a ""concrete,"" finely chop candy or cookies, freeze them, and add them the machine during the last two minutes of churning., The custard will melt quickly, so it's best eaten right away. If you prefer a harder frozen custard, stick it in the freezer for a couple hours. Unlike ice cream, this will lose its texture rapidly, and is best eaten within a few hours.

Refrigerate the bowl and the electric beaters or the whisk attachment from a stand mixer for at least 15 minutes.When making fruit cream, you can substitute 2 cups (150 g) of whipped topping for the whipped cream.;
, Remove the bowl, the cream, and the beaters from the fridge. Add the sugar, and beat the cream on medium speed for about eight minutes, until the cream doubles in volume and forms stiff peaks.When the cream forms stiff peaks, it means it will hold its shape when you remove the beaters or stir it.
You can use either granulated sugar or confectioners’ sugar to sweeten the fruit cream. Granulated sugar won’t have the same hint of starchiness that confectioners’ sugar has, but the cornstarch in the confectioners’ sugar will help stabilize the whipped cream., Pour the sour cream into the bowl with the sweetened whipped cream. Use your beaters, the stand mixer, or a whisk to whip in the sour cream for about a minute on medium speed.Whipping the sour and whipped cream together ensures the fruit cream will have a light and airy texture. Otherwise, the sour cream could make the mixture heavy and dense.
You can also use Greek yogurt in place of the sour cream., Add all the prepared fruit to the bowl with the cream, reserving the nuts and the two strawberries for garnish. With a rubber spatula or wooden spoon, gently fold the fruit into the cream until the fruit is distributed evenly and completely coated with cream. Avoid stirring vigorously to prevent mashing the fruit.You can substitute any of the fruit in the recipe for your favorite fruits, including:


Pomegranate
Guava
Apple
Pear
Peach
Kiwi
Cantaloupe
Mandarin orange

, Transfer the fruit cream to a large serving bowl. Spread a layer of strawberry slices over the top of the fruit cream. To finish, sprinkle with the nuts to add a nice crunch and a new texture to the dish.

You can use any nuts to garnish the fruit cream, including pistachios, cashews, or hazelnuts., To start, add the flour, salt, and sugar to a food processor. Pulse them a few times to combine. Then add the chilled butter cubes and the shortening, pulsing the mixture together.

Pulse about 10 times. The mixture is ready when it comes together into pea-sized crumbs.
To ensure the butter is cold enough, place it in the freezer for at least 15 minutes before making the dough.If you don’t have a food processor, combine the ingredients in a mixing bowl and use a pastry cutter or two knives to mix everything together.

, Once you have pea-sized crumbs, continue pulsing the food processor as you gradually add the water. Add the water in 1-tablespoon (15-ml) increments and keep pulsing until everything comes together as a doughy ball.You may not need the entire ¼ cup (60 ml) of water to bring everything together. Only use as much as you need to form a dough.

, Wrap the dough in a piece of plastic wrap and chill it in the fridge for about half an hour. This will help chill the butter again, which will make it easier to work with and ensure the pie crust is light and flaky.You can also double this recipe if you'd like a second pie crust for something else, or to keep in the freezer for later use.

, Turn the dough out onto a floured surface. With a floured rolling pin, flatten the dough into a circle. With each roll, start in the center of the dough and roll outward toward the edge. Then rotate the dough ⅛ turn and roll again from the center to the edge.Add more flour as necessary to prevent the dough from sticking.
Continue rolling and rotating the dough until your dough is about ⅛ inch (0.3 cm) thick.

, Use your fingers to mold the dough into a nine-inch pie plate. If the dough is hanging over the edge by more than ¾ inch (1.9 cm), trim off the excess.

To make it easier to transfer the dough, fold it in half before picking it up and moving it to the pie plate. Position it in the plate and then unfold the dough., Preheat your oven to 350 F (177 C). Line the dough with a piece of parchment paper and fill it with pie weights or dried beans. This will prevent the dough from puffing up during the baking process. Bake the shell like this for 10 to 15 minutes, until the edges become golden brown.

Once the pie shell has set, remove it from the oven. Remove the weights and the parchment paper. Return the shell to the oven for another five to 10 minutes, until the bottom becomes a light golden brown., When the pie shell is ready, remove it from the oven and set it aside to cool to room temperature. Place the pie plate on a wire rack to allow air underneath. This will help the pie shell cool faster.

The pie shell should be ready to fill after one to two hours.

, Spoon in enough of the fruit cream mixture to fill the pie shell. Use the spoon to spread the mixture around evenly.

If you're making fruit cream for a pie, fill the pie shell first, and then garnish the top of the fruit cream with the nuts and extra berries.

, Trifle is a layered dessert dish that typically alternates between layers of cake, fruit, and cream or custard. To make a fruit cream trifle, you'll need your ingredients, a mixing spoon, and a clear glass serving or trifle bowl. The bowl should be around three quarts, or 12 cups, or roughly eight inches (20 cm) wide, across, and deep. For the cake layers, you can use:

A sponge or angel food cake
A package of ladyfingers
A pound cake

, In the bottom of the trifle bowl, lay down a single layer of cake or ladyfingers. If necessary, cut the pieces down so that they fit the bottom of the bowl to coat the bottom completely.If you're using angel food, sponge, or pound cake, cut the cake into one-inch (2.5-cm) thick slices for the cake layers.

, Pour a layer of fruit cream over the cake layer. You can make the fruit cream layer as thick as you like, but a good rule of thumb is to make it about two inches (5 cm) thick.

When you’ve added a layer of fruit cream, add another layer of cake, followed by another layer of berries.
Continue layering this way until you fill the trifle bowl.

, Finish the trifle with a final layer of fruit cream.Then garnish the top with the extra whipped cream, and sprinkle on the berries and nuts, just like you would with regular fruit cream.

Serve the trifle at the table so everyone can see the presentation. Then use a spoon to dole out individual portions, making sure that each portion gets cake and berries from each layer.

Enjoy!",How to Make Clotted Cream1," Clotted cream thrives on low heat over a long period.;
, Pasteurization is heating food, usually a liquid, to a very high temperature and then immediately cooling it down. The high heat lessens spoilage by preventing microbial growth, but a by-product of this is that the structure of the cream erodes, along with some of the taste. In order to get the tastiest clotted cream, stick with organic, high-fat, less pasteurized cream.

, The main thing to worry about here is how high up the sides of the pot the cream goes. Try to get it so that the cream comes up at least one inch and no more than three inches on the pot., Cover the pot with its lid and close the oven door. The cream may take as long as 12 hours to fully clot.


After 8 hours, the cream will develop a thicker, yellowish skin resting on top of the cream. This is the clotted cream. If you're checking on the cream in the oven, be careful not to puncture the clotted cream on top.

, Then, place the pan in the refrigerator and refrigerate for another 8 hours, being careful not to disturb the outer skin.

Melt 1/3-1/2 cup chocolate chips in the milk, stirring frequently, before adding to the eggs to make chocolate flan.",How to Make Flan," The caramel needs time to set before the flan is poured in, so it should be made first. Choose any of the three caramel methods below and then, while the caramel is still hot, pour it into the bottom of your baking dish(s). You can then move on to the actual flan.;
, This is perhaps the most common method, as all it requires is granulated sugar and a heavy-bottomed pan. Simply place the 3/4 cup sugar in the bottom of the pan and turn the heat on medium. Stir occasionally, breaking up any clumps, until the sugar is the color of a bright copper penny. Immediately remove from heat.


A thick-bottomed pan is essential here -- as it will hold and distribute heat well to prevent parts of the sugar from burning.Lighter-colored pans make it easier to see when the sugar is done cooking.

, This method is a little more fickle, but it makes a smoother caramel by a long shot. To make it, combine 1 cup sugar, 1/4 cup water, and 1/4 teaspoon lemon juice in the bottom of a heavy-bottomed pan (off the heat). Once mixed, heat on medium-high heat until it boils, stirring throughout. Once it boils, stop stirring completely. Just wait and watch until it gets a copper penny color, then remove from the heat and let cool.


Stirring agitates the sugars and creates a simple crystal -- AKA, sugar cubes, not liquid caramel. Once it boils, stop stirring.
Use a wet rubber spatula if you need to scrape some sugar off the sides of the pan back into the mixture., Quick and easy, it won't look like restaurant-quality caramel but will have all the taste. Simply mix 1 cup sugar with 1/4 cup water in a microwave-safe glass cup. Stir so that all the sugar is wet and microwave for 5 minutes. After the 4 minute mark, don't take your eyes off the mixture. Once it hits a copper color, like a bright new penny, take it out of the microwave. If it isn't there by 5 minutes, keep cooking in 30-second increments., Once you have the caramel in the ramekins, you want to work somewhat quickly. Get the oven hot quickly so that you can start cooking the flans as soon as you're done mixing., As soon as it comes off the heat, pour the copper-colored caramel into the bottom of either a large 9-inch glass pie pan or individual ramekins. Swirl it a bit so the entire bottom of the dish is coated. This will harden into the sugar disc topping your flan.



Caution: This sugar will be extremely hot.
Want a perfectly smooth caramel? Pour this syrup through a fine mesh strainer as it goes into the baking dishes., You want a completely smooth, well-mixed liquid. Use a nice large mixing bowl so that you can really whip it together without spilling.

, This is the time to lightly customize your flan, though you don't want to go overboard. You should always add the vanilla, as it brings out the richness of the dessert. In addition, try a pinch of cinnamon and nutmeg, a touch of almond extract, or even 1/2 cup of shredded coconut., Leave about a 1/4 inch at the top so that they don't bubble over, but flan shouldn't rise and you don't need a ton of room.

, This is called a water bath, and it helps prevent the sugar from quickly reheating and liquefying. You'll have a much more evenly cooked dessert as a result.


Some cooks actually boil the water before pouring it in, getting the water near cooking temperature as soon as it goes in the oven. This can lead to a slightly firmer flan.If you can't make a water bath for whatever reason, cover the flans with aluminum foil as they cook. This will help retain moisture and prevent the tops from burning., To test even further, stab a flan with a toothpick. When you remove it, it should come up relatively clean -- not covered in chunks or liquid. Take the flans carefully out of their hot water bath, but don't let them cool just yet

, Cut around the entire flan to loosen it from the sides, allowing you to easily remove it after it cools.

, This will ""set"" the mixture, helping it keep its shape when served.

, You want the caramel to become the top of the flan. So simply place a plat on top of the dish or ramekin and flip everything. If you cut the edges of the flan before hand, it should slide out easily., Of course, the caramel you cooked earlier will be hard by now, but you can always whip up more easily.

, Leave the cheese out for 10-20 minutes to soften to room temperature, then blend it until soft. Then, add the eggs and milk and continue mixing until smooth. Once you have an even consistency, stop blending and move on with the recipe like normal., This lightly sweetened flan will have a nice hint of coconut without getting too strong. To push it over the top, toss in a 1/2 cup of shaved coconut after mixing all the liquids and eggs together.

, Dissolve two tablespoons of coffee into a tablespoon of water, then add this to the wet ingredients along with a pinch of cinnamon and the tablespoon of vanilla.

, A cup of orange juice or pineapple juice is not uncommon for adventurous flan-makers. Grab the zest from half an orange or lemon for a more subtle citrus taste, or use a bit of juice and zest together to take it to the next level.For a ""Flan de Pina,"" or pineapple flan, use 2 cups of pure pineapple juice, and 1 can of condensed milk for liquids, then add 2 tablespoons dark rum to cut the sweetness slightly., Make sure you let the chocolate cool before you mix it into the eggs, otherwise the eggs could accidentally cook. Heat the milk, add the chocolate, and remove from the heat, covering and stirring to mix the chocolate in."

Separate the clotted cream from the cream with a slotted spoon.,
Enjoy!",How to Make Clotted Cream2," Most slow-cookers have different base temperatures. Because heat is the bane of clotted cream, you want to make sure you're not blasting your cream with extra heat. If you think that your slow-cooker runs hotter than the average slow-cooker, try this:


Find a wide dish that fits inside your slow cooker. Place the dish inside the slow-cooker, transfer your cream to the dish. Pour enough water into the slow-cooker (not into the dish with the cream) so that the dish is surrounded by at least an inch of water on the sides.
If you need to use the water-bath method with your slow-cooker, adjust the recipe accordingly. You want there to be a lot of surface area for your cream, which means not filling the dish up to the brim with cream.

,, After 3 hours, turn off the slow cooker and allow the cream to come to room temperature.

,, Reserve the whey for use in cooking or baking., Bring clotted cream back to room temperature before serving.Store in the refrigerator for up to 3 or 4 days.

Next, line a 10-inch (25-cm) by 15-inch (38-cm) jelly roll pan with parchment paper. Spray the paper with nonstick cooking spray and lightly flour it before setting it aside.If you don’t have parchment paper, you can substitute foil.
You can use butter to grease the pan in place of the cooking spray if you prefer.;
, Add 3 large eggs to a large bowl. Use a handheld electric to beat the eggs on high for 3 minutes, or until they are slightly frothy.You can use egg substitute in place of the eggs if you prefer.
If you prefer, you can mix the cake batter in a stand mixer.
You can also mix the cake batter by hand, but it will require more time and effort.

, After you’ve beaten the eggs, add ⅔ cup (133 g) of sugar. Beat the mixture for another 3 minutes on high, or until it becomes pale and frothy., Once the sugar is mixed into the eggs, add 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of vegetable oil and 1 teaspoon (5 ml) of vanilla extract to the bowl. Mix the ingredients in on medium until they are fully incorporated.You can substitute canola or avocado oil for the vegetable oil if you prefer.

, Add ¾ cup (94 g) of all-purpose flour, 1 teaspoon (4 g) of baking powder, 1 teaspoon (2 g) of ground ginger, ¼ teaspoon (½ g) of ground nutmeg, 2 teaspoons (5 g) of ground cinnamon, and ⅛ teaspoon (¼ g) of ground cloves to a separate large bowl. Whisk the ingredients together until they’re fully blended.You can substitute cake flour for the all-purpose flour if you want your cake to have a lighter texture.

, After you’ve mixed all the dry ingredients together, gradually add them to the wet ingredients. Mix them in on medium-low until they are just blended.Be careful not to overmix the carrot cake batter. If you do, you may end up with tough, chewy cake.

, Once the batter is fully mixed, add 2 cups (100 g) of shredded carrots. Use a rubber spatula to gently fold them into the batter until they are fully incorporated., When you’re finished mixing the carrot cake batter, carefully pour it into the prepared jelly roll pan. Use the rubber spatula to spread it evenly throughout the pan.The batter will be fairly thin, so be sure to spread it to all the corners of the pan.

, Once the batter is in the pan, place it in the preheated oven. Allow the cake to bake for 15 to 16 minutes, or until the cake is cooked through but still soft on top.You can tell that the cake is done if the top springs back when you touch it.

, While the carrot cake is baking, lay out a clean kitchen towel on the countertop. Liberally sprinkle the towel with approximately ¼ cup (31 g) of powdered sugar so the length of the fabric is covered., As soon as the cake is finished baking, immediately turn it out onto the kitchen towel. Start with the short end of the cake and roll it up tightly with the towel.If the parchment paper is stuck to the bottom of the cake, remove it before you begin rolling it up.

, When the cake is rolled up in the towel, leave it to sit out on the counter. Let the cake cool completely, which should take at least 1 hour.You want the cake to be room temperature before you add the filling, or the cream cheese frosting may melt out of it.

, To prepare the filling, add 6 ounces (170 g) of softened cream cheese and 4 tablespoons (57 g) of softened, unsalted butter to a medium bowl. Beat the two together on medium until the mixture is smooth.If you’re using a stand mixer to make the frosting, the paddle attachment usually works best for creaming the cream cheese and butter together.

, Once the cream cheese and butter are creamed together, add 1 teaspoon (5 ml) of vanilla extract to the bowl. Mix it in on medium-low until it is fully incorporated.You’ll get the best flavor if you use pure vanilla extract.

, After the vanilla is blended in, add 2 cups (250 g) of powdered sugar to the bowl. Beat the sugar in on low until it is fully blended and the filling has a medium consistency that spreads easily but isn’t so thin that it will ooze out of the cake.If the filling is too thin, you can add more powdered sugar.
If the filling is too thick, add ½ to 1 teaspoon (2 ½ to 5 ml) of water to thin it out.

, Once the cake is cooled and the filling is prepared, carefully unroll the cake. Make sure that it lays flat on towel so you can easily spread the filling over it.If you like, you can sprinkle the top of the cake with more powdered sugar before you add the filling.

, When the cake is laid out flat, use a butter knife or offset spatula to spread the filling all over the top of the it. Next, start at the short end and roll the cake back up tightly with the filling inside.Leave a ¾-inch (19-mm) border on all sides of the cake when you spread the filling.

, Once the cake is filled and rolled up, carefully wrap it up with plastic wrap. Place it in the refrigerator, and allow it to chill for at least 1 hour to firm it up., When the cake is firm, remove it from the refrigerator and take off the plastic wrap. Place it on a platter and dust it lightly with powdered sugar before cutting it into slices and serving it.For the most decorative looking ends, cut off about ½-inch (13-mm) from each end of the roll before serving. That will make the cream cheese swirl visible.
Wrap any leftover carrot cake roll in plastic and store in the refrigerator. It should stay fresh for up to 3 days.

Get your hands on free wedding cake catalogs.,
Look at magazines of cakes and even books that focus on cake decorating.,
Have a budget in mind before you go to the local bakery shop.,
Get everything in writing.",How to Design a Wedding Cake on a Budget," This can be difficult sometimes because local bakery shops usually have their own styles and one-of-a-kind cake designs. Sometimes your best bet is to look up wedding cake galleries online and then take a design you find online (printed out) to your local bakery.;
, These are another great source of ideas. If you can't afford the wedding magazines and books, there are many ways to find them without having to spend a lot of money. Go the library or a bookstore and look through designs. Look in thrift stores; wedding magazines are often available for next-to-nothing once other people's weddings are done!

, This way you won't get in over your head and buy too much cake. To help you get a budget in mind, you will need an accurate head-count of the number of guests so you know how much cake to buy.

, Once you have decided on the cake, make sure to get everything in writing from the baker and then call the baker a couple of weeks before the wedding to make sure everything is on track. Don't leave anything to chance! It is a good idea to get in touch with the baker a week before your wedding and go over the details again. Make sure the baker understands exactly what you want and will deliver it on time; you don't want to get the cake and find a word is misspelled on the cake! This may seem like a small detail but with a little effort on your part it can be avoided. So remember to pay attention to the small details and don't feel overwhelmed, just take it one small task at a time.

Prepare the fondant and frosting.,
Wrap each Twinkie in fondant.,
Create the top layer of the cake.,
Design the bottom layer of the cake.,
Assemble the cake.,
Garnish your wedding cake with special touches.",How to Make a Wedding Cake out of Twinkies," Before assembling the cake, tint the fondant and frosting to the desired colors.

Consider using all white for a wedding cake. For a “true” wedding cake appeal, omit any colors and use all-white frosting and fondant.



 


Divide the fondant in half and tint each half a different color. The idea is to alternate colored Twinkies on the cake. For example, if you choose light pink and dark pink, you’ll want to wrap one Twinkie in dark pink fondant, followed by a Twinkie in light pink fondant.






Divide the frosting in half and put 1/2 aside. Split the other half in 2 and tint each half a different color (using the same color pallet as used in the fondant color).





;
, Create an interesting cake by wrapping each Twinkie in a different fondant color. Alternate colors on the cake to create a pattern so that, for example, you might have a light pink covered Twinkie next to a dark pink covered Twinkie.

Roll fondant to 1/8 inch thickness to accommodate each Twinkie. You don’t want to overpower the Twinkie with fondant––a light covering will do the trick.






Cut the fondant to accommodate each Twinkie. The fondant should be cut 4 ½ to 5 inches (11cm to 12.5cm) long by 2 to 2/12 inches (5cm to 6.5cm) wide. The average Twinkie is approximately 4 inches (10cm) long and 1 ½ inches wide. Cut the fondant larger than the Twinkie’s size so that it wraps around the entire Twinkie.






Frost the Twinkie with the corresponding fondant color.






Lightly wrap each Twinkie. Smooth any bubbles or bumps along the way.






To maintain symmetry, place the fondant seam underneath each Twinkie. The Twinkies will stand up against the Styrofoam rounds so that the bottom of the Twinkie will not be on display.







, Construct the top layer using the Styrofoam and cardboard round, then build with Twinkies.

Place the 4 inch (10cm) Styrofoam round in the center of the 7 inch (17.5cm) cardboard round. Use a piece of fondant or frosting on the bottom of the Styrofoam to hold it in place. The Styrofoam round will act as the “middle” section of your wedding cake and provide a “wall” for Twinkies to stand against.






Frost the Styrofoam round with white frosting. The frosting will act as the glue to hold each Twinkie in place. Be extra careful when frosting the top to create a smooth surface, as this portion will hold your cake topper or any other decorative touches.






Arrange approximately 10 fondant wrapped Twinkies, standing upright, around the 4 inch (10cm) Styrofoam. You can either alternate fondant colored Twinkies or go with one color––your choice.







, Perform the same steps required for assembling the top portion by gathering Twinkies, Styrofoam and cardboard round.

Stack the 8 inch (20cm) Styrofoam round in the center of the 11 inch (28cm) cardboard. Use frosting “glue” to adhere the round to the cardboard cake bottom.






Cover Styrofoam round with frosting. Consider frosting the bottom round with a different color frosting than what is on the top layer or stick with white again.
Arrange approximately 20 fondant wrapped Twinkies, standing upright, around the 8 inch (20cm) Styrofoam round.







, Gingerly place the top layer on top of the bottom layer to create a delicate wedding cake, inspired by Twinkies.

Stack the top layer on top of the bottom layer. The top layer should fit so the tops of your bottom layer Twinkies are visible (so the top layer is not sitting completely on top of the Twinkies).






Now is the time to get creative with your cake. Add decorative touches such as round dots, small flowers or leaves using a small cookie cutter or decorator piping tip. Fondant flowers and other flourishes add personality and charm to your cake.







, Select a unique cake topper in order to make the cake extra special.

Top with a cherished family heirloom. A wonderful way to top any wedding cake is to use a family heirloom such as the cake topper from the bride or groom’s parents or grandparents.






Purchase an amusing cake topper. If you're creating your wedding cake from Twinkies, you probably have a pretty good sense of humor. Some novelty and wedding stores carry fun bride and groom cake toppers to add a bit of whimsy to your Twinkie cake.






Top with fresh flowers. Match the cake topping to your wedding flowers and request that the florist create a cake topper of fresh flowers. You could also inquire about cake decorating services as well as some florists provide specialty cake decorating services with flowers.

",How to Make a Two Ingredient Chocolate Mousse," You will need 9.4 grams (0.33 oz) of chocolate, which usually comes to about a bar and a half. It is imperative that you use chocolate with 70% cocoa solids, or the other ingredients in the chocolate will prevent it from attaining a mousse-like texture.


Don't use chocolate chips for this recipe. They often come with a waxy coating that will throw off the chemistry of the dish.
Since the chocolate flavor is so strong in this recipe, buy the best-tasting chocolate bar you can find.;
, Use a microplane or cheese grater to shave the chocolate until it becomes a fine pile of powdery chocolate shavings. Get it as fine as possible so that it will melt quickly when you mix it with warm water.

, Use plenty of ice, since you'll need to get the chocolate nice and cold. Place a smaller bowl inside the larger bowl, making sure the ice rises up the sides of the smaller bowl.

, Place the water in a small saucepan and heat it over medium heat on the stove.


If you want to flavor your chocolate with vanilla, remove a teaspoon of water from the saucepan and add a teaspoon of vanilla.
You can add cayenne pepper, orange extract,or other spices or extracts to the water to flavor the chocolate., Use a whisk to begin stirring the shavings immediately. They will melt and combine with the water to form a liquidy mixture. Continue whisking until the chocolate is entirely melted.

, Turn off the stove and carefully pour the chocolate into the bowl that's sitting inside the bowl of ice.

, The second you pour the chocolate into the bowl, start whisking it quickly. This will prevent the chocolate from clumping up. As you whisk, you'll see the texture of the chocolate change from liquid to a pudding-like texture. After about 3 minutes of whisking, it will become the texture of mousse.


Do not stop whisking the mousse. This will cause the chocolate to seize up, and it won't regain the proper texture.







, This rich, delicious mousse should be served in small quantities. Add a dollop of whipped cream to the top as a contrast to the deep chocolate flavor.

, At this point, the pear will appear red to orange or reddish-purple in color. This denotes that the prickly pear is ripe., The glochids are the long spines on the fruit, with smaller ones at the base. When these start to fall off or loosen, the fruit is ripe., When the fruits reach a size of around 2 to 3 inches, they are considered mature (along with the correct coloring changes)., The prickly pear should be firm but not rock hard when gently pressed; it should be slightly yielding."

Select the tilapia from your local butcher or grocery store.,
Refrigerate the fish in a tightly wrapped package immediately after purchase.,
Unwrap and thoroughly clean the tilapia.,
Oil and season your fish.",How to Grill Tilapia1," For optimal grilling, each filet should be at least 1 inch (2.54 cm) thick. Look for fillets that have brightly colored skin, clear eyes, clean gills, and very little ""fishy"" odor. If you are purchasing filet, make sure there is no excess water in the packaging. Press against the flesh of the filet--it should be firm and spring back quickly.When selecting tilapia filets, the easiest indicator of freshness is the smell. Most seafood has a scent that should remind you of the sea. There is a difference between the sea smell that is fresh and fishy, and the bad fish smell that is musky and overly-fishy. Avoid the latter.
If fresh tilapia is unavailable in your area, frozen filets will work fine. Frozen tilapia should also be odorless and packaged in a moisture-proof container. If the filets show any white or dark spotting, they were not packaged properly and should be avoided. The same is true for dry or icy spots.;
, Only refrigerate your tilapia if you are using them in the next one to two days. If you must wait longer, the filets should be frozen at a temperature of 0 degrees Fahrenheit (-18 degrees Celsius).


If you choose to freeze your tilapia, or buy pre-frozen fish, make sure to thaw your tilapia filets in a refrigerator for a minimum of 24 hours before grilling. Doing this will promote a fresher taste and texture.

, Wash the fish in in cold water. Using warm or hot water could promote bacterial growth and make you sick. Pat the fish dry with a clean paper towel before seasoning.

, Apply a light amount of olive oil on both sides of each filet just before cooking. Season the filets according to the recipe of your choice. For a fresh, healthy way to eat tilapia, apply olive oil and then sprinkle the fish with salt and pepper. Other common seasoning combinations for tilapia include:


Lemon and garlic: Mix lemon juice with melted butter or olive oil. Add fresh or powdered garlic to the mixture, along with salt and pepper (season to taste.) Apply the mixture to both sides of the fish.
Soy sauce and Chinese five-spice powder: Dust both sides of the fish with the five-spice powder. In a separate bowl, combine equal amounts of soy sauce and brown sugar. Marinate the fish in the mixture.
Cumin, garlic, and lime: Blend cumin, garlic, and lime in a bowl. If you want to add a zing to your fish, add some chili powder.

Serve with paprika as a garnish.",How to Make Ackee and Saltfish," Take ½ pound (227 g) of boneless, salted codfish, and place it in a colander. Rinse it thoroughly under cold water to remove the salt from the fish.If you don’t have a colander, you can simply place the fish in a bowl and place it under running cold water, tossing the fish in the water to remove the salt.;
, When you’ve finished washing the salt from the fish, place it in a large pot or bowl. Cover it with hot water, and allow it to soak in the bath for an hour. Make sure that there is enough water to fully cover all of the fish.The hot water should be approximately 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees Celsius).

, After the fish has soaked for an hour, drain the water. Add a fresh batch of hot water to the bowl or pot, and allow the fish to soak for another hour so it soaks for a total of 2 hours over all., When the fish has soaked for a couple of hours, drain the water. Use a fork to gently flake the codfish in a bowl, and set aside.You don’t necessarily have to flake the fish. If you prefer larger flakes, you can break it apart using clean hands.

, In a medium size skillet, allow ½ cup (118 ml) of vegetable oil to heat for 3 to 5 minutes over medium high heat or until it shimmers. Next, mix 4 cloves of finely chopped garlic into the pan, and cook for 30 seconds.If you don’t like a strong garlicky taste, you can reduce the garlic cloves to 2 or 3.

, When the garlic has sauted briefly, add 1 sprig of fresh thyme to the pan. Allow it to cook with garlic for approximately 30 seconds.You can replace the sprig of thyme with 1 teaspoon (5 g) of dried thyme.

, After you’ve added the thyme, mix 2 sliced onions, 4 chopped scallions, 1 cup (149 g) of sliced bell peppers, and ¼ Scotch bonnet pepper that’s been seeded and finely chopped into the skillet. Stir the mixture well, and let it cook for 5 minutes.You can also add a medium tomato that’s been cut into cubes in with the onions, scallions, and peppers if you desire.
While a Scotch bonnet pepper is the classic option for this recipe, you can substitute any hot chili pepper.

, Once the vegetable mixture has cooked for several minutes, add the flaked codfish to the skillet. Stir well to ensure that the fish is fully incorporated, and then allow the mixture to simmer for 5 minutes.It’s important to stir the contents of the pan while it’s simmering to ensure that it cooks evenly.

, After the fish has simmered with the vegetables, mix 1 20-ounce (567 g) can of ackee that’s been drained into the skillet. Simmer the mixture for another 2 minutes.The ackee is delicate, so don’t use a spoon to mix it into the skillet. Instead, use a couple of forks to carefully toss it with the other ingredients until it’s fully combined., When the ackee is heated through, sprinkle 1 teaspoon (2 g) of freshly ground black pepper into the mixture and stir gently to incorporate. Next, remove the skillet from the heat and let it sit for a minute or two., When the dish is finished cooking, transfer it to a serving dish or bowl. Garnish it by sprinkling 1 teaspoon (2 g) of paprika over the top of the dish."

Finished.

",How to Grill Tilapia2," Doing this will prevent the fish from sticking and crumbling during the cooking process.

, If you are unsure of how to reach medium heat on your specific grill, err on the side of less heat than more, since you do not want to char the fish.

, Cook the first side of the fish for approximately 3 to 5 minutes. For grilling, medium or conservative heat is the best option throughout the grilling process. You never want flames from the grill to actually touch the fish filets, as this will burn the tender meat.

, Slide the spatula underneath the fish gently, as to not tear the flesh, lift it up and set it back down on the other side. Cook the fish for another 3 to 5 minutes.


During the grilling process, flipping the tilapia frequently will cause the tender meat to fall apart. To properly cook the filet, turn it over just once.

, You will know they are done when the meat turns opaque and white. Its juices should run clear.To check to see if it is cooked all the way through without leaving a big cut in your fish, slide a butter knife into the thickest part of the fish. The meat should be opaque.

Collect your materials.,
Dismantle the celery.,
Add the water into the bowl.,
Use a glass of water.",How to Store Celery1," You won’t need many items in order to store celery in water. Refrigerate the celery as soon as you can, though.


You should find a large glass bowl or a sealed plastic container. Either will work to store the celery. If the container doesn’t have a lid, you will need plastic wrap to seal it. It’s also possible but not as easy to use a plastic bag that you fill with water.
You’ll need a supply of fresh water. The water should be clean, and it’s best to use filtered water if you have it available. Even celery that’s started to wilt can be brought back to life by immersing it in water.
Choose celery that has straight and rigid stalks. The leaves should be fresh. You don’t want limp or foul smelling celery.;
, In order to keep the celery fresh, you should remove the stalks from the base of the celery. Slice the base off from the stalks.


Next, strip the leaves off the celery stalks. You can use do this task with a kitchen knife. Be careful anytime you use cutting instruments.
Then, cut the stalks in half. You want them to be about half as long as they were on the base.
Now, put the cut celery into the glass bowl or the plastic container. Leave about an inch of space between the celery and the bowl’s top., Pour enough fresh, clean, preferably filtered water that it fills your container.


Seal the container with its lid or, if it doesn’t have one, seal the top with plastic wrap. Placing celery in an airtight container without water doesn’t work as well. The celery is likely to end up dried out.Make sure you change the water every day or at least every other day. This will keep the celery freshest.
When you want some of the celery, simply remove it from the water, rinse, and eat. Replace the lid and plastic wrap if you still have celery left over.

, Another water method is to hack the bottom off of the celery bunch before immersing the stalks into a water glass. Celery stored in this fashion can last 1-2 weeks in a refrigerator.


Stand the entire celery bunch in a glass of water inside the refrigerator. You will need a large glass for this, such as a souvenir glass (or a pitcher).
When storing celery, don’t put it in the coldest areas of your refrigerator because it can freeze easily.You will need to change the water every few days at least, but this should keep the celery crisp because it will absorb the water inside the glass. The same procedure works with other root vegetables, such as beets or parsnips.

"
"
Place the celery in aluminum foil.,
Wrap the celery in paper towels.,
Plant the celery base.",How to Store Celery2," Many people have aluminum foil in their kitchens. Storing celery in it will keep the celery crisp, even for weeks.Simply wrap the celery in the aluminum foil either cut or intact, and do so tightly. You may want to place the celery on a slightly damp paper towel before you wrap it in the foil.Place the wrapped celery in the refrigerator. The foil will enable a hormone called ethylene to get out. It’s a ripening hormone, meaning its release will keep the celery fresh. You can reuse the foil for several bunches of celery.
Plastic bags don’t work as well because the ethylene gas can’t get out, making it more likely the celery will rot. Put the wrapped celery in the typical crisper drawer in your refrigerator.

, If you don’t have aluminum foil handy, you may be able to preserve the celery’s crispness with other wraps.


Cut the end of the celery bunch off so that the celery stalks are all separated. You may want to cut them in half, but it’s not necessary.
Dampen paper towels. The moisture here is important. Wrap the celery in the paper towels. Place the wrapped paper towels into a large plastic zip lock bag. Seal the bag and put it into the refrigerator.Save the top, bottom and leaves of the celery and put them in a ziplock bag that you freeze. You can use them when making stock.

, You’ve cut off the base of the celery, but you don’t have to throw it away. You can use it to grow more celery!


Rinse the base off. Place it into a small bowl of warm water. Position it near a sunny window with the base side down.Every two days, change the water. It will take about a week or 10 days for tiny yellow leaves to shoot up from the base and then turn dark green.
After the leaves have grown about a half inch from the center of the base, transplant it into a planter. Cover it with dirt, leaving the leaves exposed. Water it, and watch it grow!

"
"
Blanch the celery.,
Freeze the celery to preserve it.,
Eat the celery.",How to Store Celery3," This means that you should plunge the celery into boiling water for three minutes before you freeze it.


Then, chill the celery quickly by plunging It into a bowl of ice cold water. This will complete the blanching process.
Drain off the extra water. You’re ready to put it into a freezer bag or an airtight container for freezing.
Put the celery bag into the freezer. It’s best to use frozen celery in cooked meals after you thaw it because it will lose some of its crispness. You’ll want to blanch many cut vegetables before freezing., Freezing isn’t exactly keeping celery fresh, but it will prevent it from spoiling or wilting.


Wash the celery to remove any dirt attached to the vegetable, and remove it from its store package. Cut off the celery’s base.
Cut the celery stalks into pieces, and remove the leaves. When freezing celery, you’ll probably want to cut the celery into pieces that are 1 to 1 ½ inches long.You could also cut the celery and spread it onto a cookie sheet. Put the sheet in the freezer. Once the celery is frozen, remove the pieces and put them into a freezer bag. Put the bag back into the freezer.

, Frozen celery can last more than a year to a year and a half in the freezer without going bad.


Foods frozen at 0 degrees Fahrenheit will keep safe for eating for a longer time, but the 12-19 month rule is designed for best quality.
Once you thaw the celery, it will soften somewhat. In contrast, celery only lasts a few weeks in the refrigerator.
Celery was a revered vegetable in ancient times. It was considered rare and to have medicinal value. It was first cultivated for a Persian king. It’s about 94 percent water, but it does contain fiber and many vitamins (A, C, B-complex, and E) along with minerals. So enjoy the healthy vegetable!"

You can get any variety of apple, but make sure that it is as large as possible because it will make it easier to create your swan decoration., Stand the apple upright and use a sharp knife to cut through the core of the apple at a slight angle. Cut it by placing your knife 1/4 of an inch (0.635 cm) away from the middle of the apple, and make a long vertical cut down the center. Make sure to go through the core itself. Remove the exposed seeds with the pointed end of your knife and set them aside for later.The two seeds will be used as eyes later on.

, Take the larger side that has the base and top of the apple and place it flat on the cutting board. Place two butter knives perpendicularly at the base and the top of the apple.

Add condiments to taste.,
Choose your bread and cheese.,
Heat up your skillet or pan.,
When you've got your bread toasted, turn the heat down to low.,
Remove the sandwich from the skillet and put it together.,
Finished.

",How to Make a Tuna Melt," Empty the can of tuna into a strainer or use the lid of the can to drain off most of the liquid. If you want to avoid more of the oil, you can also give the tuna a rinse under the faucet.


Solid white tuna generally makes a better tuna salad mix than chunk tuna. It's got a thicker, heartier meat, so it holds up better with the condiments. Use whatever kind of tuna you like best.;
, In a bowl, break up the tuna in the mayonnaise, creating smaller chunks and coating the mixture in mayo. This makes basic tuna salad.

If you like smoother tuna salad, you can mix this up in the food processor as opposed to the bowl-and-fork method.






If you like relatively dry tuna salad, you only need to add 1–2 tablespoons (14.8–29.6 ml) of mayonnaise. Be careful not to add too much at first. If you want more mayo, you can add more at any point. Use however much you like.






If you don't like mayo, you can use any type of salad dressing or oil to bind together the tuna. Try using Italian salad dressing, or even just a bit of olive oil and balsamic vinegar. Brown mustard also makes for a good mayo substitute in tuna salad.







, To make a basic tuna salad, add a tablespoon or two of pickle relish, a teaspoon of brown mustard, and pinch of dry dill. Salt and pepper the tuna salad to your desired taste. Mix thoroughly.


Onion and garlic make for good additions to tuna salad. Add a quarter teaspoon each of the dried versions for less potent additions, or chop up a small amount (half a clove of garlic, and an 1/8th of an onion) if you're into the raw version.






Add whatever tastes you like. A pinch of curry powder and hot sauce can make for a spicy Indian style tuna salad, while some Parmesan, chopped green olives, spring onion, and dried oregano can be a delicious Mediterranean alternative. Experiment and find what you like.







, The tuna melt is basically a toasted or grilled cheese sandwich with the addition of tuna salad, so the only other essential is any kind of bread and cheese you like to eat. For a basic tuna melt, you can use simple white sandwich bread and a slice of yellow cheese.


Rye bread and swiss makes for a delicious alternative. Parmesan and crusty Italian bread are likewise a good combination. Use whatever kind of bread and cheese you've got on hand, or whatever kind you like on other sandwiches.







, On medium-low heat, heat up your non-greased skilled until it's hot. Meanwhile, lightly butter your bread on both sides. Begin by toasting the first side of the bread. If you see it start to smoke, turn the heat down slightly and flip the bread over. Crisp both sides of both slices of the bread.


If you don't want the added calories of the butter, one alternative to a tuna melt is to toast the bread in the toaster and heat the tuna and cheese in the microwave. Scoop some of the tuna salad on a microwave-safe plate and lay the cheese slices over the top. Microwave in 10-15 second increments until the cheese is melted.

, In the skillet, assemble your sandwich. Lay the cheese slices down on both slices of bread to let them melt. Carefully scoop some of the tuna salad on one of the slices. Cover the skillet with a lid and let the heat melt the cheese and heat up the tuna salad.


Make sure to watch for smoke. If you've already toasted the bread too much it can burn rather quickly. Keep the heat on low and watch the sandwich carefully. It won't take long for the cheese to melt.

, Popular additions to the sandwich might include slices of tomato, raw onion, green pepper, or lettuce. Add arugula and yellow peppers for a spicy alternative.

, Scoop out the middle of the apple, but be careful to leave some flesh near the edges (for a better hold of the caramel).








,, While you want the lemon to protect your apple extra juice will interfere not only with the taste but how well the caramel adheres to the apple.








, Combine brown sugar, butter, heavy cream and corn syrup in a Saucepan over high heat.









Stir until brown sugar has dissolved.
Bring mixture to a boil, stirring constantly until a temperature of 230 °F (110 °C) is reached (use your candy thermometer). This process could take up to 7 to 10 minutes.
Remove from heat and add vanilla. Continue stirring until mixture stops bubbling and allow it to cool for up to 15 minutes.

,









Check apples to ensure they are still a golden color, have not turned brown but are also not carrying excessive lemon juice.

,, Work quickly before the caramel sets.








,, Serve chilled.

Make bananas foster.,
Add them to pancakes.,
Create a sweet snack.,
Create frozen desserts.,
Grill over a campfire or barbecue.,
Use brown or black bananas in baking.,
Make banana trifle.,
Bake bananas wrapped in phyllo dough.",How to Use Bananas1," Cut two peeled bananas in half lengthwise and set aside. Stirring frequently over medium-high heat, melt 4 tablespoons (57 grams) butter in a saucepan, then add 1 cup (240 mL) brown sugar. Continue stirring for 3–5 minutes, add the bananas, cook until soft, then add a dash of vanilla extract and a shot of spiced rum. After ten seconds, carefully light the mixture with a torch, let it burn itself out, and serve with vanilla ice cream.;
, Slice the banana into thick slices and cut each one in half or thirds. Mix them into homemade or store-bought pancake batter before frying. If you dislike chunky textures in your pancakes, instead place the banana between two pieces of wax paper, and smash thoroughly with your hands, before adding to the batter.


For a more unusual treat, cut peanut butter and banana sandwiches in half, dip in pancake batter and fry in hot oil.

, Peanut butter, nutella, honey, or chocolate chips all pair well with bananas. Eat this in a bowl, or make a sandwich with bread or graham crackers.

, Skewer whole, peeled bananas with a wooden skewer or popsicle stick, dip in melted chocolate, and freeze them wrapped in wax paper until the chocolate is hard. For a smaller snack, slice the bananas thinly instead before dipping.


Optionally, sprinkle chopped nuts on the chocolate before freezing.
You can also add peanut butter or almond butter to a frozen banana slice, and stick a second slice on top to make a banana mini-sandwich.

, Cut a line through the peel and halfway through the flesh of a ripe banana, running lengthwise along the inner curve. Stuff mini marshmallows, small chocolate squares, or candy into this slit. Skewer, wrap in foil, and heat over a campfire or on a grill until the inside is melted and the banana is mushy.

, When bananas turn overripe, it breaks down into sugars that turn the flesh brown and black. This sweet, mushy material is perfect for baking desserts, so use these bananas in muffins, banana bread, cake, or banana cream pie.

, Chop bananas into small pieces and mix thoroughly with vanilla pudding. In a large bowl, lay out a row of vanilla wafers. Add 1/3 of the pudding on top of the wafers, then repeat with two additional layers each of wafers and pudding. Chill until firm.

, Sprinkle peeled bananas with cinnamon and nutmeg, then roll each one in a sheet of uncooked phyllo dough. Bake at 350ºF (177ºC) for 30–35 minutes. Serve with warm chocolate sauce, chopped nuts, and/or warm dates.

Make homemade smoothies and milkshakes.,
Dry bananas.",How to Use Bananas2," Bananas make a great breakfast with Greek yogurt and a drizzle of honey, or sliced on top of oatmeal. Chop them up with other fruit to make a fruit salad. Bananas are also a healthy energy booster on their own, and easy to carry with you as a snack.

, Freeze ripe or overripe bananas until hard, then peel them and toss them into a blender until it forms small chunks. While cold, this has a similar texture to ice cream, with much less fat and sugar.


Optionally, blend with other frozen fruit, honey, or a dash of vanilla extract.

, Bananas are often used as a thickener in smoothies. Blend with orange juice in any proportion to make the smoothie thinner and tangier. Add ice cubes if you'd like a less rich taste, or a colder drink.


Add protein powder to give yourself energy for a workout session.
Add mint for a refreshing flavor.

, Banana slices can be dried into chips using a food dehydrator, or on a baking sheet kept in an oven at minimum temperature settings. Using a dehydrator only, you can slice the banana in thirds or halves lengthwise and dry to form leathery chews instead.


Most store-bought banana chips are fried or coated in oil, making them much less healthy than this homemade version.
Add cinnamon or nutmeg to accentuate the sweet flavor, or add a pinch of salt for a more savory snack.

Use under-ripe bananas.,
Fry bananas with savory spices.,
Use in a shrimp coconut curry.,
Add bananas to a salad.,
Infuse liquor with banana flavor.",How to Use Bananas3," Savory recipes work best with bananas with a low sugar content. Some varieties are naturally less sweet, but your best bet is using bananas that still have green peels and firm, white flesh.


Plantains are a separate type of fruit, almost always cooked before eating. They have a more savory flavor, and can be used in place of bananas in cooked, savory recipes.

, Boil the bananas with the peel on for 7–9 minutes. Rinse them in cool water, then peel. Mash the bananas using a potato masher, adding a pinch each of chopped green chili, chopped coriander leaves, ground cumin, asafoetida, and salt. Once the mixture is thoroughly mashed, form them into balls or patties. Fry them in shallow oil until crispy, then serve.


This recipe pairs well with many Indian sauces, including tamarind sauce, tangy mango sauce, or tangy tomato sauce. Alternatively, serve them dry, with pomegranate, chopped green coriander, or red chili powder on the side.

, Peel and slice two bananas, and sauté along with one diced white onion, stirring occasionally, until the onion is transparent. Add ¼ cup (60 mL) dried raisins and ¼ cup (60 mL) dried sultanas. Cook for a few more minutes until the fruit is soft, then stir in ¾ cup (180 mL) coconut milk and ½ tsp (2.5 mL) curry powder. Add about a dozen medium, shelled shrimp, and cook for 2 or 3 minutes, until the shrimp are pink. Serve on a bed of white rice.


Add more coconut milk for a soupier consistency, or more curry powder for a spicier curry.
Bananas can be added to other curries as well, but curries with coconut milk tend to match their sweet flavor best.

, Slice green bananas and add them to a salad of lettuce, tomatoes, and cucumber. If the bananas are already ripe, you can try making a sweeter salad instead, using lettuce and chopped, glazed nuts.

, Select ripe bananas, with a few brown spots on the peel. Peel and slice the bananas, and drop them in a bottle of white rum or bourbon. Let steep away from direct sunlight for several days, then strain out the banana using cheesecloth or coffee filters.Some of the banana may dissolve into the liquor, requiring two or more straining sessions to remove.

Rub banana peel onto itchy bug bites or hives.,
Use a home warts remedy.,
Polish leather cautiously.,
Compost banana peels.",How to Use Bananas4," Try rubbing the inside of a banana peel onto your skin to relieve itching. Note that this does not treat the underlying cause, but it may provide relief from the itch itself.

, Some people claim banana peels can eliminate warts on the hands, although the scientific community is skeptical.Still, this is unlikely to cause any harm, so consider taping a piece of banana peel, inside down, over your wart for the night. Repeat with a fresh piece of peel each night for a week or two, to see if there is any effect.

, Rumor has it that the inside of a banana peel can be rubbed onto leather shoes or other leather objects, followed by buffing with a cloth to create a shine. This may or may not work, but leather experts do not advise trying it on highly valued leather., Toss your banana peels in the compost to add nutrients for your garden. If there are rodents, raccoons, or other scavengers in your area, be aware that they may come after this. Consider setting up an enclosed, animal-proof compost bin instead, and using the compost once the banana peels and other materials have degraded.

Pull off all the legs and claws with a twisting motion.,
Toss the legs (fins) and save the claws.,
Turn the crab over on its back.,
Take the top half and the bottom half in each hand, as if you are opening a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.,
Take this bottom half and break it in half.,
Pick away all the chunks of meat in the body.,
Crack the claws by using the hinged cracker, hitting them with the crab mallet, or using your knife.",How to Eat Crabs2," You can use a dull knife inserted into the joint to make removal easier. Sometimes a little meat will come out with the leg. Eat it.








, (You will get to them in a minute.)








, Open the apron––the apron looks like a tab.








, Pull off the top shell. Take care and do this slowly. Toss the top shell.









You will have cleaned out the crab and have removed the gills to show the shell.

,









Now take one of the halves and with a knife (or your hands) cut it in half.
If you are using your hands, press down to break the chambers and then pull apart.
Now you should have the meat exposed. Use your fingers to pull the meat out and enjoy! Use your knife to get the meat out of the smaller chambers.

, Start with the claws.








, The most efficient way to open a claw:









Lay your knife, sharp side down, on the middle of the red side of the claw.
Then use the crab mallet to gently hit the knife, until the knife is halfway through the claw.
Finally, pivot the knife to the side. That will open the claw and make it easier to eat. Then snap the shell open and eat the meat, avoiding the cartilage.

Keep the boat heading straight, at a low speed.,
Wait for the tuna to come alongside the boat.,
Reach the gaff over the tuna.,
Gaff the tuna behind the fish’s gill plate.,
Lift the tuna onboard.,
Remove the gaff from the tuna’s body.,
Purchase either a 4-foot or 6-foot gaff with a 4-inch hook.,
Attach a wrist cord to a straight gaff.,
Consider purchasing a flying gaff for tuna.",How to Gaff a Tuna," Once a member of your fishing party has caught a tuna on the line, slow the speed of the fishing boat and don’t make any unnecessary turns. This will make it easier for the angler to reel in the tuna. If the boat accelerates or makes sharp turns, the tuna may break the line or slip the hook.Under these conditions, the tuna should swim up alongside the boat and present itself for gaffing.;
, If you feel impatient and strike too early, you’ll likely miss the fish altogether and have to start the gaffing process over again. Stay patient: allow the person holding the fishing rod to work the fish in close to the boat. Don’t strike with the gaff until the tuna is alongside the boat.If you’re standing in the stern of a fishing boat, wait to gaff at least until the tuna is flush with the back wall of the boat.
New gaffers make a common mistake by attempting to gaff a tuna too early, when it’s still trailing behind the boat.

, Since the gaff hook is curved, you can’t drive it straight into the tuna. Do not gaff a tuna from its near side (close to the wall of the boat). Instead, reach the gaff over the tuna’s head and body, and point the hook back towards yourself to impale the fish.This will also benefit you by decreasing the chance that you’ll cut the fishing line. If you reach in front of the fish’s head and over the fishing line, you risk slicing the line with the sharp point of the gaff.

, The gill plate holds a fish’s gills and comprises the firm, bone-like sections on the front left and right sides of a tuna’s body. Aim the point of your gaff for just behind the gill plate. The skin here will be thick enough to not tear when gaffed, and you won’t risk damaging the tuna’s edible meat.If you miss your target and gaff a tuna through its midsection, it will likely escape. The thin skin on the belly of a fish is weak, and will tear through if you try to lift the fish on the gaff.Similarly, if you miss the tuna’s head and stab the gaff through its back or side, you’ll likely damage one of the tuna steaks and render it inedible.

, In the same motion that you gaff the fish, smoothly lift the tuna up towards the edge of the boat and over onto the deck. Lift the fish smoothly, without any jerking or twisting movements on the handle of the gaff. Do not pause between gaffing the fish and lifting it onboard. Instead, let the momentum of gaffing the fish continue as you lift the fish onboard.Think of this in terms of “follow-through,” much like when playing tennis or golf.

, Once you have the fish on the deck of your boat, you can remove the gaff from the tuna’s gill plate (or wherever you successfully gaffed the fish). Gaffs do not have a barb at the tip of the hook, so you should be able to slide the gaff out of the fish’s body with ease.

Do not gaff a fish—tuna or otherwise—if you’re not planning to bring it back to the dock. You cannot release a gaffed fish back to the ocean, as the gaff wound will prove fatal in nearly all cases., Since tuna are on the larger size of the spectrum of fish that are commonly caught by gaff, you’ll need to use an appropriately large gaff. Either a 4-ft (1.2 m) or 6-ft (1.8 m) gaff will give you enough length to hook a large tuna. The 4-inch (10 cm) hook will sink into the tuna’s flesh deeply enough that the fish won’t be able to wiggle away.If you know the boat you’ll be fishing from, take its height into consideration. If you’ll be fishing from a large, high boat, choose the longer of the two gaff options.
To purchase a gaff, visit a fishing supply store. Try to find a store that specializes in selling equipment used for offshore fishing.

, If your gaff only has a textured handle at the base, a wriggling gaffed tuna could easily pull it out of your hand. To add a measure of security when gaffing, attach a wrist cord: this device will attach to the base of your gaff handle and loop around your wrist. Then, when fishing, even if the gaff is ripped from your hand, you will still have a hold of it via the wrist strap.If you need help finding a wrist cord for your gaff, speak with the sales staff at the fishing supply store.

, A flying gaff is a specialized type of gaff typically used for heavy fish, large tuna (over 250 pounds ) included. This type of gaff has a rope attached to the base of the gaff inside of the attached gaff pole. When a fish has been gaffed, the hook detaches from the base of the gaff, so that the fish is still hooked on the gaff but no longer right next to the boat’s hull.A flying gaff advantageously allows you to wear down a large fish before bringing it onboard. A flying gaff is also less likely to be torn from your grasp by a powerful, large tuna.

24 hours will be required for short-term (up to a week) storage.,
For hot smoking, smoke for about 6-8 hours (it is assumed you know how to hot smoke).,
Heat the fish internally to 160ºF/71.1ºC for a minimum of 30 minutes during the entire hot smoking cycle.,
Smoke for at least another 30 minutes after it has reached this internal temperature.,
Note that smoking can be a bit tricky when you have to maintain the exact temperatures for a period of time.",How to Smoke Salmon5,"
About 5 days is required for thicker pieces and for longer-term storage.Expose the fish to light smoke at the beginning (keep the vent open for the first third of the smoking period), then increase the amount of smoke but keep the temperature below 90ºF/32.2ºC., Smoke at 100ºF/37.7ºC for the first 2-4 hours, then gradually increase the oven temperature to 140ºF/60ºC until the salmon flesh becomes flaky., This will kill bacteria present in or on the fish.


The smokehouse will need to be set to 200 to 225ºF/93.3 to 107.2ºC for at least 30 minutes to achieve this.
Use a standard meat thermometer to test the fish's internal temperature.

, At all times after the 30 minute internal heating up, keep the fish above 140ºF/60ºC, even when continuing to smoke it.

, If it doesn't work for you or you're just not keen on fiddling with smokehouse or smoker apparatus, you don't have to miss out. You can still take your fresh catch straight to a commercial smokery to have them do it perfectly for you.

Remove the crabs from the pot using the second pair of tongs.,
Make a butter sauce to serve with the crabs.",How to Steam Crab," Crabs can be steamed alive or frozen (the latter are usually crab legs). However, if possible, live crabs taste better after steaming. If you’re not immediately cooking the crabs, you will want to keep them cold, whether they are alive or frozen. You can use a cooler full of ice or you can use cold packs.


Keep the crabs chilled right until the second you steam the crabs.If you’re cooking live crabs, you could put them in an ice chest.
You could also cover the live crabs with a salt-water soaked towel or with burlap, and put ice on the burlap or towel. This should work to keep the crabs chilled. You don’t want to store crabs in water because they could die from lack of oxygen.;
, If you are handling live crabs (such as Dungeness and Red Rock crabs), you should clean the crabs before or after cooking them. Cooks do this either way.








Remove the crabs' aprons (their abdomen) by pulling off the shell flaps on the crabs' bellies. This is the triangular shell piece positioned at the crab’s tail. You can use your hands to break this off or use a knife tip to do so.
Remove the crabs' backs (called the carapace) by sticking your thumb into the hole left from removing the crabs' abdomens. Lift up firmly, and the shells should detach from the crab body with guts attached.
Take off the leafy, spongy gills from both sides of the crabs, and throw them away.

, You can steam many kinds of crab, although the cooking times will vary.Be careful to use separate plates for raw crabs and cooked crabs to avoid cross-contamination.


You will want to rinse out the green-brown guts from the crabs. Break off the mouth parts on either side of the crabs, and throw them away. Then, turn the crabs upside down. Gripping the crabs on both sides, place your thumbs underneath along the back midpoint.
Crack the crabs along their centers by pulling down with the hands while pushing up with the thumbs. It’s also possible to do this process in reverse and cook the crabs and then clean them using the same process.

, You can either steam live crabs or you can steam frozen crab legs that you buy at the store. You will simply need to reheat frozen crab legs. It’s a simpler process.One serving of frozen crab legs is usually between 8 ounces and 1 pound (225-450 g). To defrost frozen crab legs, put them in the refrigerator for about 8 hours. You don’t want to leave them in the refrigerator for more than 2 days without cooking them, though.
You’ll want to put the crab legs in a watertight container so the legs drain while they are defrosting without creating a mess in your refrigerator.

, You don’t want to use a pot that is too shallow or a saucepan. That could easily make a mess. A 6-quart pot is a good idea.A sturdy pot or a steamer that is tall and high will work well. You need a steaming rack or separator on top of the pot so the crabs don’t touch the hot liquid. You can purchase a steam rack or make one out of tin foil. The basic goal is to allow the steam to rise into the crabs while preventing the crab from touching the boiling liquid below it.
A crab steamer is a two-part pot. The bottom pot holds the steaming liquid, while the inner pot is perforated with holes and holds the crabs. If you do not have a crab steamer, you can improvise and use a large pot and a circular rack to place in the bottom of the pot for the crabs to sit on during the steaming process.

, Water works to steam live crabs and frozen crab legs, but if you want to steam crabs like a local, you could try the Maryland approach, and use beer and vinegar. Add about ¼ cup salt to the water.


All you need is two cans of cheap beer and an equal amount of apple cider or distilled white vinegar. Some people also add bay leaves into the mixture. If using water, pour 2 cups of water into the pot and add 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) of salt. Some recipes call for adding spices to the beer or water (such as salt, garlic, chiles, limes, and cilantro).
Place about two inches of liquid in the bottom of the pot, enough to boil and produce steam. You don’t want the water line to rise above the steam rack. Boil the liquid. Other recipes call for one cup of water and one cup of vinegar., You should use tongs to do this, especially if they are still alive. Put three to four crabs belly down on the steam rack.









Cover them with a spice blend. Then, add another layer of crabs and repeat the seasoning process. Then cover the lid of the pot. You can find many recipes for different crab steaming spice blends online.A spice blend can vary by taste but often includes a mix of celery salt, dry mustard, cumin, black pepper, rock salt, and nutmeg. You could also purchase a spice blend for crab meat at many grocery stores., The size of the crabs, of the pot, and the number of crabs you are steaming can change the cooking time.


Generally, crab legs cook in about 4-8 minutes. Try not to cook frozen crab legs too long since they have already been cooked once.The crabs are done if the shell color is reddish-orange. You should check the crabs frequently. When the crabs are steamed, you will smell their aroma, and they will be warm.If you are going to steam more crabs, change the liquid before you do so. Make sure not to overcook crabs. It doesn’t take long to steam, and overcooked crabs won’t taste as good. For Dungeness crabs, boil about 18-20 minutes.
Some types of crabs, such as blue crabs, can take significantly longer to steam, as long as 20-30 minutes. Whole Dungeness crabs can take 10-20 minutes to steam., It's important to not use the tongs that handled the raw, live crabs.









Doing so increases the risk of bacterial contamination. Place the steamed crabs on a large platter or a newspaper covered table, or any other protected surface.
Sprinkle a light layer of seafood seasoning on the steamed crabs, grab your seafood bib and enjoy!

, One tasty way to enjoy steamed crabs is with melted butter and wedges of lemon. You may need a cracker to crack the shells. Boil ½ pound unsalted butter in a small saucepan and bring it to a boil over medium heat for about 1 minute. Let the butter settle.
After a few minutes, skim off the milk solids that will raise to the top of the butter using a spoon. Pour the rest of the butter into a serving bowl.Break the claws in half at their joints. Take a seafood mallet, and tap the shell of each claw so it breaks apart in order to serve that part of the crabs, if applicable.

Brine your fish.,
Debone the salmon filet and cut it into chunks.,
Air dry the fish.,
Load the smoker with chips and get it heating up.,
If desired, cut the fish into thin strips.,
Arrange the fish on your smoker racks.,
Place the fish in the smoker once it is hot and producing smoke.,
Leave the fish in the smoker (without adding more chips) at low heat for a further 12-14 hours.,
Remove the fish from the smoker.",How to Prepare Hot Smoked Salmon," Brining is the process of soaking meat or fish before cooking. Each person who smokes fish has their own preferences for how to formulate a brine, but it almost always includes both a salty and a sweet flavor. For beginners to smoking, a simple brine of kosher salt and brown sugar is a good point of departure. How much you need depends on how much fish you have. For each quart of water, add half a cup of kosher salt and half a cup of brown sugar. Use a plastic or glass container, never use metal containers for brining.;
, Place the chunks in the brine, cover, and soak for at least eight hours.

, Remove it from the brine about an hour before you are ready to start smoking it, and place it on racks to dry. Some prefer to pat the fish down with a paper towel as well. After about an hour, the fish should have a noticeable sheen on it that will make it ""glisten"" slightly. When you see that, it is ready to be smoked.

, Alder imparts a delightful flavor to salmon, but any common smoker wood will work. Each produces a different flavor, experiment till you find one you like.

, It can be smoked in chunks but cutting it smaller at this stage will help it absorb more of the smoky flavors and will cook it more evenly. Leaving it in larger chunks can produce a moister, more tender finished product, but it will not keep as long.

, If you have cut it into strips you may find it easier to hang it from the racks rather than laying it out on top of them.

, Keep refilling the smoker with fresh chips as they are consumed until active smoking has gone on for at an hour and a half to two hours.

, (If you think that seems like a long time, traditional Native Alaskan methods can take three to four days, during which time the salmon must be constantly guarded lest a bear or other predator get into it.)

, It is now ready to eat. As smoking is a method of preservation it does not have to be refrigerated, but if you have a lot it will keep even longer if refrigerated.

Give your crab sticks seasoning.",How to Serve Crab Sticks," Contrary to what you may think at first, crab sticks are actually often made with imitation crab after than crab proper. The safest bet is to buy a pack of pre-sculpted crab sticks from the supermarket. If you're much more the DIY type, you can get bigger slabs to cut into the pieces yourself.


Outside of a deep-frying oil, you thankfully won't need anything else to get this recipe started. You can of course, however, add spices and garnishes to your personal preference.;
, This may be even easier if you have a specialized fry cooker handy in your kitchen; you can cook crab sticks in much the same way as you would fries.


As with a lot of cooking, it's good to get your elements heated up while you're getting the other preparations looked after.

, Although it's totally optional, the crispy taste for crab sticks goes wonderfully together with a good homemade batter. Make a thick fix of corn starch, flour, milk, salt, baking soda and water, and mix thoroughly. From there, you can dip your individual pieces in before putting them in the deep fryer.Tempura batters also work really well when it comes to crab sticks.

, You can cut your crab sticks however it suits you. You may find that cutting them into long sticks (like fries) makes them easier to eat generally speaking. Keep in mind that bigger pieces will also incur a longer average cooking time.

, Once you've got everything ready, it's time to put it all in the deep fryer. It's better to cook crab sticks in batches rather than all at once. This will help ensure even cooking throughout. Wait until they're generally golden-brown, then take them out and insert a new batch. Repeat this process until you've made as many a you prefer.

, Crab sticks have a pleasant, distinctive taste, and they're used quite often in oriental cuisine. If you're not satisfied with simply having them as a snack, you should experiment with how to incorporate them into larger recipes. For something simple, you might try adding them atop a bowl of seasoned rice. Udon noodles are also a popular combination with crab sticks. While most of the crab stick recipes you'll find are based in oriental cuisine, you shouldn't be afraid to experiment with combining it with other types of food. After all, part of the food of cooking is being creative and original!

, Whether battered or not, crab sticks tend to taste better when they're spritzed with a strong flavour. Much like battered fish, crab sticks taste amazing with some lemon. Vinegar makes for a stronger, more distinctive punch in the flavour., Crab sticks are ultimately a snack food at heart, so it stands to reason they would work so well with snack dips. If you have any favourite kinds of dip, you might try serving it with them. Sriracha and soy sauces are great crab stick companions. In the end however, the sky's the limit, and there's no harm in trying a combination if you're curious.

, The rule for a lot of recipes is to add a little salt and pepper if you think your food is too bland. A small dash of each adds an appropriate kick to just about anything. The same is true for crab sticks. The taste and texture of crab sticks are complimented by some light salt and pepper. If for whatever reason you're not interested in the more complex techniques,

, Add these three ingredients to the bowl. Stir the ingredients into the cream cheese using a spoon, only mixing them well enough to evenly spread each one throughout the cream cheese.

, To make things easier, you should only work with a few wontons at a time, but you should continue filling the wrappers until all of the filling is gone.

, In order for the wrapper to stick together, they need to be slightly moist. Do not soak the entire wrapper, though. Instead, just wet the tip of your finger with a little water and gently rub your wet finger along the edges of the wrapper.

, Put anywhere from 1 tsp to 1 Tbsp (5 to 15 ml) of filling onto each wrapper, depending on how large the wonton wrappers are. The wrappers should be well filled, but you should also have enough empty wrapper to fold and seal it up.

, Fold one corner over the middle of the wrapper until it meets the corner diagonally opposite from it. Press the corners together.

, There should be two open edges of the wrapper. Gently press along these edges with your finger to seal them.

, Bring one corner over to the corner diagonally opposite from it. Press the corners together to seal, and press the sides together to seal, as well.

, Fold the two corners at the base of the triangle together, over the filling, and seal them together. You may need to wet the corners again to accomplish this. The end result should be what appears to be a little pocket or ""boat"" of filling.

, Fold two corners that are next to each other up so that they meet in the center of the wrapper, which should also be the center of the filling blob. Press the corners to seal together, and press along the edges that have met together.

, Press the corner into the other two joined corners and press the side of the wrapper together where the edge of the new fold meets the edge of the previous fold.

, Press and seal the corner into the other corners before pressing and sealing together the remaining open sides. You should be left with a completely sealed pouch.

, Working from the middle of each side rather than the corner, bring two sides that are next to each other up and over the center of the wrapper and the center of the filling. Press the middle of both sides together.

, Again working from the middle of each edge, bring the sides up and over the filling to the center point of the wrapper, where the other two sides have already been sealed. Press the center of each edge into this point, sealing all four sides together. You should be left with a shape that looks like an ""X"" with slightly open corners.

, You should fill the pot with at least 3 to 4 inches (7.6 to 10 cm) of oil. Heat the oil over medium to medium-high heat until it reaches a temperature between 350 and 375 degrees Fahrenheit (177 and 191 degrees Celsius).


You can check the temperature of the oil by using a candy thermometer. If you use a thermometer that can be attached to the side of the pot, you can monitor the temperature of the oil throughout the entire cooking process.

, Only add about six to seven rangoon to the oil at once. If you are not used to deep frying foods, you may even want to start out with three or four at once. You need to make sure that you leave plenty of room to prevent the rangoon from sticking together or frying incompletely. You also need plenty of room to be able to fish them out of the oil.

, The crab rangoon should turn golden brown and should be floating at the surface. Use a deep fryer scoop or ladle with draining holes to fish each rangoon out. In the absence of this tool, use metal tongs.

, Placing them on paper towels will drain off excess oil.

, Wait a few minutes after pulling the rangoon out of the oil to prevent them from being scalding hot, but serve them shortly thereafter.

If you opt for cooking live crabs look at the underside of the crab to determine the amount of meat. If the color is white it has a lot of meat. If the color is black, then it does not have a lot of meat. If the shell is soft there is less meat than if the shell is hard. Try to find a crab with long and large legs. When selecting frozen crab legs look for crab legs that are thick and meaty. Choose frozen crab legs that don’t have too many ice crystals. Be aware the crab legs need to fit in your pan. , If you purchase frozen crab, make sure to give yourself enough time to thaw the crab before you cook it. Put the crab legs, covered, in the fridge overnight to thaw. You can also put the crab legs in a colander and run cold water over them to thaw them faster. , Fill a large pot with water and turn the stove on high. Bring the water to a boil. Put the live crabs directly in the boiling water and submerge them. Put the lid on the pot and turn the heat down to medium. Cook for 15 minutes. , After you are done boiling the crabs, take them out of the water. They should be bright orange. Rinse the crabs under cold water. , Keep rinsing the crab while removing the apron of the crab. Grab each side of the crab and crack it in half down the middle of the body. Remove the mouth, lungs, and any extra parts from each side of the crab. Remove the legs from the shell. Do all of this while still rinsing the crab. , Fill a large pot with to 2/3 full of cold tap water and bring to a boil. Add crab legs to the water, bending to cover as much as possible with water.

Cook uncovered for 4-5 minutes, occasionally adjusting with tongs to evenly heat.
Remove the legs from water, rinse if desired. , The crab legs need to fit in your steamer so break off the body and bend the legs. Put the bodies at the bottom of the pan because they require more cooking and steam gets hotter at the bottom.

Fill the bottom of the steamer with 3-4 inches of cold water. Heat the pot until you get a rapid boil.
Put the steamer basket into the pot and replace the lid. Monitor the pot for a few minutes until the steam begins to develop.
Cook thawed legs for 5-6 minutes and frozen legs for 10-12 minutes. They are done when they reach 155 degrees. , Preheat your outdoor grill on high heat. Lightly oil the grate when it is hot. Mix olive oil, butter, and garlic and brush it onto the crab. Put the crab on the grill and turn once. They are finished when the shell is brown. It usually takes around 6 minutes. , Preheat your oven to 375 degrees. While you wait, melt butter in a pan. Add garlic, lemon juice, and olive oil. Put the crab legs on a baking dish and brush the butter sauce onto the legs. Bake for 25 minutes, brushing the sauce on every 5-7 minutes. , Use scissors or twist the legs at the joint to get the meat out of the shell. If you twist the legs use a towel so the sharp edges on the legs do not cut your hands. , One 4-8-ounce leg is one serving. Use a small seafood fork to take the meat out of the legs. , Fresh snow crab is best alone, in simple dishes. Use it for a recipe or enjoy with melted butter, lemon, and garlic. "

Decide how you want to purchase your sea monkeys.,
Purchase your supplies, if you didn’t buy a kit that comes with everything.,
Clean and prepare the tank.,
Fill the tank with purified water.,
Add your water purifier.,
Find a suitable place for your sea monkey tank or aquarium.,
Add the live eggs into the purified water.,
Wait for the eggs to hatch.,
Add sea monkey growth food, after five days.,
Aerate your tank regularly.,
Feed your sea monkeys.,
Add water to replace evaporated water.,
Keep the water in your tank healthy.",How to Raise Sea Monkeys," There are a number of ways you can go about purchasing your sea monkeys. Ultimately, like other aquatic creatures, they require an aquarium or something similar to live and thrive. You can take several routes to purchasing what you'll need. Consider:


Buying a kit that comes with everything. There are a number of sea monkey kits available in retail stores and on the internet that come with everything you’ll need to get started growing sea monkeys. These kits come with tanks, the monkeys, a feed pack, and more. This might be the easiest route to go.
Buying the sea monkeys and other supplies separately. This could be a more inexpensive option if you have an aquarium or a tank already. However, this could be a more expensive option if you don’t. Ultimately, buying everything separately instead of in a kit allows you to customize your sea monkeys' environment.
Buying live sea monkeys. Unfortunately, some people buy their sea monkeys and don’t want to keep them anymore. You could choose to adopt someone else’s sea monkeys, or buy already grown ones from a pet store. This, though, takes some of the fun out of the magic of hatching your sea monkeys from nothing. However, if you do this, you might give some homeless sea monkeys a desperately needed break.;
, Because sea monkeys are so easy to care for, you don’t really have to buy much to prepare for them. However, there are a few things that are absolutely necessary. You will need:


A water purifier. Water purifier comes in a variety of forms. It might be a gel or liquid or it could be a dry pack of solution.
A pack of sea monkey eggs.
A pack of sea monkey growth food.
A plastic or glass aquarium of 1/2 gallon to 10 gallons.
Accessories like plastic plants or rocks., Before you start to grow your sea monkeys, you need to clean the tank or aquarium you’ve purchased for them. This is important as new aquariums might have chemical films still on them from production. Older aquariums might have bacteria or other waste present. Your aquarium should be clean of all dirt and contaminants before you fill it.


Clean the tank with water if possible. Avoid using soap.
Use vinegar and/or a plastic scrubber to loosen dirt and grime.
If you’ve used something other than water, make sure to rinse the tank thoroughly before filling it with water.

, Since water is your sea monkey's habitat, you must use distilled or purified water to keep the creatures healthy.


Do not use water that has chlorine or any other chemicals in it.
Be wary of tap water if possible.
Avoid mineral water., Open the pack of water purifier and pour its contents into the water. The water purifier is intended to balance the chemical makeup of the water and help create an appropriate environment for your sea monkeys.


Stir the water so the purifier can more easily spread throughout the tank.
Wait at least 24 hours before moving on to the next step.
After you’ve added your water purifier, make sure your water has adjusted to room temperature before continuing on, even if this is longer than 24 hours. Room temperature is considered 76 degrees Fahrenheit or 27 degrees Celsius., Since sea monkeys are relatively easy to care for and can thrive in a number of different types of environments, you shouldn’t have a problem finding a suitable place to put your tank. However, there are a number of things you do need to consider when placing your tank:


The best temperature range for hatching sea monkeys is 75-80 degrees Fahrenheit (24-27 degrees Celsius).
Colder temperatures will slow your hatching and growth time.
Place your aquarium in a place where it will get sunlight, but not too much direct sunlight., Now that you’ve got your water purified, you can open your pack of sea monkey eggs and empty them into the water. After emptying the pack, stir the water for about a minute so the eggs can have a chance to spread out. You don’t want your sea monkeys all hatching in one place!


Cut open the packet and dump it into the water.
Using the food stick (which will be included in any kit), gently stir so you do not damage any eggs.
Be patient. Sometimes the sea monkey’s take longer to hatch and sometimes hatching is not really “instant.”, The amount of time sea monkeys will take to hatch varies on a number of factors. Ultimately, there is no guarantee about the amount of time they will take to hatch. Some sea monkeys will hatch very quickly, others could take days. The factors that impact hatching time are:


The temperature of the water. Cold water (below 75 degrees Fahrenheit) will slow hatching. Hatching could take several days if the water is cold.
The thickness of sea monkey egg shells. Thicker egg shells will delay sea monkey hatching by up to several days.
The combination of water temperature and egg shell thickness can produce a wide range of sea monkey hatching times., After five days, you need to give your sea monkeys growth food. This growth food comes with most kits or can be purchased separately. The growth food is specially formulated to give your monkeys the mineral mix during the first week so that they can grow to maturity.


Wait five days to give your monkeys the growth food.
Don’t give them more than the package and the size of the tank requires.
Don’t substitute something else for the growth food.
After you add your growth food, your water might turn slightly green. Don't be alarmed. This is normal.

, Aeration is one of the most important things in caring for and keeping your sea monkeys alive. Aerating is the process in which oxygen is added to the water of the tank. Your sea monkeys need oxygen-rich water to survive and thrive. Consider:


Aerate at least once a week.
If you choose to aerate your water by pouring it back and forth, remove your sea monkeys with an aqua leash or similar device and put them into an alternate tank first.
Take a straw and blow air into the tank every couple of days.
Buy an aerating system that will continually aerate the water.
Baby sea monkeys consume and need a great deal of oxygen in the beginning of their life., After you initially feed your sea monkeys growth food, you need to feed your sea monkeys every five days. This makes sure they have enough food to grow and thrive in your tank.


Feed them the appropriate amount as directed on the package.
Never feed them more than once every five days.
Only feed them sea monkey food.
Sea monkeys often supplement their food supple with algae and other plant life that grows in the tank., You’ll want to make sure that your tank maintains the same level of water over time. To do this, you need to replace your water from time to time. It’s probably best to schedule a time every week when you’ll add more water to your tank.


Replace evaporated water with non-chlorinated water.
Make sure any new water is the same temperature as the existing tank water. You don’t want to add super cold or hot water.
Pour the water in slowly so you don’t hurt or disturb your friends.

, Sometimes you might notice that the water in your tank is a little cloudy or dirty. When this happens, don’t drain the water or clean it. Chances are, there’s too much food or other organic material in the tank. You need to give the monkeys time to do their job. Simply stop feeding them for a little bit.


When the water is cloudy, stop feeding them and wait a few days.
If your water is cloudy, make sure your water is aerated.
If the water does not clear up after a few days, you may need to transfer your sea monkeys and replace the water.
Avoid cleaning your tank. If you can, don’t clean your tank too often. Sea monkeys live off of algae (in addition to their normal food) and will eat the algae that’s growing in their tank. "

To peel the shrimp, just pull off the head, if it's still attached, along with the legs. Start with the head end and pull off the outer shell. You can decide whether you want to leave the tail tip on for presentation, or take it off for eating convenience.Place the shells in a plastic bag and seal it shut to throw them out.






If you want to use the shells to make shellfish stock later, just seal them in a plastic bag and place it in your freezer.






You can leave the shell on to keep some of the flavor, though this will make the shrimp a bit harder to eat. If you want to do this, you should cut the outer edge of the shrimp's back with kitchen scissors, so you can devein the shrimp easily.





;
, You should always remove the veins from the shrimp before you cook them. To do this, take a small paring knife and cut along the outer edge of the shrimp's back. Cut at least 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) into the back, enough to reach the vein, which will be a dark greenish color that contrasts with the paleness of the shrimp.


If you can see the vein, just pull it out with your fingers or with the tip of your knife. If you can't see the vein, then move on to the next shrimp.

Choose your tank.,
Make a safe environment.,
Keep good water quality.,
Provide the correct filtration.,
Provide the right diet.",How to Take Care of Amano or Algae Shrimp," Amano shrimp can adapt to most environments in an aquarium; they can live in a small tank of 5 gallons (a little more than 18.92 litres), but they thrive best in a larger tank of 10 gallons (about 37.85 litres).

Make sure that your tank is planted, as these shrimp love planted tanks; they love objects that catch detritus in the water. They eat the mess in the plants, making your tank a lot cleaner.
Amano shrimps prefer plants such as moss or marimo moss balls. They hang onto them and eat as well as clean your tank.;
, Amano shrimp are vulnerable to water fluctuations and predators. They need their tank mates to be peaceful and not extremely aggressive. Tank mates should also be able to survive the same environment as the Amano shrimp.

If you are looking to breed Amano shrimp, then you should have brackish water ready (half salt-water, half fresh-water), but they are also able to survive fresh water too.
Don't add any fish that would try to harm Amano shrimp or their fry. They are very vulnerable; even the smallest species of tetra could gobble on a baby Amano shrimp.

, The water quality is a key part to an Amano shrimp's survival. They need clean water with the right pH. They also need the ammonia, nitrate and nitrite to be kept at an all time low.

They require their pH to be between 6.5-7.5; a little lower than 7.3 is ideal as this is the pH in where they thrive.
They require the water hardness to be 8.0 dkh. They need to have their water changed at least 20-30% once a week or twice a week to be on the safe side.

, Amano shrimp need their filter to give flow as this will help detritus get trapped in plants and they will eat it. They also need correct water flow to swim with ease. You should never get a filter with a big intake, as fry will easily get inside and die.

Because sponge filters have an intake so small, they are an ideal filter for Amano shrimp fry, juveniles and adults.
You may think that you don't need a sponge filter for adults, but this will make feeding cost less as they will not need that much food. They will get their food from the sponge on the filter as they like a cheap and easy meal.

, Amano shrimp are omnivores and they love to eat anything that comes near their mouths. They poke around on driftwood to clean it from the bio-film. They also eat a lot of algae; they will always be on the look-out for plant matter or any other organic matter that is available.

You can supplement an Amano shrimp's diet if it eats too much of the waste in your tank (this can actually happen). They will eat blanched zucchini or any other soft vegetable, and algae wafers are a favorite.

Remove the vein from the prawn.,
Rinse under running water and pat dry with paper towels.",How to Prepare and Cook Prawns1," You can cook the prawns in their shells as well, removing them later, and this often helps them retain moisture as they cook, But if the prawns are part of a larger dish (like a soup) you don't want to search for scales with your spoon. Luckily, cleaning prawns is easy before cooking.


If you are grilling or pan frying your prawns, you should leave at least the shells on.
You can leave the heads on the prawns, as they will lead to a stronger flavor, but many people remove them to make eating easier.;
, They should come off with ease. Grab around the eyes and firmly twist to pull the head off. You can discard these, or save them to make seafood stock., Simply use your hand to pinch off the small dangling legs and pull them away.

, Starting at the larger end, work your thumb under the shell and slide it down to the tail, pulling off the shell as you go. It may come off in pieces. You can either leave the tail on, usually as a ""handle"" when eating by hand, or remove and discard it if you're cooking the prawns into another dish.

, You're looking for the long black vein that runs through the entire prawn. It is easiest to see near the tail, where there is a small valley in the prawn., Pull the end of the vein up with the tip of the knife then grab it with your fingers to pull it off. This is not strictly necessary, but the vein has a bitter taste that is best removed now.You can still remove the vein while leaving the shell on. To do so, clip the shell with scissors and pull the vein out, closing the shell back up. You can also pull the entire vein out in one piece if you break the head off and locate it.

, Moisture on the outside of the prawn will make the cook unevenly. Give them a quick rinse with cold water and then dry them off.


If you don't plan on cooking them yet, keep the prawns on ice or in the refrigerator.

Add seasoning and stir the prawns up once as they cook.,
Flip the prawns and cook until the entire outside is pink.",How to Prepare and Cook Prawns2," If cooking a lot of prawns, add enough butter to cover the bottom. You should have enough oil to cover the bottom of the skillet, but you don't need the prawns to be covered.

, Aromatics are basically spices that cook with the oil, imparting their flavor on the prawns. Some good additions are:


1/2 cup chopped shallots.
3-5 cloves of garlic, smashed.
1-2 tablespoons chopped ginger.

, This usually takes 3-4 minutes. As the first side cooks, stir in your flavorings.

, Make sure you stir enough to coat the outside of the prawns in your seasonings, then leave them until the first side is cooked. some seasoning options include:



Mexican Prawns:Salt, lime juice, red pepper, cayenne, chili powder, garlic powder (if not using fresh)

Mediterranean Prawns: Salt, lemon juice, black pepper, oregano, garlic powder (if not using fresh) Cook in olive oil.

Cajun Prawns: Salt, paprika, cayenne, thyme, red and black pepper, chili powder, onion/garlic powder (if not using fresh). Cook in butter.

, Prawns lose their moisture quickly, so you just want to get the outsides nice and pink and then turn off the heat. There will be deep streaks of pink, not just white, when they are done. Serve in the hot pan so that they don't cool too quickly.

You can leave the shells and head on, or remove them before cooking. Leaving them on will lead to a stronger flavor.

, As soon as they come off, drain the hot water and plunge the prawns in a cold water keep them from cooking.


You can use that water as the base of a soup stock if you want to save it.

, These prawns are a nice addition to a buffet table, often placed on a large platter and served with a variety of sauces, such as cocktail sauce, tartar sauce or drawn butter.


These prawns also work well in a prawn salad with a mayonnaise-based dressing, either served on a bed of greens or in a bread roll.

Coat the prawns in olive oil.,
Arrange the skewers on the grill without touching each other.,
Cook for 3-4 minutes on each side, turning when the side is pink.,
Season the prawns after the come off the grill.",How to Prepare and Cook Prawns4," Prawns need to be cooked quickly to retain their moisture and still cook all the way through, so you want good high heat. This leads to wonderfully browned, crispy skins with succulent prawn meat underneath.


Generally, leaving the skins and tails on his best for grilling. However, it is not essential.

, The baking soda alters the pH slightly, promoting caramelization.Pat the prawns dry after removing them, but don't rinse them and get rid of the baking soda.

, You can mix them with vegetables as well, threading them one after the other on your skewer. Whatever you do, thread them tightly together, with no spaces between each prawns. This helps the interiors retain moisture as the outsides brown.Soak wooden skewers in water until thoroughly soaked through. Soaking the wooden skewers ahead of time prevents them from drawing moisture out of your prawns while they cook.

, Use a brush to coat all the sides of prawns with olive oil, which helps them cook evenly. Add a dusting of garlic powder, if you love garlic, and a light sprinkling of salt.

, Press them lightly down into the grill so that the prawns are touching the hot grate.

, Remember that prawns cook quickly, and you only need the outsides to be pink to move on. With a very hot grill you should get char lines quickly, and then the prawns are ready to turn. Cook for 1-2 minutes on the opposite side before removing.

, Take the prawns, shells and tails still intact, and toss them with some olive oil or melted butter, salt, and pepper. You can then add whatever other flavors you desire:



Mexican Prawns: Lime juice, red pepper, cayenne, chipotle, chili powder, garlic powder.

Mediterranean Prawns: Lemon juice, black pepper, oregano, garlic powder, parsley.

You can use a clean paper towel to do this.Some experts believe you should buy frozen shrimp if you want the shrimp to taste best. Fresh shrimp is rare. Shrimp that is bought already peeled and deveined probably won’t have as much flavor. Frozen shrimp can be defrosted in cold water.
You should avoid brown shrimp or shrimp with black spots on their shells. You also want to avoid shrimp with yellowing shells.;
, To remove the head of a shrimp, you should twist its head if the head is still attached. Do this with a gentle twist, and the head should pop off.Some people will also remove the shrimp’s legs by pulling them off, although this is not necessary and is a matter of personal preference.Keep the shrimp cold while you are peeling and deveining them. Keep the shrimp on ice or in ice water while you are working with them. One reason to peel your own shrimp is that they will likely have more flavor. Pre-peeled shrimp are often overcooked., Put your thumb on the underbelly of the shrimp, where its legs are attached.


Release the shell with your thumb. Hold the tail while removing the shell by pulling it off.The shell is softer on the shrimp’s underside. That’s why it’s best to remove it that way.You should be able to peel the shell off the shrimp.

, If you prefer to use kitchen shears to remove the shell, cut through the shrimp’s shell at the top, crack it open, and then pull off the shell.


This method might cut into the shrimp more, although you might find it easier to get the shell off. Either method will work.
Stop cutting when you reach the tail. Peel back the shell from both sides of the cut. The shrimp's shell is not very tough. It should be easy to remove.

, Some people don’t want to remove the shrimp’s tail because they like how it looks when they serve the shrimp, but if you want to remove the tail, do so with a gentle tug.


Pinch the tail at its bottom, where it connects with the shrimp’s body. Pull it.
The tail should slide off the shrimp. Once it does, you may want to save the tail to make stock with it.

, Some people prefer to leave the tail on the shrimp. In that case, perform all of the steps above, except for removing the tail.


Similarly, some people prefer to leave on both the head and tail of the shrimp. Simply perform the other steps without removing the head or tail.
For the latter, remove the shell only in the middle of the shrimp. Some people believe the shrimp is more pleasing to look at with the head and tail intact.

, Once you’ve removed the shrimp’s tail, head, and shell, you need to clean the shrimp to make it presentable for eating.


To clean the shrimp, put the shrimp down on a cutting board. Take a paring knife, and run the knife’s blade along the back of the shrimp, in the middle of the shrimp’s back.
Cut more deeply if you want to butterfly the shrimp., You do this by pulling the small gray vein out of the shrimp. You can use the tip of the knife to do this.


Make sure you don’t cut too deeply into the shrimp’s back. The vein is the shrimp’s digestive tract. It looks like a string.
Run the shrimp under cold water when you are done peeling and deveining it.

, Once you’ve peeled and deveined the shrimp, it’s time to cook and eat them! There are many recipes for cooking shrimp. Or you could eat it raw with cocktail sauce.


Try turning the shells, tails, and heads into stock. To do this, wash them off and then put them in a saucepan with cold water. You will want enough to cover them. Add peppercorns, a bay leaf or fresh parsley. Simmer uncovered about 15 minutes. Strain the shells out. Add the stock to a shrimp recipe to increase its flavor.Remember that it doesn’t take shrimp very long to cook. In fact, shrimp can cook in as little as three minutes. You will know they are done when they appear pink.

Steam your shrimp.,
Grill your shrimp.,
Saute your shrimp.,
Boil your shrimp.",How to Prepare Shrimp in Healthy Ways1," Steaming your shrimp does not add any extra calories and fat through cooking oils. To steam your shrimp, place your shrimp in a covered basket with small holes. Place this basket above a pot of boiling water. The heat from the steam will cook the shrimp.Steaming takes about five to six minutes.Shrimp will turn a pinkish color when they're done.
Any prep work, such as shelling or seasoning the shrimp, should be done prior to steaming them.;
, Grilling shrimp also limits additives. First, brush the shrimp with oil or a non-stick spray. Place your shrimp near the edge of the grill. After a few minutes, your shrimp will start to release some moisture. At this point, flip your shrimp and allow them to cook for a few minutes on the other side.You can use grilling skewers or a grill basket to prevent your shrimp from falling through the grill grates.

, While sauteeing shrimp calls for the use of oil, heart healthy oils like olive oil will keep your dish healthy. Olive oil can also add some flavor. Heat up your oil in a pan over medium heat and then add the shrimp. Cook the shrimp for two to three minutes on each side. When done, the shrimp should be a bright, pink shade.While olive oil is healthy, it is high in calories. Make sure to only use a small amount of oil while cooking your shrimp. The precise amount depends on how many shrimp you're grilling, as more shrimp need more oil, but try to stick to only one to two tablespoons.

, Boiling your shrimp only requires water and a bit of salt, so it does not add calories to the shrimp. Add your water and shrimp to a pot. Bring it to a boil. Allow it to boil for only two minutes before removing the pot from the heat. Cover the pot and let it sit for five to ten minutes before serving your shrimp.Smaller shrimp only need about five minutes to cook, while larger ones should cook for closer to ten minutes.

Make a shallow cut near the top of the shrimp, grab onto the vein, and gently pull it out.Eating the vein is not harmful, and you can skip de-veining in a rush. However, many people dislike the taste and texture of the vein.

, When choosing shrimp at the supermarket, make sure you choose the best shrimp. Fresher shrimp will taste better and be healthier overall.Avoid shrimp that gives off a fishy odor or an ammonia-like smell.
Fresh shrimp should be translucent and shiny.
Avoid mushy, slimy shrimp.

Alternatively, you can also thaw pre-cooked crab legs by running them under cold water for several minutes.

, Prepare a shallow baking pan by filling the bottom 1/8 inch (3.175 mm) with hot water.


Since this pan will be going into the oven, it is better to use hot water than cold or room temperature water. Hot water is already closer to the temperature inside the oven. If you cook crab legs in cold water, you may need to wait an additional few minutes to allow the water enough time to heat up inside the baking pan.

, Arrange the crab legs in a single layer in the water.


Cover the entire pan with aluminum foil after adding the crab legs.
Note that the water can be added to the pan either before or after you arrange the crab legs.

, The crab legs will only need to bake for about 7 to 10 minutes total.

,


You will need to create multiple layers of crab legs, but these layers should at least be even.
Due to the shape of the crab legs, an oval slow cooker usually works better than a round one.
You only need enough water to cover the crabs. Too little or too much could be result in crab legs that are too dry or not sufficiently heated.

, Melt the butter in a small bowl and stir in the garlic powder and dill.


If you prefer a stronger garlic taste, you can use 4 cloves of minced garlic instead of concentrated garlic powder.
Since the crab legs are being cooked slowly, the flavors of the seasonings have a greater opportunity to permeate the thick shell of the legs and flavor the meat beneath.

, Pour the melted butter mixture over the crab legs in the slow cooker.


Try to spread the butter over as many of the crab legs as possible. You can toss them to coat the crab more thoroughly, but this is not necessary.

Freeze your crabs.,
Check for signs of sensitivity.,
Spike the crab to kill it.,
Consider buying and thawing frozen crab.",How to Cook a Crab1," Place your crabs in the freezer for several hours. The cold air will numb the crabs and cause them to move around much slower. This makes it easier to handle the crabs when killing them and may even dull their pain. Remember that once they're desensitized to pain, you should kill them immediately so they don't recover and feel pain again.If your crabs are larger, they'll take longer to freeze.;
, You'll know your crab has frozen long enough when it's easy to handle or manipulate. The crabs shouldn't be moving their limbs at all or react when you touch near their mouthparts.Try tapping a crab's shell. If the crab's eyes don't react, then the crab is desensitized.

, You can quickly pierce the two nerve centers on a crab to immediately and painlessly kill the crab. Place your immobile crab on a non-slip mat so that it's on its back. Lift up the tail flap. You should see a hole that looks like a small dot. This is directly over a nerve center. Take a knife (or awl) and spike into this tiny hole at an angle of 85°. Do this again for the front nerve center.The front nerve center is located in the shallow depression at the front of the crab. Insert this spike at an angle of 60°.
The whole spiking process should take less than 10 seconds. You can then cook the crab according to any method you'd like.

, If you don't want to worry about cooking a very fresh crab or killing it yourself, buy frozen crab legs and claws. These are steamed before they're frozen so all you need to do is heat them back up. To thaw your frozen crab you can either:Place the frozen crab in the fridge and let it thaw overnight
Place the frozen crab in a container of cool water that's set in your sink or on the counter

Fill the pot with about 1 inch of water and place the steamer in the bottom. Cover the pot with the lid and bring the water to a boil.If you don't have a steamer insert, twist a long sheet of foil into a rope and place it in the bottom of your pot twisted into a figure 8.

, Use tongs to pick up a crab from behind so that one tong arm is on its belly and the other is on its back. The legs of the crab should hang on both sides of the tong arms. Set the crabs onto the steamer rack.You should put the crab on the steamer so that its back is facing up towards you.

, Cover the pot with the lid and bring the water back to a boil over high heat. Let the crabs steam for 1 minute. You should reduce the heat to medium-high and let the crab keep steaming until it's cooked (about 15 more minutes for 2 pounds of crab).


You can figure your cooking time as being about 7 minutes for each pound of crab that you're steaming., Lift the crabs out of the pot using your tongs. Set them in a colander over cold running water or submerge them in a bowl of ice water till they're cool. Avoid handling the crabs while they're still hot since the water inside the crabs may be boiling hot.

There should still be 3 or 4 inches of space near the top of the pot once your crabs are in the bottom. Remember how far up the sides your crabs come.Remove the crabs and set them aside while you get the water ready.

, Fill the pot with water so the water is 2 or 3 inches over where the crabs were. Cover your pot and bring the water to a boil over high heat. You'll notice steam escaping from under the lid when the water begins to boil.For even more flavor, consider boiling the crabs in a vegetable stock. For a simpler flavor, you could just add a a sliced lemon to the water., Carefully lower the crabs into the pot of boiling water. Cover the lid with the pot and set a timer for 15 minutes (if you're cooking one or two 1/2 pound crabs) or 20 minutes (if you're cooking larger crabs). Once the water begins to boil again, lower the heat so the water is only simmering.You'll need to watch the pot of boiling crabs while they cook. Make sure that the water is always at a lively bubble. Avoid boiling the crabs for the entire cooking time since this can make the crab meat tough and rubbery.

, Use tongs to lift the crabs out of your pot. Place them in a colander so the hot water will drain out of the crabs and into the sink. If you'd like to dress your crabs quickly, run cold water over them while they're in the colander.


Use caution when handling boiling water and the cooked crabs. Use oven mitts to hold the tongs (especially if your tongs are metal) since the tongs may heat up as well.

Grill your crab.,
Finished.

",How to Cook a Crab4," Heat your grill to high using direct heat. While the grill is heating, gently hit the crab shells with a rolling pin to slightly crack them. This will help the marinade soak in more. To make a marinade, combine olive oil, salt, and garlic (all to taste). Coat the crabs in the marinade.You can make the marinade ahead of time (up to 3 hours before grilling). This will give the crabs more flavor.
If you don't want to marinate the crabs, you should at least cut the shells of King Crab legs and cover them with a little oil. This will keep them from sticking to the grill and will make it easier to get to the meat.

, Place the crabs directly on the cooking grate of your grill. You may want to use tongs to set the crabs on the grill if you're worried you'll burn yourself. Try to arrange thicker or whole crabs on the hottest part of the grill (usually in the center). If you're using pre-steamed crabs that were frozen and thawed, grill them for 4 minutes and then turn them over using your tongs. Grill them for another 4 minutes.If you're using fresh crabs that you just killed, grill them for 10 minutes and then turn them and cook for another 10 minutes.,"

The simplest way to kill a live crab is to immerse the crab in boiling water for 60 seconds. Then, use tongs to remove the crab from the water and place it in an ice bath to cool., If you are using frozen crab, thaw it out before cleaning it. Fill a sink with cool water and immerse the crab in the sink. After about 15 to 20 minutes, it should be thawed enough to clean., If you boiled your crab, let it become cool to the touch before cleaning it. You should also let it dry off first, as handling a wet crab can be difficult. If you thawed your crab in water, let it dry before cleaning it., Take a pair of scissors from your kitchen and use this to cut the face off the crab. The face includes the crab's eyes and mouth. Cut a straight line across the front of the crab, just behind the eyes and mouth, to remove the face.It is generally easier to use scissors to remove the face. However, not all scissors will be sharp enough. If your scissors fail to cut through the crab, use a sharp knife instead to make the cut.

, The abdomen of the crab is the small flap of shell on the underside of the crab. You do not need any special tools to remove the abdomen. Pull it off with your fingers., You will see the gills underneath the abdomen. They resemble small, beige tongues. To remove the gills, grab them with your fingers and pull them off., Once unwanted materials are removed from the crab, it can be cleaned using water. Hold the crab under running tap water to rinse out the guts. These are the greenish brown substances found inside the crab. Keep rinsing the crab until the guts are completely removed., Now, you can get to the meat of the crab. This can be cooked after it is extracted. Turn the crab upside down. Hold it with both sides and place both thumbs underneath the crab, near the midline of the crab's back. As you push with your thumbs, pull down with your hands. The crab will crack open.You should be left with two even sections of crab meat.

Purchase frozen crab legs from the supermarket, as this ensures the best taste.,
Buy enough crab legs per person.,
Keep the crab legs frozen until you plan on boiling them.,
Rinse off the crab legs, set aside, and fill a large saucepan or pot halfway with cold water.,
Drop in the crab legs and wait for the boiling liquid to return to a boil.,
Remove the crab legs from the boiling water, let drain, and serve with clarified butter.",How to Boil Crab Legs," Frozen crab legs — doesn't that compromise their flavor? Actually, frozen crab legs usually taste better than thawed crab legs, as the thawed legs do not retain the familiar taste and freshness found in frozen ones. Why is this?









Most crab legs available at the supermarket were cooked on the fishing boat immediately after they were caught, and then flash frozen. Because crabbing vessels are often at sea for a long time, and because cooking helps ward off unwanted bacteria and germs, this flash freezing helps lock in the flavor.
Want to tell for sure whether your crab legs have been pre-cooked before being frozen? Look at their color and the package. Crab legs, usually a pale color uncooked, turn bright orange or red when cooked. If you're not sure either way, look at the package. It should state pretty clearly whether the crab was previously cooked or not.;
, How much crab should you buy? The general idea is that if you're planning on serving the legs with a side or two, 2 to 4 legs per person is ideal as a main course.Because crab can get pretty expensive, it's also possible to serve crab legs as an appetizer. One crab leg per person is more than sufficient as an appetizer.








, You don't need to defrost them before cooking, and you certainly shouldn't microwave them. Because they are already pre-cooked, they keep quite well.









If you do wish to cut down on your cooking time a bit, of course you can defrost your crab legs. To safely defrost frozen crab legs, put them in the refrigerator for approximately 8 hours. Thawed crab legs can be kept in the refrigerator for up to 2 days without spoiling.

, Add salt or seasoning, if desired. Turn the stove on high, and allow the water to come to a boil. If you want to get fancy with your boiling medium or added ingredients, try out these suggestions:









Add a bit of lemon juice (or vinegar) to the water. This helps give the crab legs an extra fresh flavor and helps neutralize some of the most pungent seafood odors. Squeeze the juice of one whole lemon to the pot right after it comes to a boil, or add one tablespoon of vinegar.
Boil with beer and Old Bay seasoning. Try adding two cans of flavorful beer and four cans of water as your boiling medium. Add one heaping tablespoon of Old Bay seasoning for a little bit of kick.

, Reduce the heat to medium-high, and let the crab legs boil for 4 to 5 minutesfor smaller varieties of crab, 7 to 8 for larger varieties, and up to 15 minutes for colossal. Remove from heat immediately. Remember, you're most likely not cooking them so much as reheating them.









If the crab legs are already thawed, cook them for 2 to 5 minutes, depending on their size.

, Serve immediately. In order to make clarified butter, do the following:









Chop good-quality butter into cubes. Over low heat, melt butter until completely melted and foam starts rising to the surface. Let simmer for a little while.
With a small slotted spoon or similar implement, begin skimming off the foam from the top of the butter. You don't have to get every last piece of foam, but try to get most of it. What you're doing is removing the mild solids and moisture from the fats.Line a fine mesh strainer with cheesecloth or muslin and strain the remaining liquid through it. Discard any solids caught in the cheesecloth. You've just made clarified butter!

Stir until the mixture is smooth, and set aside.You can also mix 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of sesame oil and/or 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of oyster sauce into the mixture if you like those flavors.;
, In a large wok or skillet, heat 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of vegetable oil over medium-high heat until the oil is hot and starting to shimmer, which usually takes approximately 3 to 5 minutes. Add 2 cloves of finely chopped garlic to the pan, and stir fry for approximately 3 minutes or until the garlic becomes soft.If you’re using a skillet instead of a wok, make sure that it’s fairly deep so it has similar dimensions to a wok.
When you add the oil to the pan, swirl it around once or twice to ensure that the entire bottom is coated.

, When the garlic is soft, mix 1 pound (450 g) of large, raw shrimp that have been peeled and deveined into the pan. Stir fry the shrimp for about 3 minutes or until they become pink. Use a slotted spoon to remove the shrimp, so you can place them on a plate and set aside.It’s a good idea to pat the shrimp with paper towel before you add them to the pan. Excess moisture on the shrimp can cause the oil to splatter when you place them in the pan., After you’ve removed the shrimp from the pan, add 2 ½ cups (250 g) of broccoli florets to the oil and garlic. Allow the broccoli to cook for approximately 2 minutes, or until the florets become bright green.Broccoli is the first vegetable added because it is very dense and takes longer to cook. If you plan to add or replace the broccoli with other dense vegetables, such as carrots or cauliflower, stir fry them at this point., When the broccoli has cooked for a couple of minutes, mix 1 large red pepper that’s been cut into strips, 1 large yellow pepper that’s been cut into strips, and 1 ¼ cup (120 g) of snow peas into the pan. Stir fry the mixture until the peppers and snow peas are nearly tender but still crisp, which should take approximately 1 minute.You can add to or replace the peppers and snow peas with other vegetables that are similar in density, such as green beans, if you prefer.

, Once the vegetables have all cooked for a few minutes, sprinkle the pan with salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste. Stir well to ensure that you season the entire mixture., After you’ve fried and seasoned the vegetables, place the shrimp back in the wok. Mix in ½ cup (118 g) of sliced water chestnuts and 4 green onions that have been chopped as well.If you aren’t a fan of water chestnuts, you can replace them with chopped nuts, such as cashews or peanuts, for added crunch in the stir fry.

, When you’ve added all of the stir fry ingredients, pour the sauce into the pan. Stir fry the entire mixture until the sauce begins to thicken and boil, which should take about 1 minute., Remove the pan from the heat, and transfer the stir fry into four bowls. Serve while the dish is still hot.You can serve the stir fry with cooked white rice, egg noodles, or rice noodles.
For a garnish, consider adding chopped green onions, peanuts, or cashews.

Assemble your shrimp, with or without shell, next to your bowl of homemade cocktail sauce.",How to Make Shrimp Cocktail2," In a medium bowl, mix together ketchup, chili sauce, horseradish, lemon juice, Worcestershire sauce, hot sauce, and salt. Stir until evenly mixed.

, Allow to chill while the shrimp cook.

, While fresh shrimp are superior in taste and texture, frozen shrimp can be perfectly acceptable if that's all you got. Just make sure to factor in extra cooking time if you do decide to use frozen shrimp.

, It's a little bit of hassle to peel the shell from the shrimp at the end of the day, but the taste makes up for it. Shrimp with their tails and shells still on are said to taste better.Another option is to cook your shrimp with shells and tail on, and then peel them after cooking is complete.
Look for shrimp that are ""ready to peel."" This simply means that they've been de-veined, so that you don't have to go through the hassle of removing their guts. If you want to de-vein shrimp yourself, check out this handy tutorial.

, How you cook your shrimp will depend on two things: whether they are fresh or frozen, and how large they are.


Fresh jumbo shrimp will take about 5 minutes to cook. Once they turn from translucent to opaque, they're ready to take out.
Frozen (uncooked) shrimp generally take a bit longer. If you put them in the water, wait for the water to come back to a boil and then test one; they're usually finished when the water has returned to a boil. You can also defrost your shrimp first in cold water to make the cooking process go faster.

, Shocking shrimp in the ice bath will halt the cooking process and keep them from becoming rubbery.

, Make sure the shrimp aren't wet before you assemble them.

, A classic placement is to surround your cocktail sauce with shrimp and lemon wedges on a bed of ice.

",How to Make Shrimp Alfredo," As you peel and de-vein the shrimp, you should keep them in a bowl of ice or ice water.


Prior to being cooked, shrimp must be kept cold to reduce the risk of food-borne illness.;
, These elements can be plucked off with your fingers. A knife should not be necessary.


Note that some shrimp is sold without the head and legs attached. This is often the case with packaged shrimp, but shrimp sold fresh are more likely to come with the head and legs attached.

, Grasp the outer shell or skin with your fingers at the head end. Peel it all the way back to the tail end and rip or slice it off.


The shell should be easy to distinguish from the meat of the shrimp at the head end once the head has been removed.
The tail tip and last segment of the shell can be left on the shrimp for decorative purposes, but the they can also be removed. You should be able to pluck both off with your fingers, if desired. Otherwise, you can rip the shell off before the last segment with your fingers or cut it off with a knife.
Place the shells in a resealable plastic bag. Close the bag and discard the shells or freeze them to make shellfish stock later.

, Make a 1/4-inch (6.35-mm) incision along the back of the shrimp.


Use a small, smooth paring knife to avoid cutting away too much of the shrimp and to create a smooth line.
Cut from the head end to as close to the tail end as possible.

,


You may need to use your paring knife to dig it out, but the vein can often be removed with your fingers.
If you can't see a vein after cutting down the back, you do not need to worry about removing one. (Often on small shrimp.)

,


The cornstarch may become clumpy as it sits, so you will need to stir the two together periodically as you prepare the rest of the sauce.

, In a large saucepan over medium-high heat, heat the butter until it melts.


You could also use a large, heavy frying pan with tall sides. Since all of the ingredients will eventually be piled into this pan, however, you need to make sure that it is large enough to accommodate the entire dish.

, Add the garlic to melted butter and cook on medium-high heat for 5 minutes, or until the garlic becomes fragrant and soft.


Stir the garlic continually to prevent it burning.
Instead of 3 cloves of garlic, you could also use 3 tsp (15 ml) of fresh bottled minced garlic, 1.5 tsp (7.5 ml) dried minced garlic, or 0.5 tsp (2.5 ml) garlic powder. If using dried minced garlic or garlic powder, however, you do not need to cook it first. Instead, add the garlic when adding the salt and pepper.

, Add the shrimp to the hot pan and cook,stirring occasionally, until it turns pink.


This should take about 1 to 2 minutes.
Make sure to drain any ice water the shrimp might be sitting in prior to adding it to the pan.

, Pour the half-and-half into the pan. Sprinkle with salt and pepper before gradually adding the Parmesan cheese.


Sprinkle the cheese in 1 Tbsp (15 ml) at a time, stirring after each addition to incorporate it thoroughly., Add the milk and cornstarch mix to the pan. Reduce the heat once you see bubbles forming, and stir until thickened.


The sauce will take at least 2 minutes to thicken after it begins to bubble, if not longer.
Give the milk and cornstarch a final stir before adding it to the rest of the sauce. This will re-combine the two ingredients if they separated while sitting.
Set the sauce aside and keep warm.

, You will need one large pot filled halfway with water for the pasta and a medium saucepan filled with 1 inch (2.5 cm) of water for the broccoli.


If desired, you may lightly salt both pots of water as they come to a boil. Salt can help draw out the flavors of the pasta and broccoli.

, Add the pasta to large pot of boiling water and cook 8 to 10 minutes. Drain the water.


The pasta should be al dente when done.
If the package directions for you pasta vary from this, follow the package directions.

, Add the broccoli to the other saucepan of water. Bring to a boil before reducing the heat to medium-low. Let simmer, covered, for 6 to 8 minutes.The broccoli should be tender enough to stick a fork through when done.
Drain when completed.
If the cooking directions on your bag of broccoli varies from these instructions, follow the package directions.

, Add the drained pasta and drained broccoli to the pot of shrimp alfredo sauce. Heat the whole thing over medium heat for a few minutes to warm everything up.


Stir the ingredients as you heat them so that they are evenly distributed and evenly heated.
Turn the heat down if you see the sauce start to bubble.

, Transfer the hot shrimp alfredo to individual serving plates.

If desired, you could also top the dish with extra Parmesan cheese or black pepper.

You are only partially cooking the shrimp, so as soon as they start turning pink, remove them from the oil and drain on a paper towel.

, Using the heel of a large chef knife, push down on a peeled garlic clove to flatten and then finely mince. To prepare the red chili peppers, start by cutting off their heads and then slicing them down the middle. This will expose the chili's membranes and seeds. Use a paring knife to scrape them out. Stack the chili pepper halves on top of one another and thinly slice. Prepare the green onion by cutting off both ends, but still leaving a little green and then finely mincing. It is important to remember that when working with red chilies not to touch your eyes after handling them without first washing your hands.

, After pre-heating your wok until it starts to smoke, add a tablespoon of vegetable oil around the sides of the wok. Allow the oil to get hot.

",How to Prepare and Cook Salmon," Salmon purchased at a grocery store or fish market should still have the skin on to maintain its freshness and moisture. Try to buy a whole salmon side, or a fillet that is cut from the thickest part of the fish. Request a center cut piece of salmon. Purchase 6 oz. of salmon (170 grams) per person.


Avoid salmon with a strong fishy odor. Look for moist, clean cut fillets.;
, There are several different kinds of salmon, all of which can be cooked in the different ways listed in the second section of this article (Cooking Salmon.)King Salmon (a.k.a. Chinook) is known for its buttery flavor and texture. It is the largest salmon species and has the highest Omega-3 and oil concentrations of any salmon. It is generally the most expensive salmon you can buy.
Sockeye Salmon, or Red Salmon, is more abundant than King Salmon. It has a bright red-orange color and a very rich flavor. It has a high fat and Omega-3 content. Sockeye is the most common salmon you will find in your local grocery store.
Coho Salmon usually appears in grocery stores around August and September. It has a milder flavor that King and Sockeye salmon, and is sometimes referred to as silver salmon.
Chum Salmon is most often used for canned salmon. It varies greatly in quality and is generally lower in oil than other types of salmon.
Pink Humpback Salmon is the most abundant salmon of the species. This salmon is generally canned or smoked. It has a mild flavor and lighter colored flesh.

, There has been controversy about the effects farmed salmon have had on the environment. Specifically, activists have alleged that farmed salmon have escaped and carried diseases to wild salmon. Proponents of wild salmon also point out that salmon in the wild have healthier diets than farmed salmon, so the meat is better tasting and looking. Talk to your local fishmonger or experts in your market about the pros and cons of wild and farmed salmon.


Wild salmon will also look pinker and brighter than farmed varieties. Some salmon farmers inject dye into their farmed fish to make them look as pink as the wild salmon.
It has been reported that wild salmon contains more nutrients per serving than farmed salmon, and several studies have been cited showing that farmed salmon contains more polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) than wild salmon., Some people prefer to keep the skin on the fish when cooking and eating it.


Place the fillet on a cutting board with the skin side down. Sprinkle one end of the salmon with salt to make the fish less slippery. Hold the salted end of the fish and use a sharp knife to cut between the flesh and the skin slowly, until the fish pulls away from the skin.
Discard the skin or, save it to use in other recipes. Some people enjoy making crispy salmon skin for salads or sushi.

, Pull the bones out of the fish one by one in the direction of the fish's grain. Use your fingers to remove the bones.

, Sprinkle salt and pepper on both sides of the salmon. Depending on taste, add other herbs such as parsley, dill, tarragon, and garlic. Coat the salmon with olive oil or white wine, and add any other flavors you like, including brown sugar, lemon or butter.

, Salmon should be cooked until the meat is opaque and flakes off easily.

, Poaching is a simple way to prepare salmon. The fish comes out light and fresh tasting. When poaching salmon, make sure to not overcook the fish.Place the liquid, such as water, wine or fish stock, that you wish to poach the salmon in, into a large pan or skillet. You can also add other flavoring ingredients such as carrots, lemon, parsley, etc. Follow your specific recipe for the ingredients you should use.
Bring the liquid to a boil and then reduce it to a simmer. Cover the pan and simmer the liquid for 8 minutes.
Place the fish into the simmering liquid. The liquid should just cover the fish. Cook the salmon until it is opaque all the way through (about 5 minutes of simmering.)
Remove the salmon from the liquid using a large slotted spatula.

, Slowly grilling salmon is one of the best ways to bring out all of the flavors of the fish. To increase the flavor, you can marinate the salmon in your favorite marinade.Rub some oil the fish to prevent it from sticking to the grill. You may also consider greasing the grill to keep the fish from sticking.
If you are using a charcoal grill, place the salmon on the grill rack over medium coals. Grill uncovered for 4 to 6 minutes per each ½ inch of thickness or until the fish begins to flake when cut into with a fork. Flip the fish halfway through grilling to cook it evenly.
If you are using a gas stove, preheat the grill to a medium heat. Place the salmon on the grill and close the grill. Again, grill the fish for 4 to 6 minutes per each ½ inch of thickness. Flip the fish halfway through grilling.

, Baked salmon can be buttery and delicious if cooked right. Baking is also one of the easiest and least time consuming way to prepare salmon.Place the dressed salmon in a baking dish and cook it at 350 degrees Fahrenheit (177 degrees Celsius). If you are baking salmon fillets, cook it at 450 degrees F (232 degrees C). Cook until the fish is fully opaque and flaky.
Some recipes recommend wrapping the salmon in foil with a variety of spices, seasonings, and vegetables for moist, flavorful fish.

, Broiled salmon is crispier than most other prepared salmon dishes. It is particularly good to broil salmon if you like crispy skin on your fish.


For a crispier texture, place the salmon on a baking sheet with oil and stick it under the broiler for 1 or 2 minutes.

Let the salmon rest.",How to Pan Fry Salmon," Place a 10 to 12-inch saute pan or skillet over medium heat. Drizzle a teaspoon of olive oil in the pan. The oil can keep the salmon from sticking. Heat your pan till you feel warmth coming off of the pan when you hold your hand about 4 inches above it.


Choose a non-stick skillet or cast iron skillet. These can prevent the salmon skin from sticking to the pan.;
, Your salmon should be cut into fillets of about 2 inches wide. If you bought a long fillet of salmon, carefully use a sharp knife to cut the salmon into individual fillets. For this recipe, you'll need two fillets that weigh about 6 ounces each. Remove any pin bones from the salmon fillets before you cook them.To remove the bones, feel the sides of the fillets for any sharp or prickly bones sticking out. Use needle-nosed pliers to pull the thin bones out of the fillets.

, Pat the salmon dry with paper towels to remove moisture. Drizzle the flesh of the salmon with 2 teaspoons of olive oil. Try to drizzle the oil evenly so both fillets are lightly covered with the oil. Sprinkle 1/4 teaspoon of kosher salt over the fillets and grind a few twists of black pepper over them.The oil will help the flesh of the salmon brown as it cooks and prevent sticking.

, Use your favorite spices or seasonings to add extra flavor. If you don't want much additional flavoring (beyond the salt and pepper), but want extra color in your salmon fillets, sprinkle paprika over them. This will help make a reddish-brown color as they cook. For unique seasonings, try:A dry barbecue rub
Chinese 5-spice
Garam Masala
Ras el Hanout

, If you want crispier skin, place the salmon skin-side down. If you're not planning on serving the skin with the fillet, place it flesh-side down. You should leave the salmon on while cooking since it's easier to remove after it's cooked and it can help prevent overcooking the salmon.If you decide to make more than two fillets, make sure not to crowd the pan since this can lower the temperature of the pan. Instead, just pan fry them in batches.

, The salmon will probably begin curling in towards itself during the first minute or two of cooking, especially if you placed it skin-down. To keep the fillet flat as it cooks, press down evenly using a fish spatula.A fish spatula is a narrow metal spatula that gets wider at the end. It's flexible but strong enough to lift up a delicate fillet in one piece., Salmon fillets that are 6 to 8 ounces in weight will need to cook for a total of about 4 minutes. If you have thin fillets, cook each wide side for 2 minutes. If your fillets are pretty thick on one end and taper to thin on the other end, consider pan frying the large wide sides for 1 1/2 minutes each and 30 seconds on each narrow small side.It's a good idea to use a timer to cook your fillets. Thermometers can be inaccurate since the shape and size of the fillets varies and cooks at different speeds.
Avoid flipping the salmon repeatedly. This will prevent a good crust from developing., Remove the salmon to plates and cover the fillets with a large piece of aluminum foil. Let the salmon rest for about 5 minutes. This gives the fish a chance to finish cooking and the juices will redistribute within the fillets. Serve the salmon while it's still warm.


You can cook the salmon ahead of time and refrigerate it. Use this in recipes that call for cooked, flaked salmon. Be aware that the skin will lose its crispness, so you should probably remove it before serving it.

",How to Prepare Crab Stuffed Salmon,"


Ask for 2 or 3 thick steaks from your local meat counter. The salmon should be at least 3/4-inch (1.9 cm) thick in order to be properly stuffed. The length should be about the size of your hand. If you purchase 1 large steak, you can cut it in half to produce 2 proportional serving sizes.;
,


Dump your crab meat into a large bowl.
Sauté a small onion and half of a bell pepper in butter on the stove until the vegetables are tender. Place these into the bowl.
Whisk 1 egg in a separate bowl. Add mustard and whip to combine it with the egg. Add this to the crab meat bowl.
Grate approximately 4 tbsp (56.7 g) of frozen Brie into the bowl.
Toss in 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) (14.3 g) of pine nuts.
Set the stuffing mixture into the refrigerator until the salmon is ready.

,


Place the steaks on a cutting board. Insert a sharp knife into one side of the salmon steak. Stop when you are about two-thirds of the way inside.
Cut away a small square of salmon by gently running the knife along the interior. The size of the square you should cut depends on the amount of crab you want in each steak.

,


Spread extra virgin olive oil over both the flesh and skin sides of the salmon.
Rub salt and pepper onto the flesh side.

,


Spoon the stuffing into the pocket of the salmon. Use as much or as little as you prefer.

,


Preheat the oven to 435 degrees Fahrenheit (218.3 degrees Celsius) and grease a baking sheet with extra virgin olive.
Set each steak onto the baking sheet with the skin side facing upward.
Bake the salmon for 8 to 10 minutes, depending on the thickness of the steaks. The meat is done when the steaks have turned an opaque pink hue.
Flip the salmon and grate the rest of the Brie on top. Place in the broiler until the cheese browns, about 4 minutes.

If you don’t have a steaming rack, use a metal cooling rack or an upside down colander.To cook more or larger lobsters, you may have to adjust the cooking time, and you may need a larger pot, more water, and an extra tablespoon of salt.
You'll need enough fresh water to fill the bottom of the pot, so the size and shape of the pot will determine the amount of water.
To cook up to eight pounds (3.6 kg) of lobster at once, use a five-gallon (19 L) pot.;
, Place the steaming rack in the bottom of the pot and fill the bottom with two inches (5 cm) of water. Add the salt to the water. There are a number of salts you can use for this, including:


Sea salt
Kosher salt
Table Salt

, Place the pot onto the largest element you have, put on the lid, and heat it over high heat. As the water comes to a boil, prepare the lobster:Rinse the lobster under cold, running water and place it on a plate, tray, or other flat surface until the water boils.
When the water boils, grab the lobster where the head meets the body.Hold the lobster down and carefully remove the rubber bands on the claws by slipping them off or cutting them with scissors. Watch your hands, or you might get pinched.
You can leave the bands on during the cooking process if you're worried about getting pinched. The bands may transfer a bit of a rubbery taste to the claw meat.

, Immediately after removing the bands, remove the lid from the pot and use your hands or tongs to plunge the lobster head-first into the boiling water. If you're cooking more than one, place them in the pot one at a time. Return the lid and bring the water back to a boil.


Avoid crowding the pot if you're cooking more than one lobster. If you can't see the bottom of the pot or can't get the lid on properly, you either need a second pot, a larger pot, or you have to cook the lobsters in two batches., As soon as the lobster goes into the water, start your cooking timer or make a note of the time, because the cooking time is based on when the lobster goes into the pot, not when the water returns to a boil.Cooking times for steamed lobsters are:10 minutes for one pound
12 minutes for 1¼ pounds
14 minutes for 1½ pounds
16 minutes for 1¾ pounds
18 minutes for two pounds
22 minutes for 2½ pounds
20 to 25 minutes for three pounds
40 to 45 minutes for five pounds
50 to 60 minutes for six to seven pound

, Halfway through the steaming time, take the lid off the pot. Use the tongs to rearrange the lobster in the pot to ensure even cooking.Return the lid when you're finished and allow the lobster to continue cooking.
When you remove the lid, open it away from you first so the steam escapes on the other side and doesn’t burn you.

, Take the pot off the heat, remove the lid, and use the tongs to remove the lobster from the pot. If you're cooking more than one lobster, remove them one at a time. Place the lobster on a baking sheet until it’s cool enough to touch.


To stop the cooking process immediately and speed up the cooling, quickly dunk the lobster in and out of a pot of ice water before placing it on the baking sheet.You can tell that lobster is done when the shell goes bright red, the meat goes white, and an antenna comes out with no resistance when it’s pulled., To get at the meat inside the lobster, you have to crack and remove the shell that’s protecting it. For this, you will need:


A sharp knife
Scissors
A small towel

, Remove the tail from the body by gently twisting and pulling the tail away from the body. Lay the tail right side up on a cutting board. Insert the point of the knife into the center of the tail and cut the tail in half, lengthwise, toward the tail fins.


Turn the tail around and make a second lengthwise cut to finish slicing the tail in half. Use your fingers to gently remove the meat from inside the shell halves., Remove the claws from the body by gently twisting and pulling the claws and knuckles away from the body. Use the scissors to separate the claws from the knuckles. Set the knuckles aside.


Remove the smaller pincer from the claw by bending it back and forth with your fingers until the shell cracks off. The meat should stay behind, still attached to the larger claw.
Wrap the claw in a towel and hit it with the butt of a knife to crack open the shell. Hit it once or twice on each side. Unwrap the towel and peel the cracked shell away from the meat., Use the scissors or a knife to cut open the side of the knuckle shell. You can then pry open the shell and remove the meat from the inside.If you have seafood crackers, you can use them instead of a knife or scissors to crack the shell on the claws, knuckles, and legs.

, Pull or cut the legs off the body. Use scissors to cut open the side of the shell. Pry open the shell and remove the meat from inside.When you have finished removing the meat from all these parts, throw out what remains, including all the shells, the head, and the torso., Place the lobster on a plate and serve with the lemon herb butter and a wedge of fresh lemon.


You can also use the lobster meat in other dishes, such as lobster pastas, bisque, or salads.

, In a small saucepan, melt the butter over medium–low heat. To make a larger batch of butter to serve more people, multiply the ratios by four. The ingredients you need from the lemon herb butter are:1 cup (230 g) butter
2 teaspoons (12 ml) fresh lemon juice
2 teaspoons (10 g) each of parsley, chives, and basil

, When the butter is melted, add the lemon juice and herbs. Use a small spoon to sample the butter, and then add salt and pepper to taste.


For a spicy treat, add ¼ teaspoon (1.25 g) of ground cayenne pepper to the butter as well.

, Transfer the butter to a heat-proof dish and serve with the lobster. To keep the butter warm and liquid, you can:


Place it in a ramekin designed to sit over a small tea light candle
Place the dish into a larger bowl filled with hot water

"
"
Get a bowl, a plate and a fork.,
Separate the tail section from the body:


Center the lobster over the bowl to catch the water that will spill out.,
Hold the tail section over the plate.

,
Pull the fins off the end of the lobster tail.,
Wrap your fingers around the shell firmly, leaving the lobster meat exposed on both ends.

,
Poke the fork tines into the end of the tail, where you pulled the fins off.,
The meat of the lobster tail will pop out the other side onto the plate!",How to Get a Lobster Tail out of Its Shell,";
, This doesn't always happen, some just do the whole process right on their plate.
Hold the tail section in one hand
Hold the body in the other hand
Bend the two sections toward each other, across the lobster's back. You can also separate the body from the tail in a twisting motion. Be bold!
Place the body in the bowl. Lobster freaks may actually twist off the little legs and suck the meat out, but it's a labor of love.

,, There's tiny bits of meat in the fins, if you're inclined to work them out.

,, If you're comfortable using your fingers, just poke one or two fingers into the rear end and push through the tail shell.

, Dig in!

Choose live lobsters that are active and do not have curled tails. You will want to select lobsters that are holding their claws upright, rather than lobsters that have limp claws.

, For an authentic New England lobster bake, it is recommended that you use New England steamer clams, which are from New England and larger than little neck clams and have a softer shell.


Choose clams and mussels that have their shells intact, and are not cracked. If you are purchasing fresh clams and mussels, tap the shell when they are open-the shell should close.
Scrub the shells of the clams and mussels to remove any excess sand.

Sometimes you won’t want to cook the lobster immediately. Store the frozen lobster in an airtight freezer bag. If vacuum-sealed, it can be stored in a freezer for up to one year.
Of course, you can also purchase lobster that is not frozen. Cooking a live lobster involves a different process in some ways, though.;
, You can buy two different kinds of lobster tails, either warm-water or cold-water tails. The different tails vary in taste and quality. You can buy either frozen lobster tails or claws.

Warm-water lobster tails are not as tasty because the meat can become mushy. These tails originate from Latin America, the Caribbean, and Florida. The tails from the Caribbean have yellow spots and tails with yellow bands.
The meat in cold water tails is more desirable. It’s whiter and tenderer. However, it can also be more expensive. Cold-water lobsters come from South Africa, New Zealand, and Australia, generally. If the store doesn’t know whether the tails came from cold water, they are probably the less expensive warm-water variety.
Frozen lobster claws contain less meat and are not as desired as tails. You can find them in the frozen food section of many grocery stores.
Avoid buying any lobster tails with black spots or gray tails. The lobster probably died during the processing in those cases., It’s important to know how many people a lobster will serve to make sure that you have enough food for everyone. Lobster tails in particular are full of meat.You should also be aware that different cultures will have different preferences when it comes to cooking lobster. For example, in Canada lobster tends to be cooked longer than it is in France.
Generally speaking, you will want 1 to 1 ½ pounds of lobster for every person you are serving. You can cook lobster tails or frozen lobster claws.

, It’s absolutely essential that you thaw the tails (or claws) before you cook them. If you don’t, you are likely to end up with meat that tastes very tough.It’s a good idea to thaw the lobster for about 24 hours in the refrigerator before you cook it or at least overnight. A good way to thaw the lobster faster is to put it in a plastic bag. Then, put the plastic bag in a pot full of water, and put that in the refrigerator. You may need to change the water at least once.If you are in a great hurry, it’s possible to defrost the tails a bit in a microwave before cooking them. Although this is a better idea than cooking frozen tails, it’s not as ideal as thawing the lobster more slowly. It’s a bad idea to thaw lobster in warm water or room temperature. Lobster claws also need to be defrosted completely before cooking., Once you’ve thawed the frozen lobster, before you cook it, cut the shell down the middle of the tail’s back, using scissors.

To do this, put the point of kitchen shears or scissors between the lobster meat and the shell. Leave the tail fan in place. Lift the meat through the slit you’ve created in the top of the shell. You’ve now created what is called a “piggyback lobster tail.”
Another method is to start at the tail, and peel back the soft under shell of the lobster. Then, discard the undershell. Bend the tail backwards. If you crack some of the overshell joints, it will stop the lobster from curling while you cook it., Boiling lobster is one of the most common ways to cook it. Start by boiling water in a large pot. You want to make sure you have enough water in the pot to cover the lobster tails completely.

For each quart of water, add 1 tablespoon of salt. Place the thawed tails into the water, and cover the kettle, and let the water simmer for 5 minutes for each 4-ounce tail (and one extra minute for each additional ounce of lobster that you are cooking.)
Remove the lobster from the hot water, and place it in cold water to stop the cooking process. Drain the lobster. It’s not ready to serve. You can tell the lobster is done when the shells are bright red and the meat tender if you poke at it with a fork., Set your oven on broil. Be aware that broiling is a very fast process, so keep a close eye on the lobster to make sure you don’t burn it.

Arrange the lobster tails on a broiler pan. Place them on the pan shell side up, and then broil it for only about 4 minutes. You want to keep the lobster meat about 5 inches away from the heat.
If you are broiling very large lobster tails, you might want to split them lengthwise to make two servings from each. Turn them over. Brush with butter. Broil the other side 5 minutes more. Serve the tails.

, One healthy way to cook lobster is to steam it. You want to start by putting a half inch of water in the pot with a tablespoon of salt and a tablespoon of vinegar.

Now, put the lobsters in the pot. Cover the pot, and let them steam for 15 minutes for a 1-pound lobster. For every extra pound of lobster, add 5 minutes.
You can also steam lobsters by placing them on a rack. Boil about two inches of water in a pot that is below the rack holding the lobster. Steam the lobster for 10 minutes for every pound of lobster., Poaching the lobster allows the flavor to come out, especially when you add herbs and other seasonings into the poaching water.

To poach a lobster, prepare a poaching liquid in a pan by adding lemon, chives, onion and celery to a little water. Simmer this concoction.
In a second pan, boil water fully. Place the lobster into the boiling water for a minute or two. Then, take the lobster out of the boiling water. Put it in the poaching liquid. Cover the plan tightly. Simmer the lobster but don’t boil.
You will know it’s done if an antenna or small leg pulls away easily when you tug on it.

, To grill the lobster, find the cross that is located on the back of its head. Pierce it with a heavy knife. Cut down the back of the tail, splitting the lobster lengthwise..

Place the lobster on the grill. You will want to place the flesh side of the lobster down on the grill, and leave it there for about 8 to 10 minutes. There is no need to turn the lobster over.
Before you grill it, brush it with butter or olive oil. You could also put a metal skewer through the tails before grilling them.

, If you are cooking once frozen lobster claws instead of tails, it’s possible to bake them. First, heat your oven to 400 degrees.

Bundle the claws together. Wrap them in a pocket of aluminum foil, and place them on a cookie sheet. You will bake them for about 10 minutes.
You can tell the lobster claws are done when they look pink. Many grocery stores have lobster claws in the frozen food section.

Set the temperature to 450°F (230°C) and allow it to fully heat., Place a 9-inch (23-cm) skillet on the stove, and heat it over medium heat. Add 8 tablespoons (113 g) of unsalted butter to the pan and allow it to melt completely, which should take 5 to 7 minutes., Once the butter is melted, add 1 medium onion that’s been finely diced to the skillet. Allow the onion to cook until it is softened but not browned, which should take about 5 minutes.You can substitute a shallot for the onion if you prefer.

, When the onion is soft, add the roughly chopped leaves from 2 sprigs of tarragon and 2 sprigs of Italian parsley to the skillet. Stir well so the herbs are fully incorporated.You can substitute your favorite fresh herbs, such as rosemary, thyme, sage, or basil, for the tarragon and parsley if you prefer.

, For the stuffing, you’ll need 4 ounces (113 g) of seafood. If you’re using raw seafood, such as peeled shrimp or scallops, mix it in with the onion and herbs and allow it cook for 1 minute., After the seafood has cooked for a minute, remove the skillet from the heat. Let the mixture cool for about 3 minutes, and then mix in some kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste.If you’re using cooked seafood, such as cooked crabmeat or lobster, add in into the onion and herb mixture after it has cooled slightly.

, Add 4 to 5 inches (10 to 13-cm) of water to a large pot and place a steaming rack in the bottom. Set the pot on the stove over high heat, and allow the water to come to a boil, which should take 7 to 10 minutes.You may want to add a pinch or two of salt to the water before you boil it.

, This stuffing recipe makes enough for 2 1 ½ to 2 ½ pound (680 to 907 g) hard shell select lobsters. Slice them in half lengthwise by inserting the knife just beneath the head and cutting downward to split the belly., When you’ve cut the lobsters open, use the knife to remove the brain, heart, guts, and other innards. Don’t remove any of the meat, though., Once you’ve cut and prepared the lobsters, place them in the pot with the boiling water. Cover the pot with a lid, and allow the lobsters to steam for 10 to 15 minutes.You'll know the lobsters are finished steaming when their shells are bright red and the meat is white.
If you prefer, you can boil the lobsters instead of steaming them. Fill the pot with ¾’s of the way full with water and bring it to a boil. Place the lobsters directly in the water, cover the pot, and let them boil for 10 to 20 minutes.

, Place the seafood and herb mixture into a medium bowl. Add 1 cup (61 g) of crumbled crackers, and mix well so they’re fully incorporated.You can use any type of crackers that you like, but oyster crackers, saltines, or Ritz crackers are good options.
You can also substitute crumbled cornbread for the crackers if you prefer.

, When the crackers are fully mixed into the seafood mixture, sprinkle a little lemon juice and white wine into the bowl for seasoning. Stir well to ensure that the liquids are evenly distributed.Fresh lemon juice works best for the stuffing.

, After you’ve mixed in the lemon juice and wine, add a little kosher and freshly ground black pepper to taste. Mix well so the stuffing is evenly seasoned., When the lobsters are finished steaming, use a spoon to fill them with the stuffing where you removed the innards. Be careful not to pack the stuffing too tightly in the lobsters’ opening or they won’t bake evenly., Once they’re stuffed, set the lobsters in a roasting pan so they’re belly-side-up. Pour 1 to 2 tablespoons (15 to 30 ml) of lemon juice and a little water into the bottom of the pan so the lobsters will stay moist as they cook., Before you bake the lobsters, use 3 tablespoons (43 g) of melted butter to coat them. Lightly stroke the tops of the lobsters, including the stuffing, with the butter on a pastry brush.If you don’t have a pastry brush, fold a piece of parchment paper into a strip and use it to brush the butter onto the lobsters.

, After you’ve brushed them with the melted butter, place the roasting pan with the lobsters in the preheated oven. Allow them to bake for 15 to 20 minutes, or until the stuffing is crisp and golden and the lobster claws begin to split., When the lobsters are finished baking, use a pair of tongs to lift them out of the pan and onto a platter. Place lemon wedges around the edge, and serve."

Serve the coconut shrimp.",How to Make Coconut Shrimp1," Since the coconut shrimp will be fried, it needs to be peeled before you cook it. Remove the shell from the shrimp (you can leave the tail if you'd like) and extract the black veins that run along the shrimp's back and belly. Continue until all of the shrimp have been processed, then give them a rinse to clean off the bits of shell.






;
, To make the coconut batter stick to the shrimp, you need to dredge the shrimp in a flour mixture, an egg mixture, and then the coconut mixture. The easiest way to do this is to make a dipping station with three bowls containing the three different mixtures.









In the first bowl, mix the flour, salt, and pepper together.
In the second bowl, mix the cream and eggs.
The third bowl consists of the shredded coconut.

, One by one, dip each shrimp piece in the flour bowl, then the egg bowl, then the coconut bowl, in that order. Make sure that you coat each shrimp thoroughly before placing it into the next bowl.








, This keeps the shrimp from sticking to a plate.








, Pour the oil into a deep frying pan. Heat the oil to about 350 degrees F or 180 degrees C. Drop the shrimp pieces into the oil and fry each piece for 2 to 3 minutes.









You can test whether the oil is ready using a kitchen thermometer, or by dipping the handle of a wooden spoon into the oil; if the spoon bubbles, the oil is ready to fry.
If you don't want to deep fry the shrimp, you can fry them in a shallow pan. Fry them on one side for 1 1/2 minutes, then flip the shrimp using a pair of tongs and fry them on the other side for 1 1/2 minutes.

, Lift them from the pan with a pair of tongs. Transfer the shrimp onto paper towels to drain the oil.

, Mix the flour and spices in one bowl, the eggs and cream in another bowl, and put the coconut in a third bowl.








, One at a time, dip each shrimp in the flour mixture, the egg mixture, and the coconut mixture. Make sure each shrimp is completely coated in batter before moving to the next one.








, Grease a 9x12 glass or metal baking pan and lay the shrimp on the bottom. Make sure they aren't touching one another, or else they won't cook as evenly.








, Put the baking pan in the oven and cook the shrimp for about 10 minutes, until the top is golden brown. Remove the pan from the oven and flip the shrimp to the other side, then bake for another 10 minutes. The shrimp are ready when the second side is golden brown.









If the shrimp don't seem to be getting brown, you can use the broiler setting on your oven to cook them. Broil for 2 - 3 minutes on each side.
Don't overcook the shrimp, or they won't be as juicy. Be sure to remove them right when they're finished.

, Baked coconut shrimp are a healthy appetizer or main course. Serve them on a bed of mixed greens or with a dipping sauce such as honey mustard.

Melt the butter in a skillet.,
sauté the garlic.Add the minced garlic to the hot butter and stir-fry with a heat-resistant spatula 30 to 60 seconds, or until the garlic just begins to release a strong aroma.,
Add the shrimp.,
Splash some lemon juice over the shrimp.,
Serve warm.",How to Fry Shrimp1," Warm 2 Tbsp (30 mL) of butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat until it melts.


Olive oil can be used instead of butter for a slightly healthier alternative. Warm the olive oil over medium-high for a few minutes until it becomes glossier, but do not let the oil begin to smoke.
If the butter or oil begins to smoke, remove the skillet from the stove and reduce the heat. After a few minutes have passed, return the skillet to the stove, add more butter or oil to make up for what was lost, and watch closely to prevent it from smoking again.;
,


If starting from fresh cloves, mince two cloves of garlic.
You could also use garlic powder. Add the garlic powder when you add the salt and pepper. Use roughly 1/4 tsp (1.25 mL) garlic powder in place of the 1 tsp (5 mL) fresh minced garlic.
The garlic can be skipped completely, if desired.

, Pour the shrimp into your skillet and immediately season with salt and pepper. Cook until slightly pink and opaque.


Evenly sprinkle a generous amount of salt and pepper over the shrimp. You can add as much or as little as you would like, but if you need a starting point, try 1/2 tsp (2.5 mL) salt and 1/4 tsp (1.25 mL) pepper.






The amount of time needed for your shrimp to cook will vary depending on the size. Large strip should cook for 3 to 4 minutes, medium shrimp should cook for 2 1/2 to 3 1/2 minutes, and small shrimp should cook for 2 to 2 1/2 minutes.Occasionally stir the shrimp with a spatula as it cooks.






Do not crowd the pan. The shrimp should be able to fit in a single layer inside the skillet. If this is not the case, cook the shrimp in two separate batches, adding more butter or oil as needed to cook the second batch., Drizzle 3 to 4 Tbsp (45 to 60 mL) of lemon juice over the cooked shrimp. Let simmer for another minute or so before removing the shrimp from the heat.


The lemon juice can also be skipped, if desired.
Do not cook the shrimp for too long after adding the lemon juice. Once the shrimp becomes opaque, it is technically ready to eat. You may end up overcooking the shrimp if you let it simmer in the lemon juice for too long.

, Remove the shrimp from the heat and transfer immediately to a serving platter or individual serving dishes.

Purchase shrimp from your seafood grocer.,
Peel your shrimp (optional).,
Devein the shrimp.,
Give your shrimp a boost of flavor.",How to Grill Shrimp1," If possible, buy your shrimp the day that you plan on cooking it. Shrimp thaw quickly and can go bad even more quickly. For the best possible results, buy fresh shrimp on the day that you plan to cook them. Make sure that you buy either jumbo or colossal sized shrimp for easier grilling. Smaller varieties of shrimp are more likely to fall through grill openings.








Shrimp come in all different colors with the commonest colors being brown, greyish green, and slightly pinkish.;
, Shrimp can be grilled with or without their shells. Remove all of the shell except for the part that is around the tail of the shrimp. The tail will serve as your handle for dipping and eating the grilled seafood. Cooking with the shell on will create a more tender meat and stronger shrimp taste. Removing the shell will allow the marinade to penetrate the meat and give the seafood more taste of your spices.








Use a pair of scissors or a sharp knife to cut the shell along the back of the shrimp. Be careful not to tear the meat of the shrimp. In some cases, shrimp have very soft shells. If you find that this is the case, you can peel the shell off with your fingers.

, Use a small, sharp knife to cut down the back of each peeled shrimp. Pull out the back vein while washing the shrimp under cold water. The vein is most noticeable in jumbo or colossal shrimp. You don’t necessarily have to remove the vein, but shrimp veins are often filled with sand, meaning that they can give the shrimp a gritty texture.








If you look over your shrimp and don’t see any vein at all, it has already been cleaned by your seafood grocer.

, The favored way to do this is by marinating the shrimp. There are hundreds of kinds of marinades you can try--from spicy to pleasantly sweet and salty. Put your shrimp in a bowl and pour your marinade over them. Put a lid or foil on the bowl and let them sit and soak up the flavors of the marinade.









You can also simply brush your shrimp with olive oil to help it cook on the grill.
Rub spices on your de-shelled shrimp to give your shrimp a kick of flavor.

If you do not have a deep fryer, a heavy saucepan or large skillet could also work. Heat the oil over medium-high heat if using the stove.
Test the temperature of the oil using a candy thermometer. Periodically keep an eye on the temperature throughout the frying process to make sure that it does not rise too high or drop too low.

, In a shallow bowl with a wide mouth, use a fork to stir together the dry bread crumbs, panko bread crumbs, and salt and pepper, to taste.


You could also use a rimmed plate instead of a shallow bowl.
Panko is a type of bread crumb commonly found in Japanese cuisine. It has a light, airy texture when compared to standard dry bread crumbs, which will help make your breading seem less heavy.
If you do not have panko, however, you may use additional dry bread crumbs in its place.
If you are uncertain about how much salt and pepper to use, try 1/2 tsp (2.5 mL) salt and 1/4 tsp (1.25 mL) black pepper.

, Dunk each piece of shrimp in the egg, coating it well on all sides.Beat the egg lightly with a fork before using it.






Hold each piece of shrimp above the bowl of egg so that the excess drips off. Otherwise, the breading may stick to the shrimp in large, “eggy” clumps.






You can use your hands for this step, or you can use tongs to prevent your hands from getting slimy.

, Immediately transfer each piece of egg-covered shrimp to the bread crumb dish, turning each piece well to cover all sides.


As with the egg wash, you should momentarily hold each coated piece over the dish of crumbs to shake off any excess.

, Dip a few pieces of shrimp into the hot oil until the breading turns golden brown.


On the inside, the shrimp should be opaque.






Only fry a few pieces of shrimp at a time to avoid crowding the fryer.







, Remove the shrimp from the oil and let dry on a platter lined with paper towels. After 1 or 2 minutes, serve the shrimp.


Use a slotted spoon to remove the shrimp from the oil.
The paper towels are essential since they help absorb the oil. You could also use brown paper bag material, but paper towels are more absorbent.

, Combine these liquid ingredients in a shallow baking dish or bowl, whisking until thoroughly blended.


Make sure that the dish or bowl you use has a wide mouth. A narrow mouth will make it difficult for you to dunk the shrimp later on.
If you have a low tolerance for hot, spicy foods, use less hot sauce or leave it out completely.

, In a separate shallow baking dish, combine these dry ingredients together until well mixed.


Make sure that the dish or bowl you use has a large opening.

Choose between a grilling basket or skewers.,
Grill your shrimp.,
Remove the shrimp from the grill when it is done cooking.,Enjoy!",How to Grill Shrimp2," Shrimp can be grilled either in a basket or when they are threaded on skewers. If you choose to use wooden skewers, make sure that you soak them in water for a few hours before you start grilling--they can catch on fire if they aren’t soaked. A grilling basket needs no preparation. Whichever method you use, make sure that the device is placed three or four inches from moderately high heat.








Metal skewers don’t need to be soaked and work the same as wooden skewers.

, Keep your shrimp on the grill for five to seven minutes. You will need to turn the shrimp over halfway through the cooking process so that both sides of the shrimp get cooked evenly. Keep an on your shrimp while they cook--the outside of the shrimp should turn a nice pink color when it is cooked while the meat inside should turn white and opaque.








Be careful not to overcook the shrimp or else it might become tough and chewy (which is never a good texture for shrimp).

, Place it on a fresh, clean plate. According to the Food and Drug Administration, placing cooked seafood on a platter that once held raw seafood can cause contamination of the food. Eat the shrimp right away because it will taste best fresh off the grill.

Cook the salmon.",How to Marinate Salmon1," Salmon only needs to be marinated for about 15–30 minutes. Start preparing the marinade an hour before you plan to eat, or even less, depending on your cooking method.


Cooking methods are described at the end of this section.;
, Place the lemon on a cutting board and slice it in half. Squeeze both lemon halves over a bowl..

, Pour 2 tbsp (30 mL) olive oil into the bowl of lemon juice. Add 1/2 tsp (2.5 mL) dried thyme, and stir the ingredients together with a spoon until well mixed.


Another popular version of this marinade uses dill instead of thyme.

, Select a dish large enough that all your salmon fillets can fit into it side by side. You may need to use several dishes if you are doubling or tripling the recipe.


Alternatively, use a large zip locked bag.

, Lay the salmon fillets in the dish containing the marinade. Turn them a couple times to make sure each side is covered.


Food safety experts recommend that you do not wash raw salmon or other raw meat before preparing. Cooking the meat is more effective at killing bacteria, and rinsing the meat is likely to spread the bacteria onto your sink or other places in your kitchen.Wash your hands with soap and warm water for twenty seconds after handling raw meat.

, Unlike red meat and poultry, fish can develop an unpleasant texture during a lengthy marination process. For an acidic marinade such as this one, based on lemon juice, keep the salmon in the marinade for no longer than 30 minutes.Flip the salmon over once during this time to ensure that both sides of the fish are marinated.

, Transfer the fish to another container. Discard the remaining liquid. If you wish to use the marinade as a sauce, first bring it to a boil in order to kill harmful bacteria from the raw meat., After the salmon has been marinated, it can be prepared in a number of ways. Two popular options are grilling the salmon wrapped in foil, or baking it on a foil-lined baking sheet. In either case, cook the fillets at 400ºF (200ºC) for about fifteen minutes. The salmon is ready when a fork can easily remove flakes from the surface.


Flip the salmon halfway through the cooking process if you are grilling it.

Consider 1 tbsp (15 mL) sesame oil and 1 tbsp (15 mL) sesame seeds to match the other East Asian ingredients., Mix the flavorful ingredients together with 1/4 cup (60 mL) olive oil and 3 tbsp (45 mL) soy sauce.

, Pour the marinade into a zip locked bag or a wide dish, then place the salmon in the marinade. Refrigerate, turning fillets occasionally, for 30–60 minutes. If you continue to marinade past that point, the texture of the fish may be compromised.


Because the marinade was in contact with raw fish, it should be discarded after use, or brought to a boil before using as a sauce.

, If you like, you can create a glaze to brush onto your salmon for additional flavor during cooking. A simple glaze that pairs well with this marinade is a mixture of 2 tbsp (30 mL) honey, 1 tsp (5 mL) soy sauce, and 1/2 tsp (2.5 mL) Sriracha. Feel free to experiment with the amounts until you find a flavor you enjoy, keeping in mind the glaze may seem overpowering when tasted on its own, rather that eaten on the salmon.

, Consider pan-searing your salmon to a temperature of 125–140ºF (52–60ºC) on each side.If you do not have a thermometer, avoid overcooking by cooking only skin-side down, briefly cooking the flesh side for only 15–30 seconds once the salmon is opaque but still mostly juicy.


You may eat the skin of the salmon, or remove it after cooking.
You may also grill, bake, broil, or poach your salmon after marinading.

Serve with mustard dill sauce.",How to Marinate Salmon3," Gravlax, also called gravad lax, is a traditional Nordic dish which uses salt and sugar to cure the salmon. Various herbs are used to give flavor to the salmon, typically white pepper and dill, and the salmon is eaten raw after the curing process is finished.



Note: because the salmon is never cooked, keeping preparation surfaces and tools especially clean throughout the process is highly recommended.

, Use high-quality salmon if possible, acquired from a trustworthy source. Using farm-raised salmon is recommended, due to a lower chance of health issues. Although the chance of parasites is not high to begin with, you can reduce the risk further by freezing the salmon first, then defrosting it., Use a pair of tweezers or a small knife and fork to remove the scales and bones of the fish.Leave the dark skin beneath the scales attached to the rest of the salmon.

, These cuts allow the spice mixture to soak into the salmon, giving it more flavor and better preservation., Chop up one bunch of dill, or about 8 tbsp (120 mL), and crush 1 tsp (5 mL) white peppercorns. Mix these into 3¼ oz (85 g) sugar and 4 oz (120 g) salt.Experienced gravlax chefs will vary the ratios of these ingredients to suit their tastes, but the large quantities of sugar and salt are important so the salmon is properly cured.

, Heap the spice mix onto the salmon fillets, turning the salmon to make sure it is exposed to the mixture on all sides.

, Place the salmon in a glass or stainless steel container, touching the salmon fillets together on the pink flesh side, rather than the dark skin side.Cover completely with plastic wrap, then press the fish down with any heavy object, such as a brick.

, During this time, the salt and sugar should melt into the salmon, adding a stronger flavor.If you are not comfortable preparing raw food, you may wish to move the fish directly to the refrigerator instead, reducing the risk of bacterial growth.

, Move the salmon to the refrigerator, keeping the weight on top of it. The longer you keep it there, the stronger the flavor will be, and the drier the fish will get.Try testing it every 24 hours to see if you enjoy the flavor.

, Once the salmon has achieved the flavor and texture you prefer, take it out of the container. Scrape off all the spices, and discard any liquid that has been created., This common pairing with gravlax can be found at scandinavian food stores. Alternatively, you can make it yourself using the ingredients for the ""sauce"" listed beneath the gravlax recipe. Mix the mustards, sugar, and vinegar together first, then pour the oil slowly into the mix while stirring. Once it has reached a mayonnaise consistency, stir in the chopped dill and season with white pepper and salt to taste.Rye crackers or rye bread are another common food served together with gravlax.

Rinse the fish and slice it.",How to Make Lox1," To prepare homemade lox, you’ll need 1 ½ to 2 pounds (680 to 907 g) of boneless salmon fillet with the skin on. Run some cold water in the sink and rinse the fillet well. Next, examine the fillet to make sure that all of the bones have been removed.You can purchase either ""belly lox"" or regular ""lox"" fillets. Both are salmon, but belly lox comes from the stomach region of the fish.
The graining of fat in the stomach region makes belly lox the better option to use when you make lox because it is more widely spaced. This results in a final product that is more desirable and less salty.
If there are any pin bones left in the salmon fillet, use a small pair of tweezers or pliers to pull them out in the same direction that they’re facing.
Pin bones are more likely to occur in wild salmon than farmed salmon.;
, Once the salmon is thoroughly rinsed, use a sharp knife to cut the fillet in half. Make sure that the pieces are as equal in size as you can get them., Add 1 cup (288 g) of kosher salt and 1 cup (200 g) of sugar to a medium bowl. Mix the ingredients together well so they’re fully blended.If you like, you can also add about ¼ teaspoon (½ g) of coarsely ground black pepper to the mixture.

, Place the two pieces of salmon in a shallow dish so they’re side by side. Pour an equal amount of the salt mixture over each piece, piling it right on top of the salmon.It may seem that there is a lot of excess salt mixture on the salmon, but the fish will absorb it during the curing process.

, After you’ve added the salt mixture to the salmon pieces, divide half a bunch of dill with the stems removed between them and add it on top of the salt. Next, place one of the salmon pieces on top of the other, being careful not to knock off the salt mixture., When the salmon pieces are sandwiched together, carefully wrap them in plastic wrap. Once the fish is secure in the plastic wrap, set it in a large plastic zipper bag.Before closing the zipper bag, be sure to push all of the air out of it first.

, Set the bag with the salmon down in a shallow dish. Place another heavy dish on top of the bag to weigh it down, and refrigerate the fish for 2 to 3 days.You can use any heavy item, such as a bottle of wine, to weigh down the salmon.

, While you’re curing the salmon, it’s important to keep it from getting soggy. Remove any liquid that’s been extracted from the salmon from the plastic bag and flip the fish over so both sides are evenly weighed down., At the two day mark, begin tasting the lox. Once it has the taste that desire, you can take it out of the curing container and unwrap it.If the lox isn’t properly cured after two days, you should leave in the container for another day.

, After you’ve removed the fish from the plastic wrap, rinse it well under cold water to remove any residue. Use a sharp knife to cut it thin on the bias. Make sure to leave the skin behind.You can freeze the lox if you don’t plan to eat all of it right away. Wrap it well in plastic wrap and place it in a freezer bag for storage. You should eat it within 3 to 4 months.

Slide the knife over the smoked salmon at an angle.,
Insert a knife into the smoked salmon shallowly.,
Use a back and forth motion with the knife to slice the salmon.,
Continue slicing until all of the salmon is cut.",How to Make Lox2," If you don’t want to make your own lox, you can substitute store-bought smoked salmon. However, you must cut it properly. Place 4 ounces (113 g) of smoked salmon on a cutting board, and position your knife against the fish at a slight angle in a downward motion.Any sharp knife with a long, non-serrated blade works well for cutting the salmon. However, you can also purchase a special salmon knife that’s designed specifically for cutting smoked salmon thinly.
Make sure that your knife is as sharp as possible for the cleanest cuts.

, To create the appropriate texture for lox, it’s important to slice it as thin as possible. When you insert the knife’s blade into the fish, keep it as shallow as you can so you can create a paper-thin slice., Once you’ve insert the knife into the salmon, move the blade back and forth in a smooth motion until you’ve cut a slice. You shouldn’t have to push too hard to cut the fish, so if you feel resistance, you may want to sharpen your blade.Use the length of the knife’s blade to make a long, sweeping back and forth motion for the cleanest cuts.

, After you’ve cut the first slice, repeat the cutting process until you’ve sliced all of the salmon. Be sure to leave the skin behind as you cut, and remove any black meat that you come across."

Beat the mixture on low until it is well blended.You can also use a handheld electric mixer to beat the ingredients together in a large bowl.

, Once the cream cheese spread is prepared, take 2 bagels and use a sharp knife to cut them into rounds lengthwise. You should create 3 rounds from each bagel for a total of 6 rounds.Plain bagels are a classic option for lox and cream cheese, but you can use any flavor that you prefer.

, After you’ve sliced the bagels into rounds, use a butter knife to smooth some of the cream cheese mixture over 3 of the rounds. Add a slice of lox to each round on top of the cream cheese mixture.You can add some capers to the lox and cream cheese if you like.

, Once you’ve added the lox, top each of the bagel pieces with the remaining 3 rounds to create sandwiches. Serve the bagels with lox and herbed cream cheese alongside some light salads or hearty soup."

Steep the leaves for five minutes. Alternately, use tea bags and follow the package directions to make one cup (240 mL) of tea. Pour the tea through a fine mesh sieve, into a blender, food processor, or bowl.Jasmine tea, green tea, or Earl Grey tea are commonly used to marinate salmon. The type of tea you choose depends on your preference.;
, Pour in vinegar, salt, and a chile pepper or chili powder. Add maple syrup, ginger, and garlic, if desired. Whisk or blend the ingredients until smooth.If you’re using a blender or food processor and want to cut down on the time it takes to marinate, blend in a cup of ice cubes.Wear rubber or plastic gloves when handling hot peppers. If hot pepper comes in contact with your bare hands, wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water.

, Leave the skin on the filets, and cut each filet in half, if desired. Place the filets in a resealable plastic bag. Dump the tea mixture over the salmon. Close the bag and allow it to marinate in the refrigerator; turn the bag occasionally.If you blended ice into the marinade, let the salmon soak for 30 to 45 minutes. Otherwise, let it marinate for at least an hour.

, Cover the plank with water. Drain the plank of excess water before grilling., Put medium-hot charcoal around the inside edge of the grill. Put the plank on a rack above the coals until the wood crackles and smokes, about five minutes.If you’re using a gas grill, preheat the grill, then reduce the heat to medium. Place the plank on the grill rack until it crackles and smokes, about five minutes.

, Place the marinated salmon filets, skin side down, on the plank. Discard the marinade sauce, or place it back in the refrigerator to cook later as a topping for the salmon. Sprinkle 1/2 teaspoon (2 mL) chili powder over the filets, and 1/4 teaspoon (1 mL) crushed tea leaves, if desired., For a charcoal grill, put the plank in the center of the rack. For a gas grill, move the plank to the unlit side of the grill. Cover the grill and cook the fish until it flakes easily with a fork. For the last four minutes, flip the filets and cook the skinless side.Once finished, you can peel off the skin, if desired. It should separate easily from the filets.

, Drizzle honey over the filets. Alternately, if you saved the leftover marinade, bring it to a gentle boil in a saucepan until it reduces by two-thirds. Pour the cooked marinade over the filets. Top the salmon with chopped, fresh chives, if desired., Serve salmon on top of salad, such as arugula and avocado. Salmon pairs well with cheese, so you can make a tossed side salad with iceberg lettuce and Parmesan or blue cheese. Try tossing any in-season vegetables in olive oil and red wine vinegar to accompany your filets. Another option is to braise or broil greens – such as asparagus or string beans – in garlic., A bed of rice is a common compliment to salmon. Crispy potatoes offer a nice contrast in texture to salmon filets. Although quinoa is a seed, it’s also a source of starch, and pairs well with salmon. Thickly-sliced, crusty bread spread with garlic butter is another tasty option to serve with salmon., Try white whine or an India pale ale (IPA). Strong hop and hints of pine go well with cedar plank salmon. For a non-alcoholic drink, try iced tea, or sparkling water mixed with herbs and/or fruit., Place the salmon in a shallow, airtight container, or wrap it securely with plastic wrap or heavy-duty aluminum foil. Store the salmon in the refrigerator for up to three to four days. You can freeze the salmon indefinitely, but it will taste best if you reheat and eat it within two to three months.If you notice that the salmon has become milky, slimy, or has a spoiled odor, you should dispose of it rather than eat it."

Prepare your lobster tails for cooking.,
Remove the meat from the shell or cut the shell for ease of cooking.",How to Cook Lobster Tails1," If the tails are frozen, you'll need to thaw them out before you cook them. (You could cook them frozen in a pinch, but they won't be as tender). When the lobster tails are thawed, you should easily be able to touch the head of the lobster tail to the end of the tailflap. To thaw:









Put them in the fridge for 10 hours or so. If you plan ahead, this method of thawing is the most effective.
Place in cold, not hot, water, for 30 minutes to one hour. Change the water every 15 minutes so that it doesn't get progressively colder as the lobster thaws.
As a last-ditch effort, thaw them in the microwave on defrost. Be very careful if you choose this method, because you don’t want them to start cooking in the microwave. Only defrost one minute at a time on low or defrost power.;
, Of course, if you don't want to remove the lobster meat from the tail, then skip this step. How you intend on cooking the lobster could affect how you prepare the meat and whether or not you remove the meat from the tail:










Broiling or baking: Let the meat ""piggyback"" on top of its shell. This is where you cut all but a tiny bit of the meat out of the shell, lift it up, and then place it on top of the shell. Makes for quicker baking and a really pretty presentation! See more below.

Grilling: Cut the tail completely in half or leave the tail whole. Grilling usually involves high heat, in which case the outer shell actually protects the meat from overcooking. See more below.

Boiling: Most cooks leave the meat in the shell until the lobster is finished cooking. Then, if the cook desires, he or she can cut the top of the lobster shell to make eating easier. See more below.

Pan searing: Remove the meat from the shell entirely. You'll be able to adjust the heat settings, being able to cook just the meat. See more below.

"
"
Set the oven to 375° F (190° C).








,
Prepare the meat by letting it ""piggyback"" on top of its shell.,
Season the tail as necessary.,
Cook the lobster according to the weight of the tail.,
Slightly before the tails are done cooking, cook under the broiler for 1 or 2 minutes (optional).,
Serve with clarified butter and lemon.








",How to Cook Lobster Tails2,", In order to do this, you shouldn't rip the tail meat completely from the tail. Instead:









Cut the shell lengthwise with a knife or a pair of kitchen shears, starting at the head of the tail. Be careful not to cut completely down the length of the tail, leaving the tailflap (the very end of the lobster) and an inch of shell above it intact.
With your hands, pry the tail meat from the membranes in the shell. Start with the thickest meat at the head of the tail. Separate all meat from the shell except an inch or so near the tailflap.
Lift most of the meat out of the shell, close the shell under it, and let the meat rest on top of the shell. The tail meat should look like it's piggybacking on top of its own tail.

, Some ways that you could season the lobster include:









Olive oil, paprika, salt, and pepper.
Lemon juice, salt, pepper, and dill.
Butter, salt, and pepper.

, Cook approximately 1 1/2 minutes for each ounce of meat. This would mean:









An 8-ounce lobster tail would cook at 375° F for 12 minutes.
A 10-ounce lobster tail would cook at 375° F for 15 minutes.
A 12-ounce lobster tail would cook at 375° F for 18 minutes.

, Put a pat of butter on each tail,or brush melted butter on them, place at least 6 inches (15.2 cm) underneath the broiler, and cook, keeping a close eye on each lobster tail.








,"
"
Clean the grill so that any food, debris, or char is removed before cooking.








,
Turn the grill on medium heat or set up a charcoal chimney if cooking with charcoal.,
Cut the lobster tail in half, lengthwise, or leave in shell.,
Brush the lobster tails with butter or oil and season appropriately.,
Grill each side for 3 to 5 minutes.,
Serve with clarified butter and lemon.








",How to Cook Lobster Tails3,",









If using a charcoal grill, once the charcoal is fully lit, scatter them in your grill so that there is a hotter area and a cooler area. Having one uniformly hot area will make it harder to cook the lobster.

, If you've decided you want to cut the lobster in half, get a clean break so that you have two smaller halves of lobster for each tail. Leave the meat in its shell.








, Many people like to add lemon juice as well.








, Start with the meat side down before flipping over to the shell side. You may need to cook the shell side a bit longer than the meat side for perfect doneness.









Make sure that the tails do not burn — if there are any flames on the grill, move the lobster away from them.
The tail meat is cooked when it's turned opaque and is no longer translucent.

,"
"
Bring 6 to 8 cups of salted water to boil in a large pan for approximately 4 lobster tails.,
Leave the lobster in its shell.,
Drop the tail(s) in the boiling water and reduce to a simmer.








,
Cook for about 1 minute per ounce of tail meat.,
Once the lobster is cooked, crack the shell open with kitchen shears to make it easier to eat (optional).,
Serve with clarified butter and lemon.








",How to Cook Lobster Tails4," Be generous with the salt, but don't add more than a couple tablespoons.








, It's customary to leave the shell on the lobster if you're boiling it. The shell will help impart flavor and make sure the meat of the tail doesn't fall apart while cooking.








,, For example, 10 oz. of tail meat needs to cook for 10 minutes. If you are cooking with 4 tails that each weigh 10 oz., don't cook the tails for 40 minutes; cook for 10 minutes!









If you are cooking a lot of tails (4+), add a minute or two on top of the original cooking time.

, You can also do this with a knife, but be careful not to break apart the lobster meat as you cut through the shell.








,"
"
Remove the meat from the tail by cutting lengthwise down the entire tail, but not cutting meat in half.,
In a non-stick pan, heat 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) of olive oil or butter over medium heat.








,
Place the tail meat in the skillet and cook approximately 3 minutes each side, depending on the size of the fillet.,
Serve with clarified butter and lemon.








",How to Cook Lobster Tails5," Pry meat from its membrane gently. You should get a whole piece of tail meat that's lightly cut on top.








,, The second side might need a little less time to cook.

Boil the leftover shells into lobster stock.",How to Clean a Lobster," Most people boil the lobster alive or immediately after death, with no prepping in advance. Transfer it to an ice bath as soon as it's done cooking, and you're ready to process it.


If your recipe calls for raw lobster meat, instead put the live lobster on its belly and kill it humanely with a small, sharp knife where the head meets the body.Clean the raw lobster as described below, but do it over a bowl to catch raw juices, and rinse the meat before cooking it.See these instructions for frozen lobster.;
, Twist the claws off of the lobster or bend them back until they snap. If you have a hard shell lobster, break off the tip of the claws with a nutcracker, scissors, or the back of a heavy knife.Push the meat out from the hole you made down through the ""wrist"" opening. If you have a soft shell lobster, just extract the meat with your finger., The knuckles between the claw and the body are tiny, but the tasty meat inside is worth it. Break these off the claw and crack them open with a nutcracker., Uncurl the tail and flatten it out. You can remove by twisting the tail and body in opposite directions, or by pulling the tail back toward the head until it snaps off.

, The fan at the end of the lobster tail consists of five flipper-like segments (a central ""telson"" and four ""uropods""). Pull these segments off or cut them off with a chef's knife. There's a tiny bit of sweet meat inside each one, which you can get at with a lobster fork or by breaking the shell., Removing the tail fan leaves a narrow hole at the tip of the tail. Push your finger or a lobster fork into this hole to push the meat out the other end, where the tail once met the body.Alternatively, put the tail upside-down on the table. Slice through either side of the shell with a pair of shears or strong scissors. Peel off the underside of the shell and remove the meat., The dark vein running down the tail contains the lobster's waste. Peel or slice this off and throw it away. It might be hiding under a flap of meat., If you have a female lobster, you might see roe — eggs — inside the tail shell. This turns pink when cooked, which gives it the name ""coral.""


Raw lobster eggs are black. Steam them for a couple minutes until they turn pink before eating., The tail and claw hold the tastiest meat, but there's plenty in the lobster's body as well. Pull the shell off by hand or crack it open.

, If you want every last bit of meat, press the meat out of each leg with a rolling pin, starting at the tip. If the lobster is cooked, you can instead place the end of each leg in your mouth and pull the meat down with your teeth while sucking., These are pale, feathery objects on the side of the lobster's body.Take care not to remove the meat in between them., Pull out and throw away the gritty ""sand sac"" just behind its eyes., This soft, green substance serves as the liver and pancreas. Not everyone finds this appetizing, but some people add it to sauces or spread it on bread.However, if the lobster's diet includes toxins, they accumulate in this organ. If you want to stay on the safe side, limit adults to one lobster's tomalley per day, and keep it away from children.Discard the tomalley if there is a shellfish ban in your area due to PSP (paralytic shellfish poison). If the lobster consumed toxic shellfish, the poison accumulates in the tomalley, but the meat is safe.
If you are harvesting a raw lobster, the tomalley will be grey and very perishable. Keep it ice cold and cook it as part of a sauce within a few hours of killing the lobster., Fish out the little chunks of meat around the ribs. Discard the papery shells between them., Simmer them for no more than 45 minutes. Overcooking them can ruin the flavor.Do not include the sand sac or gills in the stock.

Although other warm water parts of the world have animals called lobster-rock and spiny, for example-only the cold waters off the New England coast are home to true Maine lobsters.
Maine lobsters are distinctive do to their large claws that are full of meat. The rock and spiny lobsters have no claws, so their tail only produces meat.
Maine lobsters molt from July through October and some of the animals caught during this time are known as ""soft-shell."" There is less meat in a soft-shell lobster and, therefore, they are usually less expensive than the hard-shelled. Many people, though, believe that the meat of the soft-shell lobsters is more sweet than that of the hard-shell.;
,


In general, the typical Maine lobster is about 1 1/4 to 1 3/4 lbs. (.6 to .8 kg), although they are available in smaller or larger sizes.
If you are in need of a specific amount of lobster meat, you should estimate that 5-to-6 lbs. (2.3-to-2.7 kg) of soft-shell lobster and 4 1/2-to-5 1/2 lbs. (2-to-2.5 kg) of hard-shell lobster will yield 1 lb. (.5 kg) of meat.

,


If you have a reputable seafood purveyor near you, you can probably buy a Maine lobster there. Many markets have large tanks where the lobsters live until they are bought. Always be sure to buy a lobster that is active and moving its legs energetically. Reject any animal that seems limp or is barely moving.

,


Many lobster pounds in Maine and other New England states will ship freshly caught lobsters to you using dry ice and overnight shipping. This will cost more than buying them from a seafood market, but you can be sure the lobsters are very fresh.

Serve the lobsters whole.",How to Cook a Lobster1," Live lobsters may be available in your grocery store, at your local fishmonger or if you're exceptionally fortunate enough to live in a lobster fishing area, right off the boat that caught them. Look inside the lobster tank for lobsters that seem healthy and active. Avoid lobsters that are too still or have holes or black marks on their shells.;
, Add 2 tablespoons of coarse salt for each quart of water, and bring the water to a quick boil.

, One at a time, pick up the lobsters by the body and plunge them headfirst into the boiling water. Cover the pot with a lid.


Do not allow the water to overflow. If there isn’t room in the pot for all the lobsters you bought, cook them in two or more batches.

, Once the water has come to a boil again, begin timing the cooking of the lobsters. One-pound lobsters should cook for about 15 minutes, 1 ½-pound lobsters for 20 minutes, and 2-pound lobsters for 25 minutes. The lobsters are finished cooking when their shells have turned bright red. Remove them from the pot and set them on a plate on their backs to dry and cool. This keeps the juices in the lobsters.


It’s important to time the cooking, since lobsters may turn red before they are fully done.

, Place each lobster on a dinner plate for serving. Serve each lobster with a small cup of melted butter, a nutcracker for cracking the claws, a lobster pick and a bowl for the discarded shells. See How to Eat Lobster for a tutorial on which parts of the lobster are good to eat.

Serve immediately.",How to Broil Lobster Tails," If working with whole fresh lobsters, you will need to briefly parboil the lobsters in salted water before removing the tails.


Salt a large stockpot of water and bring it to a boil over high heat.
Add the lobsters and cook for 2 minutes.
Use a sharp knife to cut off the tails.
Return the bodies and claws to the boiling water for another 10 to 13 minutes to finish cooking them.;
, If working with frozen lobster tails, thaw them overnight in your refrigerator and rinse them well in cool running water.


Rinse the lobster tails under running water and pat dry with clean paper towels.

, Use a sharp knife or sharp kitchen scissors to cut out a section of the lobster shell.Begin cutting along the length of the tail just right of center. Cut from the open end all the way down to the base of the tail.
Move the knife of scissors roughly 1 inch (2.5 cm) to the left and make an identical cut on the left side.
Make a final horizontal cut at the base of the tail, connecting the two lengthwise cuts.
As you cut, make sure to keep the blade close to the top underside of the shell. You can cut into the meat slightly, but you do not want to cut through it completely, nor do you want to slice into the bottom of the shell.
Remove the cut piece by peeling it away.

, Lightly rinse the cut lobster tails under cool, running water to remove any bits of lobster shell that may have stuck to the meat.


Pat dry with clean paper towels when done.

, The digestive tract is the dark line that runs from one end of the tail to the other, across the entire length.


To remove the digestive tract, slide the tip of your blade directly under one end of the dark line, cutting it free while keeping it attached to the rest of the tract.
Grip the digestive tract between your index finger and thumb and gently peel it up and back. Trim it off at the end with your blade.
Note that this is only optional. You can leave the digestive tract in place, if desired, and it should not affect the taste of the lobster tail. Removing it is mostly done for aesthetic purposes.

, Use your fingers to sever the lobster meat from the bottom and sides of the shell. Lift it up and rest it on top of the shell.


Slide your fingers along the side of the meat and underneath it, starting from the wide end of the tail.
Loosen all of the meat except for a small portion at the small end of the tail.
Lift the meat, intact, through the opening in the shell. Let it rest gently on top of the remaining shell.
By keeping the meat above the shell, you allow the heat to circulate through all sides of the meat more evenly.

, Add the butter and heat it over medium-high until completely melted.


Once the butter melts, proceed to the next step. Do not wait for the milk solids to separate from the butter. In other words, if the butter begins to smoke or if white foam appears on the surface, you have left it on the heat for too long.

, Stir the garlic continuously for 1 minute, or until it becomes lightly toasted and fragrant.


Watch the garlic as it cooks. It can burn quickly, and if it does burn, you will need to toss out the contents of the pan and start over to avoid contaminating the flavor.

, Remove the skillet from the heat and stir the bread crumbs in, coating them completely with butter and garlic.


Keep stirring until the bread crumbs are thoroughly moistened. The butter should be completely absorbed when done.

, Stir well until thoroughly combined.


Keep stirring until the cheese is slightly melted and the parsley seems evenly distributed throughout the mixture.

, Set the stuffing aside and prepare to broil the lobster.


Note that you should not prepare a butter sauce if you plan on using stuffing, and vice versa.

, Place the butter in a saucepan and heat over medium until it becomes foamy.Once the butter melts and takes on a white, foamy appearance, the solids have begun to separate from the liquid portion of the butter.
Skim and discard the foam on the top of the butter. You are, essentially, creating clarified butter.

, Mix well until completely combined.


The garlic powder should be dissolved and the lemon juice must be well incorporated into the butter. Mix the garlic and juice into the butter while the saucepan is still on the heat, stirring it with a mixing spoon for another 1 minute or so.

, Set the butter sauce aside and prepare to broil the lobster.


Note that you should not prepare stuffing if you plan on using butter sauce, and vice versa.

, Meanwhile, arrange the lobster tails on unheated broiler pan rack.


The broiler will need to preheat for 5 to 10 minutes in order to get adequately hot. Most broilers only have an “on” setting, but if you have a broiler with “high” and “low” settings, set it to “high.”
If you do not have a broiler function on your oven, set the bake temperature to 500 degrees Fahrenheit (260 degrees Celsius). Give it 15 to 20 minutes to preheat completely.
Keep the tails in a single layer. Do not stack them together.

, Sprinkle the meat evenly with paprika, salt, and black pepper.


The paprika, salt, and pepper, can be used even if you are using a butter sauce or a stuffing, or they can be used without either option.

, If you prepared a butter sauce, brush it evenly over the exposed meat of the tail using a pastry brush.


Rub the butter sauce over all sides of the meat, including the bottom. Lather a large amount on the top, however, so that the top of the meat browns better in the broiler.

, The meat should turn opaque, as well. This will usually take about 10 to 11 minutes.


Precise broiling times vary depending on the weight of the lobster. It takes roughly 1 minute to cook every 1 oz (30 g) of lobster tail.
The lobster tails should be placed roughly 4 to 9 inches (10 to 23 cm) away from the upper broiler coils of the oven.
Watch the lobster tails carefully as they broil. When they overcook, they take on a rubbery texture.
Once finished, the lobster meat should reach an internal temperature of 145 degrees Fahrenheit (63 degrees Celsius). This can be checked with an instant-read meat thermometer.
Note, however, that if you plan on stuffing the lobster tails, you will need to remove them from the broiler roughly 1 minute before they are done.

, If you made stuffing for the lobster tails, spoon it in equal amounts into the space between the flesh and the shell. Continue broiling for 30 to 60 seconds, or until the stuffing turns light brown.


Shove the stuffing into the slits of the shell and beneath the meat. It should be fairly well packed.

, The lobster tails should be removed from the oven and transferred to individual serving plates while still hot.


You can also serve the lobster tails with wedges of lemon on the side for a pretty display.

",How to Make Salmon Cakes," Take three 6-ounce (170 g) cans of salmon that have been well drained, and dump them in a large bowl. With a fork, gently break the salmon apart into flakes.Red or pink salmon works best for the cakes.
Make sure that the cans you’re using contain skinless, boneless salmon.;
, After you’ve flaked the salmon, mix 1 ½ cups (355 g) of cracker meal into the bowl. Stir until the ingredients are well combined.Instead of a fork or spoon, it may be easier to combine the salmon and cracker meal with clean hands.
You can substitute seasoned or plain bread crumbs, panko, or crushed Saltine crackers for the cracker meal.

, Once the salmon and cracker meal are well mixed, add 2 large eggs that have been beaten, 2 rounded teaspoons (10 g) of Old Bay seasoning, half a red bell pepper that’s been finely chopped, a handful of fresh chives that have been chopped, 2 to 3 tablespoons (30 to 45 g) of chopped fresh dill, 1 teaspoon (5 ml) of cayenne pepper sauce, and the zest from 1 lemon. Combine all of the ingredients until they are thoroughly mixed.If the mixture seems too wet as you’re mixing, you can add a little more cracker meal.
You can add other vegetables and seasonings, such as minced onions, chopped green bell pepper, minced garlic, and chopped fresh parsley, to the cake mixture to suit your tastes.

, When the salmon mixture is well combined, use clean hands to shape it into patties that are approximately 3-inches (7.6 cm) in diameter and 1-inch (2.5 cm) thick. You should be able to make approximately 8 to 10 cakes.If possible, allow the cakes to chill in the refrigerator for about a half hour before cooking to help them firm up.

, Add 1-inch (2.5 cm) of vegetable or canola oil to a large, heavy-bottomed skillet, and turn the burner to medium. Allow the oil to heat for approximately 3 to 5 minutes., Carefully place the salmon cakes in the skillet, making sure that they’re in a single layer. Allow them to cook until they’re browned, which should take approximately 3 to 4 minutes per side.Depending on the size of your skillet and the amount of cakes that you make, you may need to fry them in more than one batch.
Use a wide spatula or fish turner to carefully flip the cakes when it’s time to cook the other side., Once the cakes are browned on both sides, use a spatula to remove them from the pan. Place them on a plate or tray lined with paper towel to drain the excess oil.Before serving the cakes, you may want to squeeze the juice from the lemon that you zested over them to help brighten their flavor.

, Set your oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit (200 degrees Celsius) and allow it to fully preheat. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil, and grease it with oil or a nonstick cooking spray to prevent the cakes from sticking.Be sure that you know how your oven indicates that it’s preheated. It may beep or flash an indicator light to alert you.

, Set the salmon cakes on the greased baking sheet in a single layer. Use a pastry brush to lightly dab each cake with canola, vegetable, or olive oil so they’ll brown nicely as they bake.Instead of a baking sheet, you can use a small muffin tin to bake the salmon cakes. Make sure the tin is lightly greased, and scoop approximately ⅓ cup (78 g) of the salmon mixture into each.

, Place the salmon cakes in the preheated oven, and allow them to bake for 20 to 25 minutes. Halfway through the baking time, flip the cakes over so they brown on both sides.You’ll know the salmon cakes are done when both sides are golden brown.

Wash the tails under cool water.,
Cut a ""window"" out of the shells.,
Prepare the butter marinade.,
Dress the lobster tails.,
Broil the lobster tails.,
Serve the lobster.",How to Broil Lobster1," The easiest way to make broiled lobster is to pick up some lobster tails, either frozen or fresh, from the supermarket or your local fishmonger. Lobster tails are the meatiest part of the lobster. You can certainly broil the other parts, too, but if you're looking for an easier preparation experience, you can't go wrong with tails.


If you choose fresh lobster tails, keep them refrigerated until use.
If you buy frozen lobster tails, thaw them in the refrigerator overnight before using. This will help ensure they cook evenly.;
, Just before you're ready to broil the lobsters, preheat the broiler. If your broiler operates inside the main part of your oven, place the oven rack in the center of the oven to ensure even broiling.

, Wipe them clean with a paper towel.

, Use a sharp pair of kitchen scissors to cut a rectangular window shaped-piece along the top curve of the lobster tails. This exposes the flesh so that it will cook thoroughly under the broiler. Don't remove the shell entirely: just cut away a section that's a few inches wide and runs the length of the lobster tail.


You can use a knife to do the job if you don't have a pair of scissors. Try a serrated knife, which is less likely to slip on the slick lobster shell.
If you prefer, you can simply make one cut along the length of the tail, then pull the shell halves apart with your hands to expose the flesh.

, Since lobster meat dries out pretty quickly when it cooks, it's usually broiled with flavored butter to keep it moist. The most important ingredient in the butter sauce is the butter, of course - and it can be flavored any way you like. To make a delicious basic butter sauce, mix the following ingredients together in a bowl:


1/4 cup melted butter per lobster tail
1 minced garlic clove per lobster tail
Salt and pepper to taste

, Place them flesh-side up in a small roasting pan that will catch all the drippings. Pour the butter sauce over the lobster tails, allowing it to pool inside the shells.

, Put the baking pan under the broil and cook the lobster tails for 10-12 minutes. The lobster tails are ready when the flesh is opaque in the middle and the butter has browned. Remove them from the oven.


If the flesh still looks a little translucent, the lobster tails aren't ready yet. Broil them for another 2-3 minutes and check again.
Don't overcook the lobster - the meat could become a bit rubbery. Be sure to check after 10-12 minutes to see if the lobster is done.
As a general rule, broiled lobster requires 1 minute per ounce of meat to cook properly.

, Broiled lobster tails are delicious with extra butter sauce, a squirt of lemon juice and a sprinkling of fresh herbs such as dill or chives. Serve the lobster immediately after cooking for best results. The meat can be left inside the shell for presentation or may be taken out.

Dress the lobster with a butter marinade.,
Broil the lobster.,
Serve the lobster.",How to Broil Lobster2," Look for live lobsters tanks at the supermarket or buy them from your local fishmonger. Be sure to look inside the lobster tank for lobsters that look vibrant and healthy. Avoid lobsters that are too still or have holes or black marks on their shells.

, This is the recommended method for prepping a live lobster before you broil it. Boiling the lobster kills the fresh lobster quickly and ensures the meat gets thoroughly cooked, which is harder to do with broiling alone.To parboil the lobster, do the following:


Fill a large pot three quarters full with water. Add 2 tablespoons of salt for each quart of water. Bring the water to a full, rolling boil.
One at a time, plunge the live lobsters into the water headfirst. Cover the pot with a lid.
The length of time you boil the lobsters differs according to how much they weigh. A one-pound lobster should cook for 3 1/2 minutes, a 2-pound lobster for 5 1/2 minutes, and a 3-pound lobster for 7 1/2 minutes.
Submerge the parboiled lobster in an ice bath to stop the cooking.

, Just before you're ready to broil the lobsters, preheat the broiler. If your broiler operates inside the main part of your oven, place the oven rack in the center of the oven to ensure even broiling.

, Use a sharp knife or a pair of kitchen shears to split it form the head to the tail. Remove the coral and tomalley, which look like greenish horseradish. These are the intestinal materials. While they're edible, they aren't pretty, so people often remove them for the sake of having a prettier presentation. Rinse the lobster to clean off the smaller bits.


If you want to broil the claws as well, crack them so that the heat from the broiler can reach them more easily.

, Put the lobster flesh-side up in a roasting pan. In a bowl, mix together 1/4 cup of butter (per lobster) 1 clove of minced garlic per lobster, and salt and pepper to taste. Pour the mixture over the lobster to keep the meat moist while it cooks.

, Place the roasting pan under the broiler and cook it until the flesh is opaque and the butter has browned. Depending on the size of the lobster, it will take 10-12 minutes. Broiled lobster requires about 1 minute per ounce to cook properly. Remove it from the oven.


If the meat starts to look dry while the lobster is broiling, dress it with more butter to keep it from overcooking.
If the meat still looks translucent after 12 minutes, return it to the broiler for another 2-3 minutes.

, Place the whole lobster on a plate to serve. Garnish it with lemon juice and a sprinkling of chipped dill, parsley or chives. Whole broiled lobster is usually served in the shell for a striking presentation.

A reef that looks alive is teeming with life and has healthy coral. Except for slipper lobsters, lobsters will not be found in sandy areas.;
, Use a boat; a dinghy will do for calm to moderate conditions.

, Avoid the dusk, night and dawn hours. For subsistence fare, the day hours are clearly sufficient.

, Lobsters can be found in waters from ten feet deep and deeper. Most people should not go deeper than 30 feet (9.1 m).

, This rope is for the divers to get a sense of bearing and should be knotted at intervals to signify depth.

, Discuss your working depths, cinch on your weight belts and slip calmly into the abyss. Strive to relax to keep from hyperventilating, and soon you will recall the cold and darkness of the deep.

,, Going past 10 feet (3.0 m) in depth, it gets dark, even in the day carry a small flashlight at the very least. Be careful how you use the flashlight to avoid vision problems. After a while your vision will adjust to the darkness of the depths.

, Often, they will be partially in a hole, so beware of the vicious moray eels. The eel and the lobster strangely coexist. The three-pronged spear serves a second purpose: coax the lobster into the open with it, so the lobster can be grabbed.

Choose fresh or frozen shrimp.,
Choose shrimp with or without shells.,
Devein the shrimp.",How to Cook Shrimp1," Most markets carry both fresh and frozen shrimp.


If you choose fresh shrimp, the flesh should be translucent white and the shell should be light grey. Be sure the shrimp is not leaking liquid.
Frozen shrimp comes either precooked or uncooked. These cooking methods are for uncooked shrimp.

, Fresh shrimp are often sold pre-peeled. If you buy shrimp with shells, you will have to peel them yourself.


Shrimp can be peeled either before or after cooking. Many find it easier to peel cooked shrimp. Cooking with the shells on also helps preserve the flavor.
To peel shrimp, grasp the legs and tear them off. Open the shell along the inner curve of the body and remove it.
Shrimp shells can be used to make shrimp stock.

, Devein the shrimp after they have been peeled. It's easier to devein shrimp before they are cooked.


Use a sharp paring knife to cut a slit along the outer curve of the shrimp's body. The cut will reveal a dark brown or black vein, the shrimp's digestive tract. Use your fingers, a fork or the paring knife to lift it out of the shrimp and discard it.
The vein is not unhealthy to eat, but many people prefer not to.

Bring a large pot of water to just to a boil.,

To the water, add:

1/4 cup cider vinegar
Pinch of salt
Seasoning. Zatarain's Shrimp Boil seasonings may be used, or Old Bay seasoning, or a combination of both. Either use a small box of Zatarain's, 3 to 4 tablespoons of Old Bay, or a box of Zatarain's with 1 tablespoon of Old Bay.

;
, This helps turn the water into more of a broth or brine, which you'll then sink the shrimp into.








, Most chefs agree that cooking the shrimp with the heads and shells on, while annoying to peel, makes the shrimp tastier and more flavorful.If desired, de-vein the shrimp before you place them in the pot to cook.








, There is no set time for boiling shrimp, but smaller shrimp (50+ per pound) will take around 2 to 3 minutes, while larger shrimp (~30 per pound) will take around 5 to 7 minutes. This is only a guideline however.









If you feel like you want to check for doneness, shrimp is cooked when the thickest part of the flesh is opaque.
Take care not to overcook the shrimp. Overcooked shrimp become tough and rubbery. Remove the shrimp from the heat as soon as a few begin popping up to the top of the water.

, Just submerge the colander in the ice bath and take out immediately. This will more or less stop the shrimp from overcooking.








, Enjoy!

Don't transfer the females if it causes the eggs to fail.,
Keep watching if the young shrimp won't eat.,
If all the shrimp die after putting them in the tank, use different water or introduce the shrimp more slowly.",How to Breed Ghost Shrimp," Your fish tank should hold about 1 gallon (4 L) of water for each shrimp.No matter how many you have, ghost shrimp will be most comfortable in at least 10 gallons (40 L) of water.


If you have to keep your shrimp in a tank smaller than 10 gallons (40 L), allow 1.5 gallons (6 L) or more for each shrimp to make up for the small space.;
, The hardest part of breeding ghost shrimp is keeping the young shrimp alive. If you let the eggs hatch in the same tank as the adult shrimp, the young could be eaten by the adults. This second tank doesn't need to be as large as the first, but a larger tank will give the young shrimp the best chance at survival., Filters are necessary to keep aquarium water clean. Most filters suck the water in to clean it, but these can kill the tiny ghost shrimp young. Use a sponge filter instead to avoid this possibility.If your tank is larger than 10 gallons (37.9 L) and contains fish as well as shrimp, you should use a hang-on or canister filter to provide better cleaning. Never use anything besides a sponge filter for the breeding tank.
If you don't want to buy a sponge filter, you can cover your filter's water intake with a sponge or a piece of nylon stocking. Alternatively, if your filter intake is too weak to suck in adult shrimp, you can disconnect the filter before the young hatch and replace 10% of the water volume in the tank every day until the young are fully grown and you can turn the filter on again., Like most aquarium pets, ghost shrimp need air pumped through the water in order to breathe. Without an air pump, the water will run out of oxygen and the shrimp will suffocate.

, Sand or light gravel will keep the shrimp transparent, while dark gravel will cause them to develop small specks and make them more visible.Pick any color and type you like.


For additional detail in setting up a freshwater aquarium, see this article.

, Many places treat tap water with chlorine, so treat it with a dechlorinator or chloramine remover to make it safe for animals. At the very least, leave it out for 24 hours before adding the shrimp so some of the chlorine will evaporate.

, This is the broad range of temperatures ghost shrimp are comfortable in, but many people prefer to stick near the center of this range.Put a thermometer in the tank to check the water temperature, and use an aquarium tank heater if you keep the shrimp in a cold room.

, Ghost shrimp feed off the debris that falls from plants, but you can keep them with just store-bought food if you'd prefer not to deal with plants. Aquarium plants with fine, thin leaves are the best to use, such as hornwort, cabomba, and milfoil. If kept in a tank with other fish, small flower pots or other containers should be placed upside down to provide hiding places only the shrimp can enter.For best results, give your plants about a month to stabilize the chemical levels in the tank. Sudden changes in nitrogen levels or other chemicals could kill your ghost shrimp.
See this article for instructions on planting aquarium plants.
Adding plants to the breeding tank in advance is strongly recommended, as plant debris is one of the few foods small enough for the shrimp young to eat. Many people use Java moss in their shrimp breeding tank, which may trap food debris to help the young shrimp eat., ""Feeder shrimp"" are bred to produce high numbers of young, but they tend to be more fragile and have shorter life spans.Well treated ghost shrimp should live for a couple of years, and will be much easier to care for and breed.


The seller should know which type of ghost shrimp he sells. You can also guess based on the living conditions: if the shrimp are kept in a cramped space without many plants, they are probably feeder shrimp.

, Float the bag of water with the shrim inside on top of the tank's water. Every 20 minutes, dispose of 1/4 of the water from the bag, then replace it with water from the tank. After you've done this three or four times, pour the bag out into the tank. This lets them adjust to the temperature and chemical change slowly., Shrimp are active scavengers, but while they can live off algae and plant debris if required, you should encourage reproduction by giving them a minuscule daily allotment of fish food. A single crushed pellet a day can sustain six adult shrimp.If you keep other fish in the tank, use sinking pellets, since the shrimp will not be able to compete for floating food with larger animals.

, Even if the water looks clear, chemicals could be building up that prevent the shrimp from thriving. Change 20-30% of the water every week for best results. Make sure the water temperature of the old and new water is the same to avoid stressing the aquarium's inhabitants.


Changing 40-50% of the water every other week may also work, especially if the tank doesn't have many fish or shrimp for its size.

, Almost any medium to large fish will eat ghost shrimp, or at least spook them enough to make breeding difficult. If you want a more varied tank, add snails and small fish only.


If you have decided not to use a breeding tank, do not include any fish at all in the single tank you have. The adult shrimp will already eat many of the young shrimp; with additional predators, not many young will survive to adulthood.

, Adult female ghost shrimp tend to be much larger than males. The size difference is significant, so you should be able to tell the difference easily once your shrimp are full grown.You don't need equal numbers of each. One male for every two females is plenty., If you've cared for your ghost shrimp properly, the females should produce eggs every few weeks at least. These are bunches of 20–30 tiny green-grey eggs attached to the females' legs. These legs, or ""swimmerets"", are short limbs attached to the lower body of the female, so it may look like the eggs are attached to the female belly.Look from the side of the tank for the best view, and get someone with sharp eyesight to help you if the babies are hatching before you see the eggs.

, Give the males a chance to fertilize the eggs, then transport the females. Use a net to catch the females and quickly move them to the prepared breeding tank without other shrimp or fish. Move the breeding tank nearby and transfer directly if possible; females have been known to drop their eggs when stressed, so don't make the transfer prolonged.

, Keep checking on the female to watch the progress of the eggs. Near the end of the process, you might be able to see tiny black dots within each egg: these are the baby shrimps' eyes! When the eggs finally hatch, the female will swim upwards and flick the young off of her legs a few at a time.Don't disturb the female if you see her flicking the young away, as they need to be deposited within an hour in order to feed. She may take a while to do this, since in the wild the young have a better survival rate if she deposits them in different places., After she is done depositing the hatched young, move the female back to the other tank. The parent is no longer needed in the young shrimp's life, and in fact may attempt to eat her children.


Once the young shrimp are alone and moving about on their own, you may not even be able to see them, as they are extremely tiny when newly hatched. Continue to add food to the breeding tank for three weeks even if you don't see them.

, For the next week or two, these shrimp will float around in the larvae stage, and have extremely tiny mouth parts. Your breeding tank should already have plenty of plants and algae to provide debris small enough for them to eat, called ""infusoria"". You should still supplement this with any of the following types of food, but remember the shrimp only need tiny amounts:


Storebought ""rotifers"" food, baby brine shrimp, microworms, or powdered spirulina algae are all suitable for young ghost shrimp.You can buy ""fry food"" intended for young fish, but be sure to select powdered fry food suitable for ""egg layer"" sized animals.Strain small pieces of egg yolk through a fine mesh strainer if you don't want to use storebought food.Java moss may help trap food for young shrimp to eat, but don't add or remove plants while larvae are in the tank, as it could disturb the chemical balance of the water.

, The surviving larvae will enter the juvenile phase, and look just like miniature adults. AT this point they can feed off regular food, although you may want to crush pellets and other large food items to help them out.

, The shrimp will grow all their legs and develop into miniature versions of the adults after 1 to 2 weeks.After 5 weeks, they will be fully grown and can be transported back to the other tank.


If you have a younger batch of eggs or larvae in the breeding tank, move the larger shrimp out after 3 to 4 weeks.

, Transferring the females to the breeding tank can stress them out and interfere with the adult's and eggs' growth. If the females drop the eggs or die after transfer, alter your main tank instead to take care of the young there:


Remove any fish from the main tank. Since you won't be using your breeding tank after all, you can move them there, altering the plant composition if necessary to suit the species.
Turn off or cover the filter. If your filter has a water intake pipe, it will suck in and kill the young shrimp. Cover the intake with a sponge or piece of nylon stocking, or turn it off and clean the water manually by replacing 10% of it every day until the young are grown.
Accept that some young shrimp will be eaten by the adults. You can reduce the chance of this happening by using a spacious tank, but it will be difficult to avoid.

, The floating larvae may not eat much directly after hatching. If they are still ignoring their food the next day, you should try a different food immediately, as they can starve quickly., You may need to use tap water treated with a dechlorinator, or even bottled water. Do not use rainwater or local river water unless ghost shrimp live in the river you took it from.You should never pour the bag of water with the shrimp directly into the tank. See Caring for Adult Shrimp for instructions on introducing your shrimp.
You may also want to purchase an aquarium test kit to test the characteristics of your water. See the Tips section below for the correct pH, dH, and chemical levels for ghost shrimp.

Store shrimp properly.",How to Clean Shrimp," All shrimp should be kept refrigerated between 32 and 38 F. Raw shrimp should be consumed within 48 hours of purchase, while cooked shrimp should be consumed within 5-7 days.Frozen shrimp is usually good for up to 5 or 6 months.Cooked shrimp should be firm, pinkish-white, and should not have a strong fishy odor. Some cooked shrimp will have head, legs, carapace, and shell all attached, while others will have some combination of these.
Raw shrimp should be firm, translucent, and somewhat shiny, with no noticeable odor. Most of the time, raw shrimp will have the legs and shell, and often the head attached.
Frozen shrimp, cooked or raw, should be defrosted in the refrigerator overnight, before attempting to clean or devein them. It's also possible to remove the number of shrimp you plan to use, and defrost them in cold water, in a bowl, in the sink.It should only take 20-30 minutes.;
, Place shrimp in a colander, washing them thoroughly with cold water. Inspect the shrimp closely for signs of spoilage while you're rinsing them, and discard any that appear slimy, discolored, or which smell overly fishy.


Only rinse and defrost shrimp in cold water, no warmer than room temperature. Shrimp cook very quickly, and running them through hot water will result in gummy, rubbery shrimp.

, Pinch the head between your index finger and thumb, just where it meets the body, and hold the body firmly with your other hand. Pinch and twist the head, until it comes free.


Not all shrimp come head-on, and some people prefer leaving them during cooking, to help flavor the meal. They're fine to eat, if a little strange. If the thought makes you squeamish, remove them.
Discard the heads into a separate bag from your household trash or a plastic storage bag and take out quickly, or it'll start to smell. You can also save heads for making homemade seafood stock.

, After the head has been removed, turn the body ""belly"" up, facing you. Grasp all the legs firmly in your fingertips, tearing them down toward the tail and pulling them free. They should come off relatively easily, but you might not be able to get them all at once. Go back and pull any stubborn legs individually.

, At this point, there are a few different ways to proceed, all effective, depending on whether you've got raw or cooked shrimp. The most common way of removing the shell is to start where the legs were removed, peeling the shell back along the sides of the shrimp, like you were opening its jacket.


Use your fingernail, or a small paring knife to get the carapace started, pull it back and off the shrimp in segments. If you prefer, you can also start where the head was removed, pulling the shell off down the back ridge of the shrimp. Equally effective.
Alternatively, you can use your knife to cut along the curved back ridge of the shrimp, where the vein will be, cutting through the shell to separate and remove it along the sides. Since you'll need to remove the vein of raw shrimp anyway, it's common to use this method for raw shrimp.

, More often, shrimp is cooked with the tail on, depending on how you want to cook it. It's also fine to remove the tail, pulling it off. You can use a small knife to slit along the underside of the tail, if you have trouble getting it off.

, Along the back ridge of the shrimp there is a dark vein, which is the shrimp's intestinal tract. With a deveining knife or a paring knife, this can be removed by cutting into the shrimp, straight along this ridge, just deep enough to reach the vein to pull it out.


You don't need to cut down very far – just until you reach the vein (about halfway through the shrimp).
Tease out the vein with the tip of your knife, then grab it with your fingers and pull it back toward the tail of the shrimp. It should come loose easily. Make sure it's all removed.

, Rinse the shrimp in cold water to remove any loose shell bits, or gunk from the inside of the shrimp. It's usually best to cook raw shrimp right away, after cleaning, or you can store them loosely in the refrigerator for up to 24 hours until you want to cook them.


Shrimp should be stored in the fridge, between 32 and 38 degrees F, in cling wrap or in an airtight container.

Buy an approximately 10 ounce (283.5 g) salmon filet from your local meat counter. Buying fresh salmon will result in a better omelet than canned or frozen salmon.;
,


Find a sharp knife. Skinning salmon with a dull blade is both difficult and dangerous.
Hold 1 end of the salmon filet with your fingers. Insert your knife between the skin and the meat at a 45-degree angle at the end you are holding the salmon. The edge of the blade should be angled toward the skin.
Move the salmon back and forth on the knife. This should cut the salmon easily if your knife is sharp. You should not have to move the knife at all-just the filet.

,


Slide your fingers over the top of the skinned salmon until you discover the line of bones. Take each bone out with tweezers or your fingers.

,


Choose a pan that is between 6 inches and 10 inches (15.24 cm and 25.4 cm) in diameter. Any larger and the omelet will spread too thin. Any smaller and the omelet will be too thick to fold.
Make sure the frying pan is a non-stick pan. Even though the egg will be fried using vegetable oil or butter, a non-stick pan is essential to ensure proper flipping and removal.

,


Chop an onion and green pepper into fine pieces.
Cut the salmon into chunks. Use the same sharp knife you employed for filleting to cube the salmon into half-inch (1.27 cm) pieces.

,


Heat the pan on medium high for 1 minute.
Place 1 tablespoon (14.125 g) of butter into the hot pan and let it melt.
Pour the onion, green pepper and salmon cubes into the pan and sauté them for 2 to 3 minutes. Move the fillings into a small bowl and set it aside.

,


Crack 2 to 3 large eggs into a mixing bowl and beat thoroughly.
Add 2 tablespoons (29.6 mL) of milk into the bowl and continue to whisk until air bubbles form.
Place another tablespoon of butter into the same pan as before.
Pour the egg/milk mixture into the pan and let the eggs cook for 1 minute.
Lift the edges of the egg patty periodically to let uncooked egg into the bottom.

,


Spoon the salmon, onion and green pepper onto one side of the egg in the pan.
Cover the fillings with shredded cheese.
Fold the omelet in half, and place a lid on the pan for about 1 minute for the cheese to melt and the egg to finish cooking.
Remove the omelet from heat, turn off the stove and serve.

, Place the fish on its side on a large cutting board. Hold the tail down with one hand, and with the other insert a fillet knife into the vent, or the anus, located on the underside of the fish near the tail. Pull the knife from the vent along the belly toward the head, and stop just between the gills.


Make sure you're using a sharp knife to make the cut. You should not have a make a sawing motion; the cut should be clean.
Take care not to actually cut deep into the vent or belly, since the organs inside may contain bacteria that could contaminate the fish. If your initial cut is too shallow, you can go back and make a deeper cut.
If you do cut into the organs, rise the liquid off immediately. Make sure it flows out of the fish, rather than deeper inside.

, Start at the backbone above the pectoral fin. Press your knife down until you can feel the spine, then make a downward cut that extends behind the pectoral fin and ends at the belly.


Don't cut too deeply, since you want to avoid damaging the organs.
Gently lift the meat to make sure it is detached from the head area. You should be able to lift a flap from the side of the fish. If it's still attached to the head, use the knife to cut it away.

, In a similar fashion, start the cut at the bellow below the pectoral fin. Since you're coming at it from the other side, extend the cut in front of the fin and end it at the backbone. Lift the flap of meat to make sure it is no longer attached to the head.

, Use a heavier, sharper knife, rather than the fillet knife, to make a cut straight through the background just behind the head.


The intestine will still be attached to the vent. Use your knife to cut it cleanly.
The head, internal organs, and pectoral should come off in one piece. Discard them.
A serrated knife makes it easier to cut through the backbone.

, The long, dark red organ along the salmon's backbone is its kidney. Use the fillet knife to carefully cut it away and lift it from the fish.

, Use a large knife (preferably serrated) to saw off the dorsal and caudal fins, then discard them.

, With the salmon resting on its side, insert the fillet knife at the end where the head used to be, just above the backbone. Begin using a gentle sawing motion to cut through the ribs and separate the meat from the contoured spine.


Don't cut too far away from the backbone, since you want to preserve as much meat as possible in the fillet.
Cut until you reach the tail. Make a perpendicular cut across the tail and lift the fillet from the salmon.

, Turn the salmon over and insert the knife where the head used to be, just above the backbone. Use the same technique to saw through the ribs and remove the meat from the spine, creating a second fillet. When you reach the tail, cut the fillet away from the body and set it aside.

, Lay the fillet skin side down on the cutting board. Insert the fillet knife just underneath the first few ribs. Slowly work the knife under the ribs, angling it toward the thicker part of the fish and toward the tail, to loosen a thin flap of meat containing the ribs. Continue until you have removed the ribs, then discard the flap.


Don't cut too deeply underneath the ribs, or you'll lose too much meat. Cut as closely underneath the ribs as possible, so you only remove a thin layer of meat attached to them.
Repeat with the second fillet.

, Extract the remaining small rib bones near the tail end of the fillet with needle-nosed pliers.

, Some consider this portion of the meat to be too strong in taste. Simply slice it off and discard.

, Salt may be added to remove superficial impurities from the meat.

, Do not let the meat sit out for too long, or it will spoil. You can also freeze the meat in freezer bags for up to six months.

, The backbone and head may be saved to make a broth for soup or risotto.

, Put the fish trimmings, entrails, and carcass in a tied-off plastic bag and toss in the garbage.

The fresher and fattier the salmon, the better your gravlax will taste, so choose the highest quality salmon possible.


Check the salmon's labeling. Look for sustainably-sourced salmon that was not previously frozen. It's easier to find this while salmon is in season during the summer months. Salmon that has been frozen and thawed will not taste as good after curing.
To make enough for eight servings, get a two-pound salmon filet with the skin still attached. The flesh should be bright orangish-pink and firm. The skin should look bright and shiny, not spotted or damage.
Buy the salmon the same day you're planning to start the curing process, if possible. Store it in the refrigerator until you're ready to use it.;
, It's increasingly popular to rub alcohol over the fish before coating it in a cure. Using vodka, bourbon, rye or another alcohol is not traditional when it comes to the lox you'd get in a deli for your bagel, but it can add a lot of depth during the curing process. If you wish to use alcohol, you'll only need a few tablespoons, enough to rub over the entire filet before you coat it in the cure., The most basic ingredient of a salmon cure is salt. Salt draws the moisture from the fish's flesh, changing the taste and texture and acting as a natural preservative. Sugar, spices and citrus zest may be added to provide extra flavor. Start with a basic cure the first time you cure salmon, then consider getting creative and adding your favorite spices and alcohol for a different flair the next time around. Use the following ratio of ingredients for one two-pound piece of salmon:


1/2 cup kosher salt (not table salt, which can negatively affect the flavor)
3 tablespoons white sugar
3 tablespoons of the fresh chopped herbs of your choice, like oregano, dill, basil, fennel or a combination
1/2 tablespoon white pepper
Optional: 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) lemon zest

, When you're ready to star the curing process, remove the salmon from the refrigerator and rinse it in cool water, then dry it thoroughly with paper towels., The salmon will need to be tightly wrapped in plastic as it cures. Tear off a few large sheets of plastic wrap and place them on a baking sheet. Lay the salmon fillet skin-side down in the center of the plastic.

, Gently press into the flesh of the filet with your fingertips to feel for tiny pin bones. They're usually located near the center of the filet. It's important to remove these before curing the salmon, since they'll interfere when it comes time to slice it up. When you come upon a bone, use a needle-nosed plier to pry it from the flesh, taking care not to damage the filet too much as you do so. Discard the bones when you're finished.

, Time to apply the alcohol and cure mixture to the salmon to begin the curing process. Use enough to cover the filet on both sides. Err on the side of using too much instead of too little, since you can always rinse off the excess flavoring later.


Rub the salmon with alcohol. Use a tablespoon or two of the alcohol you chose to cover the salmon on both sides. No need to rub it in with pressure; instead, just smooth it over the surface.
Apply the cure. Use a spoon to sprinkle a good coating of the cure mix over the entire filet. Flip it over and put more on the other side.

, Lift the sides of the plastic wrap and wrap up the salmon so that it's tightly covered with no air holes. You may want to get another piece of plastic wrap to make sure the wrapping is secure.

, Place a second baking sheet over the first one. Nest it in so it's sitting directly on top of the salmon. If you don't have a sheet that fits perfectly, find another flat-surfaced pan or dish to do the job. Put a heavy bowl, a brick, or heavy canned goods on top of the entire contraption. This will compress the cure ingredients into the salmon, creating the right conditions for it to cure.

, During this time, do nothing to the salmon except wait patiently while it cures. Most chefs recommend three days of refrigeration, though some recipes specify curing for two. It's a matter of taste, so if you prefer salmon that's less salty, go for two instead of three., Remove it from the refrigerator and take off the plastic wrap. Rinse the fish under cool running water, washing away the salt and other cure ingredients. If you skip this step, the fish will taste too salty.

, Use a very sharp knife to cut thin horizontal slices from along the top of the salmon (rather than slicing it vertically as you would a steak). Gravlax has a strong flavor, so thinner slices are more palatable. The salmon is now ready to enjoy.


Taste the salmon for flavor. If you find it too salty, give in an extra rinse before continuing to slice it.
The classic way to serve gravlax is with a fresh bagel, cream cheese, sliced red onion and capers. It also makes a great topping for salads, pizzas, crostini, pasta and more.

, Brush the fillets with just enough olive oil to coat them. The oil helps the fish to stay moist inside the dry heat of the oven. Add salt and pepper to taste, over the olive oil.

, Salmon can be baked without a sauce, but it absorbs flavor well and a sauce can help the salmon stay even more moist. You can create a basic sauce by whisking together the yogurt, honey, mustard, and dill in a small bowl.

, The salmon does not need to soak in the sauce, but you should try to spread the sauce evenly over the top of each fillet.

, Like all fish, salmon cooks quickly. It should be ready within about 20 minutes. Test the fish with a fork when you pull it out of the oven. If the salmon flakes easily in looks opaque, it should be ready.

Choose wet cured salmon.,
Choose dry cured salmon.,
Cure by injection.",How to Buy Smoked Salmon1,"

Wet cured, or brined, salmon is the process by which salmon (usually the fillet) is immersed in a combination of water, spices, sugar, salt and possibly sodium nitrite (to preserve the color) for several days. This allows the cells of the flesh to fill with moisture, so that the smoking process doesn't leech out all the moisture. Wet cured smoked salmon is moist and flavorful.;
,

The method of dry curing salmon prior to smoking is how it was traditionally done in Europe. The salmon fillets are fully covered in a combination of sugar, salt and spices. Dry cured and smoked salmon tends to be drier and silkier than wet cured salmon. Dry cured salmon is typically made in smaller batches and tends to be the more expensive of the cured smoked salmon.

,

Salmon fillets that are injected prior to smoking cure the fastest of the 3 options, but injecting brine into the delicate flesh of the salmon can damage it. The result is a cheaper, but more easily mass produced, cured salmon ready for smoking.

Set the salmon steaks on the hot grill.,
Serve plain or with sauce.",How to Cook Salmon Steaks1," If you are speaking to a butcher or fishmonger, ask that the steaks are the same thickness, so that they cook uniformly.;
, Although this step is not essential, this is the best way to create a richer flavor before placing your salmon on the grill. A good marinade ratio is one part acid to one part oil to one part aromatics/hers, along with salt and sugar to taste.


For example, try combining 2 tbsp. of white vinegar with 2 tbsp. of olive oil and some sugar, dill weed, salt and pepper to taste.
Alternatively, you can use one part hoisin, miso or soy sauce along with one part sesame oil for an Asian marinade.
Use one part olive oil, one part lemon juice and one part (several cloves) crushed garlic and salt for a simple fresh marinade.

, Place the salmon steaks inside and seal it. Refrigerate the bag for one hour.


Turn the bag once to ensure you salmon is well coated in the marinade.

, Consider coating the grill with oil before you grill to stop salmon from sticking. Do not do this over an open flame or the grease will splatter.

, Do not pat the salmon or the marinade will come off.

, Close the cover. Cook for five to seven minutes on each side.


Cooking time will depend upon how you like your salmon-rare, medium rare or well done. If the fish flakes and has no pink coloration, it is well done.

Buy whole salmon fillets when preparing baked salmon.,
Leave the skin on the fillet and bake skin-side down.,
Set the oven temperature between 325 ºF/175ºC and 375ºF/190ºC.,
Cook the salmon fillet in a covered, oven-proof baking dish.,
Check the fish often, as cooking times vary, widely depending on the equipment used and the size of the fillet.,
Use a meat thermometer if available.",How to Bake Salmon1," The flesh can range in color from a pale pink to a deep red, depending on the salmon species available. A salmon fillet is cut in half lengthwise down the middle of the fish. The pink flesh is exposed on one side, and the skin (typically scaled) on the opposite side.


Depending on your location and the time of year, you may find Atlantic, Coho, Chinook, Sockeye, and King, wild, farmed, fresh, or frozen. Each option features subtle differences in taste, texture, and appearance.;
, Cooking fish with the skin-side down helps retain its moisture during the cooking process. This is especially important when baking salmon, as it tends to dry out easily.

, The right temperature depends on the recipe used and the size of the fillet being baked. Set the oven to the lower end of the temperature range for smaller fillets and the higher end for larger fillets. Cooking the fish at too high or too low of a temperature will dry it out.

, Keep the fish covered during the process, as it helps the fish retain its moisture and speeds up the cooking time.

, A small fillet may only require 25 to 30 minutes, while a large fillet could take 40 to 60 minutes to bake.

, A meat thermometer can be purchased at most grocery or kitchen stores, and it takes the guesswork out of baking salmon. Insert a meat thermometer into the thickest portion of the fillet and remove the salmon from the oven when the temperature reaches 140ºF/60ºC.

Choose cold smoked salmon.,
Choose hot smoked salmon.",How to Buy Smoked Salmon2,"

The majority of smoked salmon is cold smoked. After being cured, the salmon goes into the smokehouse, which is kept at between 70 and 90 degrees F (21 and 32 degrees C). The fish is hung over slow burning wood coals, which help to flavor the fish as it smokes. The low temperature doesn't cook the fish, but it does take up to 3 weeks to fully cold smoke fish. Cold smoked salmon is more perishable than hot smoked fish.

Hot smoked salmon is prepared much the way cold smoked salmon is, but the difference is that the heat at which it is smoked is higher. The heat can range from 120 F to 180 F (50 C to 80 C), but it requires less time in the smoker. Hot smoked fish is typically smoked for less than 12 hours. Hot smoked salmon is drier than cold smoked salmon, and often has a smokier flavor.

",How to Bake Salmon2," Although you will be wrapping the salmon in parchment paper, the oven doesn't need much extra in terms of heat. Cooking salmon or any other type of fish, in parchment paper is a very efficient way of baking, and almost fool-proof. Cleaning up the surface of where your baking is as easy as throwing away a piece of paper.

, When cooking en papillote, it's generally best to:


Leave the skin on the fillet and bake skin-side down.
Rinse the fillets in cold water, dabbing the fillets dry with paper towels or letting air-dry.
Season with salt and pepper.

, Place the parchment on a baking sheet. Center the salmon fillet onto one side of the parchment paper.

, Baking en papillote is an opportunity to cook vegetables and other seasoning along with the fish. Here are some combinations that work well with salmon that you might want to consider:



Lemon, capers, and rosemary. Lemon and salmon is a classic, as is the addition of tangy, briny capers. Add some fresh rosemary to the mix for a burst of life.

Asparagus, lemon, and onion. Chop up some asparagus and add it in with the salmon, complementing with lemon and red onion. The onion will turn out sweet and the lemon will help the salmon taste light and moist.

Dill and lemon. Dried dill has a very mild, almost-anise flavor, making it a perfect complement to the salmon if you don't want to overpower it. Don't forget the lemon juice!

Tomatoes, zucchini, and mushrooms. For a heartier dish, try adding these summer vegetables. (No need to cook them first.) A spritz of lemon or an entire lemon wedge is never a bad addition to a combo like this.

, After you've decided on your seasonings and vegetables, drizzle a bit of olive oil onto the salmon. A tablespoon of white wine will help keep the salmon and vegetables moist and flavorful.


Butter will work as a substitute for olive oil. For a deeper flavor, add a tablespoon of butter into the parchment instead of olive oil.

, Fold the parchment over the salmon, creating a triangle. Starting at the bottom, fold the edges of the parchment over, creating several overlapping sections. This will make a seal, allowing the salmon and any vegetables to cook in their own juices.


Do not tape the parchment paper together. While you want a good seal on your fish, you do not want to completely capture all the air inside the parchment. A small amount of escaped air is fine.
Do not fold the parchment too tightly. Leave ample room in the paper chamber for the salmon and vegetables. Your parchment should be snug without being cramped.

, You want the salmon fillet to be opaque and flaky. Translucent, reddish flesh means the salmon has not yet fully cooked.

, Transfer all ingredients to a separate platter, or simply cut open the parchment and serve as is.

The Atlantic Ocean is home to only one kind of salmon, Atlantic salmon. Atlantic Salmon are usually farmed, and the fish are fed a diet that can be full of growth hormones and coloring agents to turn the flesh pink. They are mass produced and fairly inexpensive. This kind of salmon also tends to have higher levels of PolyChlorinated Biphenyls, or PCBs, which are a highly toxic industrial chemical. The Environmental Defense Fund suggests consuming no more than one meal per month consisting of Atlantic salmon. Atlantic salmon is available all year long.;
,

Chinook salmon are also known as King or Blackmouth salmon and they are the largest of the Pacific salmon. The flesh is very red and this variety has one of the highest levels of Omega 3 fatty acids, which are valued for their nutritional benefits. This fish is usually only wild caught, and it is typically only available May through August.

,

Also known as Keta salmon, this fish is available June through September. The flesh is firm and mild. Chum salmon range the mid to upper Pacific Ocean from California to Canada and all the way across to Siberia. Due to this wide harvest area and the fish's abundant numbers, keta salmon is often widely available and at more moderate prices.

, These salmon are harvested or caught between July and October. They are found from British Columbia to Alaska, and they are a mild but flavorful fish.,

These are a smaller variety of salmon that is seen in supermarkets from May through July. The flesh is mild and sweet, and it is a popular salmon choice in seafood restaurants.

It’s ok if the head and tail overhang a little. Line the baking sheet with two layers of aluminum foil that are each a little longer than the sheet.You can also use a roasting pan or fish kettle to cook the salmon.;
, Clean the potatoes under running water and scrub them with a vegetable brush to remove dirt. Pat them dry with a towel or paper towel. With a knife, slice them into rounds that are a quarter-inch (0.6 cm) thick.You can also use a mandolin to cut the potatoes.

, Arrange the potato slices on top of the aluminum foil on the baking tray. Start with a single layer, and then overlap the potatoes if necessary. Drizzle them with some olive oil to coat the top layer.

Sprinkle the top of the potatoes with salt and pepper.

, Take half the dill and half the parsley and place it in a bowl. Use a zester or grater to zest the two lemons. Add the zest to the bowl with the herbs and toss to mix.Cut open one of the lemons and squeeze the juice over the herbs. Toss to coat.

, Place the salmon on the cutting board. Open the slit in the belly that the fishmonger made when removing the organs. Pat the inside of the belly dry with paper towel. Pat the outside with a fresh paper towel as well.

, With your knife, score the skin of the salmon by making six angled cuts from the back to the belly. The cuts should be about an inch (2.5 cm) deep. Turn the fish over and repeat on the other side.

The point of scoring the skin is to give you a place to stuff the herbs, dressing, and vegetables., Transfer the fish to the baking sheet, laying it diagonally across the potatoes. Take the remaining dill and parsley and stuff it inside the salmon’s belly. Sprinkle salt, pepper, and the herb-lemon mixture into each slash you made in the skin.

Sprinkle the top of the fish with the carrots, onions, celery, and garlic.
Drizzle the white wine over the top of the fish and vegetables., Curl the edges of the foil up and around the fish and potatoes to make a little lip around everything. Place the fish in the oven and bake for 15 minutes.

If it feels warm, the fish is ready., Fire up the grill or barbecue to high heat, around 400 F (204 C).Lay out three large sheets of aluminum foil that are big enough to hold the salmon, plus some extra for folding.

Place the salmon on the three layers of foil. Fold up the edges of the foil around the salmon on all sides to make a lip.

, Whisk together the soy sauce, chili sauce, ginger, and garlic in a medium bowl. Use the zester to zest the lime, and add that to the bowl as well. Cut the lime in half and squeeze the juice into the bowl. Add the brown sugar and whisk to combine all the ingredients., With a sharp knife, score the skin of the salmon by making four shallow cuts on one side of the body, running from the back to the belly. Drizzle the dressing into the slits and onto the skin of the fish. Finally, sprinkle the fish with the chopped green onions., For a wood or charcoal grill, move the hot coals to either side of the grill so the salmon will cook over indirect heat. For a gas grill, turn off the gas to one side. Place the salmon on the grill away from the heat. Close the lid and cook the salmon for 25 to 30 minutes.

To determine if the salmon is done, look at the color of the flesh. It should be pink inside with lighter colored edges.
If you have a meat thermometer, 120 F (49 C) is rare and 130 F (54 C) is medium., When the salmon comes out of the oven or off the grill, set it aside to rest for five to 10 minutes before you cut it. This will give the meat time to relax, and will help make the salmon juicier., Once the fish has had time to rest, you can remove the skin. Start by opening the foil surrounding the fish. Gently peel away the skin from the fish. If there is any grey flesh on the salmon, carefully scrape it away with a spoon., With a spatula, carefully lift the fish from the foil and transfer it to a serving platter. Use a spoon to scoop up any juices left in the foil and drizzle them over the fish.For salmon that was roasted with other vegetables, arrange the vegetables (such as potatoes and carrots) around the fish on the platter.
You can serve the fish whole like this and slice it into individual portions at the table.

, Use a sharp knife to cut the fish into individual portions. Cut off the head and tail if they're still attached. Then, cut the salmon into horizontal or widthwise steaks. Each steak should be about a half-inch (1.3 cm) in thickness.Transfer the portions to individual plates, and serve some of the vegetables and juices with each portion.

Use a cleaver or a chef's knife to cut the fillet into 4 even portions. Hold the knife at a slight angle with the cutting edge of the blade facing away from you when making the cuts. You should have 4 relatively even portions of fish weighing approximately 8 oz. (225 g) each.





;
, Crack the egg in your hand and let the egg whites, but not the yolk, slide through the spaces between your fingers into the mixing bowl. Discard the whites and reserve the yolks in a separate container.


Beat the egg yolks. Using a wire whisk, whip the egg whites in a mixing bowl for 1 to 2 minutes or until light and foamy. Squeeze in the juice from 1 lemon. Whip slightly to mix the juice and the yolks, and set aside.







, In a small mixing bowl, combine 1/4 cup (55 g) of almonds, sliced and chopped; 1/4 cup (55 g) of panko; 1 tbsp. (15 g) of dill; 2 tbsp. (30 g) of parsley; 1/2 tsp. (5 g) of sea salt; 1/4 tsp. (2.5 g) of white pepper; and 1/4 cup (55 g) of flour. Mix the ingredients using a small fork or spoon, and set aside.


Place the egg wash and the container with the mixture of chopped nuts, herbs, panko, flour and seasonings side-by-side on a clean, flat surface. Place a portion of salmon into the egg wash, making sure it is well coated on all sides.






Place the salmon into the breading mixture, making sure that the portion of fish is well coated and set aside. Repeat this process until each portion of fish has been evenly breaded on each side.







, Place a large skillet or frying pan on medium heat and add 1 tbsp. (15 g) of olive oil. Wait a few moments for the oil to heat up and place the breaded salmon fillets in the skillet. Turn the salmon once the almond crust has turned a deep, golden brown.


Reduce the heat to low and continue cooking until the salmon is only slightly translucent in the center of the portion. The salmon will continue cooking during plate-up and will be finished by the time it is served. This will ensure that the salmon is not over cooked and dried out.

Buy farmed salmon.,
Buy wild salmon.",How to Buy Fresh Salmon2,"

Farmed salmon is the term for the mass raising of salmon. These salmon are kept in small pens and fed diets containing hormones, dyes and antibiotics. They are often grown in deplorable conditions which facilitate the spread of disease and lice among the fish population. This salmon, however, is widely available and inexpensive. You should not consume farmed salmon more than one time per month due to the high level of chemicals in the fish.

,

Wild caught salmon is the most expensive of all the kinds. This is because the fish are allowed to grow at their own pace in a natural environment until caught or harvested. The harvest of wild salmon is strictly monitored and regulated with the aim of stabilizing or increasing the number of available fish. Wild salmon from Alaska is considered to be a sustainable harvest, due, in part, to the strict regulations and the fact that the fish is allowed to reproduce as naturally.

Remove excess water from the surface of the tuna.,
Heat oil in a pan on the stove.,
Add the steaks to the pan.,
Sear on each side for 1-2 minutes.,
Remove tuna from pan and serve.,
Optionally, cook vegetables and garnishes in the leftover juice.",How to Sear Tuna1," Cut your tuna into even-sized steaks if it isn't already divided this way. Pat each steak gently with a paper towel on both sides. The steaks don't need to be bone-dry, but you don't want any excess water beyond the natural moistness of the meat.


Water will turn to steam in the hot pan, effectively steaming your meat rather than searing it. This keeps you from getting the crispy, caramelized exterior you want.;
, Use medium-high or high heat for about five minutes or until pan starts smoking. Add cooking oil to the hot pan. It should start to shimmer immediately. Use canola oil or another oil with a high smoke point — not olive oil.The key to getting a good sear is cooking at high heat for a short length of time. Cooking at too low of temperature won't give you the crispy texture you want and cooking for too long will risk drying out the inside of the meat.

, Season the steaks lightly on both sides with salt and pepper to prep them for cooking. Carefully add the steaks to the hot pan. Lay the steaks away from you to protect yourself from getting sprayed with the hot oil. The meat should begin to sizzle immediately.

, As mentioned above, the key to searing is to cook hot and fast. Let each side cook without disturbing it for about 90 seconds. At this point, peek underneath and look for a brown, crispy exterior. This is a sign to flip. Cook the other side for the same length of time.You can adjust the cooking time somewhat as needed based on the thickness of your steaks. For example, if you have an especially-thick steak (over an inch or so thick), you may want to cook in the area of 2-3 minutes.

, Once the outside of the tuna is crispy and well-browned, the fish is ready to eat. Sprinkle the steaks with one tablespoon of the lemon juice for added flavor. When the meat cools slightly, cut it into strips by slicing against the grain of the muscle. This severs the tough muscle fibers, making the meat more tender.Note that it's not especially important for the inside of the meat to be all the way done. In fact, most restaurants will deliberately leave the inside of tuna steaks very rare — unlike fattier fish like salmon, cooking tuna all the way through tends to dry out the meat.
Good-quality tuna is safe to eat seared with the inside rare. If you're worried about the possibility of disease, use a cooking thermometer. Most cooking resources recommend an internal temperature of about 125 degrees F (51 degrees C)., Now, if you wish, you can prepare an easy and healthy side by cooking vegetables in the pan until soft. In the recipe above, ginger and scallions are recommended, but there are many other good choices — it all depends what you have in the fridge.


To make this side, toss the scallions in the pan with the ginger, adding a little more oil to prevent sticking. Cook until clear and soft. Add the soy sauce, rice wine, and remaining lemon juice. Cook for one minute. Season with salt and pepper and serve over the steaks."

Combine marinade ingredients in bowl.,
Set tuna in marinade to soak.,
Sear marinated meat as normal.,
Baste each side of the meat with extra marinade as desired.",How to Sear Tuna2," Making a marinade is easy. All you need to do is mix ingredients and seasonings that you like. The recipe above will make you a delicious soy-orange marinade, but you can easily make your own. A few guiding rules for making your marinade are below:Marinades almost always contain at least one fat and one acid. The fat is generally oil, while the acid can be vinegar, citrus juice, wine, or another acidic ingredient.
In addition to this, most marinades have a few other ingredients to give the meat added flavor or aroma. These include herbs, spices, sugar, salt, pepper, and more.
In the example marinade recipe above, the orange and lemon juices are the acidic ingredients, the olive oil is the fat, and everything else is for flavor.

, Once you've made your marinade, transfer it to a sturdy plastic bag. Put your steaks in the bag, massage them so that they get well-coated with the marinade, and set the bag in the fridge. Leave it here for at least half an hour and as long as 24. The longer you let the fish marinate, the stronger the flavor will be.


You can double-bag your marinade if you're worried about spills.

, Heat a pan on the stove, adding oil when it's hot. Remove the steaks from the marinade. Shake off excess moisture. Sear the steaks at high heat for 1-2 minutes per side or as needed — just like you normally would.

, As you cook the meat, you can add flavor by basting the meat with a little extra marinade. When you flip the meat, the marinade gets caught between the fish and the pan, searing and caramelizing.


Since the marinade contains the juice of the uncooked meat, for sanitation reasons, make sure you never add marinade to the top side of the meat right before serving it. You want the marinade you add to touch the hot pan so any germs in it can be killed. If you do add marinade to the top side of the tuna, flip it and cook briefly before serving.

Try grilling instead of cooking on the stove.,
Use oil and solid seasonings to give the tuna a flavorful crust.,
Serve the tuna with dipping sauce.,
Try breading the tuna before pan-frying.",How to Sear Tuna3," The directions above call for a hot pan on the stove, but there's no reason you can't get a great sear on the barbecue. The same general principles apply: get the grill nice and hot, paint the bars with a little oil, and lay your steaks down to cook 1-2 minutes per side. It's easiest to control the heat of gas grills, but charcoal works just as well as long as you get a hot, steady cooking temperature.


See our grilling article for lots of specific instructions to get your meat just right.

, Once you've mastered cooking basic seared tuna recipes, try changing up the recipe by giving each steak a coat of solid or powdered seasonings. This is a little like applying a dry rub to other types of meat. To do this:


After you use a paper towel to remove the water from the steaks, paint both sides of each steak with a thin layer of cooking oil.
Toss your oil-coated steaks in a bowl with your favorite seasonings, herbs and spices. They will stick to the oil and form a crisp exterior when you sear the meat.
Good choices include minced garlic, minced parsley, ginger, paprika, rosemary, thyme, cayenne pepper, onion powder, and much more — it's up to you.
Finish by seasoning with salt and pepper. Sear as normal.

, If you've ever been to a sushi restaurant, you may have noticed that many tuna-containing dishes come with a small portion of sauce meant for dipping the fish in. You can replicate this by pouring a small amount of your favorite sauce into a small dish or bowl and serving this with the meal. Soy and teriyaki sauces are good all-purpose choices, but other can sauces can also work well.


See our soy dressing recipe for a simple sauce that goes well with most seared tuna dishes.

, What isn't better breaded and fried? Giving your steaks a coating of bread crumbs and frying in a little more oil than you would normally use can give them a deliciously crispy exterior. There are many ways to do this — you can find just one below:Combine equal parts panko bread crumbs and black sesame seeds in a bowl.
Roll the steaks in the breading mixture one by one until they are well-coated. If they aren't picking up the breading on their own, try coating them lightly with oil first.
Pan-sear, using extra oil to get a crisp, fried effect on the breading.

Choose fresh or frozen tuna steaks.,

Heat your skillet or grill.,
Coat the tuna with your spice mixture.,
Sear the tuna on both sides.",How to Cook Ahi Tuna1," Ahi tuna is sold in form of large steaks or fillets that can be cooked in a similar fashion to beef steaks. Look for deep red tuna steaks with firm flesh. Avoid steaks that have a rainbow sheen or look dry, also avoid buying fish that looks mottled or pale in color.


Buy a six-ounce steak per serving you need.
If you're using frozen tuna steak, thaw it completely and put in the refrigerator before using.
Fresh tuna is in season from late spring to early fall. If you're choosing fresh tuna, it's best to get it while it's in season. Frozen tuna is available all year round.
Ahi or yellowfin tuna from the United States or Canada is the best choice, since it has relatively low levels of mercury and is not in danger of being overfished. Bluefin tuna should be avoided, as the mercury levels are higher and it is being over-fished across the world.;
, Seared tuna is frequently coated with spices that complement the tuna's meaty flavour. You can use a steak rub or any other type of spice mix that includes ingredients like garlic powder, pepper and dried herbs. Try making your own spice mix by combining the following ingredients in a bowl (makes enough to coat one six-ounce steak):


1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon dried basil
1/4 teaspoon dried oregano

, Tuna steaks and fillets are easy to sear on either a grill or stove top. The key is to fully heat the cooking implement you're using before adding the tuna. This will ensure that the tuna cooks evenly and attains a good crunchy sear.


If you're using the stove top, heat a cast iron skillet or other heavy skillet over medium high heat. Add a tablespoon of peanut oil or canola oil and heat it until the oil just begins to smoke.If you're using a grill, light the charcoal at least half an hour before you plan to cook the tuna. that way it will have plenty of time to get nice and hot before you add the tuna.

, Each six-ounce steak or fillet will need approximately one to two tablespoons of seasoning. Pat the seasoning into the tuna on all sides so that it's completely coated. After you've coated the steak, allow it to sit out and come to room temperature before you place it on the grill or skillet.

, Tuna steaks are normally served rare, since the texture of rare tuna is more appealing than the texture of a fully-cooked piece of tuna, which tends to be on the dry side.


To achieve a sear on the outside and keep it rare inside, place the tuna on the skillet or grill and let it sear for two minutes on the first side. Flip the tuna and let it cook for another two minutes, then remove it from the heat.
Watch the tuna as it cooks to make sure you don't overcook it. You'll be able to see the heat cooking the tuna from the bottom up. If two minutes seems like too much time on one side, flip the tuna sooner.
If you'd prefer to make sure the tuna gets fully cooked, leave it on the heat for extra time.

The marinating step is only optional. You can skip the marinade altogether and simply brush the tuna steaks with olive oil, lemon juice, and fresh herbs before cooking it. Marinades penetrate into the tuna further, however, creating a more flavorful dish.
Experiment with marinades as desired. You can use commercial and homemade marinades as long as you combine both an acid and an oil. Asian-inspired flavors are used especially often with tuna steaks.;
, Rinse the tuna steaks under cool, running water and pat dry with clean paper towels.


Rinsing the fish removes any sticky or dirty residue on the surface.

, Add the tuna steaks to the bag of marinade and seal. Give the bag a good shake to coat all sides of the tuna.


Make sure that there is as little air as possible inside the bag as the tuna marinates.
Keep the tuna and the marinade in the refrigerator.
The tuna steaks can marinate anywhere from 15 minutes to four hours.

, Spray the grill rack with nonstick cooking spray.


You could also lightly oil the rack with olive oil or vegetable oil. You simply need some sort of greasy coating to prevent the tuna steaks from sticking.

, The grill needs to be set up for medium heat.


If using a charcoal grill, evenly spread several layers of coal over the bottom of the grill. You do not need a huge pile, but you need more than a single layer of coals. Light the coals and allow them to burn down until a fine layer of ash begins to form on them.
Preheat the grill the medium-high. After several minutes pass, reduce the heat down to medium.

, Tuna steaks will usually need to cook for roughly four to six minutes per one-half inch (1.27-cm) thickness. Turn once in the middle of the cooking process to promote even cooking.


Leave the grill uncovered if using charcoal but cover it if using gas.
The tuna is finished once you can flake it with a fork, but it is generally left pink in the center. Cook longer if you want a more well-done tuna steak without any pink in the center.
Baste with any leftover marinade when you turn the tuna steaks halfway through cooking them.Do not use the marinade past this point, however, since it may not be exposed to the heat of the grill long enough to have the bacteria cooked out of it.

, Tuna steaks can be served hot, warm, or at room temperature.

, Add 2 Tbsp (30 ml) of olive oil to the skillet and heat over medium-high heat for several minutes.


Make sure the oil is plenty hot. Drip a drop or two of water into the skillet. If it sizzles and immediately evaporates, the skillet is ready. Be careful as this can cause a flame up.
You could also use vegetable oil or other types of cooking oil.

, Add the fish to the hot oil in the pan and cook for 6 to 9 minutes.


The steaks should start to sizzle as soon as you add them. If they do not, take them out of the pan and allow the oil to continue heating. You need the oil to be hot enough to sear the tuna, trapping the moisture inside.
Turn the tuna steaks over once, after 3 to 5 minutes pass, so that both sides are evenly seared.
Do not cover the skillet.
The fish is considered done once you can begin flaking it with a fork, but some pink is generally left in the center. If this does not appeal to you, though, you can continue cooking the tuna until it reaches your desired level of doneness.

, You can serve them immediately after removing them from the heat, or you can allow them to cool to room temperature.

, Prepare a broiler pan by lightly coating the interior rack with nonstick cooking spray.


Allow the broiler to preheat for 5 to 10 minutes.
If your broiler has separate ""high"" and ""low"" settings, preheat the broiler to high.
Coating the broiler pan rack with cooking spray is only optional, but it is a good idea since the spray will prevent the tuna from sticking too severely to the rack.

, Position the tuna steaks in a single layer, spaced evenly apart.

,


Place the broiler pan on the top rack of the oven, roughly 4 inches (10 cm) away from the top heating element.
Tuna steaks are generally considered done once the fish can be flaked with a fork, but the middle is often left pink. You can leave the tuna in for an additional 1 or 2 minutes if you feel uncomfortable consuming it with a pink center.

, Let them cool slightly for several minutes before serving or allow them to cool longer until they drop to room temperature.

, Prepare a baking sheet by coating it with nonstick cooking spray.


You can also opt to cover the baking sheet with aluminum foil or parchment paper.

, Position the tuna so that the steaks are spaced evenly apart on a single layer.

, The tuna steaks need to bake for approximately 4 to 6 minutes per 1/2-inch (1.27-cm) thickness.


The fish is considered done once you can begin flaking it with a fork. It is generally served with some pink in the center, but if desired, you can continue cooking it for several additional minutes or until the pink vanishes completely.
You do not need to turn the tuna at all as it bakes.

, Tuna steaks can be served either fresh from the oven or slightly cooled.

Bake the tuna.",How to Cook Ahi Tuna2,", Choose a glass or ceramic dish that's just a little bigger than the size of the tuna steaks or fillets you're baking. Use olive oil to grease the bottom and sides of the dish so the fish doesn't stick.

, Rub each steak or fillet with a teaspoon of either melted butter or olive oil, then season with salt, pepper, and the dried herbs of your choice. The tuna itself will be the star of the show, so keep the seasoning light and complementary.


A squeeze of lemon juice complements the flavor of the tuna well if you want to add a little extra flavor.
You could also season the tuna with classic pairings like soy sauce, wasabi and ginger slices.

, Place the baking dish in the preheated oven and bake until the skin is no longer pink and flakes when poked with a fork, about 10 to 12 minutes. The actual cooking time will depend upon on how thick your steaks are.After 10 minutes, check the steaks to see if they need more time.


Err on the side of undercooking the tuna, since overcooked tuna tends to be dry and take on a fishier taste.
If you want the baked tuna to be seared on top, turn on the broiler and broil the top for the last two to three minutes of cooking.

It's a light, refreshing dish that doesn't actually require cooking, but it's one of the most popular ways to prepare the fish. It's important to get sushi-grade tuna if you're using this preparation method, since you won't be cooking the fish to kill parasites and bacteria.


To make four servings of tuna tartare, you need one pound of tuna. Either steaks or fillets will do.
This dish is best with fresh tuna, rather than tuna that has been previously frozen.

, Tuna tartare is prepared with a sauce made from fresh flavors like citrus paired with the deep warmth of wasabi. To make a delicious tartare, combine the following ingredients in a bowl:1/4 cup olive oil
1/4 cup chopped cilantro
1 teaspoon minced jalapeno
2 teaspoons minced ginger
1 1/2 teaspoons wasabi powder
2 tablespoons lemon juice
Salt and pepper to taste

, Use a sharp knife to cut the tuna into 1⁄8 to 1⁄4 inch (0.3 to 0.6 cm) cubes. It's easiest to do this with a knife, but you may use a food processor to save time.

, Mix them together thoroughly so the tuna is completely coated. Serve the tuna tartare right away on crackers or potato chips.


If you don't serve the tuna right away, the lemon juice in the sauce will begin to react with the tuna and change its texture.
If you wish to prepare the tuna tartare in advance, keep the sauce and tuna separate until just before serving.

Look for dark brown seeds inside the apple.",How to Tell if Apples on Your Tree Are Ripe1," Apples are ready for picking earlier in warmer areas than the fruits in colder climates because the heat helps them ripen. Likewise, south facing fruits will get more sunlight and be ready for picking earlier than apples on the north side of the tree.


In cooler climates, harvest time is generally September through October.
In warmer climates, harvest time could be anywhere from late summer through early spring.;
, The most obvious sign to watch for is color. Golden delicious apples will change from green to yellow when they are ready to be harvested and red delicious will turn entirely red. If the tree produces apples with stripes or a red blush, the green part of the apple will turn yellow when it is ready to pick.Unfortunately, some of the newer apple tree cultivars are not so obvious. The skin on these apples may turn entirely red before they are ready for harvest or the green part of the skin may not turn yellow until the apples are stored for a few months. To overcome this obstacle, heck the flesh of the apple before harvesting all of them to determine if they are ready. When these apples are ready to harvest the flesh will have changed from pale green to white.
The color of the indentation near the steam is another way to tell on certain varieties. The shade of this area generally lightens as the apples ripen.

, Apple trees naturally drop their apples when they are ripe in order to self-seed and reproduce. Watch for an apple or two to drop from the tree to determine if they are ready to pick.


When your apples are ripe, they should be fairly easy to pick from the tree with a simple upward twist of the apple. Try to avoid picking an apple by pulling the fruit straight down and tugging.
If otherwise healthy fruits begin to fall off the tree, they are probably beginning to get a little too ripe and should probably be harvested as soon as possible.

, Apples that are nearing maturity will generally have dark brown seeds rather than white ones. However, keep in mind that this may not be the case for varieties that ripen early. Their seeds may still be light colored when they are ripe and some types have seeds that turn brown weeks before the optimal picking time. This is where researching the variety in your yard can also prove helpful.

Do a taste test.,
Test the apple for softness.,
Spray the inside of the apple with iodine.",How to Tell if Apples on Your Tree Are Ripe2," The ultimate test of ripeness is the taste test. The flesh should be sweet or tart, depending on the apple variety, and slightly softer but not mushy.


Don’t be discouraged if all signs point to harvest time but the apples are not as sweet as they should be, especially if they are a type of Delicious apple. Some types of apples will get sweeter after they are picked and stored for a short while.

, Apples that are fully matured are also slightly softer in texture than unripe apples. A good way to test a fruit’s ripeness is by giving it a light squeeze between your fingers and thumb. If the apple indents a little then it is finished growing. It may take novice gardeners some time before they become proficient with this test, however.

, If all else fails, gardeners can cut an apple through the core and spray it with iodine to see if it is ripe. Iodine will turn the unripe cells a dark color due to the presence of starch in the apples. Fruits that are to be stored should have a completely white center and dark spots that take up anywhere from three quarters to one half of the fruit. Fruits that are completely clear should be immediately eaten or preserved in some fashion."

, Place the pointed end of the stake 15 to 18 inches (38.1 to 45.72 cm) away from the base of the tree. You'll want your single stake to be on a 45-degree angle towards the direction in which the wind usually blows, to help stabilize the tree.Do not disrupt the tree's root system when planting your stake.

, Use a hammer to bang on the top end of the stake so that it drives it deep into the ground. You'll need to make sure that it's deep enough so that it adds stability to the tree and will remain in the ground, even in high winds., You can use wire or twine to attach the tree to the stake. Tie your loop in the center of the wooden stake or as low as you can tie it without the tree falling over. You'll want to attach the stake to the tree securely but not so tight that your tree won't be able to grow or move.

If you are replanting a tree, you should also measure the width of the root ball so that you know how far apart each of the stakes have to be placed into the ground without hurting the tree's roots.The stakes should be as high as the lowest hanging branches of your tree.
When replanting an adult apple tree, some of the roots may become damaged which will cause a loss of stability.

, Go to a hardware or home and gardening store and purchase metal or wooden stakes that are around 2/3 the height of your apple tree. Each stake should be at least 2 inches (5.08 cm) wide.Metal stakes provide greater overall stability when creating a permanent stake.

, Use a tape measure to mark the area where you want to plant your tree. The stakes should be placed far enough apart on each side of the tree so that when you drive them into the ground, they won't disrupt the tree's roots., Once you know where your stakes have to be, tap the top of the stakes and drive them vertically into the ground about a foot (30.48 cm) deep. You should now have two stakes running vertically on each side of your tree., Using twine, wire, nylon string, or tubing, attach the stakes to the tree near the middle of the stakes, or 1/3 the way up from the ground. Do not tie the knots too tight and make sure that there's enough slack so that your tree is free to sway slightly."

Prune in the spring.",How to Plant Sugar Apples," You can get sugar apple seeds from your local garden center or, if you have a friend with a tree, you can get the seeds from the flesh of the apples. You could also order seeds from an online retailer.

If you obtain seeds from the flesh of a sugar apple, you’ll have to wait one week after removing the seeds from the flesh before planting them. They don’t germinate very well if you put them in the ground right away. Cut open your sugar apple fruit and pull out the big, black seeds. Put them in a seed envelope and wait one week prior to planting.If you purchased sugar apple seeds from a garden center, you don’t need to wait before planting.;
, Although germination can take thirty days, you can speed up the process by soaking your seeds. Wrap up your seeds in a piece of paper towel. Soak the seeds with a bit of water. Place the seeds with the paper towel in a ziplock bag. Let your seeds soak for three days and then plant them.Alternately, you can scarify the seeds. Lightly sand the seeds. Then, soak them in warm water for twenty-four hours. In this way, you can speed up the seed preparation process and improve germination time., Since sugar apple is a tropical tree, you’ll want a sunny spot to start your seedlings. You’ll want to put your seeding tray in front of a south facing window so that the seeds get plenty of warmth and light. If you don’t have a south facing window, you’ll need to install grow lights., You’ll need a seeding tray that is at least two or three inches deep and has drainage holes, which you can obtain at a garden center. Fill the seeding tray with fresh potting soil from the garden center, as opposed to soil from your garden. You’ll want to moisten the soil a bit before planting the seeds.Sugar apple trees do well in most soil types as long as there is good drainage. They will not tolerate any water-logging, so avoid getting the potting soil sopping wet at this stage. It should be moist but not soaking., In your seeding tray, plant the seeds two or three centimeters deep. They should be spaced one and a half centimeters apart. The plants should germinate within thirty days.Alternately, you could purchase a grafted sugar apple tree from a nursery.
Once the seedlings are mature, you can transplant them outside.

, Spray the seeding tray with a mister to keep the soil moist but not soaking. Since sugar apples do not tolerate water-logging, it is best to let the soil dry out a bit between waterings. You can stick your finger one inch into the soil to check the moisture level. If it feels dry at a depth of one inch, you can spray the seedlings.You can use a fan to ensure movement of air over the seedlings, which will help prevent disease.
Symptoms of water-logging or “flood stress” include yellow leaves, stunted growth, wilting and browning, as well as fallen leaves., Every few days, you should rotate the seeding tray so that all of the plants are able to enjoy the benefits of the south facing window. If you are growing under a light, you should set the timer for fifteen hours per day and remember to let the seedlings rest in the dark for the rest of the day.

If you are using grow lights, you’ll need to raise them as the seedlings grow.

, You should plant your sugar apple tree in a tropical or near-tropical climate. Since sugar apples can tolerate some level of drought, you could plant it in a dryer climate. Cooler temperatures are not tolerated, so avoid planting it outdoors in places with cold temperatures in the winter or at night.It will tolerate USDA zones 11-12.The lowest temperature range it will tolerate is 40-50 Fahrenheit (4-10 Celsius).
If the temperature drops below 0 Celsius (32 Fahrenheit), the plant will die., You can transplant your sugar apple tree in the spring or whenever the temperature reaches between 73 to 94 Fahrenheit (23-24 Celsius). You should find a place that has some wind protection, plenty of sun and is not prone to water-loggging., Sugar apple is a tropical plant that grows well in South America, Asia and Africa, so it enjoys the sun! You should plant it in a sunny spot that is well protected from the wind.The location should be sunny at least eighty percent of the time.Make sure it gets at least six hours of sunlight per day, although it will do better with eight hours or more., Choose rich, well draining soil for your sugar apple tree. You could plant it in sandy, limestone or a heavy loam soil, since it tolerates a range of soil types. However, you should avoid water logged soil and ensure adequate drainage., Since sugar apple trees have shallow root systems, you should make the planting hole twice as wide as the root ball of the seedling. The depth of the hole should match the size of the root ball. Place the root ball in the planting hole, cover and water the seedling.If you are planting more than one, put them five meters apart from one another.
You could also plant the sugar apple tree in a large pot., You can use “companion planting” to prevent pests, fertilize the soil and ensure pollination of your sugar apple tree.You want to plant your sugar apple tree near star fruit and mango trees.Underneath your sugar apple tree, you want to plant flowers and herbs that attract beneficial insects and repel pests. Choose two or three of the following companion plants to put underneath your sugar apple tree:Chives
Marigold
Garlic
Lemon balm
Mustard
Nasturtiums
Tansy
Yarrow

, Water your tree infrequently but thoroughly.Sugar apples have moderate watering requirements and are drought tolerant, although they will lose leaves if the drought is very bad.If you are getting a lot of rain, you should stop watering.
Ideally, they will get an annual rainfall of between 750 and 1,200 mm.

, To get the tree going, you’ll want to apply a complete fertilizer. Use an organic fertilizer to improve the development of the root system. To improve yield in later years, you can use 3-10-10 fertilizer. If you have a young tree, you should fertilize it every six to eight weeks during the growing season.After the third year of growth, you should reduce the number of applications of fertilizer.
In the first year of growth, you should apply fertilizer five to six times.
In the second and third years of growth, you should apply fertilizer three to six times.

, To give shape to your sugar apple tree, you’ll want to prune it in the spring. You’ll find that it grows many branches, which can get quite unwieldy. You’ll want to prune to give shape to the tree, as well as remove any old fruit.Use your shears to cut any dead branches.Remove branches that are growing towards the ground.
After ten years, you can do renewal pruning to give new life to your sugar apple tree.

",How to Make Apple Snow," You can use any apple variety, but tart apples provide a more interesting flavor. Chop them into small pieces so they stew faster.;
, Combine the apples with ⅓ cup (75g) caster sugar and the juice and zest of one lemon in a nonstick pan. Cover and simmer over low heat, stirring often, until the apples are soft and starting to break apart.This takes 10–20 minutes depending on how firm your apple variety is.


Check on the apples frequently. Add a couple spoonfuls of water if the apples start sticking to the pan. Cook until liquids have boiled away.Caster sugar is sold as superfine sugar in the United States. You can make your own by putting granulated white sugar in the food processor for 1–2 minutes, or until it reaches a fine sand consistency. Measure the sugar after processing, as the volume will decrease., Finish the apple puree in a blender or food processor if you want a classic, smooth apple snow. If you want small pieces of apple in your dessert, skip this step and continue stewing until the apples reach the desired consistency.If you don't have a blender, continue stewing until very soft, then strain the apples through a fine mesh sieve., The apples need to reach room temperature before you can mix them into the meringue. Meringue will start to deflate after about ten minutes, so don't continue to the next step until the apples are finished cooling.While you wait, put one mixing bowl in the fridge to chill. This will make it easier to make whipping cream.

, Separate two egg whites and place in a deep bowl with straight sides. Beat with a handheld mixer on medium-low speed or a hand whisk, moving around the bowl. Continue until the eggs turn white and foamy.Use the freshest eggs possible to improve the volume of your meringue.
Any egg yolk or grease in your bowl will interfere with the meringue. For best results, wipe your bowl and beaters with lemon juice, rinse, and dry before using.

, Increase mixer speed to high. Pour ¼ cup (55g) sugar down the side of the bowl in a steady stream. Continue beating until the meringue forms stiff peaks that stick to the beaters when lifted.Stop beating immediately if you notice any lumps forming.
This is an uncooked meringue, so there is a small risk of salmonella. To prevent this, rest the bowl on top of a pot of water on the stovetop. Beat in the sugar until an instant read or candy thermometer reads 160ºF (70ºC)., Whisk ½ cup (120mL) cream in a chilled mixing bowl until peaks form. Untreated cream will whip more easily than pasteurized or homogenized cream.You can reduce or eliminate this ingredient for a healthier dessert.

, Fold the cream and egg whites into the cooled apple mixture to make apple snow.

, Spoon the apple snow into large wine glasses or other individual dishes. Chill in the refrigerator for at least half an hour before serving.,"

You can lay your wire rack on top of a baking sheet to capture any dripping juice.

, A little bit of sweetness will take these to the next level. You can use powdered sugar, or mix up equal parts cinnamon and granulated sugar and dust the apples with this. For a lighter notch of sweetness, you could also drizzle the apples with honey.







, Leave the oven cracked open slightly to vent the moisture from the apples. You can safely wedge a wooden spoon in the oven door gap for venting at this low temperature. The time needed will vary based on the thickness of the apple slices; more for thicker slices, less for thinner slices.









Use a spatula to flip the apples at the one hour mark. If you're using a non-mesh or wire baking sheet, where air can't escape the apples from below, turn them every 30-45 minutes instead of just on the hour., Either way, turn off the oven. The chips will be a bit rubbery while warm, but will quickly turn as crispy as potato chips when cooled. If you leave them in the oven as they cool, this will speed up the drying and lead to a crispier, crunchier chip.







, The chips will last several weeks in a cool, dry place, as long as they are in an airtight container.

Core the apples.,
Slice the apples.,
Place the cut rings into a bowl of lemon water.,
Dry and season the apples.",How to Make Apple Rings1," Some apples work better than others for baking and cooking, and this applies to both dried and deep fried apple rings. Look for crispy apple varieties that will hold their shape when heated, such as:Braeburn
Fuji
Honeycrisp
Gala
Pink Lady
Granny Smith
Golden delicious;
, Run the apples under cold water and scrub them with a vegetable brush or cloth. This will remove excess dirt and bacteria.With a sharp knife, cut away any bruises or soft spots on the apples if you're going to deep fry them. Bruised flesh is safe to eat, but it will become mushy when heated.

, This is more important for deep fried apples, and is optional for dried apple rings. Apple peel contains a great deal of fiber and other nutrients, so you may want to consider leaving the apples intact for dried apple rings.To peel the apples, use a sharp knife to peel off the skin. You can also use a vegetable peeler or mechanical apple peeler, which is a hand-powered crank device that turns an apple on a spit and peels it with a blade.

, Use an apple corer to remove the core from each apple. It’s important to use an apple corer, because taking out the center of the apple will give you the traditional apple ring shape.Hold the apple still with one hand and center the corer vertically over the top of the apple core. Push the corer all the way through the apple, then pull it back out to remove the core.
If you don’t have an apple corer, use a thin, long, and sharp knife to cut out the core from the center of the apple. Cut a small circle around the core, remove the knife, and push the core out through the bottom.

, The easiest way to do this is with a mandolin, because it will ensure uniform thickness for each slice. Press the bottom of the apple onto the mandolin using the vegetable holder. Use swift downward motions to slice the apple into rounds. If you don’t have a mandolin, slice the apples by hand with a sharp knife.


For dried apples, slice the fruit into rings that are one-eighth to one-third inch (3.2 to 8.5 mm) thick. Thinner rings will dry faster, but can easily become crispy and hard.For deep fried apples, slice the rings one-quarter inch (6.4 mm) thick. Lay each ring out flat in a single layer. Take a small biscuit or cookie cutter and cut a smaller ring from the center of each apple slice. Then, do the same with a medium biscuit cutter so that you get a small, medium, and large apple ring from each apple slice.If you have shaped cookie cutters in graduated sizes, you can use these instead of plain circles to make shaped apple rings.

, Fill a large bowl with cold water and squeeze in the juice from one lemon. This will prevent the apples from browning. Let the apples soak for about five minutes.


To add a hint of floral nuttiness to the apples, add 1 teaspoon (6 ml) vanilla to the bowl as well., After five minutes in the lemon water, remove the apples and lay each slice flat on a clean towel. Gently pat each slice dry. You can also season the apples with spices such as:¼ teaspoon (1.25 g) cinnamon
⅛ teaspoon (0.625 g) ginger or cardamom
Pinch of cloves
Any combination of the above, or any other spices you wish to experiment with

Batter and fry the apples.,
Cool and serve.",How to Make Apple Rings2," Along with the prepared apples and your other ingredients, you'll also need a large mixing bowl, two small mixing bowls, a whisk, a deep pan for frying (or a deep fryer), and metal cooling racks.

, Fill your frying pan with about an inch (2.5 cm) of oil. Heat the oil over medium heat to 350 F (177 C).Use a deep fryer or candy thermometer to maintain a consistent temperature.


The best oils for frying include coconut, peanut, and canola.In case you don’t have a thermometer, drop a single popcorn kernel into the cold oil. When the kernel pops, your oil is ready.If you're using a deep fryer, make sure the oil is fresh, otherwise your apples could taste like fish and French fries and anything else you’ve fried in that oil.

, In your small dish, combine ⅓ cup (75 g) of sugar and 2 teaspoons (10 g) of cinnamon. Set the bowl aside.


The remaining cinnamon and sugar called for in the recipe are for the batter.

, In a large mixing bowl, measure in the flour, baking powder, salt, ⅛ teaspoon (0.6 g) of cinnamon, and 2 tablespoons (28 g) of sugar., In a small mixing bowl, whisk together the egg and buttermilk until fully combined. When they are ready, pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and whisk the batter together.Instead of buttermilk, you can use plain yogurt if you prefer.

, One at a time, dip the apple rings into the batter to coat them. Wipe off excess batter on the side of the bowl. Lay a few slices in the frying pan at a time, being sure not to crowd them, otherwise the batter will stick together and the apples rings will merge.


Fry each batch for two to four minutes, turning once, until the rings are golden brown and crispy., When the apple rings are done, remove them from the oil and hold them over the pan to let the excess oil drip off. Toss each one into the cinnamon-sugar mixture and coat both sides.Once coated, lay the apple rings on a wire rack, which will allow them to cool without getting soggy.

"
"
Lay out the apples.,
Dehydrate the apple rings.,
Cool and store the apples.",How to Make Apple Rings3," You can dry your apple rings in either a dehydrator or in the oven. For the dehydrator, arrange the apples on the dehydrator trays. For the oven, arrange the apples on metal cooling racks and place these onto baking sheets. This will allow air to circulate under the apples so they’ll dry more evenly.


Lay the apple rings side by side, but make sure they don’t touch or overlap, otherwise they won’t dry consistently.
If you're drying your apples in the oven, preheat the oven to 150 F (66 C). Set your dehydrator to between 110 and 135 F (43 and 57 C).With a lower temperature, the rings dry more consistently and thoroughly, but will need longer to dry.
Use metal cooling racks because other types, such as non-stick or coated ones, may not be oven-safe.

, Turn the dehydrator on or put the apple rings in the oven. Prop the oven door open slightly so that air can circulate.Let the apples dry for 10 to 14 hours in the dehydrator, checking them every hour after the 10-hour mark.In the oven, dry them for five to eight hours, or longer if necessary, until they reach your desired level of dryness.You can stop drying the apples at any time, depending on your personal preference. For juicier apples, dry for a shorter time. For crispier apples, dry for longer; and for leathery apples, dry them for somewhere in the middle.

, When the apples are done to your liking, remove them from the dehydrator or oven and allow them to cool to room temperature.


Whatever you don’t eat or use immediately can be stored in an air-tight container for up to a year."

However, make sure you choose the right place to ripen your fruit.Plantains ripen best in a warm and well-ventilated place. If your kitchen is very cold or stuffy, try to find another room in your house to ripen them.
Plantains can ripen in cooler environments. It just may take longer.;
, Plantains will ripen fastest if they're not bothered. Keep them out of reach of children and pets. Do not handle your plantains while they're ripening. Plantains are usually not sold ripe in the stores and take awhile to ripen on their own. Your plantains will need to sit undisturbed for awhile to get them adequately ripe., It should take 7 to 11 days for a plantain to ripen. In a warmer environment, you can expect plantains to ripen faster. A plantain is ripe when it's black and wrinkled in appearance and soft to the touch. A plantain should not need to be poked too hard to yield to the pressure of your finger when it is ripe."

Do not automatically throw out moldy produce.",How to Clean Apples3," It is rarely necessary to soak apples or use ingredients other than tap water or vinegar to wash them. Fancy waters that involve soaking apples can change their taste. Stick to tap water for the most part, and vinegar if your apples are very dirty. Elaborate washes will do little to clean apples., Many people think organic apples do not need to be washed. While organic apples use less pesticides, they are still prone to environmental bacteria and can be contaminated during transport. Even organic apples should be washed under tap prior prior to eating., Moldy produce does not have to be discarded if only a small corner is infected with mold. If you see a small part of your apple is moldy, cut away that portion with a knife. Unless an apple is completely covered in a layer of fuzzy mold, there is no need to throw it away."

Place the tomato and/or apple next to the bananas.,
Seal the bag.,
Place the paper bag containing the fruit in a warm spot.,
Leave the bananas overnight.",How to Ripen Bananas Quickly1," By placing the bananas in a brown paper bag with another fruit, you will maximize the amount of ethylene gas released. Ethylene gas is the substance fruit produces as it ripens. This will help to substantially speed up the ripening process, giving you smooth, creamy bananas.






;
,, Make sure the tomato is not overripe so it doesn't burst or mold in the paper bag. If you don't have an apple or tomato, a pear will also do the trick.








, Roll down or fold the top of the paper bag to seal in the ethylene gas produced by the fruit.








, Higher temperatures cause fruits to release more ethylene gas, which will speed up the ripening process even further.








, Leave the bananas and other fruit in the paper bag overnight. Check the bananas in the morning to see if they have reached the desired level of ripeness. If not, roll the bag up again and check the bananas every 12 hours until they become ripe enough.









You should be able to ripen green bananas using the paper bag method to the point where they have yellow skins, or yellow skins speckled with brown spots, within 24 hours.

, Don't overcrowd them, three or four bananas to a baking sheet is usually enough. Note that this method will not work for completely green bananas, they will need to be almost ripe (yellow in color) for best results.








, How long you need to leave the bananas in the oven will depend on what you intend to use them for.








, If you leave the bananas in the oven for an hour, the skins will turn completely black and the fruit will be perfect for using in smoothies and baking recipes, such as banana bread.








, If you leave the bananas in the oven just long enough for the skins to turn a darker yellow, without any dark spots forming, you will be able to eat them on their own. This should take about 20 minutes, but make sure to watch them closely in oven so you can take them out at exactly the right time.









Once you have removed the bananas from the oven, place them in the refrigerator to cool down and halt the ripening process. Eat once completely cool.

, Use a vegetable scrubber to scrub the skins, then pat the apples dry. If you prefer peeled apples, peel your apples after washing them. Any type of apples will do, but Fuji or Granny Smith apples are both great candidates for slicing and roasting. The tart flavor and firm flesh holds up well to the cooking process.

, Stand an apple upright and use a sharp knife to slice the apple in half through the middle of the core. Slice the halves in two, leaving four large pieces. Cut out and discard the core. Repeat with the remaining apples.Apples break down as they roast, so keep this in mind when you decide on the size of your slices. Apples sliced into eight parts tend to come out with the best texture.
If you have an apple corer, use that before slicing the apples.

, Place them in a bowl and toss gently to completely coat them with sugar and spice. If desired, add a pinch of salt and a squeeze of lemon juice.

Unwrap the apples.",How to Roast Apples3," Build your fire and allow it to burn for about half an hour before you start cooking the apples. As the wood burns, it will break apart and form a layer of red-hot coals. These coals provide a hot, even surface for cooking food.


Don't try to roast your apples directly over the flame. They will char instead of cooking.
Use a fire poker to spread the coals into an even layer. Make sure they're still close enough to the flame to remain hot.

, Use a vegetable brush to scrub the skins, then pat them dry with a towel. Any type of apples will work, but Granny Smith or Red Delicious apples make great campfire-roasted apples.

, Use either an apple corer or a paring knife to remove the cores and hollow out the apples. Don't cut all the way through, though. Keep the bottoms intact, since you're going to fill the apples with the remaining ingredients.


If you're using a paring knife, make four deep slices around the stem of the apples. Use a spoon to scoop out the core and seeds.
If you accidentally cut through the bottom of an apple, simply reinsert the bottom piece to block the bottom of the hole.

, Poke shallow score marks into the skin all around the apples. This will allow heat to penetrate to the middle of the apples as they roast.

, Evenly distribute the brown sugar and cinnamon among the four apples. Then evenly distribute the butter cubes among the four apples. Drop the cubes directly into the holes so that they rest on top of the sugar mixture.

, Take one apple and place it upright on a large piece of aluminum foil. Gather the edges of the foil to the top of the apple and twist, so that the apple is completely wrapped with a foil ""handle"" on top. Repeat with each remaining apple., Place the wrapped apples directly on top of the burning coals. Roast them for 45 minutes to an hour, depending on how hot your coals are. Use tongs to rotate the apples (keeping them upright) two or three times to ensure they cook evenly on all sides. When you can feel the apples give when you poke the foil with the tongs, they're ready to come out of the fire.

, Let them cool for a few minutes, then carefully unwrap the aluminum foil. The apples should be soft and steaming. Serve them with spoons that can be used to scoop out the flesh.

Mix the dry ingredients for the chocolate sauce.Combine 3/4 cup of sugar, 1 1⁄2 tablespoons (22.2 ml) of all purpose flour, and 1/2 cup of unsweetened cocoa powder in a bowl.,
Combine wet ingredients for chocolate sauce over heat.,
Add the dry ingredients a small portion at a time.,
Increase heat to medium-high and simmer.,
Crush the candy canes into powder.,
Peel and core your apples.,
Top the apple slices with chocolate sauce and crushed candy cane.",How to Make Chocolate Apples1," Mix them together with a fork or whisk to combine them evenly and remove any lumps there might have been.;
, Bring a saucepan up to medium heat, then add 1 1/4 cups of milk, 2 tablespoons (29.6 ml) of unsalted butter, and 1⁄2 tablespoon (7.4 ml) of vanilla extract. Stir the ingredients until the butter has melted completely.


Add more vanilla extract for stronger flavor, but don’t go overboard!

, If you try to dump all the dry ingredients into the saucepan at once, you’ll have a flour-bomb. Instead, add the dry ingredients little by little, whisking them into the wet ingredients to even out any lumps.

, Keep stirring the sauce to keep it from burning over the higher heat. After about five to six minutes, turn off the heat completely and add a pinch of salt to add depth to the flavor., There are many ways you can do this, so use whatever is handy in your kitchen.


The most obvious method would be to use a mortar and pestle. Snap the candy into smaller, more manageable pieces, and put them in the mortar a few at a time. Use the pestles to grind the candy down into a powder or small shards — whichever you prefer.
You can also use a hammer or meat tenderizer. Place the candy cane in a sealable plastic bag, snapping it into smaller pieces to fit if needed. Place the bag on a stable surfaces, then pound at the candy with the hammer or meat tenderizer until it reaches the texture you prefer.
Use whatever you can find around the house. Be creative, but be safe.

, Use a vegetable peeler to remove the outer skin from the apple, being careful not to cut your fingers in the process. Stand the apples up, then, using a sharp knife, slice down along the edges of the core to remove the edible flesh of the apple from the inedible core. Cut the edible flesh into smaller slices as you see fit.

, Lay them out either on a large plate or over a length of tin foil, if you want to avoid the extra dishes. You can finish your chocolate apples any way you like. Some choices might include:


Dip the entire apple slice in chocolate sauce, or dip only half the slice.
Use a spoon to drizzle chocolate sauce lightly over the apple slices. Wag a spoonful of sauce quickly back and forth, allowing the chocolate to drizzle down lightly over the apple slices.
Top them with the crushed candy, letting the sauce work as an adhesive.
Put out a bowl of chocolate sauce and a bowl of crushed peppermint, allowing your guests to dip and sprinkle themselves, deciding how much garnish they want for their apples.
Refrigerating them before serving them sets the chocolate a little bit, which some people prefer.

Hold the apple in one hand.,
Learn how to hold a short, sharp knife.,
Hold the knife firmly against the surface of the apple.,
Decide which way to point the knife.,
Puncture the apple peel with your knife.,
Rotate the apple to remove most of the peel.,
Remove the ends of the apple.",How to Pare an Apple1," Hold the apple in your non-dominant hand, keeping it stable against your palm and fingers.;
, Select a sharp knife no longer than the width of the apple, typically between 2 and 4 inches (5–10 cm) long. Hold it in your dominant hand, wrapping your fingers around the handle and the dull, back edge of the knife. Keep your arm straight, with the knife extending outward as though it were part of your arm.This type of knife is often called a paring knife, because of their use in this task.

, Hold the blade steady against the fruit by pushing gently against the dull edge of the blade. Make sure your grip on the knife is steady, with no wiggling, but don't strain or press against it.









Most people start by holding the knife within 1 inch (2.5 cm) of the apple's top or bottom, at a point on the round portion of the apple's surface.

, The best method for handling a paring knife depends on your level of comfort and control.If you are unfamiliar or uncomfortable with knife use, or using a larger knife than instructed above, point the knife away from you to minimize the chance of cutting yourself if the knife slips. Once you have had some practice using a paring knife, and you know your grip is firm, you may find you have more control over the knife if you point your knife at a slight inward angle.

, Press the apple gently against the knife, until the peel is cut and the knife is resting under the surface of the peel.








, Turn the apple slowly against the blade of the knife, holding the knife steady in the same position or using minimal pressure to push it against the apple. Keep rotating the apple as the knife removes the peel, turning it in a spiral pattern until all the peel is removed. Leave the flattened ends of the apple alone for now.









If the knife slips through the peel again, simple place it back onto the apple at any position where peel remains.

, The top and bottom of the apple are typically more difficult to peel, due to their uneven shape. Hold the apple down against a cutting board, rounding your fingers into a ""claw"" shape so your fingertips are pressed onto the apple, but your knuckles are the closest part of your finger to the knife.Slowly press the knife down against the apple end until it is stable inside the apple, then push down hard to cut off the apple end.









Do not attempt to cut the apple ends if the apple is sliding against the cutting board. Stop and make sure the apple and cutting board are both dry, instead, or try a different cutting board.

Wash and dry your apples.,
Push a wooden skewer into the core of each apple.,
Cut 16 ounces of chocolate into small pieces.,
Melt the chocolate over a double boiler.If you try to melt chocolate over high heat too quickly, you might burn the chocolate and ruin your whole sauce.,
Dip the apples in the melted chocolate.,
Garnish the apples.,
Place dipped apples on wax paper and refrigerate to harden.",How to Make Chocolate Apples2," You can use whichever type of apple you like, but the tartness of Granny smith apples goes well with the sweetness of chocolate. Remove any produce stickers that might be on the apples’ skin, then rinse them under water to remove any chemicals or germs that might be on the surface. Dry them with a clean towel.

, This will allow you to eat the apple like a lollipop once it’s been dipped in chocolate. You may have to press firmly, but you should be able to ease a stick into the apple fairly easily.

, If you can find good quality chocolate in chocolate chip form, skip this step. However, if you bought a bar of chocolate, you’ll need to cut it up into smaller pieces. If you bought a chocolate bar that snaps easily into bite-sized pieces, break it up along the suggested lines. If it’s a solid bar, use a sharp knife to break the chocolate bar down into very small chunks.


If the pre-portioned pieces of chocolate from your bar are too large, run your knife through those, too.
The smaller the pieces, the more quickly and easily the chocolate will melt down into a sauce.

, To guard against that, use the double boiler method to steam the chocolate gently from below, warming it evenly and preventing it from burning. To create a double boiler, you’ll need a large saucepan; a double boiler pan that fits over the saucepan, but does not touch the bottom of it; and a stirrer.


Fill the bottom of the large saucepan with water, making sure that the water does not touch the bottom of the double boiler pan when it’s in place.
Place the saucepan, water, and double boiler pan combination over medium-low heat on the stove.
Place the chocolate pieces in the double boiler pan.
As the steam from the hot water rises up to the double boiler pan, the chocolate will begin to slowly melt.
Stir the chocolate to speed up the melting process and ensure an even texture to the sauce.
When the chocolate has melted through, turn off the heat source.

, Hold each apple by the skewer, and dip it into the chocolate in the double boiler pan. Roll it around to make sure that the apple is completely covered by chocolate sauce.

, If you want to add any other toppings to the chocolate apples, do it immediately after rolling the apple in the chocolate sauce, while it’s still wet. You can top the apple with anything that strikes your fancy. Some common toppings include chopped hazelnuts, sprinkles, crushed candy canes, and so on. You can dip the apple into a bowl of the topping, or you can sprinkle the topping over the apple.

, Place a sheet of wax paper over a cookie pan, then place each apple upside down on the wax paper. The skewer should be sticking up toward the sky. Place the cookie pan in the refrigerator for at least 15 minutes to allow the chocolate to harden once more, then you’re ready to serve your chocolate apples!

Cut off each end of the apple.,
Identify your type of peeler.,
Try holding the peeler like a pencil.,
Grip the apple, keeping your fingers on the sides.,
Use the vegetable peeler to scrape off the first strip of peel.,
Rotate the apple and repeat.",How to Pare an Apple2," This method of peeling is usually much quicker if you remove the uneven ends containing the stem, resulting in two parallel surfaces instead.In preparation for cutting, hold the apple firmly against a cutting board with your non-dominant hand, curling your fingers inward in a ""claw"" shape. This keeps the tougher skin on your knuckles closer to the blade, which reduces the chance of a painful or serious injury when the knife slips.








, There are two main types of vegetable peeler. Straight peelers, with the metal section extending straight out of the handle like a knife, is meant to be pushed away from you. Y-shaped peelers have two ""arms"" forking out from the handle, with the metal blade extended between them. These work with a pulling motion instead. Some people tend to cut themselves more with one type than another, so if you find one peeler difficult to control, try the other type.

, You may have a steadier grip on your peeler, especially a Y-shaped peeler, if you place your thumb and index finger on opposite sides of the handle.Curl your other fingers around the handle to make your grip firm.

, Hold the apple firmly in your non-dominant hand, but keep your fingers on the sides of your apple, not on either end. Leave a wide strip of peel visible running between the two cut ends, with your fingers and knuckles nowhere near this path. Position your apple according to your type of peeler:


If using a straight peeler, hold the apple so this strip is flat, angled so you can move the hand holding the peeler straight across it without bending your arm uncomfortably.
If using a Y-shaped peeler, hold the apple so this strip is almost vertical, angled slightly away from you so you can pull the peeler down over this strip.

, Double check that the apple and your fingers are in the position described above. Slowly draw the blade of the vegetable peeler from one of the cut surfaces to the other, removing the strip of peel. Remember, push a straight peeler away from you, but pull a Y-shaped peeler down toward you.








, Continue to remove short strips of peel until all of the peel has been removed. Consider holding the apple over a cutting board, bowl, sink, or trash can to catch the peel as you remove it.









Practice moving slowly for at least three or four apples before you try to speed up. Even if you become comfortable cutting more quickly, switching to a different type or size of peeler may cause injury if you do not slow down and get used to it first.

Turn the apple peels into snacks.,
Make the peels into potpourri.,
Add peels to homemade jam.,
Start a compost.",How to Pare an Apple3," Toss the peels with a small pinch of cinnamon and sugar, adding a few drops of water to help the spices stick. Spread out the peels on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Bake at 120ºC (250ºF) for about 2 ½ hours, or until the apple peels are crisp and curled.







, Dry the apple peels for several hours in a dehydrator, or in an oven on the minimum setting. Mix them with spices, perfume, or other scented ingredients to create potpourri mixes.Place these in bowls around your home to cover unpleasant odors or add your own scent to a room.








, Cut the peels into small pieces and add them to other fruit while making jam. If you have enough peels, apple cores, or other waste fruit, you may not need to add pectin, or reduce the amount of pectin you need to form jam.








, If your cooking creates a fair amount of waste ingredients, consider starting a compost. This can create high-quality soil for your garden, and reduce your impact on the environment. If you do not have a use for the compost yourself, ask your city government whether curbside compost pickup services are available.

Take them out when they are done.",How to Dry Apples," You do not necessarily need to peel them. The skin adds extra flavor to the apples and also contain a good deal of the fiber apples are famous for. Other people like to peel their apples because they do not like the texture of the dried skins. It is really just a matter of what you like.


Any variety of apple can be dried, though Gala, Fuji, and Golden Delicious work particularly well.;
, You will also want to cut out any worm-eaten parts. Kitchen stores sell apple corers that will easily and efficiently remove your apple cores. However, if you do not have one of these devices you can also core your apples by hand.If you are using these apples for decorations, or you really like your food to look as beautiful as possible, skip the coring. Apples that are not cored and are cut so that they keep their circular shape have a pretty star pattern in the center created by the core.

, You can either cut your apples so that they retain their circular shape, or you can cut them into thin wedges. Again, this is simply based on your own preference, though some say that the thinner the slices, the easier it is to dry the apples.

, An excellent solution for this is lemon juice, pineapple juice and water mixed together. The pineapple juice isn’t necessary but it adds sweetness to the mixture that counteracts the sour flavor of the lemon juice.Pre-treating the apples will also help them retain more of their vitamin A and vitamin C properties as well as provide a better texture in the final product. Here are some methods you can use to pretreat the apples:


Soak the apple slices in lemon juice. Mix 1 cup (240 mL) lemon juice into 1 quart (2 pints) of water. Do not soak for more than 10 minutes. Drain the liquid from the fruit.
Soak the apple slices in sodium bisulfite. Mix 2 teaspoons (9.85 mL) of sodium bisulfite into 1 quart (2 pints) of water. Do not soak for more than 10 minutes. Drain the liquid from the fruit.
Soak the apple slices in ascorbic acid for a result 6 times more effective than lemon juice. Mix 1 tablespoon (14.78 mL) of crystalline ascorbic acid into 1 quart (2 pints) of cold water. Soak the fruit for 3 minutes. Drain the liquid from the fruit.
You can also add orange juice and lemon juice mixed with water.

, Some people like to flavor their apple slices with spices like nutmeg, cinnamon, or allspice. These give the apple slices a flavor boost, but unflavored apple slices are equally delicious., You can even make your oven go down a bit lower, to 145ºF (62.7ºC), but many ovens will not go down this low., Make sure that they are not overlapping or else they will fuse together while they are drying.

, Bake the apple slices for an hour. When the hour has passed, remove the sheets and flip all of the the apple slices over. Bake the apples for one more hour is you prefer your apples to be a little less crispy. If you like crispy dried apples, bake them for two more hours. Just make sure to bake them evenly on each side.


You should keep an eye on your apples and check them periodically. All ovens are different and your oven might take a longer or shorter amount of time to dry the apples.

, Inside, crack the oven door open a small amount and let the apples cool inside the oven. You should not take the apples out until the oven has cooled completely (this should take one or two hours)..


There's another school of thought that you should keep your oven open during the entire cooking process, with a fan blowing on it to help circulate the air. If you decide to prop the oven open in advance, just cook the apples for 6-10 hours.

, Cover the bottom of the trays with parchment paper or some other cooking paper before placing the apples on the trays. Cooking trays that have lips are better than cookie trays because the drying apples may leak a little juice which could make a sticky mess.

, Keep them out as long as the sun is out. Cover the apples loosely with cheesecloth to protect the fruit from any pesky bugs. In the evening, before the dew falls, bring the apple slices indoors so that they do not get moldy. Place the tray in a dry spot in your house., At least once a day, turn the apple slices over so that the underside faces the sun. This will result in an even drying. You should also turn them when you bring them in for the night., The next day, spread the apple slices in the sun again and keep them out all day once more. They will probably become quite dry during the course of the day. Normally this method takes about two days to be fully completed.

, When the apples are quite dry, which is when the outside flesh is not moist at all, put them into brown paper bags and hang them up in an airy, dry place; alternatively put them in plastic airtight containers for storage.

, Try to spread them out so that none of the pieces are touching each other. If they do touch, they might fuse together while they are in the dehydrator.

, If your dehydrator has a temperature control, set it to 140ºF (60ºC). Using the dehydrator will take anywhere from 12 to 24 hours depending on the type of apple and how thickly you cut the slices., You can tell when a dried apple is done by feeling it. The slices should feel bendable or leathery and not brittle. Some people liken them to the consistency of a fresh raisin. Store the apples in airtight containers until you are ready to sit back and enjoy them.

For a milder flavor, use just 2 teaspoons of ground cinnamon and ¼ teaspoon of ground cloves. Omit the vanilla.For a more flavorful apple butter, try: 1 tablespoon of ground cinnamon, ½ teaspoon of ground nutmeg, ¼ teaspoon of ground cloves, and 1 tablespoon of vanilla extract.For a sweeter apple butter, use 1 cup (225 grams) of white sugar and 1 cup (200 grams) of light brown sugar., Use a wooden spoon or a rubber spatula to stir everything together. Be sure to scrape the bottom of the crock-pot so that the apples at the bottom get coated with the sugar mixture too.

, Don't worry if your apples haven't turned to ""butter"" by the time the hour is up.

, Once the initial hour is up, open up the crock-pot and give the apple mixture a stir. Then, cover the crock-pot again, reduce the heat to ""low,"" and cook for another 9 to 11 hours. From time-to-time, open up the lid, and give the apples a stir., This will help any excess liquid evaporate, and give you a nice, thick apple butter. If you'd like, you can stir the apple butter with a whisk to make it smoother., If the apple butter is still not smooth enough for you, take it out of the crock-pot and let it cool for 10 to 15 minutes. Pour it into a blender or food processor, and pulse it until it is smooth., Leave ¼ inch (0.64 centimeters) of space in each jar. Wipe the mouth with a clean towel, then screw the lid on tightly. Store the apple butter in the fridge.

Buy fresh celery.,
Consider growing celery.,
Wash your celery.,
Store celery in the refrigerator until you're ready to use it.,
Chop the stalk into pieces, to taste.",How to Eat Celery1," You can find celery at most grocery stores and farmers markets, and you may also encounter it in some gardens.


For the freshest celery, consider buying a locally-grown product. You can find pre-packaged celery, but it may have been shipped from who-knows-where, stored for who-knows-how-long, and sprayed with who-knows-how-many pesticides.
Buy a whole stalk of celery. Make sure that the stalk is light green, firm, and unblemished. If the stalk is whitish, soft, or cracked it may be going bad; if the leaves are wilted, choose a fresher stalk.
If you're looking for a quick and convenient snack, consider buying a package of pre-cut celery sticks. Again, pre-packaged sticks may not be as fresh as whole-stalk, locally-grown celery, but they take less work to prepare if you're in a hurry.;
, Celery is a Mediterranean plant, and it grows best in temperate climates with temperatures between 59 and 70 degrees Fahrenheit.


Celery is a long-season crop, and it may be difficult to grow in areas with brief summers. The seeds sprout best when they are sprouted indoors.
You should be able to find a package of celery seeds at a local nursery or garden-supply store. You may be able to harvest wild celery seeds; refer to botanical field guides, or ask a friend who grows celery in her garden.
If you grow your own celery, you can collect the seeds and use them as seasoning. With care and planning, you can ensure that you will have a consistent supply of celery from year to year.

, Use fresh, running water, but don't use soap or detergent. There's a chance that commercially-grown celery has been sprayed with pesticides and other chemicals, and a thorough rinsing can remove many potential contaminants. Washing can also reduce the risk of contracting any number of food-borne illnesses., You may store celery in the crisper drawer, in a well-sealed plastic bag, or in a bowl or jar with the end of the stalk submerged in a bit of water to keep it fresh.


When properly stored, fresh (whole) celery should last 3-4 weeks past the printed sell-by date; pre-packaged celery should last 2-3 days past the printed date; and cooked celery should last up to one week after it is cooked.Celery is not always sold with an expiration date. Use your intuition: if the stalk is whitish, soft, cracked, or wilted, it may be going bad.
If you won't use your celery before four weeks have passed, consider freezing it and thawing it out when you need it.

, If you buy a whole, fresh stalk of celery, cut off the leaves at the top; compost the leaves or put them out with the trash.


If you will be dipping the celery into a sauce or condiment, chop the stalk into pieces ranging from 3-4 inches in length.
If you are cooking with celery or mixing it into a salad, chop it into smaller, bite-sized pieces, or dice it finely.

Cut off the brown ends, and peel off the extra chewy part on the outside of the celery if you prefer. Chop the celery into 1-inch pieces.Onions and celery make a nice addition to this dish, but you'll need to cook them a little before adding the celery.;
, Place a medium-sized skillet over medium heat. Let the butter melt in it. Add the celery into the pan. Sprinkle on a dash of salt and pepper. Leave the celery uncovered, cooking it about 5 minutes and stirring it occasionally., After the celery starts to cook a bit, pour the broth in. Beef broth is best, but chicken or vegetable broth would also work. Mix it in with the celery. Put the lid on the skillet, and reduce the heat. Let the celery cook for another 5 minutes., Take the lid off. Let the liquid reduce down. You don't want celery soup. Rather, the liquid should thicken a bit and coat the celery. You'll only need to cook it for approximately another 5 minutes.For a bit of freshness, add a tablespoon of finely chopped fresh parsley before reducing the liquid."

Dip celery into any number of sauces.,
Try dipping your celery sticks in hummus.,
Consider dipping celery in peanut butter.,
Dip celery in salad dressing.,
Try dipping celery in yogurt or cream cheese.,
Try dipping celery in cheese sauce.,
Dip celery in soup.",How to Eat Celery2," Celery has a mild, watery flavor that blends well with most things. Experiment with your favorite soups, dips, sauces, and butters, and see what keeps you coming back for more.If you aren't sure whether a particular sauce will go well with the flavor of celery, dip a small chunk of celery in and see how you like it. It never hurts to try.

, This thick, garbanzo-bean based dip has been used in Mediterranean and Middle-Eastern cuisine for centuries, and it's the perfect compliment to the Mediterranean-grown celery.


You should be able to find pre-packaged hummus in most grocery stores. Plain hummus is great, but it can also come mixed with garlic, eggplant, red peppers, avocado, and other ingredients.
Experiment with other Middle Eastern sauces, such as tahini (a sesame seed dip) and toum (a garlic paste). Be aware that these dips tend to taste stronger and saltier than standard hummus.

, This is a classic move, and it's a great way to add protein to your snack. Most peanut butter is thick enough that you can spread it directly onto the celery stick.


Choose chunky or smooth peanut butter, to your preference. You can find peanut butter in most U.S. grocery stores, and some some stores allow you to grind your own from fresh nuts.
Spice up this classic choice by using other types of nut butter: almond butter, cashew butter, or walnut butter, for instance. These are more difficult to find in stores, but many upscale healthy-food retailers may offer them.
Make ""Ants on a Log"": Pimp out your peanut-butter celery stick with raisins, seeds, or even M&Ms. This is a great way to make celery exciting for kids.

, Ranch is a popular choice, but any creamy dressing will do: thousand island, blue cheese, Italian, Caesar, etc. Serve the dressing in a small bowl or tray for easy access. Be judicious; you can always pour more!,


Greek or plain yogurt may blend most smoothly with the flavor of the celery, but feel free to experiment with other flavors.
Plain cream cheese is fine, but consider trying any number of herbed or flavored cream cheese dips.

, Fondue, nacho cheese, or any melted cheese sauce will do. You may be able to find cheese sauce in some grocery stores; but consider making your own fondue.

, This works best with creamy soups: clam chowder, potato leek soup, or even celery soup itself.


You can use celery as a low-calorie replacement for saltine soup crackers or oyster crackers. Celery will not absorb soup in the same that crackers do, but the grooved channel in the stalk will provide a scooping mechanism.
Keep 3-4 inch long chunks alongside your soup for scooping, or chop the celery directly into the soup.

You'll need a head of celery; an onion; 15 grams (1/2 ounce) of butter, margarine, or olive oil; 900mL (1&1/2 pints) of vegetable stock or water; salt and pepper to taste., This is a quick, simple side-dish that can complement larger, meatier entrees. You can stew celery with olive oil, wine, and white sauce, among other things., Many recipes explicitly ask for celery (e.g. potato salad), but feel free to add it raw to any salad. You can also make it the star of a salad--for instance, consider making a lemon, celery, and Parmesan salad:


In a medium bowl, toss 4 thinly-sliced stalks of celery, 1/4 celery leaves, 2 tablespoons of extra-virgin olive oil, 1/2 teaspoon of finely grated lemon zest, 1 teaspoon of fresh lemon juice, and 1/4 teaspoon each of salt and pepper. Gently toss the mixture with one ounce of Parmesan cheese. Serve cold or at room temperature., Celery adds a unique flavor and texture to mixed-vegetable stir-fries, and it goes well with many rice- and pasta-based Asian and Mediterranean dishes.Chop celery stems into bite-sized portions to cook. Keep the leaves whole, and treat them like any other leafy green: they cook quickly, so add them in later than the other vegetables.
Celery is 75% water, and the rest of its bulk is stringy and fibrous--so it does not need to cook for long. Do not expect the stems to change much when cooked. although they may soften and become less chewy.

If you don’t have a potato masher, place the slices in a blender or food processor.You can also mash with a large spoon, though it may take slightly longer.;

You can also add the cardamom and nutmeg if you wish for a more complex taste. Stir to mix.

, Measure out the flour in a measuring cup and add the ½ teaspoon of baking powder. Then pour the flour and baking powder gradually into the banana mixture, stirring continuously until the dry ingredients are incorporated.You can also use an electric mixer to help mix.

, Put a small deep skillet over medium heat and heat up 2 cups of oil. Make sure that the oil is thoroughly heated before starting to fry the fritters.Try to use a cooking oil with a high smoke point, such as peanut or vegetable oil, as opposed to one with a low smoke point, like olive oil.You need to use a large amount of oil for deep-frying so that the fritters are partially submerged and can get crispy.

, Once the oil has heated, use a serving spoon to scoop up a round spoonful of batter, then drop it into the oil. The batter will start frying immediately and keep its round shape. Drop in more scoops to the skillet, spacing them out so they don’t stick together., After you see that the round fritters are getting golden around the bottom, use a spatula to flip them over so they can fry evenly. It should take only about 30 seconds for the fritters to get golden on each side, so be watchful., When the fritters are browned all around, about one minute, use the spatula to press down lightly on the fritters and see if they have finished cooking. If no batter oozes out of them, they are finished frying., Some prefer to pan-fry their banana fritters in flat pancakes rather than to deep-fry them to make spherical fritters. To pan-fry, pour in 2 tablespoons of cooking oil into a pan and wait for it to heat.


Pan-frying requires less oil and makes fritters that are softer and less crispy. It is a healthier option if you are counting calories and fat., Use a large serving spoon to pour the batter into the pan. Try to create a flat shape like a pancake rather than a spherical ball. This will ensure that the entire surface of the fritter fries equally in the oil.Because flat fritters take up more space on the pan, you may have to fry in batches depending on the size of your pan. Make sure to give each fritter enough space, and don't overlap them.

, Use a spatula to turn over the fritters when they are browned and look slightly crisped on the bottom, around one minute. Then cook the fritters on the other side for another minute., After the fritters look browned on both sides, press a spatula gently on each fritter pancake. If batter oozes out, continue cooking. Otherwise, remove the fritters from the pan., Once you’ve ensured the fritters are done, immediately take them out of the skillet with the serving spoon or spatula and drop them onto a layer of paper towel. The paper towel will absorb the excess oil from the fritters., If you want to give your banana fritters a little extra sweetness on top, sprinkle them with confectionary sugar or plain white sugar. You can also leave them as is if you prefer.

, Banana fritters are meant to be eaten hot while the outside is still crispy. Because the texture is much different when they have cooled, serve them immediately.

, Vanilla ice cream is a classic accompaniment to banana fritters. Because it is cool, creamy and soft, ice cream perfectly offsets the hot and crispy banana fritter.Other great topping for banana fritters are yogurt and whip cream. You can even top the fritters with berries or drizzle them with hot fudge or maple syrup! Don't be afraid to experiment with your toppings!

Choose ripe to slightly overripe bananas.",How to Freeze Bananas1," Bananas that have not fully ripened will not ripen correctly if frozen. As soon as a banana has ripened, it can technically be frozen. Freezing a banana just before it becomes overripe or during the beginning stages of being overripe tends to preserve a stronger flavor, though, and is generally preferred.




"
"
Peel the banana.,
Cut the banana into even chunks.,
Freeze the slices on a cookie sheet.,
Store the frozen slices in a plastic freezer bag.,
Use the banana either frozen or thawed.",How to Freeze Bananas2," If storing the banana as slices or chunks, you will need to remove the peel first. Removing the peel after the freezing process would be too difficult.


;
, The size is up to you, but cutting the banana into 1- to 2-inch (2.5 to 5 cm) chunks makes it easier to use the bananas for frozen recipes like smoothies and shakes.



, To prevent the bananas from sticking together as they freeze, place them on a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper. Make sure that the banana chunks are not touching. Place the tray in the freezer and keep it there for 20 to 30 minutes, or until the bananas have frozen solid.




, Transfer the frozen banana slices directly from the cookie sheet and into the bag. You may want to mark how many bananas are in the freezer bag, or you can store each cut up banana in its own freezer bag to keep track of how much you have. Squeeze the air out of the bag, seal it, and mark the date on the front. Stored this way, bananas can remain good for three to four months.




, If using the banana for shakes, smoothies, or other frozen confections, you can use the chunks while they are still frozen. For baked goods, however, you should thaw them out first.




"
"
Decide whether or not to peel the banana.,
Place peeled bananas on a cookie sheet and freeze.,
Store whole bananas in heavy plastic freezer bags.,
Thaw before peeling bananas.,
Use unpeeled bananas either frozen or thawed.",How to Freeze Bananas3," A banana can be frozen both in the peel and out. Freezing the banana in the peel takes a little less initial effort, but you should be aware that there are some downsides. Out of the peel, frozen bananas tend to last roughly one month longer than when stored in the peel. To peel a frozen banana, you can cut it in half, thaw in room-temperature water, then peel off the skin.





If you plan on using your frozen bananas for banana bread or an ingredient that called for mashed banana, freezing the banana in its peel is adequate. If you plan on using it for something that calls for whole pieces, freezing it out of the peel is recommended.
Also note that the skin of an unpeeled frozen banana will turn black when stored in the freezer, but the banana inside is still edible.

, To prevent the bananas from sticking together as they freeze, you need to freeze them separately before storing them together. Place the peeled bananas on a cookie sheet covered in parchment paper, spacing them apart so that they do not touch. Put the cookie sheet in the freezer for 30 minutes, or until the bananas are frozen solid.





Note that unpeeled bananas do not need to be frozen separately first.

, Place the already frozen bananas into a thick, sealable plastic bag, preferably one that is specifically labeled for freezer use. Mark the current date on the bag so that you can remember how long the bananas have been stored later on.Peeled bananas can last for roughly three to four months, while unpeeled bananas usually last for about two months.




, If you kept the peel on, you will need to wait until the banana has thawed some before you can remove it. The process will likely be a bit slimy, but the banana should still be good.




, If you are using the banana in something like a smoothie, you might be able to blend it into the smoothie while it is still fully or partially frozen. For use in baked goods, thaw the banana first.

Mash the banana by hand or by machine.,
Add 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of lemon juice per 1 cup (250 ml) of banana.,
Store and freeze in sealed containers.,
Thaw before use.",How to Freeze Bananas4," Do not attempt to mash the banana with the peel on.

, You might find it easiest to mash the banana in a food processor or blender, especially if you want a thinner puree, but bananas are soft enough to mash by hand. To mash bananas by hand, simply press down on them with a fork or spoon until they reach the desired consistency.

, One large banana makes about 1 cup (250 ml). Lemon juice preserves the banana longer, but you can also use 1/4 tsp (1.25 ml) ascorbic acid mixed with 1 Tbsp (15 ml) water. Mix either the juice or acid mixture into the mashed banana until thoroughly combined., Place the mashed bananas into sealable, plastic containers approved for use with the freezer. Mark the current date on each container and how many bananas or cups of banana are in the container. Stored in this manner, bananas can remain good for a solid four months.

, It will be difficult to measure out the mashed banana if you do not thaw it first. If using it in a frozen recipe, you can wait until it is only partially thawed. If using it in a non-frozen recipe, however, you should wait until it is completely thawed.

Freeze berries.",How to Store Berries," Farm-fresh berries make an excellent choice because you can be assured of their freshness, especially if you've picked them yourself or the farmer has reassured you when they were picked. In the shop, be on the look out for:


Berries being the color they should be; avoid any with odd spots, colors, or shades.

Berries that are intact and in good shape. If you see signs of bruising or staining on the container, this may indicate bruising and squashing.
Check for signs of mold. This is common in berries that have traveled a long way and have not sold immediately.;
, Berries are highly perishable food products. Our ancestors would eat them from the bush or within hours of collecting them, so we expect a great deal of berries by trying to keep them for longer! Try to consume them within 3 days; some berries may last up to a week but it's best to avoid storing softer berries for this long as it's likely they'll grow mildew sooner.

, These soft berries will keep best in a sealed container in the refrigerator. For more details on each type of berry, read:


How to store raspberries

How to store blueberries.







, Blackberries can be stored uncovered in the fridge. Blackberries deteriorate quickly and are best eaten on the day of purchase or picking but should last a day or so in the fridge., Store ripe mulberries in the refrigerator for no more than a few days. Their fragility means that you should store them as quickly as possible.And naturally, eat them soon after picking or purchasing, washing carefully before eating.

, Store fresh cranberries in the fridge for up to one week.They should be in a plastic bag or a covered container.Cranberries freeze well and also be dried.

, Store in the fridge for a few days and turn into delicious jam as quickly as possible!

, Store dried Goji berries in a container at or below 30ºC. If the temperatures are any higher than that, then place them in the refrigerator.Use by the use-by date on the packet, although they will keep longer if refrigerated.


Goji berries taste best at room temperature.

, Grapes are classified botanically as berries, so they're included here for completeness.Grapes can be stored in the their original plastic bag in the refrigerator for 3 to 5 days.Don't wash grapes until you're ready to eat them; they are impossible to dry and the trapped water will cause them to deteriorate quickly.Grapes ripen quickly at room temperature. They are also best eaten at room temperature, so remove them from the fridge for eating half an hour before., Leave unwashed loganberries in their original container. Store in the refrigerator (the crisper is a good place) for up to one week.Wash just before use.

, These are classified botanically as berries.Store persimmons at room temperature. Storing them in the refrigerator will cause chill damage.Eat when very ripe (they continue ripening after picking); they can be eaten as a dessert in fruit salad, as a raw fruit, in baked goods, or as a preserve.

, Lightly cover them and ensure that they're dry prior to storage.Top and tail gooseberries before using. They usually need a lot of sugar added but their high pectin content makes them ideal for making jams.

, Most berries will respond well to freezing, although you may need to be creative in how you use them on thawing. For freezing, arrange in a single layer, then stack frozen layers into plastic bags for longer freezing storage.


Wash redcurrants and remove the stems prior to freezing.
Make sure washed berries are dry prior to freezing.
Firm berries can be frozen directly in freezer bags, no need to layer them.This is suitable for such berries as cranberries, gooseberries, and blackberries.

Wait until late winter.,
Prune back all the primocanes.,

Cut back lateral branches.,
Remove damaged canes and dead canes.",How to Prune Blackberries," When planting a blackberry vine as a rooted cutting, prune off two-thirds to three-fourths of the handle or stem, leaving only a short crown behind. Doing so stimulates the buds at the crown of the cutting, encouraging them to grow more vigorously.The ""crown"" of the cutting refers to the portion of the cutting that extends just above ground once the cutting is planted.
Cutting off most of the stem also removes any potentially damaged or diseased tissue that may have been on the stem.
Do this pruning after you have already planted the cutting in the ground.
If you are planting a seedling, bush, or vine with well-established erect canes, do not prune them back.;
, First year growth is usually poor, so late during the first winter, you should cut back the canes back until they are roughly 3 to 4 inches (7.6 to 10 cm) high. This encourages the plant to develop sturdier canes that can support more fruit.


If you are satisfied with your first year growth, however, pruning back the canes so dramatically may not be necessary. Blackberries producing satisfactory growth in their first year can be pruned according to standard annual requirements.

, As soon as you harvest the berries from one floricanes, you should remove the entire cane from the plant by cutting it off at its base, near the main stem of the plant.


Floricanes are usually second-year canes and are the canes responsible for producing the majority of the plant's fruit. They are spent after producing fruit, which is why you should remove them.
Only remove the canes that bore fruit that year. You should be able to see visible fruit stalks on the canes even after the berries have been removed.

, Once each primocane has exceeded its desired height by roughly 4 inches (10 cm), you should it back down to its desired height.


Primocanes are new or ""first year"" canes. They usually start as green shoots but should mature by fall, changing into woody brown canes.
Primocanes of vigorous, erect blackberries should be headed down so that they are 48 to 60 inches (122 to 152 cm) above ground. Less vigorous erect blackberries should be headed to a height between 36 and 48 inches (91 and 122 cm), and semi-erect blackberries should be headed down until they are roughly 4 to 6 inches (10 to 15 cm) above the top trellis wire.
Heading causes the cane to stiffen. Once a cane stiffens, it will be able to support the weight of fruit and foliage better, making it less likely to break.
Heading also encourages lateral buds in the primocanes to develop into lateral branches. The lateral branches are also the plant's fruiting branches. As such, the plant can produce more fruit when it has more lateral branches.

, You should periodically clean out canes if the plant gets too crowded. Doing so increases the amount of light received by the plant and the airflow between plants. As a result, the blackberries grow better and are less prone to disease.


If there are multiple blackberry plants in a row, maintain a row width of 18 to 24 inches (45 to 60 cm) at the base of the rows by cutting back low base canes once they threaten to crowd each other out.
Remove weak primocanes when you cut off dying floricanes after your floricane harvest. During active growth, primocanes are considered weak when they exhibit poor foliage growth, appear damaged, or show signs of disease.

, You can allow root suckers to develop into rows up to 12 inches (30 cm) wide.Once they grow beyond this point, though, you should trim them back down to a width of 12 inches (30 cm) or less.


Root suckers grow out of the crown or base of the plant. They aren't very practical since they do not develop fruit, and once they grow too long, they start stealing too much crucial energy from the rest of the plant.

, Heavy dormant pruning should be performed once the plants are well into dormancy and just before they return to a state of active growth.


Late winter and early spring are best. Harsh winters can injure the tips of canes and laterals. You should wait until most of the winter passes so that you can take care of these damages spots while doing the rest of your pruning.
Doing the majority of your heavy pruning during the dormant season decreases the occurrence of wounds that can invite diseases like cane blight.

, Shorten all of the primocanes on your plant by about one-third their current height.By cutting back the canes, you encourage lateral fruiting shoots on the lower portion of these canes to branch out in the spring. As a result, the plant spends less energy on growing outward and more energy on its fruit producing branches.

, For upright blackberries, thin out the new primocanes produced from root buds and crown buds so that there are only six or eight canes per linear foot (30 cm) of row.


If you are working with a type of blackberry plant that does not produce root buds and only produces crown buds, simply remove weak canes measuring less than 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) in diameter at the base. Then, thin out the remaining new primocanes until there are only five or six per hill.

, Most lateral branches should be trimmed back to a length of 12 to 18 inches (30 to 45 cm). Cutting these branches back will encourage larger fruit to form since you are essentially forcing the plant to spend its energy in a more concentrated space.


Leave the lateral canes a bit longer on vigorous canes and a bit shorter on slower canes.
If you notice winter damage on a lateral cane, cut it back far enough to remove this damage, even if doing so will shorten the branch more than usual.
Completely remove lateral branches from the lowest 18 inches (45 cm) on vigorous canes and lateral branches from the lowest 12 inches (30 cm) on weaker canes. Doing so improves air circulation, thereby minimizing the risk of disease and making harvest easier later on.

, Any weak or damaged canes that have not already been removed by this point should be pruned, as well.Weak canes include any cane with a diameter less than 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) at its base.
Canes that rub or intertwine with one another should also be removed.
Damaged canes, diseased canes, or dead canes should be cut off, as well, to prevent the possible spread of disease or insects.

Give your strawberry flowers away as a fresh gift.",How to Make Strawberry Flowers," Foremost, you’ll want to get the best strawberries you can find. For your flowers, buy large strawberries that are bright red. Lightly press one of the strawberries with your thumb to test for firmness. If the strawberries are too soft, they will be hard to shape. The more uniform they are, the better your flowers will look.


Wash and dry your strawberries before you make your flowers.
You’ll also need at least one skewer to hold the strawberry while you cut your petals into it.
For cutting, use a small paring knife. Sharpen the knife before you begin for the best results.;
, The base is the end of the strawberry with leaves. This will keep the berry in place while you create your flower. Only push the skewer in far enough to hold the berry firmly.


You don’t want to hit the skewer as you carve your top petals.

, Depending on the size of your strawberry, you should be able to get four to six of these petals circling around the bottom of your strawberry.


After you make your incisions, use the flat of the knife to slightly bend each petal outwards, so it curls like a flower.
As you cut, be careful to only cut into the strawberry slightly. Avoid removing any part of it.

, Continue making slight cuts around the berry. Each row will have fewer petals as you move upward.


As you get toward the top, make your cuts as thin and close to the skin of the berry as possible. This will help your petals curl outward and look more realistic.

, To do this, drive your knife downward into the top of your berry to create the look of final petals.


After you make these final cuts, spin your flower around and look at it. Adjust it as you see fit. Make the petals deeper or curl them out more if you feel like this would improve the aesthetic.

, To make your strawberry flowers more of a treat or special gift, you can add sweet drizzle of melted white, dark, or milk chocolate.


For even more decadence and a geometric look, dip your strawberry flowers completely in chocolate.Melt chocolate chips or chopped up chocolate over a double boiler or in low power increments in the microwave. Stir often. To temper the chocolate, add a few extra pieces of solid chocolate to your melted chocolate and stir them in until they melt.To create an even drizzle, spoon your melted chocolate into a plastic sandwich bag. Cut off a tiny bit of one corner of the bag. Squeeze the chocolate onto your strawberry in this hole in the bag as though you are piping icing.
Lay out your strawberries on wax paper to let the chocolate harden so that it doesn’t become messy or smudged.

, Interesting sprinkles can give your strawberry roses a pop of color and visual interest.


For a touch of class, add single edible sugar pearls in the petals of your strawberries.You can find these at most grocery stories in the confectionary aisle.
To add these pearls to your strawberries, use a dot of melted white chocolate as a kind of edible glue. Simply dip one side of the pearl in the chocolate, and then place it on one of the petals of your strawberry. Don’t move the strawberries until this chocolate dries.

, Rainbow sprinkles will transform your strawberries with a bit of whimsy. Adding sprinkles will make these fancy strawberries a kid-friendly treat.


Adding sprinkles to your strawberries work best with chocolate.
First, either dip your strawberry into melted chocolate or drizzle with the melted chocolate of your choice.
While the chocolate is still wet, shake your sprinkles onto so that they stick.
Allow your strawberries to dry on waxed or parchment paper.

, You can use stems from plastic flowers for a reusable option or cut the stems off of fresh flowers.


For fresh stems, take a sharp knife to create a 45-degree angle on each of your stems. This will help them glide easily into the strawberries.
Carefully stick your stems into the base of your strawberries where the skewers were. Only push them in far enough that the flowers feel secure. You don’t want the stem to protrude from the top of your strawberry flower.
Place your finished flowers in a vase of your choice to serve.
If you don’t want to use stems, you can also dye your skewers green. Mix some green food coloring and water in a large dish like a roasting pan. Then, lay all your skewers in the pan, and leave them to dye for 30 minutes. Lay them out on a paper towel to dry.

, Strawberry flowers are deceptively simple, and so they are an impressive refreshment at any gathering and party.


Strawberry flowers are a beautiful addition to a wedding shower or baby shower served in a vase on either skewers or stems or added to a fruit plate.
For a more adult treat, make the classic champagne and strawberries a little more lovely.Simply add a strawberry flower to the rim of each glass. To do this, make an approximately half-inch incision in the bottom of the strawberry, and then push it onto the side of the champagne flute.

, Whether it’s for a party, your own enjoyment, or something like a bake sale, strawberry flowers can greatly enhance the appearance of cakes, cupcakes, and tarts.


Add strawberry flowers to the top of your favorite strawberry shortcake recipe to make a classic just a bit more refined.To add strawberry flowers to a baked good, simply press them into the icing so that they stick and remain where you place them.

, Many people give fruit baskets and fruit bouquets as gifts. A handmade strawberry flower bouquet can be a sweet gift to show you are thinking of someone.


This is great for Mother’s Day, a significant other, a birthday, or comforting someone who is ill or grieving.
Tie a ribbon around your bouquet, and add a hand written note for a little personalization.
Deliver your strawberry flowers as soon as you can, so they are fresh when the recipient gets them.

, Choose the darkest coloured, purplish blackberries - the red ones won't taste as nice, and the green ones haven't ripened yet.

, (Pulling straight down can damage the berries). If the berry doesn't easily release, it's not ripe yet. If it falls apart in your fingers, it's overripe and should be discarded.

, Once you've got enough berries from that hedge, move onto the next one. Blackberries are common fruit - you'll find them almost everywhere, so looking for them won't be hard.

Pick the bananas according to what you will use them for and when you plan to use them.,
Buy only the amount of bananas you feel you can consume before they become overripe.,
Look for bananas with no brown spots or obvious signs of handling damage.,
Consider buying smaller bunches of bananas at varying stages of ripeness so you can eat them as they ripen in the following days.

",How to Choose Bananas," Bananas that are still basically green will ripen slowly over a period of time, whereas, already fully ripe bananas will become overripe very quickly.


For cooking, such as banana pudding, you can choose ripe bananas if you buy only the amount you need for the recipe, and use them in short order.
For eating daily, choose a bunch of bananas that show signs of ripening, preferably with some very nearly ripe to be eaten shortly after they are bought some greener ones which will ripen in a few days to be eaten then.;
, Make this decision based on your own experience from previous purchases.

Purchase bananas that are green on the ends and yellow in the middle.,
Store bananas at room temperature until they are ripe.,
Hang your bananas on a banana hanger.,
Keep your bananas separate from other fruits and vegetables.,
Place bananas in the refrigerator once they are ripe.",How to Keep Bananas from Ripening Too Fast1," This means they are slightly under-ripe.


Make sure the bananas have no brown spots or blemishes. Bruises and punctures leave the banana exposed to air, which speeds up the ripening process.
Do not choose bananas that are already yellow. Bananas ripen at a rapid pace and their shelf-life is very short.For this reason, you want to make sure you buy bananas that are on the greener side; this will give you more time to properly store your bananas before the ripening process occurs.;
, Avoid exposing them to heat as this will speed up the ripening process.


Do not place bananas in the fridge before they are ripe. This can actually have a reverse effect and turn your banana peels brown faster. This occurs because the cold causes the cell walls to break down prematurely, which allows the production of melanin, turning bananas completely black. Contra-intuitively, the inside of the banana will still not be ripe since the cold inhibits the ripening process of the fruit., This prevents them from getting bruised and becoming exposed to air. You can also seal the stem of the banana bunch with plastic wrap.This limits the amount of oxygen the stem receives and can keep bananas fresh for another week.

, Fruits and vegetables give off a gas that speeds ripening.


Storing produce together can speed up the ripening process. Plants naturally produce a gas called ethylene, which causes them to ripen. Fruits or vegetables that are already brown give off more ethylene than normal, causing nearby fresh produce to ripen faster.
Do not store bananas in sealed bags. This will cause the bananas to turn brown faster because the ethylene hormone will be unable to escape from the air surrounding the bananas.

, Now that the ripening process has begun, you can safely delay it with the application of cold temperature.


To stop ripening, you need to slow down the chemical reaction. Cold temperatures will slow down the reaction, delaying the banana fruit from ripening.
Do not be alarmed if your banana peel turns completely black, which it most likely will. This is due to the pigment of the peel turning black and does not have anything to do with the actual freshness of the banana. The banana should still taste flavorful and remain slightly firm.

Place peeled bananas in an airtight plastic container and put it in the freezer.,
Brush the banana in lime or lemon juice.,
Dip peeled bananas in a vinegar water solution.,
Soak bananas in a water solution with crushed vitamin C. If you don't have access to other fruits or vinegar, vitamin C can achieve a similar effect when dissolved in water.",How to Keep Bananas from Ripening Too Fast2," You can thaw the bananas for use at a later date.

Although peeled bananas have no protection against air exposure, the airtight sealing acts to limit the amount of fresh air that the bananas get. The freezing temperature will slow down the ethylene emission more than simply refrigerating it.






Unlike refrigerated bananas, frozen bananas will not be edible immediately. You will need to leave bananas at room temperature for about an hour to allow them to thaw.







, The acid coating acts as a preserving agent and keeps the banana yellow longer.


You do not need to saturate the banana in lemon juice. Adding more lemon does not equal better preservation. Adding to much will make your banana taste sour.
For sweeter alternatives, replace lemon juice with pineapple, orange, or apple juice. These are all acidic enough to slow the browning process without needing to be diluted. Apple juice is also mild enough to be nearly undetectable; opt for the other juices if you plan on later mixing the banana with other fruit.

, This also uses acidity to preserve the banana but uses vinegar instead of fruit juice.


Using vinegar is a nice alternative if other fruit juices are distorting the taste too much. Simply add ¼ cup of vinegar for every cup of water. Dip the banana, sliced or whole, into the water for about three minutes.
Avoid leaving bananas in the vinegar water solution for longer than three minutes. Submerging the banana can cause it to become too soft and can impart a strong vinegary taste, which is likely less appetizing than lemon or lime juice.

,


Crush a single vitamin C tablet with a spoon and sprinkle it in a glass of water. Stir the solution with a spoon and dip your bananas in the water for a few seconds.






Effervescent vitamin C tablets work especially well for this. Put one tablet in a glass of water. Once the effervescing stops, skip stirring and dip your bananas in the water immediately for a few seconds.

Bake banana bread.,
Blend a Biscoff banana apple smoothie.,
Freeze melted bananas into Bananas Foster Popsicles.",How to Keep Bananas from Ripening Too Fast3," Just because you may not have saved all bananas from ripening doesn't mean you can't use them in tasty treats.


Banana bread is actually the sweetest and most flavorful when over-ripe bananas are used. For bananas considered a ""lost cause,"" banana bread is usually the answer.Bananas are actually edible longer than you might imagine. As long as your banana does not have mold, fruit flies, or traces of fruit fly eggs, it will most likely be edible regardless of its softness or blackness.

, Throw your over-ripe bananas into the blender with a few other ingredients and create a tasty drink.


All you need is one over-ripe banana, half an apple peeled and cored, four Biscoff cookies (can be purchased at most grocery stores), a dash of cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract, one cup of milk, and a handful of ice cubes.
Place the banana, apple, and Biscoff cookies into the blender first and mix until smooth. Add the other ingredients and continue blending. You can continue adding milk until you've reached your desired consistency.
For added texture, add whole oats or blend them into the smoothie as well.] This will give your smoothie a crunchy element to offset the richness., Bananas Foster is a popular New Orleans dessert and is very simple to make.You will need 2 large, very ripe bananas that have been thinly sliced; 2 tablespoons (29.6 ml) of brown sugar; 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) of butter; ½ teaspoon of cinnamon; 1/2 cup of plain Greek yogurt; ½ cup of milk; 1 teaspoon of vanilla; and 1 teaspoon of rum extract.
First, add your bananas, brown sugar, butter, and cinnamon to a small bowl and microwave in 30 second intervals until the bananas are soft. Stir this mixture. Allow the bananas to cool, then add the mixture to a blender along with the Greek yogurt, milk, vanilla, and rum extract. Blend these ingredients. Pour the blended mixture into Popsicle molds and place them in the freezer for a few hours until they are completely frozen through. Pop them out of the Popsicle mold when you are ready to serve."

Combine the ingredients in a saucepan.,
Cook over medium heat.,
Pour the mixture through a strainer to extract the seeds.,
Refrigerate the puree.",How to Make Raspberry Puree1," Place the raspberries, sugar and lemon juice in a large saucepan. You may use fresh raspberries if they’re in season, or frozen raspberries, which are available year round and are picked and frozen at the peak of freshness. Stick with the minimum amount of sugar and lemon juice that the recipe recommends for now. More can be added to taste later if the puree turns out too tart or sweet.If you are using frozen raspberries, allow them to thaw enough to separate from one another or defrost them in the microwave before heating to make puree.;
, Turn on the stove to low-medium or medium heat and begin heating the raspberry mixture. The sugar will begin to melt and combine with the liquid from the raspberries and lemon juice, stewing the fruit. Cook for around 10 minutes or until the raspberries begin to break down and integrate with the liquid, stirring frequently.Cooking on too high a heat might cause the mixture to scorch.
Sugar in particular has a very low burning point. Make sure there is another liquid in the pan to dissolve the sugar so that it doesn’t burn as it melts.

, Position a fine mesh strainer over a large bowl and pour the raspberry mixture over the top. The liquid will run through the strainer while the larger solids will be trapped. Use the back of a spoon to force the remaining fruit through the strainer until only the seeds are left. This method will result in a thick puree that contains some small chunks of the stewed raspberries., Chill the finished puree until it has had time to set up. The puree will thicken on its own as it sits. Take the puree out once it is ready to be used or served. You can also serve it warm as a topping for cakes, custards and ice cream, though it will be slightly thinner than puree that has been refrigerated.Raspberry puree will stay good in the refrigerator for a week or longer.
You also have the option of freezing the puree until you need it.

Place the frozen berries in freezer bags.",How to Pick Strawberries," When you pull the strawberries off their plant, you need some type of container to put them, so they don’t get damaged. If you’re at a you-pick farm, they will probably have containers that you can use. However, they usually charge for them, so you may want to bring your own. You don’t want a container that’s too deep because you shouldn’t pile the berries more than 5-inches deep or you may bruise the ones on the bottom.Lightweight containers work best because you’ll have to carry them with you as you pick. Tupperware, metal oven pans, and plastic dishpans with sides that are at least 3-inches tall work well. Wicker baskets are a good option too.
Because you may need to sit or kneel on the ground to pick the berries, you may also want to bring knee pads or a garden cushion to make it more comfortable.;
, When you’re trying to decide which strawberries to pick, it’s important to choose ones that are fully red. Strawberries don’t continue to ripen after they’re picked, so they should look like you’d want to eat them when you pick them. In particular, look at the tip of the strawberry -- if it’s red, you can pick it. Avoid berries with white, yellow, or greenish tips.Make sure that the strawberries that you pick are plump and feel firm when you touch them too.

, When you’re ready to pick a strawberry, take hold of its stem approximately 1-inch above the berry between your index finger and thumbnail. Cradle the fruit against your palm without squeezing to avoid bruising the berry.Some varieties of strawberries, such as Surecrop berries, are easier to pick than others because they easily snap off the stem when they're mature so you don't have to worry too much about handling them very carefully. However, it's best to handle all berries gently in case you don't know what type they are.

, The best way to ensure that you don't damage the berries you're picking is to sever them from the plant at the stem. Gently twist it between your fingers to and pull lightly. Allow the strawberry roll down into your palm, and continue the process until your hand is full -- that usually means 3 or 4 berries. Carefully set the berries down in your container, and repeat until you have enough fruit.Be careful not to step or kneel on the strawberries or plants as you’re picking.
If you come across strawberries that are rotten, riddled with insects, burned by sun, or otherwise damaged, remove them from the plant. At home, you can simply throw them away. At a you-pick farm, you’ll usually be directed to leave the damaged berries in the center of the row for collection.
If possible, don’t leave your containers of picked berries out in the sun. Find a shady spot to keep them so they’ll stay fresh.
Try to drive home carefully so the strawberries aren’t jostled too much. That will keep them from getting bruised.

, If you enjoy eating strawberries regularly, planting your own may be the best option. That way, you’ll always have your own batch to pick each season. There are varieties that will grow in just about every climate, so you can probably Grow Strawberries wherever you live. It’s often best to start with bare-roots plant rather than seeds to increase your chances for plentiful, healthy berries.In most climates, strawberries should be planted in early spring. However, if you live in a mild climate, you can also plant in the fall.
If you live in an area with cold winters, make sure to mulch your strawberry plants to protect them from frost and other winter damage. You can lay straw loosely over the plants to keep them safe in the cold weather.
Strawberry plants are subject to a variety of pests and diseases, such strawberry root weevils, mites, and verticillium wilt. Make sure to purchase plants that are certified disease-free and remove any diseased portions or rotten fruit to reduce the chance of problems.
You’ll need to replace your strawberry plants when you begin to notice signs of decline. Typically, the plants will last approximately three years.

, If you don’t have a green thumb, you can still enjoy picking strawberries -- just find a local farm where you’re allowed to pick your own. Usually, these farms have large fields of strawberries, so you have an even better chance of finding plenty of high quality fruit than you would with a couple of plants in your yard. Berries from a you-pick farm are also healthier than store-bought berries because they usually don’t have as much pesticide and fungicide residue.You-pick farms typically sell strawberries by the pound.
In many cases, the farms might also have other in-season fruit that you can pick, such as raspberries and blueberries, so you can pick a good variety of fruit during your trip.
If you’re not sure where to find a you-pick farm in your area, do an online search to locate the nearest option.

, Strawberries are typically available for harvesting during the months of April, May, and June, depending on where you live. The warmer your location, the earlier that the berries are usually ripe. Weather, such as rain and cool temperatures, can have a serious effect production, though, so if you’re going to pick at a farm, call beforehand to ensure that there is a supply available.If you’re going to a you-pick farm on a weekend, it’s best to leave early. In many cases, the fields will be picked clean by mid-day.
Keep in mind that strawberries picked on hot, sunny days are likely going to spoil more quickly than those picked on cool days. If you’re not going to use the strawberries that you pick right away, it’s best to pick them in cooler part of the morning or on a cool, overcast day.
It takes approximately 10 to 15 minutes to pick a quart of strawberries, so make sure you give yourself enough time to pick as many as you need.

, No matter how discerning you are when you’re picking or how careful you are with them afterward, you may wind up with some rotten or damaged berries when you get home. Carefully pour the fruit into shallow pans and sort through it so you can remove any that show obvious signs of damage.Rotten strawberries should be thrown away, while you can toss or eat those that were squashed in transit

, Strawberries will mold quickly if they’re left at room temperature. The best temperature for preserving them is between 32 and 36 degree Fahrenheit, which is why you should keep them in the refrigerator. Store them in a shallow container, and place them in your crisper drawer if possible.In the refrigerator, strawberries will last about a week, depending on how ripe they were when you picked them. It’s usually best to eat them within a few days of picking, though.

, While you should wash your strawberries before you eat or bake with them, it’s important not to do it until you’re ready to use them. That’s because washing the berries makes them spoil more quickly. Run them quickly under cold water to get them clean.Don’t allow the berries to soak or sit in the water when you’re washing. That will make them mushy and more prone to mold.

, If you’ve picked more berries than you can eat within a few days of picking, you’ll want to freeze the excess so they don’t spoil before you can use them. Use a knife to cut away the green, lefty cap at the top of the berries. Next, put them in a colander and wash them in cold water.Allow the berries to dry for at least 10 minutes to get rid of any excess water before freezing.

, Place your clean berries on a cookie sheet or baking pan that's been lined with wax paper. Make sure that they're in a single layer, so none of the berries stick to one another as they freeze. Allow them to sit in the freezer until they're completely solid.You can slice the berries before placing them on the cookie sheet if you prefer.

, Once the berries have undergone their initial freeze, you can transfer them to plastic freezer bags. It's important to take the time to squeeze out as much air as possible from the bags to prevent freezer burn. After they berries are packaged, try to place them on the coldest shelf in your freezer.If you have a vacuum sealer system, it’s a good idea to use it on the freezer bags of strawberries before they go in the freezer.
If you don’t have a vacuum sealer, close the freezer bags almost all the way, leaving just enough room for a straw. Suck all the air out of the bag through the straw, and pinch the straw closed. Pull it out, and quickly close the bag to keep it as air-tight as possible.
Write the date on the freezer bag before you put the strawberries in the freezer so you’ll always know how old they are.
Strawberries will last for approximately 6 months in the freezer.

Freeze or refrigerate until needed.",How to Make Raspberry Puree2," Combine the 2 cups fresh or frozen raspberries, 1/4 cup sugar and 1-2 teaspoons of lemon juice in a blender or food processor. Blend until the mixture is smooth. The puree will still be somewhat thin at this point with minimal clumps or pieces of raspberry.Be careful not to blend to the point that the seeds become ground up and pass through the strainer.
Blending results in a puree with a much smoother consistency, making it ideal for for use in sauces, smoothies, etc.

, Pour the blended raspberries, sugar and lemon juice through a mesh sieve or conical chinois strainer. Because of how smooth the mixture will be after it comes out of the food processor, you’ll need to use a strainer with very fine grating in order to filter out the seeds.Chinois are most commonly used by chefs to strain purees.

, Put the puree in the refrigerator to allow it to cool and thicken until you plan to use it. Purees also freeze well, and will retain their freshness far longer than the whole fruit.Make raspberry puree far in advance or in bulk and freeze it to have it on hand for use in other recipes.

Change the proportions of ingredients.,
Make a sweeter puree.,
Thicken it up.,
Substitute another liquid.",How to Make Raspberry Puree3," Sample the puree as it's simmering or after it has been blended to ensure that the balance of sweet and tart flavors is just right. Recipes are important guidelines for making sure a dish comes out correctly, but the best cooking is always done to taste and can be altered based on personal preference. Add more sugar to give the puree a more dessert-like quality, or increase the lemon juice to bring out the natural acidic notes of the raspberries when the puree is used in other recipes.Simmering the puree as opposed to blending it can give you more control over the flavor, as the heat will cook out the natural tartness of the raspberries, and sweetness and tartness can then be modified using sugar and lemon juice.
Always taste purees and sauces as they're being prepared.

, Up the amount of sugar in the recipe, or supplement with confectioners sugar or honey for a sweeter variety of puree. Not everybody likes sour things, and the tart flavors of the raspberries and lemon juice can dominate when not counterbalanced by sweeteners. Sweetening the puree will make it more palatable when it is being served on its own as a topping or on the side as part of a dessert plate.Confectioners sugar blends and dissolves better than regular granulated sugar because of how finely it is ground., If you want your puree nice and thick, use 2/3 tablespoons of cornstarch along with 1/4 cup of water to bulk up the consistency. Cornstarch will do little to affect the flavor of the puree, but will thicken it nicely to allow it to stand up better to cooking, microwaving and thawing after it's been frozen. Thickened raspberry purees can even be used as fillings for cupcakes and pastries, which require that the texture be more substantial.


Stir in the cornstarch a little at a time until the desired thickness is reached. Adding too much at once may cause the puree to congeal.Keep in mind that the puree will thicken on its own somewhat as it cools.

, Use orange juice, water or even honey in place of lemon juice to cut down on the tartness of the recipe. Raspberries are a naturally sour fruit, and too much acid can overpower the flavors of the puree. Try mixing the lemon juice with water first, and if that's still too tart, gradually add more water or replace the lemon juice altogether.Don't use more liquid than the recipe calls for. If you're cutting the lemon juice with water, make sure the proportions together still add up to roughly 1-2 teaspoons.
It is not strictly necessary to use lemon juice in the recipe at all. The acid in the lemon brightens the tartness of the raspberries and also helps preserve the freshness of the fruit, but all that is needed is enough liquid to break down the raspberries as they cook or blend.

Wash the berries gently.,
Spread the blackberries on a baking tray.,
Place the blackberries into the freezer.,
Transfer berries into a freezer-proof bag.,
Freeze for up to six months.",How to Freeze Blackberries1," When you've picked (or bought) a selection of ripe, juicy blackberries, give them a gentle (but thorough) washing. Pour the berries into a colander and run cool water over them while you gently shake them or sift through them with your fingers. Allow to drain well and gently pat dry with a soft towel to remove excess moisture.


As you wash and dry your berries, take the opportunity to remove any rotten, under-ripe, or damaged berries. You'll also want to remove any leaf litter, dirt, or other debris.;
, Line a metal pan or tray with parchment paper and spread your blackberries out on it so that none are touching each other. Do not forget the parchment paper -- without it, the berries will freeze to the pan and can break up when you try to remove them.


If you have too many blackberries to give each their own space on your baking tray, it's alright to simply pour them all over the tray. However, if you want separate, individual blackberries later, you'll have to break up the frozen block of berries that you'll get from this method.
If you've got lots of berries that you want to keep separate, an even better idea is to lay down a second layer of parchment paper over the top of your first layer of berries to double your working space.

, Set your tray on a level surface in your freezer (so that your berries don't roll to one side of the tray) and allow your berries to freeze completely. You may want to leave your blackberries in the freezer overnight to ensure that they're completely frozen through. If you do this, don't forget about them — left uncovered in the freezer, berries can easily develop freezer burn within a few days., When your berries are frozen solid, pour them into a plastic freezer bag. Squeeze as much air as you can out of the bag, then seal it and return it to the freezer. The thicker the plastic and the less air in the bag, the better — thin bags and air pockets can both contribute to freezer burn.


If you own a vacuum-sealing device (like, for instance, the FoodSaver), use it here to remove the air from your bag for the absolute best possible protection against freezer burn.
Alternatively, if you're not worried about your berries freezing together, you can skip the baking sheet altogether and simply place the washed and dried berries into a freezer bag directly. If you do this, the berries will freeze together into a large block, which can hurt their visual presentation, but shouldn't effect their taste.

, Berries frozen this way are good for at least six months, though some sources recommend using them up to eight months after the date of freezing.The frozen berries can be used in cooking and baking recipes (like blackberry pie, for example) and can even be enjoyed as a semi-thawed dessert on their own or with a sprinkling of sugar.


As a general rule, you shouldn't thaw berries before using them in baking recipes, as this can throw off their moisture content.For more information on using frozen berries, see the corresponding section below.

First, gather all of your strawberries.,
Start by picking off the green tops from every strawberry.,
Cut the tops off the strawberries with a knife.,
Now, you're ready to start slicing!,
FOR YOURSELF.,
FOR YOUR FAMILY.,
FOR A PARTY.,
Wash your berries!",How to Cut Strawberries for Every Occasion," If you're making them for yourself, 6-8 might be a good number. But, if they're for a party, 2 packages might be sufficient.;
, If you leave a bit on, that's okay. Just try to get most of it off.

, Don't cut the nice red part, just cut the raw, green or white part off.

, Decide if you're slicing for yourself, your family or a large party.

, To easily cut strawberries for yourself, turn each strawberry upside-down onto the freshly cut top. Now, cut right down the middle. Turn the strawberry around and cut down the middle again to make quartered strawberries. Repeat for each berry.

, For your fun-loving, demanding family, you might want to try a more complex shape. Turn each berry upside-down onto the tops. cut right down the center. Now, place the berry halves down so the insides are facing up. Slice each berry half vertically from the top right side, down the the bottom left side. This will make a pretty, yet complicated shape!

, Now you have to please a large crowd of party-goers! But don't worry! Slicing strawberries for a party is a snap! All you have to do is start by putting each berry onto its side. slice thin slices from the top and work your way down to the bottom. Simply, this creates round, thin, pretty slices!

, This step is a must! Always remember that washing them after they're cut makes them taste way fresher!

Rinse and dry the berries as normal.,
Mix with sugar.,
Pack the berries into bags or airtight containers.,
Freeze for up to nine months.",How to Freeze Blackberries2," Sweetening your blackberries before freezing them helps keep the berries' natural color and texture intact through the freezing process. It also makes the berries last longer in the freezer.Freezing sweetened berries requires the same washing process as for unsweetened berries: gently rinse and drain the berries, then allow to air dry or gently pat with a soft towel to remove any moisture.


As above, you'll also want to remove any unripe or overripe berries before proceeding, as well as any leaf matter or debris.

, Next, add your berries to a large mixing bowl and add about 1/2 to 3/4 cups sugar for every quart of berries (as a reminder, one quart is equal to four cups). Mix the berries and sugar thoroughly, but very gently — your goal is to coat the berries with sugar, not to mash them into a jam or paste. The sugar should combine with the natural moisture of the berries (along with the juice of any berries that do break) to form a syrupy mixture that should cover the berries.

, Next, pour the berries into seal-able, airtight plastic containers (like, for instance, Tupperware. Try to fill the containers nearly to their tops — leaving about 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) of head space or less is ideal.The less air remaining in the container, the better, but resist the urge to force the berries into a container that's too small for them, as this can crush the berries.


You can also use plastic freezer bags as described above, though, with sweetened berries, this can become somewhat messy.
There's no need to freeze sweetened blackberries separately, since the sugar helps protect their appearance and texture from the effects of freezing. However, if you especially want separately-frozen berries, you can still use the baking sheet method described above without harming the berries.

, Sweetened blackberries should last for a minimum of nine months, though some sources say that they can last up to a full year.The sweetened berries can be used like unsweetened berries in a wide variety of baking recipes or enjoyed on their own. However, if using the berries in baking recipes, it's important to remember to take the sugar you added to the berries into account and adjust your recipe accordingly.


Because of this point, you may find that it's a wise idea to label your freezing container with a volume of berries in the container and the amount of sugar added along with the date of freezing.

Don't thaw berries for most baking recipes.,
Roll frozen berries in flour to prevent bleeding.,
Thaw berries for liquid recipes.,
Thaw berries intended for raw consumption.",How to Freeze Blackberries3," As noted above, when you use frozen berries in baking recipes, you'll almost never want to thaw them before adding them to the recipe. Doing this creates extra moisture in the recipe and can lead to a final product that's mushy or watery.


Some people find that thawing their berries about halfway in the microwave before baking produces great-tasting results without adding too much moisture.If you want to try this, note that the exact amount of time you'll need to keep your berries in the microwave for will vary based on the number of berries you have and the power of your microwave.

, Sometimes, when using frozen berries in baking recipes, the berries can ""bleed"", producing discolorations throughout the batter.Though this won't effect their taste, it can make the finished products a little less appealing to look at. To minimize the effects of bleeding, try gently rolling your frozen berries in flower before adding them to your baking recipe. This helps contain the berries' moisture, minimizing bleeding.

, There are some instances where you'll want to thaw your berries before using them in your recipe. Usually, these are cases where the extra moisture that comes from thawing is a benefit to the dish, like blackberry sauces and toppings for ice cream, shortcake, and so on. To quickly thaw blackberries, place them in an airtight plastic bag (or keep them in their original freezer bag) and submerge them in cold water for about 10-15 minutes.


To keep the bag of blackberries from floating and thawing unevenly, you may want to weigh it down with a heavy dish or bowl.

, Another situation in which you'll want to thaw your blackberries is if you intend to eat them raw. Though frozen berries make a great summertime treat, sometimes there's nothing like ordinary berries. For raw berries, you may want to use the quick thawing method above, or simply leave them on the kitchen counter overnight. Dumping your berries in a container of cool, clean water after thawing them to wash away any frost or debris leftover from freezing. At this point, you may also want to sift through your berries and remove any crushed or damaged ones.


Don't be put off by the soft, juicy appearance of thawed blackberries. Though they may not look as pristine as fresh berries, if they were fresh when they were frozen, they're safe to eat.

",How to Freeze Raspberries," During peak season, foods are usually the freshest, taste the best, and are least expensive. Peak season for raspberries is usually May through September., Ripe raspberries should be bright red and evenly colored. Dark colored berries may be overripe and won't taste the best. Dark sections on the berries are probably just bruises, which are harmless., Although raspberries are very fragile, they should still be firm to the touch. Gently press on the berries. If they give very easily or are too mushy, they're probably overripe., This can be a sign of overly ripe fruit and is a good environment for mold to grow in., If you see any white or green fuzz on the berries, avoid buying the container. If you've already taken a container home and find mold, be sure to get rid of any berries with mold on them to stop it from spreading. Also get rid of any overly mushy berries, as these are a breeding ground for mold., Don't rinse the berries directly under running water- they are fragile and can break apart. Instead, place them in a colander. Then dip the colander in a bowl filled with cold water and swish the berries around., The fastest way to do this is by spreading them out on a paper towel.

,, Don't allow the berries to touch. They will freeze together and you'll destroy them trying to get them apart.,, You want to make sure the berries are frozen solid before removing them from the freezer. But leaving them in uncovered for more than a few days will lead to freezer burn, so make sure you don't leave them in much more than a day., Take them off the sheet and place them in either a freezer bag or a freezer container. Then place them back in the freezer.

, As a tasty alternative, you can sweeten the raspberries by adding sugar when you freeze them.Place a small amount of frozen raspberries in the bag. Then sprinkle sugar on top of the berries. Repeat this layering process until the bag is full.
Let the fruit defrost for about 15 minutes. This will allow the berries to absorb the sugar.
Then seal the container and place it in the freezer.

, They can stay for up to a year in the freezer. The berries can be eaten while still frozen, or allowed to defrost.

Use the dehydrated raspberries.",How to Dehydrate Raspberries," Try to use the ripest, freshest raspberries you can find. This usually means you'll be getting them at the peak of their season, when they're also the least expensive. Buy as many raspberries as you'd like to dehydrate.You may be able to find deals on bulk raspberries from farmer's markets or orchards.;
, Place your ripe raspberries into a strainer or colander. Run water over the berries to wash away any dirt or debris. You can also pick out any twigs or leaves you find and discard them., Go through the washed raspberries and remove any berries that are smashed or so soft that they begin to fall apart in your hands. Set these aside for a different use. You'll want to use raspberries that are whole, don't have any blemishes, and are still a little firm.You can freeze the berries that are slightly smashed and blend them into a smoothie.

, Once you've selected the best raspberries for dehydrating, scatter them on a baking sheet and let them air dry. This will take several hours since the berries should be completely dry., Place the raspberries in a single layer on the trays that came with your dehydrator. Ensure that there's a little space between the berries, so air can circulate easily. If you want the berries to keep their shape, set them upright.If you can, use mesh trays. These can contain the raspberries better and keep them from rolling off as you place them in the dehydrator.

, Put the trays of berries in your dehydrator and close it. Turn the dehydrator on to 135 degrees F (60 C). Let the berries dehydrate for 12 to 18 hours. The time it takes depends on the size of the berries, moisture level of the berries, and your dehydrator.If your dehydrator has a fruit setting, you can simply turn it on.

, If you don't have a dehydrator, you can just place the raspberries on rimmed baking sheets. Put the raspberries into an oven at 140 degrees F (60 C). Bake the raspberries for 6 to 9 hours or until they completely dry out. You'll need to stir the berries every 2 hours, so they dry evenly.

The oven is convenient if you don't have a dehydrator, but it won't dehydrate the raspberries as evenly as a dehydrator.

, Once the berries have dehydrated, they'll become light and completely dry. Don't worry if they lighten in color - they're still safe to eat. If the berries seem chewy, put them back in the dehydrator. Only store them once they're crisp., For quick storage, scoop the dehydrated raspberries into airtight containers (like mason jars or airtight plastic containers). To keep moisture out of the containers, add an oxygen absorber packet.Store the containers in a dry place away from light. This will prevent the light from fading the raspberries further.

, You can eat the dehydrated raspberries on their own for a quick snack, or use them in recipes calling for raspberries. Just add a few tablespoons of water or liquid to the dehydrated raspberries to rehydrate them.

You can also grind the dehydrated raspberries into a powder. Sprinkle the powder on baked goods, oatmeal, or use it to decorate desserts.

, In some cases, removing the moisture from a fruit or vegetable to dehydrate it can harm the food's nutritional value. Blueberries, however, retain their health bolstering antioxidant properties, even after being dried out. These will stay good for long period of time, making them an excellent hiking snack.


Dehydrating most fruit has a tendency to concentrate its sugar content. This means that a half cup of fresh blueberries will have fewer calories than a half cup of dried ones.
You may want to stick to one serving of dried blueberries per day to prevent yourself from eating too many calories., Being a nutrient packed, light food, blueberries are excellent at breakfast. They are a popular option to mix in with cereal, oatmeal, pancakes, and yogurt. Making it a habit to have some blueberries every day with breakfast will surely increase the amount you eat.To create a rich topping for pancakes and waffles, crush up some fresh pineapple with some blueberries and a tablespoon of your favorite jam., Take a whole honeydew melon and cut it into four to six equal sections.

Put your batter in the freezer.,
Cut your bars and store them in the freezer.",How to Eat More Blueberries2," You may need to make a special trip to the grocery store to purchase some of what you'll need, but most of these items should be available at your local grocery. These bars are a healthy snack you can enjoy on the go, and this recipe should make 16 bars total. You'll need:


Almond butter (1 cup)
Almonds (whole, ¾ cup)
Apple sauce (unsweetened, ¼ cup)
Blueberries (dried, heaping ½ cup)
Flaxseed (ground, 1/3 cup)
Honey (1/3 cup OR maple syrup)
Knife (for cutting into bars)
Mixing bowl (large size)
Pan (8"" by 8"" (20.3 by 20.3 cm) baking sheet)
Parchment paper (or wax paper)
Pepitas (1/3 cup)
Pistachios (½ cup)
Rolled oats (1½ cups)
Spoon (for mixing)
Sunflower seeds (¼ cup)
Walnuts (1/3 cup), Clean and clear an area of your counter. Take your baking pan and use your parchment paper or wax paper to line it. The paper should overhang the edges of the pan a little bit. Then lay out your mixing bowl and ingredients on the counter as well.


You may need to crease your paper to make it fit to the inner contours of your baking pan.

, Start by adding your rolled oats, almonds, dried blueberries, pistachios, ground flaxseed, walnuts, pepitas, and sunflower seeds to your mixing bowl. Use a spoon to mix all ingredients thoroughly. Then:


Drizzle your honey or maple syrup and apple sauce to the mixture. Use your spoon to stir it well, until it is well mixed.
Add your almond butter to the bowl last. Using your spoon again, mix the contents of your bowl until the almond butter is evenly distributed., Take your bowl and position it above your parchment paper lined pan. Use your spoon or a spatula to push the batter from the bowl into the pan. Then, use a spoon, your hands, or a mini-roller to spread the batter evenly to even thickness in the pan.

, Take your pan and put it in the freezer for a full hour. The cold of your freezer will cause the batter to firm up and become solid. After an hour has passed, remove your bars from the freezer and return them to the counter.


You may want to set a timer so you don't forget about your bars in the freezer. Leaving them in for too long could cause them to become so hard they are difficult to cut.
Because this recipe uses natural ingredients, you may notice the bars are a little more crumbly than store bought brands. This is completely normal., First, clean your counter well or lay down a clean cutting board or cutting mat. Peel the batter you've spread in the pan from the parchment paper so that it is one, flat slab of batter. Lay the batter slab on your counter or cutting board/mat, then:


Take your knife and use it to cut eight long bars from the batter slab. Cut these in half, and you'll have 16 blueberry snack bars total.
Store your blueberry snack bars in a sealed airtight container in the freezer. The bars should last up to three weeks."

Gather your smoothie making supplies.,
Add your ingredients to your blender.,
Blend your smoothie and enjoy.,
Save leftover smoothie for later in the fridge.",How to Eat More Blueberries3," This smoothie is a great option if you have children (or adults) in your life that aren't big on breakfast. This smoothie is packed with nutrients, is quite tasty, and can be whipped up relatively quickly. You'll need:


Blender
Blueberries (fresh, 1 cup)
Banana (x1)
Pineapple (½ of a full fruit, chunked)
Ice cubes (about 10)
Milk (½ cup)
Rolled oats (½ cup)
Greek yogurt (vanilla recommended; ½ cup), But make sure your blender is unplugged before you do so. Leaving your blender plugged in when adding ingredients puts you at risk for accidentally activating it, which could send food flying. After that, fasten the lid of the blender firmly in place and plug it back in.Always follow your blender's user directions. Improper usage of your blender could result in serious injury or harm.

, Depending on your model and brand of blender, there may be many blending options available. From among these, find and press the ""Blend"" button for short intervals until the mixture is smooth throughout.


Holding down the ""Blend"" button for extended periods could cause the motor of your blender to overheat. This can cause damage to the motor or electronics in the blender., Leftover smoothie can be kept in the fridge for about 12 hours to a day. Store extra smoothie in an airtight container, with as little air in the container with the smoothie as possible.


Air causes the nutrients in your smoothie to break down more quickly. By limiting the amount of air in the container, you'll preserve the nutritional value of your smoothie better."

Shop for strawberries seasonally.,
Examine the strawberries.,
Smell the strawberries.,
Check out the packaging.,
Pick your own strawberries.",How to Buy Strawberries," Although you may be able to purchase the berries year-round, the fruit tends to taste best during its peak production time. When not in season, the berries may be shipped slightly under-ripe, which can ruin the taste.;
, They should be firm to the touch, bright red, and free of bruising or mold. Green berries will have little if any flavor. The berries should also have a brilliant sheen, which indicates that they are fresh. The stems, or caps, should be bright green and fully attached to the berries.


Strawberries tend to not ripen further once picked, although they may become darker and lose acidity. In order to achieve the best flavor, strawberries should be picked and purchased at their peak.
Medium-size strawberries are ideal as they tend to be more flavorful than the larger berries. Larger berries may be hollow in the inside and be infused with water, which can ruin the taste. Smaller berries may have a hard bottom that is full of seeds.

, Although it's not a true indicator, the most fragrant berries tend to be the freshest. You may also be able to smell if the berries are sour or full of mold.


Berries that are picked in your local area may be more fragrant than those at a larger grocery store. Locally grown berries usually are juicier and sweeter than those shipped from further distances because they don't have to deal with the added distance time.

, If the strawberries are prepackaged, make sure that the berries are not packed too tightly as this may cause the berries to be crushed. If the berries are stacked inside the packaging, check the berries on the bottom to make sure that the freshest berries aren't covering unripe ones. Avoid any containers that have mold, as this can indicate too much moisture. Mold also spreads quickly and can infect other berries.


If you're buying strawberries from a pick-your-own strawberry farm, make sure the berries were picked within 1 to 2 days. These berries are fresher than ones in a local grocery store and may spoil quicker. If berries are placed in a container that is more than 5 inches (12.7 cm) deep, the lower strawberries will bruise.

, This option is best if available, because then you can pick and purchase the berries at their peak and can avoid the pitfalls found when buying strawberries in a store.

Create a marinade for the swordfish steaks, as a marinade adds flavor and keeps the swordfish moist and tender.,
Marinade the swordfish steaks in a plastic or glass bowl in your refrigerator for at least 4 hours.,
Forego the marinade and use simple seasonings such as salt and pepper or fresh rosemary if you prefer a plainer swordfish steak.,
Grill the swordfish steaks on a preheated grill.,
Flip the swordfish steaks over every few minutes so the steak cooks evenly, cooking until the fish is done and flakes easily with a fork.,
Serve the grilled swordfish on a serving platter with your choice of garnish.",How to Grill Swordfish," A marinade can consist of a variety of ingredients depending on your preferences. Start with combination of liquids such as Teriyaki sauce, soy sauce, wine vinegar, fresh lemon juice, salad dressing, tomato sauce or ketchup. A bit of honey or brown sugar adds a sweet flavor. If you prefer a fiery marinade, try chili powder or Tabasco sauce. A small amount oil such as butter or olive oil mixed in the marinade prevents the swordfish steaks from sticking to the grill. If your prefer to grill your swordfish steaks without marinade, just sprinkle the steaks with your choice of seasonings. A squeeze of fresh lemon or lime juice brings out the subtle flavor of the swordfish.;
, Turning the steaks occasionally will ensure that the steaks are evenly covered with marinade. You can also marinade the swordfish steaks in a resealable plastic bag.

, Brush the steaks with oil before seasoning to prevent sticking. A drizzle of fresh lemon juice or lime juice accentuates the subtle flavor of the fish.

, Medium to high heat is best for swordfish. Brushing the grill generously with oil before grilling will help to prevent them from sticking to the grill. If you use a marinade, the extra marinade can be brushed on the steaks. If you prefer, simply season the steaks with salt and freshly ground black pepper or your choice of seasonings.

, Swordfish steaks grill in approximately 5 to 8 minutes, depending on the thickness of the steaks. Don't overcook the swordfish, as too long on the grill will dry it out.

, Use fresh parsley or a few sprigs of rosemary along with fresh lemon slices or a sprinkle of chopped green onions. You can also make extra marinade and serve it as a dipping sauce, or serve the fish with mayonnaise or salad dressing.

Learn the basic combination of liquid to gelatin leaf.,
Assess the mold's capacity.",How to Make Jelly1," Once you understand this, you can determine your measurement needs from the mold's capacity. In a nutshell:

1 leaf of gelatin sets 3 1/2 fl oz/100ml of liquid (water, juice, etc.)The liquid used to make a jelly can be almost anything edible, including water, fruit juice, soda, liqueur, wine, beer, etc.;
, Fill the mold with water. Pour the amount back into a measuring jug. Using the equation from above, assess much gelatin will be needed."

, Pour some of the liquid you're using to make the jelly into a small pan. Bring to a simmer, and keep it cooking gently.

Place the heatproof bowl of softened gelatin leaf pieces (see previous section) on the water.
Keep heating gently until the gelatin melts. Stir frequently. The melting time will take around 10 minutes, longer if you're using milk.

, Stir well., The sieve will catch undissolved gelatin (which will make the jelly gritty if not removed)., Skim off any surface bubbles unless they're not an issue––just be aware that any bubbles showing on the surface will set too., Leave to set. This will take at least six hours.

If you have strong odors in the fridge, cover the jelly mold with an upturned plate, plastic kitchen wrap or a lid, to prevent the flavors melding with the jelly.

, This tends to be many a cook's least favorite part of making jelly, for fear of breakage. Be prepared for some trial and error. In a nutshell, here is how to unmold:

Place the jelly container in a bowl of warm water, the raw edge of the jelly facing upward and out of the water.
When you see the jelly loosening or melting a little at the sides, it may be ready to release from the mold. This can take anywhere from a few seconds to a half a minute.
Tip over and land the jelly on the serving plate. If you wet the plate before doing this, you will be able to align the jelly exactly where you want it to be on the plate.

Use a whole wheat flour.,
Replace fats with tofu or coconut oil.,
Replace butter and fat with a fruit puree.,
Replace eggs with egg whites.,
Swap cow's milk with a different type of milk.",How to Make Healthy Holiday Desserts1," Whole wheat flour contains more vitamins and nutrients than its refined all-purpose counterpart. If you want to pack your holiday desserts with more fiber, calcium, and vitamins, than you can substitute some of the all-purpose processed flour that you would usually use, with whole wheat flour.Replace 50% of your all-purpose flour with wheat flour when making your holiday desserts.Whole wheat flour will create a denser, firmer final product.
Try using a 1:1 ratio in recipes for oatmeal cookies, chocolate cake, and gingerbread.
Avoid using wheat flour for delicate dishes like angel food cake, yellow cake, or cream scones.;
, For many recipes, you can replace butter with tofu or coconut oil. Try using pureed soft or silken tofu in a 1:1 ratio in your recipes.When using coconut oil, you can also use a 1:1 ratio.


Tofu will impart a fluffy and lighter texture to things like brownies and will take on the taste of other sweet desserts.Tofu is high in protein but low in fat.
Coconut oil is solid at room temperature and acts similar to butter.
Coconut oil goes great in cupcakes, oatmeal cookies, and muffins., Fats like butter help bind desserts together and provide texture and moisture to your food. You can replace these unhealthy fats with fruit purees, such as applesauce, pumpkin or squash puree, prune puree, or mashed bananas.Cut the amount of butter you'd use in half, and replace it with fruit puree.


Applesauce is a great replacement for butter in cake recipes, muffins, and gingerbread.
Prune puree works great in recipes like muffins, scones, chocolate cakes, coffee cakes, brownies, and cookies.

, Replace the eggs that you would normally use in a recipe at a ratio of two egg whites per egg.Egg whites are high in potassium, riboflavin, protein, and selenium. Unlike the egg yolk, egg whites don't contain cholesterol or saturated fat.Egg whites will give your dessert a fluffy and lighter texture.

, Instead of using cow's milk, which can be high in fat, you can use other alternatives. Some options include soy milk, almond milk, or rice milk. These types of milk will act similar to low-fat or skim milk in most recipes, and can usually be swapped at a 1:1 ratio. When replacing whole milk, consider using coconut milk beverage, not to be confused with coconut milk, which has 5 grams of fat per cup compared to whole milk's 8 grams of fat per cup.Almond milk is naturally sweet and should be used when making sweet desserts.
Soymilk has a beany flavor that can overpower delicate desserts.

Cut back on sugars.,
Eliminate unhealthy options from your dessert menu.,
Avoid processed or artificial ingredients.,
Shop for organic food.",How to Make Healthy Holiday Desserts2," In most recipes, the sugar content in your desserts can be pulled back anywhere from 25% to 33%, without having an enormous impact on the overall taste or quality of your finished dessert. Reducing the sugar works best in recipes for cakes, quick bread, and cookies. Do not eliminate sugar from recipes that require it for its texture, like custards or compotes., Avoid inherently harmful things like candy or holiday desserts that require a lot of fat or sugar. Concentrate on desserts that rely on fruit as their sweeteners, such as pies or tarts.


Other healthier desserts include things like baked pears, low-fat strawberry shortcake, and banana oatmeal cookies., Avoid products that use chemical additives such as certain icing or frosting. Instead of buying some at the store, consider making your own frosting. Sometimes store bought icing can contain additives and preservatives that have harmful or questionable chemicals in them. Avoid artificial sweeteners or chemical food dyes as well., Using all organic ingredients will prevent your food from being tainted from pesticides. Use organic fruits and milk in your recipes. Organic foods can be good for your heart health and immune system and is often fresher than other ingredients because it's grown locally.There are more antioxidants and vitamins in organic milk.

Different religions and families practice different beliefs and have different traditions. Think about your traditions and make a list of customary desserts that your guests or family are used to eating around the holidays.


Cookies, pies, and cakes are conventional desserts in the United States.Pastries, crepes, and semolina cakes and cookies are customary holiday desserts in North Africa.In South America chocolate cake, ice cream, and brigadeiro are popular desserts.In Korea, boiled fruits, and sweet dumplings are common holiday desserts., Visuals are important with desserts and can help evoke a feeling of the holidays. Decorate your cakes and desserts to reflect the holiday that you're celebrating. Use the color scheme for your holiday on cakes or other desserts.


Add candy canes and snowmen for the winter holiday.

, Warm apples or eggnog are tastes that are usually associated with the winter holidays. Flavors like peppermint or gingerbread are also American winter holiday classics. Think of ingredients that remind you of your holiday and utilize it in your desserts.


During the winter holiday in Hungary, traditional ingredients include poppy seed paste and walnuts.French macaroons consist of raspberry or lemon flavor with vanilla.In Mexico, citrus pumpkin flan is a favorite during the holidays."

This variation of pumpkin pie is low in saturated fat and is a healthy and tasty dessert for the autumn holiday.


You can also make a traditional pumpkin pie using some of the methods listed above.

, Apples and cranberries are traditional treats to eat during the autumn season. Replace the butter in the recipe with coconut oil or a fruit puree and skip the ice cream to keep it healthy.


You can also bake cranberry orange bread.

, Swap the milk in your fruit custard with almond or soy milk. This will reduce the fat and make it an even healthier holiday dessert. Use healthy fruits and nuts with the custard to increase its health benefits.

, Cake is a perfect way to celebrate the winter holiday. When baking your healthy holiday cake, consider using this recipe and replace the butter and sugar with applesauce. Instead of using the marshmallow spread, use coconut whipped cream.

Get rid of used plants.,
Use Epsom salts to encourage the plant to bear fruit.,
Use calcium to deal with blossom end rot.,
Spray the plant with water or insecticides to get rid of aphids.,
Protect your plants from cold or hot temperatures.",How to Grow Bell Peppers," While a number of garden centers sell specimens ready for transplanting, bell peppers are relatively easy to grow from seed. Although green, red, yellow, and orange are the most common colors, gardeners also have the option of growing dark brown and purple pepper varieties.


Some fast ripening varieties can produce fruit in as little as two months but others may need over three months before they begin to flower.;
, Most bell pepper plants should be started indoors about two months before the frost-free date. Southern gardeners, and gardeners in warm climates with a lengthy growing season, may choose to wait and start their plants outside instead. However, this will naturally affect how soon the plants start producing fruit.

, The bell pepper seeds will need to be lightly covered with soil, then watered. The seedlings should make an appearance within a week or two.

, Bell pepper seeds do need a warm period in order to germinate. Ambient air temperatures of over 80° Fahrenheit (26.6° Celsius) and slightly warmer soil temperatures are recommended for good results.


Seeds that are slow to sprout may benefit from the use of heating mats.
Gardeners should note that the plants will not sprout at all if temperatures are below 55° Fahrenheit (12.7° C).

, Seedlings grown indoors need strong light to keep them from becoming tall and spindly. Bad growth at a young stage can affect their overall health and lead to floppy transplants.


If this is the case no matter what you does, these tiny seedlings can be staked using thin bamboo or wood skewers and tied in place using plain string.

, In areas where pepper plants cannot be directly started outdoors, it is a good idea to harden them off once temperatures are regularly over 60° Fahrenheit (15.5° C) at night.

, Bell peppers do well in containers. They can reach up to 3 feet (0.9 m) in height and width, so gardeners should select a pot that measures about 10 inches (25.4 cm) in depth to keep them from being overcrowded.

, These plants require full sun growing conditions and well-drained, fertile soil. They are relatively drought resistant if they are not grown in very small pots.

, The former material is also a good way to speed pepper growth in cool climate areas.


Gardeners in warm climates will want to stick to mulch because it helps conserve moisture and protects the plants’ roots from hot temperatures.

, These plants benefit from an addition of slow release granular fertilizer, such as Osmocote, or organic varieties, like those made with fish meal or alfalfa.


However, if one has leafy green plants and no peppers, gardeners should probably cut back on the nitrogen fertilizer. This chemical is known for producing lush, fruitless plants.

, Almost all bell peppers start off green and eventually ripen to the desired color in about two weeks, though some types can take as long as a month for the right color to develop.


Tall varieties may need to be staked to support the fruit and keep the plants from falling over while the fruit grows and ripens.

, Wire cages wrapped with plastic were mentioned in Mother Earth News article the author read as a good way to insulate tomato seedlings against sudden drops in temperature. Another way to prevent seedling from getting too cold is to use bell jars (hot caps).


These devices were originally made from glass but now are more likely to be made from leftover plastic milk or soda bottles.

, Pepper seeds can be saved for up to two years under ideal conditions. This means that growers will not have to purchase seed annually if they store the leftovers in a dark, dry location to keep them from sprouting prematurely.

, Once the first chill of winter sets in, gardeners can harvest the remaining fruit and then dig the plants up. Specimens that are not diseased are good candidates for the compost bin.


Diseased plants can be bagged up and left with the trash to prevent the disease from spreading.

, Peppers that are having difficulty bearing fruit in warm weather may benefit from being spritzed with a combination of 1 quart water and 1 teaspoon Epsom salts.


Another idea is to place a tablespoon of Epsom salts in the ground at the base of the pepper plant and cover the material over with dirt so that it can soak in., Should gardeners end up with fruits that are black at the ends, a condition known as blossom end rot, they will need to find a way to add more calcium to their soil. The simplest way to do this is by watering affected pepper plants with any milk that expires in the fridge.


Small amounts of soured milk can be mixed up with water if there wouldn’t be enough to use on every plant.

, Aphids are a typical garden pest that can be removed temporarily by a hard spray of water. Organic gardeners may want to try these bugs with neem or pyrethrum based sprays.


Repeated applications may be necessary as these garden menaces are especially hard to eradicate.

, Temperatures below 65° or above 95° can keep peppers from producing fruit. If it is just a minor cold spell or heat wave, they will resume production once it has passed.


Keep in mind that cold temperatures are especially bad for the health of peppers. Those exposed to extremely chilly weather may not recover from the experience, so it may be advisable to bring them indoors until the temperatures have warmed back up.

",How to Grill Vegetables," If you have a gas grill, preheat on medium for at least 10 minutes. If you are using a charcoal grill, wait until the charcoal is good and gray.






;
, Once it is hot, this will be easy to do. Grab your grill brush and get each nook and cranny of the grate. Then, dab a paper towel in oil and wipe it down to prevent sticking. You'll be glad you did this later when half of your vegetables don't end seared to the grate.









Even though your vegetables have oil on them (they will, right?) you need this coating on your grill. Don't skip this step.

, Dense root vegetables like potatoes, carrots, and beets take this extra step. They need to be precooked to let the grilling take effect. Boil them until they're partially cooked (only just starting to get tender) and proceed as normal.









You don't have to boil them whole! Even if they are in smaller pieces, they need the extra cooking time.

, Though raw vegetables are delicious and great for you, they still need to be clean! Run them under cold water and pat dry with a paper towel.








, Asparagus, big Portobello mushrooms and corn on the cob don't need to be cut up, but onions, zucchini, and pepper are grilled best when sliced.









The root vegetables discussed above should be sliced up, too.

, This way, they will not stick to the grill, you will get those restaurant-like grill marks, and they will be delicious. You don't want the oil soaking the vegetables and dripping off in a stream, but you do want them coated evenly.









If a marinade is more your style, see below.

, Combine equal parts olive oil and lemon juice. Add fresh herbs like thyme, basil, chives, or rosemary. If you are a garlic fan, a couple cloves will add a good kick. Pour the marinade over the vegetables. Toss the vegetables to coat them and allow them to soak up the flavor for about an hour.









Place these on the grill in a basket or tin foil packet. They are probably sliced into smaller pieces if they are marinated, so keep them above the flames. Depending on the vegetables you used, this could take just a few minutes. Make a taste test if you are unsure -- your tongue will know when they are done.

, You will need different apparatuses for the varying sizes. Large pieces can be placed directly on, but if they're too small they'll fall through the grate!









Buy a grilling basket for sliced up onion, pepper, mushrooms, etc. If you do not have time, use tin foil and wrap up in a covered, rectangular shape that opens on top. Another alternative is to use skewers, though those sometimes can be precarious.

If using a foil packet, throw in some butter, oil, and seasonings.
If using skewers, use metal ones. Wood and bamboo should be soaked in water for half an hour earlier to prevent charring.



, You will want to keep an eye on the vegetables as certain ones take longer than others do. Namely eggplant and onion, even if they're cut up.









Asparagus, mushrooms, peppers and zucchini all cook fast. Cooking times vary by size, weight, density, and just how done you like your greens.

, Once the vegetables are all on, keep an eye on them. Your peppers may finish twice as fast as your eggplant, so stay on the watch. If they're going too fast, move them to the edges of the grill where it's not as hot.









Take off the vegetables as they finish and either put them above the grill (if applicable) or keep them warm on a separate rack or board.

Talk to a healthcare provider about any uncertainties.",How to Harvest and Use Dandelion Roots," The roots extend deeper than you might expect - up to a foot below the surface - and they can be hard to get out of the ground. Once fall arrives, wait for a heavy rain to loosen the soil, and they’ll be easier to harvest.A fall harvest is ideal for medicinal content contained in the roots. At this time of year, insoluble fiber content will be higher, and sugar content will be lower.;
, If you want the roots to be sweeter (for use in some food recipes, for instance) you may want to harvest in the spring, before the dandelions blossom. They’ll be less bitter and chewy this time of year, and generally more palatable.Note that taraxacin in particular - which stimulates bile production and contributes to healthy liver function - will also be more plentiful in the spring.

, In terms of locations, try to gather dandelions in relatively unpolluted areas. In particular, don’t harvest dandelions from the roadside, or from an area where pesticides are used.Since many people use fertilizer or other chemicals on their lawn, the dandelions that may sprout up in your yard are not necessarily the best.
Go to a natural grass meadow for the largest and liveliest dandelions.

, Select only the largest and most lively-looking dandelions to harvest. Smaller plants won’t have much root, and are better left to keep bees and other insects happy.Consider allowing dandelions to grow naturally in your garden. They will be especially healthy in rich garden soil, and are unlikely to hurt your other plants.

, Take care not to damage the root, which is shaped like a long thing carrot. Move the tool through the soil around the plant, but not beneath it.If you don't have a garden fork, a small shovel or another garden tool can work just as well.

, Shake off the dandelion roots to remove soil and rub them with a wet, clean cloth to clean them. Once cleaned, they are ready for immediate use, or to be dried and otherwise preserved., If you’re using a dehydrator, slice cleaned roots into thin strips of comparable lengths and dehydrate them at 95 degrees F (35 degrees C) until each piece is brittle to the touch. Alternatively, tie individual roots with a piece of string and hang them somewhere cool, dry, and with active airflow. You can also lay them on a screen in such an area.If air-drying, allow them to air dry for several days, until brittle, and cut them into smaller pieces. This may occur in anywhere from three to fourteen days, depending on air conditions.
Store dried root pieces in a glass jar, where they will keep for up to a year. The outer layer of the root will darken over time, while the inner portions of the root should remain a creamy white.

, Tinctures are a common way to preserve and deliver the medicinal properties of dandelion roots and other herbs. Since the tincture will be alcohol based, it will last much longer than dried roots, and will have fast-acting effects when administered in this form. To make a tincture, simply submerge root pieces in a jar with a high proof liquor.Use a 1:1 weight ratio of liquor to root. A 100 proof liquor (which will be 50% alcohol) is important, as this will keep the solution’s overall alcohol concentration high enough to prevent fermentation. Whiskey or vodka are recommended.
Exact amounts aren't too important. Ensure that the roots are fully submerged, and that there is about and inch of liquor above the root pieces.
Allow the tincture to steep for six weeks, gently shaking the jar every day. Strain the tincture through muslin cloth and bottle it in a sterilized dark glass bottle.

, Complete the same process to create another tincture using dandelions instead of root pieces. Once both tinctures are finished, you can blend the two and have a dandelion tincture with more encompassing medical properties.It’s worth tincturing leaves and roots separately, as the leaf tincture will be finished in a matter of weeks, while the roots take longer.
Alternatively, dry extra leaf at the time of harvest, and make an additional tincture later on to blend into older batches to give them a boost.

, Dandelion is best known as an effective diuretic, meaning it kicks the liver into higher gear. This helps clean your blood, and can help keep you liver, spleen, and gallbladder in good shape. Further, some herbalists recommend dandelion root tincture for daily use for other reasons as well.Claims related to overall health including dandelion root’s ability to help regulate blood sugar, reduce stress, and improve skin health.
A few drops of tincture in juice or water can be taken daily for these benefits.
Some also use and recommend the tincture to treat arthritis symptoms, as well as hangovers.

, One of the easiest ways to use dandelion roots is in tea. Tea made with these roots will be high in antioxidants. Drinking it is said to help balance your blood sugar, aid digestion, have diuretic and laxative effects, cleanse the liver, and help prevent urinary tract infections.Most dandelion tea is made with the leaves of the plant. However, you can make dandelion tea with the roots by making a decoction and adding more water until you have the desired flavor potency.
Dandelion root tea will likely be quite bitter. Consider sweetening with whatever you prefer in your tea, such as honey.

, Somewhere between a tincture and a tea, a decoction is essentially a reduced tea. The target is about a quarter of the liquid that would be present in tea, for instance. This provides a more potent liquid that can keep for a longer period of time when refrigerated, and can be even added to hot water to make a cup of tea. To begin Decorating, heat your dandelion tea in a pot until it begins to steam.Maintain constant steam without allowing the liquid to simmer. This can usually be accomplished with a burner set to low.
Once the liquid is reduced to a quarter of the original liquid content, allow it to cool and pour the decoction in a sterilized dark glass bottle.
You can also make a decoction by simmering an ounce of dried roots (or two ounces of fresh roots) in a pint of water. Keep the solution covered as it simmers for 20 minutes., Decoctions can be used in the same manner as you would teas or other infusions. The main difference is that a smaller dose can have similar effects. In particular, animals or kids may be more willing to take a smaller portion of a decoction than a full glass of tea.A quarter cup of decoction is considered one dose, whether for a daily health boost or to help treat a particular symptom.

, Though caffeine-free, dandelion and chicory tea offers a sweet, spicy, and surprisingly satisfying early-morning alternative. You’ll need to grind and roast both dandelion and chicory root to get started. Use two tablespoons of each, along with four cups of water and a cinnamon stick.Bring all of the ingredients to a boil in a pot. Turn down the burner to simmer the liquid for five minutes. Strain the beverage and add milk or a milk alternative to taste.

, Apple cider vinegar is remarkably healthy on its own, and all the more so when infused with dandelion root. You can then add the vinegar to soups and salads, or drink it on it’s own.Chop enough fresh or dried dandelion root to fill a mason jar two-thirds of the way. Then fill the jar with raw apple cider vinegar, making sure to include the bacteria that collects at the bottom of the cider jar.
Allow the roots to infuse into the vinegar for six weeks. Store the jar in a cool, dry place out of first sunlight. Strain with a muslin cloth and store your vinegar in a sealed glass jar.

, You can add fresh or dried dandelion root to things you regularly eat, such as smoothies, for a nutritional boost. This will also offer extra support for your liver. Blend dried root into a powder on its own before adding it to other ingredients. Fresh dandelion root, meanwhile, will blend into other ingredients like other fruits or veggies., Conditions such as acne, eczema, and psoriasis, as well as some unidentified skin irregularities can be treated with a simple dandelion root paste. Use a food processor or coffee grinder to grind dried dandelion root into a cup’s worth of powder. Add a bit of warm water and mix until you have a thick paste.Clean and dry the affected area of your skin. Spread the poultice onto a piece of gauze or clean cloth and use it to cover the area.
Wrap the area with plastic wrap. If necessary, wrap the area again with a clean material that can be pinned in place.
Leave the poultice in place for anywhere from twenty minutes to three hours. Repeat as necessary, cleaning and drying the area in between applications.

, In general, dandelion root is considered safe to use in herbal remedies. However, speak with your doctor before using any herbs to treat a medical condition. Furthermore, dandelion should not be used if any of the following apply:You’re allergic to similar plants, including ragweed, chrysanthemums, marigold, chamomile, yarrow, daisies, or asters.
You’re allergic to iodine.
You experience heartburn symptoms or skin irritation when using dandelion.
You are pregnant or nursing.
You have gallstones, stomach issues, or other digestive issues.
You’re taking potassium supplements or blood thinners.
You’re taking medication to treat an infection.

Transfer the ferment to a cooler temperature.",How to Ferment Vegetables," The best vegetables to ferment are those that are in season and ripe, at the height of their optimal texture and flavor. Choose vegetables that were grown nearby, and opt for organic when possible. You can ferment one vegetable at a time, or pack several types together for a delicious ""salad"" of fermented vegetables. Here are a few popular choices:



Cucumbers. Fermented cucumbers - pickles - are a great place to start if you've never fermented before. Try packing pickles alone or with onions, carrots and peppers. (Do not use waxed cucumbers. To see if a cucumber is waxed, scrape the cucumber with a fingernail. Ask for pickling cucumbers at the store.)

Cabbage. Fermenting cabbage turns it into tart, crispy sauerkraut. Consider making kimchi for a spicy spin on cabbage fermentation.

Peppers. Peppers may be fermented on their own or packed with another vegetable to add some heat.

Green beans or asparagus. Pickled green beans or asparagus are a welcome treat in the winter months when the fresh green taste of summer is hard to come by.;
, When vegetables are covered in a liquid solution, the natural bacteria present in their skin begins to break down the cellular structure in the process of fermentation. Vegetables will ferment in plain water, but their taste and texture is better with the addition of salt, which promotes the growth of ""good"" bacteria and inhibits the growth of ""bad"" bacteria, resulting in crispy, tasty vegetables.


The standard amount of salt to add is 3 tablespoons per 5 pounds of vegetables. If you're on a low sodium diet, it's fine to add salt to taste.
The less salt you add, the quicker the vegetables will ferment. Adding more salt will cause the process to go more slowly.
If you don't want to add much salt, using a starter culture will help promote the growth of good bacteria and stifle the growth of bad bacteria. You can add whey, kefir grains, or dried starter culture to the mix and reduce the amount of salt. Be aware, however, that using a starter culture without any salt will result in less crisp vegetables., Wide-mouth, cylindrical ceramic crocks or Mason jars are commonly used to ferment vegetables. Since the vegetables and brining mixture will sit in their containers for weeks or even months, it's important to choose containers that won't leach chemicals into the mix. Ceramic and glass containers are the best choices; avoid containers made from metal or plastic.

, You'll also need lids that allow for airflow while keeping out insects as well as weights to pack the vegetables tightly. You can buy fermenting vessels that have a weight and cover system in place, or devise your own using less expensive household supplies.


If you use a ceramic crock, find a small, heavy plate that fits inside the crock. Place a heavy jar or rock on top of the plate to serve as a weight. Drape a thin, clean cloth over the top to keep out insects.
If you use a mason jar, get a smaller mason jar that fits snugly inside the larger one. Fill it with water to serve as a weight. Drape a thin, clean cloth over the top to keep out insects.

, Be sure to rinse the skins of each vegetable thoroughly, then chop them in into strips or chunks. This creates greater surface area and helps along the fermentation process.If you're making sauerkraut, shred the cabbage into bite-sized strips.

, Place them in a bowl and use a meat tenderizer or kraut pounder to release the juices. If you wish to leave the vegetables mostly intact, you'll still need to press them in some way to start breaking down the cell walls. You can squeeze the vegetables or massage them to release their juices.

, Add salt to taste and use a spoon to mix it in with the vegetables and juice. If you're using a starter culture too, you can go ahead and add it as well.

, Be sure to leave 3 inches (7.6 cm) or so of empty space at the top of the vessel. Use your hands or a kitchen tool to press the vegetables down to the bottom of the vessel so that the juices rise to cover the solid parts. If there aren't enough juices to cover the vegetables, top it off with water.

, To ferment, the vegetables must be weighted under the liquid. Place the weight system you have devised inside the vessel, making sure the plate or jar you are using fits snugly. Cover the whole container with a light, tightly-woven cloth to keep out insects and still allow for airflow.

, Place it in a clean, dry area. The vegetables will immediately begin to break down and ferment. Make sure the room is not too hot or cold; it should be at comfortable room temperature.

, There's no special moment at which a ferment is ""ready"" - it's all a matter of taste. After just a day or two, the ferment will develop a tang. Keep tasting it every day until it reaches the level of tartness you want. Some people like to eat the ferment right when it reaches their desired flavor profile. However, if you want to preserve the ferment for a long period of time, you'll need to move it.


If some vegetables emerge at the top of the liquid, they may develop a layer of mold. Simply scrape this off and make sure the remaining vegetables are weighted under the liquid. The mold is harmless and will not ruin the ferment.

, Place it in the cellar or in your refrigerator. This will slow down the fermentation process, allowing you to keep the ferment for several months. As the vegetables continue to ferment, their flavor will deepen. Keep tasting the ferment every few weeks, and eat it as soon as it tastes the way you want it to."

Choose freshly harvested asparagus.,
Wash the asparagus well.,
Trim the woody ends of the asparagus spears.,
Chop the asparagus into pieces if desired.,
Bring a large pot of water to a boil.,
Prepare an ice bath.,
Boil the asparagus for three minutes.,
Transfer it to the ice bath for three minutes.,
Dry the asparagus.,
Spread the asparagus pieces on a baking sheet.,
Freeze the asparagus for one hour.,
Transfer the pieces to freezer storage containers.,
Store the asparagus in the freezer for up to a year.,
Use frozen asparagus in your favorite recipes.",How to Freeze Asparagus," Any time you're going to freeze produce, it's best to do so when the produce is at the height of its season. Asparagus season peaks in early to mid-spring. That's when you'll find the most flavorful, crunchy asparagus that will freeze well and still taste good when it thaws.


Look for green, fresh-looking asparagus. Pick it up. If it's floppy, it's no longer fresh. The spears should be firm and crunchy.
Choose thick spears, rather than a thin-speared variety. Thick spears hold up better in the freezer.
A farmer's market is a great place to shop for fresh asparagus that's good to freeze. Avoid supermarket asparagus that was flown in from other countries.;
, Run each spear under cold water to wash away dirt, grit and other impurities. Make sure no traces of grime remain on the asparagus before proceeding.

, Asparagus tends to get tough and woody at the bottom end. It's necessary to trim off the bottom third or so of each spear. Use a knife to trim the spear. You can also break each spear by hand by feeling for the weak spot near the bottom third of the asparagus and snapping it in two. Repeat with each spear.

, If you already know that you'll be using asparagus pieces in soups and casseroles, it's fine to chop the spears into one or two-inch pieces. You may also freeze the spears whole if you prefer.Try to make all the pieces uniform in size so they blanch and freeze evenly.
If you're leaving the spears whole, sort them into piles according to size. Blanch like-sized spears together.

, Choose a pot that can easily hold the asparagus pieces or spears you're blanching. Fill it 2/3 full with water. Bring the water to a rolling boil.

, While the water is coming to a boil, fill a large bowl with ice cubes and water. You'll need to plunge the asparagus into the ice bath to stop it from overcooking after you finish the blanching.

, Place the asparagus pieces or spears into the boiling water. Set a timer for three minutes and let the asparagus cook. When the time is up, remove the asparagus from the boiling water immediately.You can add up to a pound of asparagus at a time to the water. If you have more than a pound, blanch it in batches.
If you have several piles of asparagus cut to different sizes, blanch each pile separately.
If your asparagus is exceptionally thick or thin, adjust the cooking time accordingly. Thin asparagus (thinner than a pencil) should be blanched for about two minutes, while thick asparagus (thicker than a marker) should be blanched for four.

, Place the blanched asparagus in the ice bath immediately after removing it from the boiling pot of water. Let it sit in the ice bath for three minutes, or the exact same amount of time it spent getting cooked.

, Transfer the asparagus to a dry towel and pat the pieces dry. If you don't dry the asparagus thoroughly, the asparagus will get frosty in the freezer. Work quickly so that you can freeze the asparagus as soon as possible and so you can avoid mushy asparagus., Arrange the pieces in one even layer so that no pieces overlap. Cover the baking sheet with a piece of plastic wrap.


Skip this step if you don't mind if the asparagus sticks together. Just place the asparagus into a freezer-safe container and freeze.

, Place the covered baking sheet in the freezer to ""flash freeze"" for one hour. This helps the pieces freeze individually, rather than freezing into a solid mass in the freezer storage container.

, Use bags or plastic bins that are safe for long-term storage. Label the containers with the date so you'll know how long the asparagus is safe to eat.Pack the asparagus tightly to remove as much air as possible from the storage container. This preserves the asparagus' taste and texture as much as possible.
Vacuum storage is a good option for freezing asparagus. It removes all the air from the packaging.

, After a year, the asparagus will begin to deteriorate in taste and texture. When you're ready to use the asparagus, begin cooking it frozen rather than thawing it first., Frozen asparagus does not need to be thawed before use. You can use it the same way you'd use fresh asparagus. For an easy side dish, just steam the asparagus with a bit of butter and lemon. Try frozen asparagus in these other popular dishes:


Ham and asparagus quiche. Simply add chopped, frozen asparagus in place of fresh asparagus.

Vegetable soup. Frozen asparagus reconstitutes easily when added to a pot of hot soup.

Chicken asparagus casserole. This is the perfect way to use a container of frozen asparagus.

",How to Eat a Star Fruit," Ripe star fruit is firm and has vibrant yellow skin.


The more yellow the skin is, the sweeter the fruit will be. A yellow star fruit with a bit of brown along the edges is ideal.
A star fruit has approximately 30 calories. It is also a worthwhile source of fiber, vitamin C, carbohydrates, and water.;
, Use a sharp knife to cut the fruit across the broad side, dividing it into star-shaped slices that are roughly 1/4-inch to 1/2-inch (6.35-mm to 1.27-cm) wide.


Wash the fruit well before slicing it. Rinse it under running water, scrubbing it with your fingers until any loose dirt hiding in the crevices comes free.
The entire star fruit is edible, so you do not need to peel it or seed it before eating it.
Star fruit can be enjoyed plain and on its own without adding it to anything else.

,


Wash the fruit, using your fingers to scrub away any dirt while rinsing it under cool, running water.
Hold the star fruit steady with one hand. You can either hold it in your hand or brace the bottom against a cutting board or counter.
Glide a sharp, smooth kitchen knife along the edge of the star fruit. Make the cut where the green or brown part of the edge begins and slice thinly to only remove the discolored portion of the edge.
Slice off the ends. Cut 1/2-inch (1.27-cm) off both ends of the star fruit, removing any green or brown pointed tips.
Use a sharp knife to cut the star fruit into 1/4-inch to 1/2-inch (6.35-mm to 1.27-cm) slices. Cut across the broad side of the fruit to form star shapes.
Poke through the center of the star fruit with the tip of your knife to remove any visible seeds.

, The fruit contains a neurotoxin that healthy kidneys can filter out, but damaged kidneys are unable to do so.Go to a hospital if you experience symptoms of ""star fruit intoxication"" after consuming the fruit. Symptoms include insomnia, hiccups, vomiting, numbness, muscle convulsions or decreased strength, and confusion. These symptoms usually manifest themselves 30 minutes to 14 hours after an individual consumes the fruit. Rarely, star fruit intoxication can even cause death.

, Toss slices of star fruit with other tropical fruits to create a colorful blend of sweet-and-sour flavors.


Fruits that pair well with star fruit include banana, strawberry, kiwi, mango, pineapple, papaya, grapes, and citrus fruits.
You can toss the fruit salad gently with a lemon vinaigrette, orange glaze, honey, or fruit cocktail syrup to add another dimension of flavor.
For an even more tropical twist, garnish the fruit salad with a sprinkling of shredded coconut.

, Star fruit makes an appealing addition to simple green salads.


Make the salad simple, using ingredients like romaine lettuce, chives, sweet bell pepper, and avocado. Stay away from traditional garden salad ingredients like carrots, cucumbers, and shredded cheddar cheese.
Opt for light vinaigrette dressings, like lemon vinaigrette, balsamic vinaigrette, raspberry vinaigrette, or Italian vinaigrette. Tangy French dressings can also complement the flavor of star fruit well.

, Decorate dishes and platters with sliced star fruit for an edible garnish.


Add sliced star fruit to the tops of tropical-flavor cakes or ice cream.
Decorate plates of tropical entrees, like teriyaki-marinated chicken, with artistically placed slices of star fruit.
Cut a small slice into a piece of star fruit and hang it off the side of a cocktail glass.

, Use mashed star fruit in fruit bread or sliced star fruit in upside-down cake.Combine 2 cups (500 ml) flour, 1 1/2 tsp (7.5 ml) baking powder, and 1/2 tsp (2.5 ml) salt. Add this to a creamed mixture made from 1/2 cup (125 ml) butter, 1 cup (250 ml) sugar, 3 eggs, 1 tsp (5 ml) white wine, and 2 cups (500 ml) mashed star fruit. Stir in 1 cup (250 ml) chopped coconut and cook in a standard loaf pan for 50 minutes at 350 degrees Fahrenheit (177 degrees Celsius).
Arrange 3 to 4 sliced star fruit on the bottom of a greased 9-inch (23-cm) cake pan. Pour a standard yellow cake batter or spice cake batter over the star sliced star fruit and bake according to the recipe's instructions. Invert the cake onto a serving plate before serving.

, The flavor of star fruit pairs well with chicken, duck, and many types of fish and seafood.


After preparing chicken fried rice, tropical chicken stir-fry, or Asian-inspired chicken stir-fry, add fresh slices of star fruit to the dish.
Cut the star fruit into small pieces and add it to chicken salad, tuna salad, or lobster salad.
Grill chicken, tuna steaks, prawns, or duck and serve the star fruit alongside it, grilled or fresh.

, Cook chopped star fruit on the stovetop with sugar and tropical fruit juice. Use finer pieces of star fruit and more liquid to create a jam or larger pieces and less juice for chutney.

, Blend star fruit with other tropical fruits and juice to create a thick, fruity drink.


Blend 3 seeded star fruit, 1 diced mango, 3 cups (750 ml) orange juice, 2 cups (500 ml) ice cubes, 1/2 tsp (2.5 ml) ground cinnamon, and 1 Tbsp (15 ml) honey until smooth. If desired, add chunks of pineapple, strawberry, or banana to the smoothie, as well.

Try kiwi ice cream.",How to Eat Kiwi Fruit," Kiwi fruit has olive green or brown skin covered in a thin layer of fuzz. Inspect the kiwi all over to ensure it is has an even color on all sides. If you see spots that are darker in color or black, the kiwi may be rotten., A ripe kiwi is mostly firm, but it will give slightly when you press it with your thumb. This indicates that the kiwi has reached its peak of sweetness.


If the kiwi is rock hard, it isn't quite ripe. You should be able to press it in slightly.
If the kiwi gives too much, it is overripe. The kiwi should not feel mushy.

, A ripe kiwi will smell fruity and fragrant. The smell should be sweet, but not overpowering. If it verges on being sickeningly sweet, the kiwi is probably overripe. If it has no scent at all, it may not be ripe yet.

, If the only kiwi fruit available is hard and underripe, you can ripen it on your kitchen counter at home. Simply place the kiwi fruit in a paper bag and leave it out at room temperature. In a day or two, it should be ready to eat.


Kiwi fruit releases an enzyme that causes it to ripen. Storing it at room temperature in a paper bag speeds up the process. You can add a ripe apple or banana to make it go even faster.
Don't try it with a plastic bag. It's important to have a little air circulation in the bag so that the kiwi doesn't end up tasting bad or rotting.

, Place the kiwi fruit under cool running water to rinse away any dirt or debris. Even if it shows no visible dirt, it's a good idea to rinse the kiwi in case it was treated with pesticides. Dry the kiwi when you're finished.

, Stand the kiwi on one end. Use a paring knife to slice it down the middle, so the kiwi is split into two lengthwise halves.

, If the kiwi is ripe, the flesh will come right out. Use the spoon to scoop close to the skin to separate it from the flesh. Do the same with both halves of the kiwi fruit.


If the flesh won't come out easily, you may need to peel the kiwi with a paring knife. You can also use a vegetable peeler.
You should also peel the kiwi if you prefer to keep it whole so that you can slice it into discs.

, You can eat the kiwi halves as is, or slice them into smaller pieces first. Fresh, ripe kiwi has a delicious taste with hints of both strawberry and citrus. Many people enjoy it plain, but if you're interested in trying a recipe with kiwis, they complement many other flavors well., Kiwi fruit will keep for a day or two when kept covered in the refrigerator.

Search for jackfruit in local grocery stores.,
Look in Asian grocery stores.,
Order jackfruit online.",How to Eat Jackfruit1," Before you can prepare and eat a jackfruit, you’ll need to find a store that sells it. Jackfruit is uncommon in most American supermarkets; you probably won’t be able to find it at your local Safeway, Kroger, or Publix. Start by looking in the produce section of stores that sell organic, healthy foods. You may also be able to find canned or dried jackfruit in the “International” section of a local supermarket.

For example, Whole Foods (and similar supermarkets) may sell jackfruit.
Continue your search for jackfruit in local farmers markets.;
, These businesses often sell Asian ingredients that cannot be found in other supermarkets, and will very likely sell jackfruit. If there are multiple Asian grocery stores or markets in your area, look for one that specializes in Chinese and Southeastern Asian cuisines, as these will be most likely to stock jackfruit.To find an Asian grocery in your area, search online or ask around at local grocery stores and Asian restaurants.

, Although this should not be your first means of obtaining jackfruit—especially if you’re looking to purchase fresh jackfruit—online retailers may sell jackfruit in various forms. Online stores that specialize in selling food, such as YPFarms and JirosGarden, may deliver better products than other retail giants. Before purchasing jackfruit, read the website to determine the retailer’s return policy, in case the fruit arrives spoiled or damaged.

For example, Amazon sells jackfruit in their “Grocery and Gourmet” section in various forms: dried, canned, or as a whole, fresh fruit. Their fresh Jackfruits are delivered with 2-day shipping."

Make a spinach smoothie.,
Make a spinach omelet.,
Make spinach pancakes.",How to Eat More Spinach1," Spinach can be incorporated into smoothies in a number of ways. You could hide a handful among fruits and chocolate powder for a smaller daily dose, or put it front and center in a nutritious green smoothie. For instance, you might put one cup (236 millilitres) of milk, one packed cup (30 grams) of spinach, one packed cup (30 grams) of kale, three ice cubes, three strawberries, one banana, and a spoonful of yogurt into your blender, then blend on high for thirty seconds.Drink your spinach smoothies immediately.
The iron in spinach is easier to absorb when consumed along with the vitamin C you’ll get in fruit.;
, Adding spinach to an omelet is easy and the result is delicious. For instance, in a cast-iron pan, sauté a handful of chopped onions in a tablespoon of oil on medium heat. While the onions are cooking, mix two eggs together until they achieve a relatively consistent appearance. Add a handful of spinach to the pan when the onions are translucent. Let the spinach and onions cook another minute. Pour the eggs into the pan. After three or four minutes, sprinkle the eggs with feta, salt, and pepper, to taste. Place the pan in the oven and let it cook until the edges brown. Remove the pan, fold the egg mixture over itself, and serve with catsup or salsa., For a savory breakfast, you could try spinach and ricotta cheese pancakes. To get started, pour about two tablespoons of oil into a pan or onto your griddle. Set the griddle or pan to medium heat.Drain one cup (250 grams) of ricotta or cottage cheese and whisk with a spatula until it is smooth. Add, two egg yolks, one finely-chopped green chili, 1/3 cup (120 grams) rice flour, ¾ teaspoon of chili flakes, and salt, to taste. Mix everything together until it becomes a relatively consistent batter.
Spoon about three tablespoons of batter onto your pan or griddle. Cook for about three minutes, then flip and cook the other side for about three minutes, too. If the pancakes aren’t browning, cook them for a bit longer.
Squeeze a lime wedge over the pancakes and top with salsa.

Add grapes to your salad.,
Serve grapes on a charcuterie plate.,
Slice grapes on top of your breakfast French toast.",How to Eat More Grapes1," A popular and easy way to increase the amount of grapes in your daily diet is to toss a few halved grapes on top of a lunch- or dinnertime salad. The sweet flavor and wet texture of the grapes will add a new sensation and flavor to any of your favorite salads. Try grapes on a salad with chicken for a pleasant flavor, or add halved grapes to any seafood or pasta salad.Grapes are especially popular in Mediterranean cuisine, and will go well with most Mediterranean salads. Try putting halved grapes on a salad with feta cheese, olives, and balsamic vinaigrette.
Fruits with a wet texture, like grapes, can reduce your need for dressing. Using less dressing means you reduce the overall calorie count on your salad.;
, Charcuterie plates make for a delicious and appealing pre-meal appetizer or mid-afternoon snack, but can be high in fats and low in fibers. To remedy this, and to add a sweet fruit flavor to the rich cheeses, cured meats, mustards, and crackers, add a handful of grapes to the plate.If you don’t want to take the time to put together a full charcuterie plate, you can make a simpler plate of cubed cheese, whole-wheat crackers, and grapes. Opt for a cheese with a sharper taste — like cheddar or gouda — to cut through the sweet flavor of the grapes.

, Grapes are a common breakfast food, and match well with the thick, grainy texture of French toast. Try preparing the meal with whole wheat bread, cinnamon sugar, egg whites, and a topping of sliced grapes to give your breakfast a rich flavor with plenty of protein. You can also top your toast with other healthy fruits, such as bananas, for a healthy and sweet breakfast. For the sake of variety, switch the type of grapes that you serve with your breakfast. Red grapes tend to be firmer and have a stronger flavor, while green grapes are a little larger and have a mellower flavor.

Determine if you need to soak dry pulses.,
Let dry pulses soak in water overnight.,
Soak pulses in one hour.,
Prepare kidney beans safely.,
Prep soya beans carefully.,
Cook soaked pulses in a heavy saucepan.",How to Eat More Pulses2," Soaking helps to remove chemicals than can cause digestive discomfort such as gas, stomach pains, and bloating.Some pulses do not require soaking, only a quick rinse under running water.


Soak dry pulses such as black beans, kidney beans, white beans, fava beans, pinto beans, whole peas, and chickpeas in water for several hours before cooking.
Do not soak red, yellow, brown, or green lentils or split peas. Rinse these pulses under running water.

, Dry beans and other pulses are too dense to eat uncooked and some, like kidney beans and soya beans, can make you sick if you do not cook them properly. Introduce moisture into the pulse by soaking them in water overnight, unlocking all its minerals and nutrients.Remove any broken or shriveled seeds, and then rinse them under cold running water.Place the seeds in a bowl or a dish, and completely cover them with water. Place the dish in the refrigerator overnight to soak for at least 12 hours. The next day, rinse the seeds under running water.
If you experience bloating, flatulence, or other digestive discomforts from eating pulses, be sure to change the soaking water periodically throughout the soaking process., It is not always easy to plan your meals the day before, but don’t fret if you want to cook with dry pulses that have not soaked overnight. You can quickly soften and cook them within one hour by boiling them on a stovetop or by placing them in the microwave.


Rinse the pulses under running water. Bring them to a boil in water in a saucepan for 2 minutes. Afterward, remove them from the heat, and carefully cover them with a lid. Let the pulses sit for an hour. When they have softened, rinse under cool running water.
To quickly cook the dry pulses in a microwave, rinse with running water, and then cover them with fresh water in a microwave-safe dish like a glass casserole dish. Lightly cover the dish with a lid or a paper towel, and microwave them on high for 10 to 15 minutes. Keep the dish covered, and let them soak for about an hour. Afterward, rinse the seeds with cool, running water.

, Kidney beans contain lectin, a natural toxin that can cause vomiting and stomach pains. Canned kidney beans are fully cooked, but if you are cooking with dry kidney beans, you’ll want to make sure you cook them properly to remove any traces of lectin.Soak the dry kidney beans in water for 12 hours. After they have soaked, drain the beans and rinse them under fresh water. Boil them in fresh water for 10 minutes, then lower to a simmer for 45 to 60 minutes until they are tender enough to eat., Like kidney beans, soya beans contain a toxin that can make you ill if they are not cooked properly. Soya beans contain a trypsin inhibitor, which can upset your digestive tract. These beans need to boil and cook for several hours before they are safe to consume.


Be sure to rinse soya beans and let them soak for 12 hours. After they have soaked overnight, drain them, and put them in fresh water. Bring them to a vigorous boil for one hour on a stovetop. Remove them from the heat, and let them sit for two to three hours until they are tender enough to eat., After the dry pulses have soaked, fill a large saucepan with water and a 1 teaspoon or 5 milliliters of oil to prevent the water from foaming. The pulses will double or triple in volume as they cook, so be sure you are using a large saucepan. Bring the pulses to a boil, cover with a lid, and simmer the pulses until they are tender.The cooking time will vary depending on the type of pulses you are using. Kidney, pinto, black, and cannellini beans will take about 60 to 75 minutes to cook, while lentils and split peas will take around 30 minutes.Be sure to read the suggested cooking time on your package or can of pulses.

Buy dry pulses.,
Store dry pulses in a glass container.,
Stock up on pre-cooked canned pulses.,
Keep canned pulses in the pantry.",How to Eat More Pulses3," Dry pulses can be found in many grocery stores, super markets, and specialty food stores. Dry beans, chickpeas, peas, and lentils are inexpensive and can often be purchased in bulk. Look for seeds that are uniformly sized, brightly colored, and have smooth skins. Be sure that they do not have chips or shriveled shells. , Dry pulses can keep for several years if they are preserved in a tightly sealed container and kept in a cool, dry place. Glass containers are best for storing and preserving dry pulses.Although dry pulses can be kept for several years, it is recommended that you consume them within a year. They will become drier, smaller, and tougher over time, which will increase their overall cooking time.Store your dry beans, lentils, and peas high on a pantry shelf and away from direct sunlight. Keep the containers away from water and other liquids, and do not store on them on the floor of a pantry.

, Like dry pulses, canned pulses are inexpensive and can be purchased in grocery stores, super markets, and specialty food stores. Most markets will carry a wide variety, including chickpeas, lentils, fava beans, kidney beans, garbanzo beans, and many more. Canned pulses are pre-cooked, which makes cooking with these seeds convenient and simple., Store canned pulses in a dry, dark pantry. Canned beans, peas, and lentils will often have an expiration date listed on the can, but an unopened and intact can of pulses can last one to two years past the expiration date. If the can is dented, the pulses may be bad, but not necessarily. If the top of the can is dome-shaped and rounded, then the packaging has definitely been compromised and the contents absolutely should not be consumed.Once you have opened a can of pulses, you can store the leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to five days."

Cut into a raw jackfruit.,
Turn the jackfruit inside out.,
Boil or roast the jackfruit seeds.,
Roast the jackfruit seeds in a cast-iron pan.",How to Eat Jackfruit2," If you’d like to prepare a raw jackfruit for yourself—whether for the experience or for the fruit—you’ll need to go about it in a specific way. Take a sharp chef’s knife and cut the jackfruit in half.

You’ll see a large, white central stem: cut this into small pieces and remove it.

, To do this, you’ll need to have a firm grasp on the outside of the jackfruit half. Clearly visible segments of fruit will stand out (it’ll look a little like pulled pork); grab a segment and pull it out from the jackfruit body. Tear this fruit segment open, and extract the seed.Repeat this process until you’ve extracted all of the seeds from both halves of the jackfruit.
Jackfruit produces a very sticky sap that will cling to your hands, clothes, knife, and cutting board, and make the process of cutting the fruit difficult. To avoid this, slather your hands and knife in vegetable oil, which will diffuse the sticky sap.

, Jackfruit are flavorful, and taste approximately like a mixture between a banana and a pineapple, with mango-like hints of flavor as well. The seeds are the actual fruit of the plant, and will be the fleshy material contained in cans of jackfruit that you purchase. The seeds are tasty on their own. To prepare them, you can boil the seeds for 10–15 minutes (until soft), and then eat them directly. For a firmer texture, roast your seeds in the oven at 400°F (204°C) for 20 minutes.Jackfruit are difficult to peel properly; the exterior is prickly and thick, and once you cut through it, you’ll find that the interior is gummy, sticky, and difficult to cut apart (as described above). The fruit is in pods which are challenging to extract.
For this reason, it’s easier to purchase already prepared and canned jackfruit from a grocery store or an Asian market, rather than cutting through an entire fruit on your own.

, In Southeast Asian cultures, jackfruit seeds are often cooked on a charcoal grill and eaten while still hot. This gives the fruit a delicious smoky flavor. If you’d like to approximate this method of cooking but don’t have your own charcoal grill, you can roast the seeds in a cast-iron pan. The heat from the pan will cook the seeds consistently through.Cook the jackfruit seeds at 400°F (204°C). Use your oven light to check the seeds every 5 minutes. You’ll know they are done when the jackfruit seeds break open and the fleshy fruit “pops” out from the inside.

Use jackfruit to make a spicy salad.,
Sautée the vegetables for the spicy salad.,
Treat the jackfruit like pork and eat it in a sandwich.,
Add spices to the sautéing mixture.,
Prepare jackfruit as a fish substitute in a “tuna salad” sandwich.,
Add beans and other ingredients to the jackfruit.",How to Eat Jackfruit3," If you’re looking to mix jackfruit in with other healthy greens, you can include canned jackfruit in a spicy salad with red chilies, scallions, and other spices. Purchase a can of green jackfruit in water, and cook the contents on “low” in a crockpot for 4–5 hours to soften the flesh.

Once the jackfruit is cooked, you can break it apart easily using a fork or a spoon.

, Use vegetable oil or butter to sautée 3–4 red chilies, 5–6 cloves of garlic, and the white tops of your scallions, and sautée for about 5 minutes. Add the jackfruit and 1/8 cup (30 mL) of fish sauce, and sautée for 2 more minutes.Dice two shallots and cook these in a pan of vegetable oil for 2–3 minutes. Strain the shallots, let them cool, and then toss the fried shallots with the prepared jackfruit mixture. Add ¼ cup (59 mL) of fresh mint and ¼ cup (59 mL) of fresh cilantro, and serve immediately.

, Jackfruit is a common vegan pork substitute, as its texture when cooked and “pulled” is similar to the texture of pulled pork. To make a jackfruit “pork” sandwich, purchase 3 20-ounce cans of jackfruit; remove the jackfruit seeds and cut the fruit pieces into bite-size chunks. Sautée ½ of an onion and 3 cloves of garlic together, and then add the jackfruit, along with 1 teaspoon of sugar, 1 teaspoon of brown sugar, and 1 ½ teaspoons (7.4 mL) of liquid smoke.

Avoid purchasing jackfruit canned in syrup, as the taste will be too sweet and overwhelm the other flavors in the sandwich.

, Continue to sautée the jackfruit, onion, and garlic mixture as you stir in several spices, including cayenne pepper, cumin, chili powder, and paprika. Add 1 cup of vegetable broth and simmer the mixture for 10–15 minutes, until the jackfruit has absorbed all of the liquid.Set the oven to 400°F (204°C), and spread the jackfruit “pork” mixture on a baking tray. Press the jackfruit with a spatula until it takes the consistency of pulled pork. Add ½ cup (118 mL) of BBQ sauce, and cook for 30–35 minutes.
Once the jackfruit is lightly browned, remove the pan from the oven and spoon the jackfruit “pork” mixture onto a roll or bun. Serve once it has cooled.

, Purchase a can of jackfruit packed in water, and use a fork to pull the flesh of the fruit apart. After pouring out the jackfruit water, sautée the jackfruit in butter or vegetable oil.

As the jackfruit cooks, add to the pan ½ cup (118 mL) of onion and 2 cloves of minced garlic.

, While the jackfruit mixture is cooking, in a bowl mash 1 cup of cooked great white northern beans and then add lemon juice, Dijon mustard, pickle relish, ¼ cup of mayonnaise, and ½ teaspoon (2.5 mL) of dried tarragon.Once it’s finished sautéing, add the jackfruit mixture, and mix everything together. Spoon the jackfruit “tuna” salad atop a bread of your choice, and add a handful of shredded cheese and a couple slices of tomato.

Enjoy a handful of grapes instead of a high-calorie dessert.,
Put grape jam or jelly on your breakfast toast.,
Eat grapes throughout the day to help with hydration.",How to Eat More Grapes2," Grapes are a naturally sweet fruit, but a cup of grapes contains roughly 60 – 100 calories. If you’re hungry for dessert after a meal and considering a high-calorie option, such as cake, pie, a donut, or a cupcake, opt for a handful of grapes instead.You’ll consume far fewer calories and much less fat.


Grapes contain no fat and very little protein, unlike other, higher-calorie foods, including fatty desserts. Consequently, grapes are an effective part of a weight-loss diet.
Grapes provide carbohydrates and fiber. They provide slight amounts of fiber: a cup contains 1 – 2 grams.

, Many varieties of grape spread can likely be found at your local grocery store. Grape jelly spread on toast, a bagel, or any other breakfast grain food provides a burst of sweet fruit flavor in the morning. Look for grape spreads that do not contain chemical flavorings or artificial flavors, and that instead contain natural grape flavors.If you can find a grape jelly or jam that still contains the grape seeds, it may provide even more benefits to your health. Out of all parts of the grape, grape seeds have the highest concentration of antioxidants., Grapes have high water content and will help keep your body hydrated.So, when you’re feeling thirsty, reach for a handful of grapes — or drink a glass of grape juice — along with a glass of water. Try keeping a bowl of grapes on your counter during the day; this will encourage you to snack on the grapes regularly.


Grapes are also a great source of potassium, which improves the health of your heart by regulating blood-pressure levels.Many individuals do not consume an adequate amount of potassium daily (4,700 mg daily), so regularly snacking on high-potassium grapes can have immediate health benefits, since a serving of grapes provides roughly 200 mg of potassium.

"
Diversify the types of grapes you eat.,
Have a glass of wine after dinner.,
Serve grapes in a smoothie.",How to Eat More Grapes3," Grapes themselves make a great snack and a tasty addition to many meals, but there are many other forms in which you can eat (and drink) grapes. To start, have a glass of grape juice when you’re thirsty — the juice contains many of the same healthy and powerful antioxidants that are found in whole grapes. Raisins are also a popular snack and, since an individual raisin is smaller than a grape, can be eaten when you’re in the mood for a light snack.If you’re put off by the grainy texture of grapes that contain seeds, look for seedless grapes at your local supermarket.
Additionally, there are many types of grapes, each with a distinct texture and flavor. Red and green grapes are most commonly found in grocery stores, while Concord grapes (often purple in color) are typically used in grape juice and jams.

, Many studies have emphasized the health benefits of wine — especially red wine — when consumed in moderation. Some of the health benefits associated with red wine consumption include: the prevention of colon cancer and decreasing the rate of bowel tumors, the prevention of breast cancer, and the reduction of the risk of developing dementia.Resveratrol is an antioxidant that is found in red wine and may prevent damage to blood vessels, reduce LDL (""bad"") cholesterol, and prevent blood clots. It may also support heart health and reduce inflammation, though more research is needed.Many of these benefits are also associated with frequent consumption of unfermented grapes.
Fewer studies have focused on the health benefits of moderate white-wine consumption, although white wine may also bring similar health benefits.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture defines “moderate” drinking as a single drink per day for women, and up to two drinks a day for men.

, In addition to looking for new ways to eat grapes as a fruit, you can also find ways to drink the grapes in a liquefied form. If you’d like to consume grapes in a nutritious, filling, sweet, and nonalcoholic way, try blending grapes and other fruits into a smoothie. To make a smoothie, you can blend several compatible fruits together, including pineapple, peaches, and strawberries.If you’re looking to cool down in the summer, drop a handful of ice cubes in your smoothie (before or after blending it) to make the smoothie ice cold and more refreshing.

Grill peach slices with roasted meats.",How to Eat a Peach," The best peaches are grown locally and picked at their peak of ripeness, when they're just ready to fall from the tree. Depending on where your peaches are coming from, the exact time of that season will vary. In the United States, peaches are traditionally picked during the summer months, but are picked in different places from April to October.Peach season in the following peach-growing regions are as follows:


Florida: April-May
California: May-September
Georgia: May-August
South Carolina: May-August
Michigan: July-September
New Jersey: July-September
Idaho: August-October
Chile: November-April;
, It's best to pick peaches when they're ripe, then eat them in 2-3 days. Store bought peaches are typically less ripe, but will ripen some, left away from sunlight in room temperature for 3-7 days. If peaches are refrigerated, they'll stop ripening, so it's a good idea to put them in the fridge in a paper bag, when they're at the ripeness you're looking for.


Pick peaches at the store that feel heavier than they look, which is a sign that the flesh is dense with juice.
Don't squeeze peaches to see if they ""give."" Ripe peaches will give when you press into them, but that will leave a bruise, which will rot quickly.
Ripe peaches often smell quite strongly at the stem, although some peach varieties will smell more strongly than other varieties.

, Peaches have been cultivated for almost 3000 years, and there are literally hundreds of peach varietals grown worldwide.In the west, most peaches grown have yellow-orange flesh, while Asian peaches tend to be white.


The best peaches to eat? Whatever variety is available locally. Local peaches are often much fresher and juicer, because they're allowed to be more fragile than peaches that need to be engineering for transport.
The famous Georgia peach is an ""Elberta"" variety. Other common commercially grown varieties in the US include the June Lady, Flavorcrest, and the Red Top.All peaches are either ""clingstone"" or ""freestone"" peaches, depending on whether or not the pit ""clings"" to the flesh or not. Some hybrid varieties also exist.""Melting"" peaches are typically clingstone, and are most often sold commercially for eating purposes. When ripe, ""melting"" peaches will be extremely juicy, as if the flesh were melting. ""Non-melting"" peaches will stay much more firm, and are the peaches typically used in canning.

, When you get some peaches, remove the stems and store them stem-end down, on a fabric that will breathe well to help it ripen some. Linen or cotton napkins work great for ripening peaches.Cover the peaches with a thin napkin to keep them ripening. Put them in the refrigerator, loosely packed in a paper bag, or just loose, when the flesh begins to depress slightly and they smell fragrant.


Once refrigerated, peaches usually need to be eaten in a few days. They'll become overripe in less than a week. Never store peaches in closed plastic bags, which promote spoilage.
If you want to freeze peaches, it's common to blanch them quickly, then remove the skin with a knife and cut into bite-sized peaches. Store in air-tight freezer bags.

, Always rinse your peaches in clean water, rubbing the skin gently with your hands or a vegetable brush, right before you're ready to eat them or prepare them. This helps to remove dirt and bacteria, as well as residual pesticides.


Wait to wash your peaches until right before you eat them. Getting them wet before refrigerating can promote spoilage and bacteria growth.While it's perfectly fine to eat peach skin, you can remove the skin with a paring knife, if you don't like the texture. While peach skin is high in phytonutrients and fiber, many people aren't a fan of the fuzziness., Best way to eat a ripe peach? Just dig right in and get your chin wet. You can eat the whole thing, except the hard pit at the center.


Try cutting the peach in half, rotating the knife around the stone in the center, then twisting gently to pull both halves free. Remove the pit easily and eat each half without worrying about biting into something hard.
One of the joys of the ripe peach is its juicy texture. Some of them can be a bit too juicy, though, so you want to be careful to avoid staining your shirt. Get a handkerchief or a paper towel to catch the drips.

, Use a paring knife to slice from the stem to the tail of your peach, going all the way around the center stone. Pull the halves in half, then cut each half into three or more slices, depending on how big your peach is. This is a great way to snack on fresh peaches.


Try sprinkling your peach slices with a small pinch of cinnamon or brown sugar for an added little kick. Fresh cream is also an excellent addition.
If you've got an extremely ripe clingstone peach, this can be a little tough to pull off. You may end up smashing the peach and having trouble moving the individual slices if they're clinging to the pit.

, To add a little texture and sweetness to your yoghurt, diced peach is an excellent candidate. Aside from the probiotic properties of the yoghurt, you'll have a fruit high in iron, potassium, vitamins A and C, antioxidants, and various phytonutrients.Plus, even better, it just tastes good.


Really want to gild the lily? Add some diced peach to a bowl of vanilla ice cream. Too good.

, Smoothies are made better with a little peeled peach, helping to bring sweetness and flavor to your beverage. For a simple breakfast smoothie that involves peaches try this:


Mix equal parts of peeled peach and milk in the blender, over ice (two cups of each makes for a nice portion). Top with a third as much orange juice and honey, to taste.
Other great additions include yoghurt, banana, strawberry, blueberry, chia seeds, peanut butter, or raw oats., Diced peach can be added to a variety of cereals and other mixtures for a sweet treat. Try a little peach on top of:


Granola or other breakfast cereal
Oatmeal
Cream of wheat
Polenta or hominy grits
Muesli

, A great summer peach beverage? Something Hemingway loved? Yes, please. By mixing peach puree and a little lemon, you can create a sweet and refreshing base for a champagne cocktail. Try mixing up the following in a food processor:


Put four peeled and de-pitted peaches with the juice of one lemon and blend until smooth, then add sugar or honey to taste, and a tablespoon or two more of lemon juice.
Pour some of the mixture into a champagne flute, then top with an equal amount of good Italian sparkling wine, called spumante, or champagne. A delicious summertime cocktail.

, Poached peaches, fresh pureed raspberries, and vanilla ice cream. What more do you need to know? Here's how to make it:


In a pan, heat a cup of water, a tablespoon of lemon juice, and about a cup of sugar, stirring to dissolve the sugar. Bring it to a quick simmer and add four halved, peeled, and pitted peaches, cooking them until soft. Remove with a slotted spoon.
Blend three cups of raspberries, a quarter cup of powdered sugar, and a tablespoon of lemon juice in a food processor.
Let the warm peaches cool and add them to a cold bowl, then top with vanilla ice cream and raspberry sauce.

, Whether you've got peaches that are underripe or overripe, clingstone or freestone, delicious or mediocre, peaches make a great addition to tarts, pies, and cobblers. If you've got a lot of peaches, use them in your favorite baking dish.


Make peach pie. Peach pie is an iconic and delicious late-summer treat in the US. Delicate, sweet, and simple, you can learn to make a good pie crust here and make a peach pie specifically here.


Bake a peach cobbler. Peach cobbler is a lot like pie, but without the crust and with a delicious, sweet, crunchy topping that goes so well with vanilla ice cream it should probably be illegal.

, If you've got a bunch of peaches on your hands, they make a great candidate for cooking down into a super-sweet jam. Mix equal parts of fresh peach puree with white sugar, a little lemon juice, and boxed pectin to mix up a batch.


Most commercial pectin comes with specific instructions and ratios to follow, depending on what kind of fruit you're using. Always defer to the pectin instructions specifically.
Try mixing ginger syrup with peaches for a ginger-peach jam that goes great in marinades and on grilled meats. It also goes extremely well with blueberry, plum, or cherry.

, When your peaches start turning, learning to dry them effectively can be a great way to save them and get a little more life out of a crop. The best way is to cut them into bite-sized slices and dry them in a commercial food dehydrated, or the oven on the lowest possible temperature for a long period of time. Low and slow.

, While it may sound unconventional, peaches make a dynamic addition to a variety of grilled meat dishes. Quickly searing peach slices on the grill can be used as a side or as a topping for roast pork, chicken, or steak.


Cut peach slices, then brush a little balsamic vinegar onto the surface of them before grilling them, flesh side down, for 3-5 minutes. It won't take long.

Don’t forget other “tastes” in your recipes.",How to Make Your Own Recipe," Are you a fan of Italian, Tex-Mex, Thai, fusion, BBQ? Dozens of cuisines have been created around the world using ingredients native to that region. The simplest approach when first learning to adapt a recipe might be to start with food that’s most familiar to you. This will help you recognize when the flavors are unbalanced.


You will also already be familiar with the specific cooking techniques used for that cuisine.;
, Find recipes you’d like to try by browsing cookbooks, magazines and recipes online if you don't already have one on hand you want to modify. Start with tried-and-true cookbooks and online recipes with many positive reviews, so you will know a recipe works well and that many like it. Finally, remember that modifying a recipe is an experiment. It could turn out to be the most delicious thing you’ve ever eaten or an inedible mess. Have fun with it!Reviews of online recipes often include information on how the reviewer adapted it. They also often discuss tricks discovered to make the dish more easily and quickly. Reviews also frequently cover what didn’t work.
You can also modify a dish through examining one you’ve eaten at a restaurant or friend’s home. Write down the ingredients you remember and the cooking techniques you think were used. Make this your base recipe.Don't be surprised if the measurements and instructions don’t make sense when using an ""heirloom"" recipe written decades ago. For instance, how much is a ""tumbler"" of milk? Go to a website such as this for translations and conversions: .
And when a recipe calls for ingredients in European or American/British units (e.g., grams versus ounces) that you need to convert, check out sites such as this: .

, Is it because you don’t like all the ingredients but enjoy the dish overall? Are you adapting it to increase its yield or portion sizes? To make it healthier or to accommodate allergies? The answer will guide you in adapting it successfully. Here are some tips and links to websites that will help you a) convert yield and portion size and b) adapt recipes to be healthier and to accommodate allergies.


Conduct online searches using the name of the dish and words such as “gluten free,” “dairy free,” “vegan,” “sugar free” and so forth when modifying for health or allergy purposes. You’ll have a better idea of the ingredients you can substitute after reading a few of these recipes.Here is a chart for adapting recipe ingredients to make them more healthy: Additionally, food scientists have found that people don’t notice much of a flavor difference when the following are changed: reducing sugar and fats by 1/3, omitting salt or reducing it by 1/2, substituting whole wheat flour for 1/4 to 1/2 of all-purpose flour, and substituting finely ground oat bran or oatmeal for 1/4 of all-purpose flour..
Lastly, here is a website to convert yield and portion sizes: .

, It’s difficult to change a recipe for the better until you’ve made it and know its starting point. You also get a lot of useful information from making it “by the book” the first time. For example, were there unnecessary steps, or ones that you can simplify? Were there ingredients that seemed unimportant to the final taste? How is the batter supposed to look?

, Some parts of recipes – particularly those for baked goods – cannot be changed. This is because these foods use precise ratios between and among necessary structural ingredients.All breads, for instance, are 5 parts flour and 3 parts liquid. You wouldn’t end up with bread if you changed that ratio. So always consider the role of the ingredient when deciding if you can substitute it, and how.


Signature ingredients can be swapped, but be careful because they also are typically core to a dish. For example, basil is necessary in a pesto recipe.
Accent ingredients, such as blueberries in muffins, are more easily modified without risk of ruining the dish., You can avoid unsuccessfully adapting many recipes once you learn the fundamental ratios. You can also use ratios to form the basis of potentially hundreds of recipe modifications.While some ratios call for cups, many call for parts. When they call for parts, they mean weight. A cup of flour, for instance, could vary in how many ounces is actually in it based upon variables such as whether a sifter was used or if the flour was packed into the measuring cup.
Therefore, think in terms of ounces and get a good digital kitchen scale to use.Also remember that when ounces are the unit of measurement, weight is measured in ounces but volume is measured in fluid ounces. They aren’t equivalent. Thus, always use liquid measuring cups for liquids., Below are the ratios for stocks and sauces commonly used in a variety of recipes.


Stocks: 3 parts water, 2 parts bones
Consommé: 12 parts stock, 2 parts meat, 1 part mirepoix, 1 part egg white
Roux: 2 parts fat, 3 parts flour
Brine: 20 parts water, 1 part salt
Mayonnaise: 20 parts oil, 1 part liquid, 1 part egg yolk (measure as part of the one part liquid)
Vinaigrette: 3 parts oil, 1 part vinegar
Hollandaise: 5 parts butter, 1 part liquid, 1 part egg yolk, These ratios, which encompass everything from pizza dough to crepes, will take you a long way in your recipe-making as well.


Bread: 5 parts flour, 3 parts liquid
Pasta: 3 parts flour, 2 parts egg
Pie dough: 3 parts flour, 2 parts fat, 1 part liquid
Biscuits: 3 parts flour, 1 part fat, 2 parts liquid
Cookies: 3 parts flour, 2 parts fat, 1 part sugar
Pound/sponge cake: 1 part flour, 1 part fat, 1 part egg, 1 part sugar
Pate a’ choux: 1 part flour, 1 part fat, 2 parts liquid, 2 parts egg
Muffins: 2 parts flour, 1 part fat, 2 parts liquid, 1 part egg
Fritters: 2 parts flour, 2 parts liquid, 1 part egg
Pancakes: 2 parts flour, ½ part fat, 2 parts liquid, 1 part egg
Crepes: ½ part flour, 1 part liquid, 1 part egg
Pot stickers: 2 parts flour, 1 part liquid
Crackers: 4 parts flour, 1 part fat, 3 parts liquid, These will have all those with a sweet tooth chomping at the bit, especially after creating a recipe based upon a cake or pie dough ratio.


Custard: 2 parts liquid, 1 part egg
Crème anglaise: 4 parts milk or cream, 1 part egg yolk, 1 part sugar
Chocolate sauce: 1 part cream, 1 part chocolate
Caramel sauce: 1 part cream, 1 part sugar, Before randomly substituting ingredients or cooking techniques, taste the food from the original recipe and think about what you like and don’t like about it. Would a different spice improve it, or more/less of the spice used? Might swapping a certain ingredient give it a better texture? If so, think about ingredients that would accomplish this without changing the flavor.


If cooking for others, ask them for their thoughts on the dish as made according to the original recipe. What do they like or dislike?

, When adapting a recipe, it’s critical to understand the difference between flavor and taste because interchanging ingredients can dramatically alter the dish’s flavor. Taste is what our taste buds perceive when a food touches one of the now five identified taste receptors on the tongue. There are five scientifically identified tastes: salty, sweet, bitter, sour and umami. Flavor, on the other hand, is a combination of taste; the aroma of the food; and the texture of the food.Balancing the tastes is necessary for a nicely flavored dish. Knowing which tastes balance each other will help you decide how to best modify recipes and to correct flavor imbalances. Thus, these tastes and ways to balance them are discussed in part 3.

, In many cases, this will involve swapping ingredients or changing the amounts of various ingredients you use. Focus initially on exchanging ingredients with similar textures and flavors. And make sure you’re sticking to fundamental ratios when doing so. Experiment with ingredients having different tastes and textures after you've made it the first time.But remember that ultimately the tastes must be balanced, or the modification will not have the flavor you want.


Take detailed notes each time you modify a recipe. You won’t be able to recreate it if you don’t.
Your notes will also help you determine what didn't work in your modified recipe. They’ll also help you avoid repeating mistakes if you make it again.
Here are things to include in your notes: the necessity of an ingredient, its impact on the flavor, how it reacted to other ingredients (e.g., soggy raisins in baked goods), and if it is a structural, signature or accent ingredient.

, Ask yourself these questions: Was it improved or not? What did/did not work? Why? What was the final form of the recipe? Would you change anything? Considering these things will help you think of modifying recipes as a process of simply molding them as you choose. It will also make improvising easier and more intuitive in the future.


The last step is to write the recipe once you’ve modified it to your liking.

, Start your recipe card, or whatever you choose to use to write or type out your new recipe on, with the name of your new dish. Have fun with it but still be descriptive enough that it’s clear what will be made. If you’ve adapted it from one or more other recipes, give credit where it’s due by next noting it's an adaptation of a particular recipe. Beneath that list the number of servings and serving size, if appropriate., The ingredients list lets the person making the recipe (or you, if you’re making it again) formulate a preparation and cooking plan. List the ingredients in the order they’ll be used in the recipe. Use precise measurements and indicate if they need preparation. For instance, instead of writing “1 clove of garlic” when the instructions later say to “add 1/2 tablespoon minced garlic,” write “1/2 tablespoon garlic, minced.”If an ingredient is used more than once in a recipe, list it where it’s first used. Then write “divided” after it, set off by a comma. So, for example, if a recipe calls for 6 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil to first sauté vegetables and to later create a vinaigrette, you’d write, “6 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil, divided.”
If a dish has different elements, such as a pie has a crust and a filling, break up the ingredients list with headings such as “Crust” and “Filling.”Don’t use two numerals together; set the second off with parentheses. For example: “1 (12-pounce) package of cream cheese.”Be literal in your measurements. A “cup of chopped spinach” isn’t the same as a “cup of spinach, chopped.” The latter would obviously have much less.Capitalize ingredients that start with a letter instead of a number. For example: “Sea salt to taste.”
If preparing an ingredient is easy, set its description off with a comma after the ingredient. For example, “1 stick of butter, melted.”
Use generic names rather than brand names. So, for instance, say whipped cream instead of Cool Whip., Think through the steps – including time spent pre-heating the oven, bringing the water to a boil or getting the grill going – and organize it to decrease dead time. Make sure each step is in the proper order as well. You don’t have to write in sentences, but you can. This is your recipe, so write it in your words and style. Be descriptive by providing visual cues like “barely translucent,” “golden, pebbly top,” “almost iridescent,” etc. Also give warnings when something is tricky or dangerous.State exact or approximate cooking times, with descriptors to indicate when something is done.
Separate each step into a new paragraph. If you're mixing all dry ingredients in one bowl, for example, make that one step (and its own paragraph).
As with the ingredient list, separate different parts of the process with headers.
The second to last instruction should involve plating, garnishing and the temperature at which it should be served.
The final instruction should discuss storage, if that applies. For example, “Freeze muffins individually in plastic wrap for up to 30 days.”, Check over your work for errors, give it a personal touch if you’d like and sign and date it. If you wrote it on a recipe card, go online and get a vintage, metal recipe box and start filing away. If you printed them, create a recipe book using scrapbooking materials or a photo album. You can even create your own online recipe book on websites such as these: , , or .

, Salt isn’t, as most think, used in a dish so it will tasty salty. Instead, it has three functions: to reduce bitterness, enhance sweetness and to heighten the aromas and natural tastes of other ingredients.While not all dishes need salt, it generally enhances the overall flavor of most so they don’t taste flat.


If you have a dish that tastes flat or bitter, try adding a three-fingered pinch of salt before anything else. Taste it again. If it’s still not right, add a little more and give it another taste. That might be all it takes. If not, proceed to balancing in other ways.
Salt absorbs into food as it sits. If you add too much salt, you can try increasing the sweet or sour components or by diluting the dish a bit with water.You can also try to compensate by adjusting the side dishes. For example, don’t salt the rice or add a sweet or sour side dish.To avoid over-concentration when reducing liquids, add salt after the liquid is reduced., The taste of sweet is a great contrast to sour and salty tastes. It can help balance dishes with ingredients having these tastes or if a dish’s flavor becomes too salty or sour. While the sweet taste in most foods comes from sugars – cane sugar (granulated, turbinado, brown, powdered, bakers, fruit, etc.) and beet sugar – it can also come from molasses, maple syrup, honey, carrots, mango and other sweet foods. So consider these as alternatives when creating your recipes.Sweet really benefits from sour, which is why a squeeze of lemon juice over a fruit salad or cream cheese frosting on cake work so well together.Unfortunately, because people are consuming more and more packaged foods that often have a lot of high fructose corn syrup and the like, we have become more tolerant of sweetness and require more of it to taste it.

, At many restaurants, bottles of vinegar are sitting on the table and lemon wedges are served on the side with a number of entrees. That’s because sour as a taste brings out the natural flavors in foods. It also balances sweetness and spiciness and enhances saltiness. It’s generally found in acidic foods like limes, lemons, oranges, sour cream, yogurt and pickled veggies. It’s also in vinegars like balsamic, sherry, red, apple cider and rice. Many other fruits are also classified as sour: raspberries, blueberries, red currants and grapes.If a dish is too sour, add something sweet or something with fat to balance it.Sour also helps to balance foods that are too spicy., Bitter is offensive at best and inedible at worst when used in large quantities or when not balanced. But when in harmony with other tastes, particularly sweetness, it adds depth and richness to food.It’s tarty edge also perks up the taste buds. Chocolate and coffee are naturally bitter, as are olives; greens like radicchio, arugula, dandelion and kale; hops; bitter melon; brussel sprouts; turnips; chicory; and grapefruit. Pomegranate juice is used often as well.Experiment with adding arugula, chicory and endive to your salads; thicken sauces with unsweetened chocolate; or deglaze with a bitter liqueur Campari instead of a juice or stock., The last taste discovered, umami, is described as savory or mouthwatering, though there’s not an exact translation from Japanese to English. It amplifies the flavor of a dish and is found in a variety of meats, such as beef, pork, chicken, and cured ham; vegetables, such as shitake mushrooms, truffles, Chinese cabbage, soy beans, and sweet potatoes; seafood, such as prawns, squid, tuna, mackerel, seaweed, and shellfish; and cheeses like parmesan, Gruyere, and Swiss. It’s also in green tea, tomatoes and soy sauce. Bacon also triggers the umami taste.Aging, curing, ripeness and fermenting all enhance umami.Going overboard is difficult to correct. The best way is typically to add more ingredients that are not umami-rich.

, While spicy, floral, earthy, minty, buttery, fruity and so forth aren’t technically tastes in the sense that they aren’t processed by our taste buds, they are tastes in the sense that they are notes in foods that we identify with dishes. For example, if something becomes too spicy, you can balance it with a sweet taste. Think of Mexican chocolate with its pinch of cayenne pepper."

Add the remaining water.,
Allow the mixture to rest for three to seven days.,
Strain out any solids.,
Seal the jug with an airlock.,
Ferment the tej until the bubbles stop.,
Bottle the final product.,
Enjoy fresh or aged.",How to Make Tej1," Pour the entire 1 gallon (4 L) of water into a large saucepan and bring it to a rolling boil over high heat.


Let the water boil for 1 or 2 minutes, then remove it from the heat and allow it to cool down to room temperature.
This step is only necessary if you are using tap water, since tap water tends to have contaminants like chlorine and hard minerals. If you decide to use distilled water, you can skip this step.;
, While it is not necessary, you can flavor the tej with edible blossoms, like dandelions or violets, or other herbs.Collect the herbs and wash away any dirt and other contaminants.
Chop the blossoms into rough pieces, then scatter them in the bottom of the crock or jar you plan to use.

, Pour the full 1 quart (1 L) of honey into the crock or jar you wish to use. The honey should be poured directly over the previously prepared blossoms, if applicable.


Raw, unpasteurized honey works best for this process, but commercially prepared honey will also work if it is the only available option.
It is easiest to use a large crock or similar earthenware pot when preparing a large batch of tej. If necessary, though, you can use smaller glass jars instead.
Make sure that you distribute the ingredients evenly among all vessels when using multiple jars.

, Pour 1 quart (1 L) of your prepared room temperature water into the crock of honey. Stir well until the honey is dissolved.Use a wooden spoon for best results, and use the same wooden spoon to stir the tej throughout the entire fermentation process. Do not wash the spoon in between steps. “Good” fermentation bacteria can build up in the porous wood, thereby encouraging better fermentation and enhancing the final flavor of the beverage.

, Pour the remaining 3 quarts (3 L) of water over the diluted honey in the crock. Stir well to combine.


The texture of the mixture should be even throughout the entire batch.
If you taste the mixture now, it will seem very sweet. This sweetness will become more subdued as the drink ferments, though.
Make sure that there is at least 1 or 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) of space at the top of the crock or jar after you pour the water in. This extra space will make it easier for you to stir the mixture.

, Cover the top of the crock with a cheesecloth or clean dish towel. Set it aside in a warm place and allow it to ferment for several days, or until fizzy froth begins to appear on the surface of the liquid.


Mix the beverage two or three times a day during this step.
Covering the crock with a cloth will prevent dust and pests from finding their way inside, but the porous quality of the cloth will allow natural yeast to slip in and work on your beverage. Do not cover the crock with a tight lid.
Ideally, the liquid should ferment in temperatures between 60 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit (15.6 and 26.7 degrees Celsius). Sitting it on a table or counter out of direct sunlight will usually be sufficiently warm.
The exact amount of time can vary, and the beverage will need a longer initial fermentation period if the air around it is somewhat cold.

, Once the initial fermentation period is over, pour the beverage through a fine mesh sieve and into a large glass jug.


If you do not have a sieve, you could line a funnel with cheesecloth or coffee filters and pour the tej through that. You simply need to strain out any herbs, blossoms, and solid contaminants.
You could also use a siphon to transfer the beverage from the crock to the jug.
Leave as little empty headspace as possible in the jar. Less access to oxygen is better for the final part of the fermentation process. If necessary, you can fill extra space with additional honey and water in a ratio of one part honey to four parts water.

, Fit an airlock into the top of the jug. The seal between the airlock and the jug should be very tight.


Different airlock designs work differently, so it is a good idea to read the instructions that come with your airlock to determine the proper way to install it.
Usually, you will need to insert a special cork or rubber stopper in the top of the jar and fit the airlock into a hole positioned in the center of that stopper. Add water, brandy, or vodka to the airlock, filling it halfway, before securing the the lock with its cap.

, Return the beverage to a warm location and allow it to ferment for two to four weeks.


As before, the ideal temperature range is between 60 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit (15.6 and 26.7 degrees Celsius).
The exact amount of required fermentation time can vary. Essentially, though, you simply need to wait until bubbles no longer form in your airlock. Once the bubbles stop, the yeasts inside the beverage are no longer consuming sugar and producing gas.

, Pour the finished tej into glass bottles. Seal the bottles with corks or snap tops.


You may find it easiest to pour the tej into the bottles using a funnel. A siphon could also be used to transfer the tej from the jug to the bottles.
Note that you will need to remove the airlock cap before you can bottle the beverage.

, The tej is now ready and can be enjoyed immediately. If desired, though, you can store the tej at room temperature for several years before enjoying it.


Aging the tej will mellow the natural sweetness of the drink, creating a richer, more mature flavor.

Chill the mixture.,
Combine the honey water and wine.,
Serve chilled.",How to Make Tej2," Combine the two ingredients in a small saucepan. Place the saucepan on the stove and heat its contents over a low setting.Stir the honey and water together as you heat them. Continue stirring and heating until the honey is completely dissolved and the mixture seems thick and smooth.
This step will usually take between 5 and 10 minutes.

, Pour the honey water in an airtight glass or plastic container. Place the container in your refrigerator and chill the mixture completely.


Depending on how hot the mixture became, chilling it can take anywhere from 30 minutes to 2 hours. It must be completely cool to the touch before you use it.

, Pour the full amount of cold honey water and the full amount of wine into a glass decanter. Mix well to combine.


Use a cocktail spoon or long stirring rod to mix the drink.
Continue mixing until you can no longer distinguish one liquid from the other.
A light, mildly sweet white wine will work best. Consider a Riesling, Soave, or pinot grigio., Lightly chill the drink before pouring it into serving glasses. Enjoy immediately.


You should be able store this shortcut version for several weeks, but you may need to mix it lightly after a few days if the honey begins to settle.

Oil the grill grate.,
Coat the fish with olive oil.,
Sprinkle with salt, pepper, and garlic powder.,
Place the kingklip on the prepared grill.,
Reduce the heat.,
Flip the fish once.,
Cook until done.,
Drizzle with lemon juice.,
Divide and serve.",How to Grill Kingklip1," No matter what type of grill you use, it should be preheated to as hot a temperature as you can preheat it to.


Heating the grill to high heat will allow you to immediately sear the flesh of the kingklip. This makes it harder for the fish to stick to the grate.
If using a gas or electric grill, turn all of the burners on high and let them heat up for several minutes.
If using a charcoal grill, pour a large, even pile of coals into the grill and light them on fire. When the flames die down and no longer flick above the grill grate, the coals should be ready.;
, When cooking kingklip directly on top of the grill, it is vital that you start with a clean grate to prevent the flesh from sticking.


Ideally, the grill grate should be clean before you start cooking.
If the grate is not clean, however, cover the grill for five minutes while the fire is its hottest. Open the grill and use a flame-resistant grill brush to brush away any residue on the top of the grate., Once the flames die down, dip a clean cloth into vegetable oil or olive oil and evenly wipe the oil over the grate.


Use an oven mitt or glove to protect your hands from the heat as you oil the grate. You could also hold the cloth with tongs as you work with it.
Nonstick cooking spray can be applied, as well, but it is recommended that you apply spray products to the grill grate before you light any fire.

, Place the entire kingklip fillet on a sheet of foil or parchment paper. Use your hands to massage the olive oil into the flesh of the fish.


When direct grilling kingklip, you may have more success if you cook a large fillet instead of cooking individually portioned cuts of fillet.
Melted margarine can be used instead of olive oil, if desired.

, Sprinkle both sides of the fillet with these three seasonings.Try to spread the seasonings evenly across the full length of the fish.

, Set the fillet, skin side down, above the hottest part of the flame.Placing the fillet directly over the hottest part of the flame will cause the heat to quickly sear the flesh, thereby locking in the juices and making it more difficult for the flesh to flake.

, After grilling the kingklip for 1 or 2 minutes, turn the burners down to a medium heat setting.


When using a charcoal grill, carefully slide the fish over to an area of the grill receiving less direct heat.
Kingklip, like most types of fish, can quickly overcook when grilled over high heat. For that reason, it is best to do most of the cooking over medium heat.

, Monitor the bottom of the kingklip fillet. Once it starts to look opaque, flip the fillet onto its other side.


This should usually be done after 10 minutes.
Use a wide spatula with a thin, tapered edge for best results.
Note that this is the only time you should flip the fish throughout the entire cooking process.

, Grill the fish for another 10 minutes before removing it from the grill.


To test for doneness, use a fork to flake off a small section in the middle of the fillet. The flesh in the center should be easy to flake away and should appear mostly opaque with just a hint of translucence.
You could use a thermometer to check for doneness, too. Kingklip is ready to pull off the grill once it reaches an internal temperature of 130 to 135 degrees Fahrenheit (54 to 57 degrees Celsius).

, Allow the kingklip to rest for 5 minutes, then drizzle the surface evenly with lemon juice.


The internal temperature of the fish should continue to climb as it rests. Kingklip is ready to enjoy once it is 140 degrees Fahrenheit (60 degrees Celsius).

, Use the edge of a spatula or a kitchen knife to divide the kingklip fillet into four to six even portions.


Once divided, the kingklip is ready to serve and enjoy.

Combine the marinade ingredients.,
Divide the kingklip fillet into serving portions.,
Marinate the fish for a minimum of 30 minutes.,
Preheat the grill.,
Wrap each fillet in foil.,
Place the foil packet on the grill.,
Cook for 10 to 20 minutes.,
Let rest.,
Open the packets and serve.",How to Grill Kingklip2," Combine the garlic, jalapeno, black pepper, olive oil, lemon juice, oregano, basil, and salt in a small dish, whisking well to combine., Divide the fillet into four to six equal portions, depending on how many servings you want the fish to make.


Use a sharp serrated kitchen knife to divide the fillet.
For this method, preserving the delicate flesh is not an issue, so you can cook smaller portions without worrying about the fish falling apart on the grill. Smaller portions will also cook quicker.

, Place the fish in the marinade. Turn to coat all sides, then refrigerate both the fish and marinade for 30 minutes to 2 hours.


Keep the kingklip in either a non-reactive glass dish or a resealable plastic bag as it marinates. Do not use a metal baking dish.

, When the fish is almost done marinating, preheat your grill the a medium-low or medium temperature.


Set the burners on a gas or electric grill to a medium heat.
Light a moderate pile of coals when using a charcoal grill. Wait until ash begins to form on the coals before proceeding.
A medium-low to medium heat setting is ideal when using foil packets. Kingklip and other fish can overcook quickly, but using a moderate heat level can reduce this risk.Since the fish will not come into direct contact with the grill grate, you do not need to worry about scraping the grate clean or coating it with oil.

, Remove the kingklip fillets from the marinade and wrap each fillet separately in separate sheets of aluminum foil.


Discard the remaining marinade.
To wrap each fillet:Spread out a sheet of aluminum foil large enough to wrap around the fish two full times.
Center the fillet over this piece of foil.
Fold the top and bottom edges of the foil toward the center of the fillet.
Bring the left and right edges of the foil together over the fillet. Bend them together, folding them several times, to create a tight seal.



, Set the foil packets over direct heat on your preheated grill.


The seam side of each packet should face upward. At no time during the cooking process should the seam face down into the grate.

, Grill the packets over direct heat until the fish is done. Thin fillets should be done in 10 minutes, but thicker fillets may require up to 20 minutes.


Use tongs to reposition the foil packets as needed while they cook.
You may need to open one of the foil packets to check one of the fillets for doneness before pulling them all off the grill. When done, the center should flake easily with a fork and appear mostly opaque. The internal temperature should also be between 130 and 135 degrees Fahrenheit (54 to 57 degrees Celsius).

, Allow the kingklip packets to rest off the heat for 5 to 10 minutes.


Check the internal temperature again after letting the fish rest. The kingklip should have continued cooking off the heat to a temperature of 140 degrees Fahrenheit (60 degrees Celsius).

, Open each of the packets after allowing the kingklip to rest. Serve immediately.


Be careful as you open each packet. Steam should have built up inside of the packet, and if you aren't careful, it could burn you as it bursts out.

;
, Place the bacon on a hot frying pan or a tinfoil-lined baking pan. Lay several strips on the pan so the grease will pool and stop the bacon from burning. The hotter the bacon is, the thinner the grease will be and the easier it is to remove, but you should still be careful.









, Do this once the bacon in the pan has given the bulk of its grease. Simmer the grease on low to medium heat until it stops steaming. This will remove the water from the fat and allow for a better consistency for the candle. This can take several hours, so be patient. However, it may take less, or you can even use it without this step.









, While this step is optional, doing so will result in a candle that looks and smells cleaner, and leads to a better burn. Once the grease has finished steaming, filter it through a sieve or paper towel.









, To melt the wax, you can either add solid wax to the grease and melt it together while mixing or you could pre-melt the wax in a pan, or add the wax in a jar placed in a pot of water around 100° C or 210°F. Add 1 part wax to 2 parts grease.

",How to Smoke Pork Tenderloin," For the best flavor, you want to season the pork tenderloin prior to smoking it. Depending on your preference, you can use a dry rub or a marinade to help make the pork more flavorful. Prepared rubs or marinades are a good option if you’re in a hurry, but you can also create your own with your favorite spices and ingredients to pair with pork tenderloin.For a tasty dry rub for your pork tenderloin, mix together 1 ¼ cup brown sugar, ⅔ cup sugar, 3 tablespoons black pepper, 2 tablespoons kosher salt, 2 tablespoons ground ginger, 4 ½ teaspoons garlic powder, 4 ½ teaspoons onion salt, 1 tablespoon dry mustard, 1 ½ teaspoons cayenne pepper, 1 ½ teaspoons crushed red pepper, 1 ½ teaspoons ground cumin, 1 ½ teaspoons paprika, and ¾ teaspoon dried thyme.To make a good basic marinade for a pork tenderloin, combine a ½ teaspoon of minced garlic, ¼ cup of cola, ¼ cup of dark brown sugar, ¼ cup of soy sauce, ½ teaspoon of salt, 1 teaspoon of ground pepper, 1 teaspoon minced onion, and 3 tablespoons of olive oil.;
, Before applying the rub or marinade to the tenderloin, you may want to cut it to ensure that the pieces will fit on the grill. If you’re dealing with a tenderloin that’s between 1 ½ and 3 pounds, cutting it in half is usually sufficient. For larger pieces of pork, you may need to cut into additional pieces.Pork tenderloins usually have a silvery-looking membrane known as the silverskin on the top of it. Use a sharp knife to carefully cut off the silverskin before applying the rub or marinade. You can also trim away any fat as desired., Once the pork is properly cut, it’s time to season the meat. You can apply a dry rub with your fingers, making sure to apply a generous amount and cover all sides of the tenderloin. For a marinade, you can use a pastry brush to cover the entire tenderloin with the mixture.Lightly scoring the tenderloin before you apply a dry rub can help the spices better penetrate the pork.
When using a marinade, you can also place it in a plastic zipper bag, add the pork to it, and move the meat around inside to ensure that it is completely covered with the mixture.

, To ensure that the flavors really have time to penetrate the pork, allow the tenderloin to sit with the rub or marinade on it for some time before smoking it. You can wrap the pork in plastic wrap or place it inside a plastic bag and store it in the refrigerator until you’re ready to cook it. With a rub, you can allow it to sit on the meat for 15 minutes to several hours. You may want to let a pork tenderloin in a marinade sit in the refrigerator overnight, but a few hours is usually sufficient.Make sure to keep the seasoned tenderloin refrigerated until it’s time to smoke it.
If you marinade has citrus in it, don’t let it sit on the pork for more than two to three hours.Make sure to throw away any excess marinade that’s still in the bag or dish after you remove the pork. It can contaminate other food if you reuse it.

, For the best smoking results, the wood that you use makes a big difference. Hickory, apple, cherry, and oak are all effective in helping give your pork a delicious smoky taste. You’re also better off using wood chunks instead of chips because chunks are less likely to cause fire flare-ups.If you are using wood chips, soak them in water for at least an hour before putting them on the grill.
Never use sap woods, such as pine for smoking. Not only will they ruin the taste of the pork, they can be toxic.

, To effectively smoke your pork tenderloin, you must use your grill for indirect cooking. For smoking, a charcoal grill works best. Start by removing the grate and opening the grill’s bottom damper. Place coals lit by chimney starter on top of it, making sure that they’re all piled on one side of the grill.If you’re using a gas grill, start the smoking process by preheating it to medium., It’s important to add the wood chunks or chips to the grill when it’s reached a temperature of 250 degrees Fahrenheit (121 degrees Celsius). You can get the grill to the right temperature by gradually adding coals to continue to build up the heat. Once the grill is at the right temperature, place the wood directly on top of the coals.If your grill doesn’t have a temperature gauge, you can test the temperature by holding your hand over the charcoal. If you can do it for three seconds or more, the grill needs additional coals. If it’s too hot to keep your hand over the charcoal for more than two seconds, it’s hot enough
If you’re using a gas grill, put the wood in a smoker pouch or box inside the grill, set it to high until you see smoke, and then reduce the grill heat to medium., Once you’ve added the wood to the grill, you’re ready to smoke your pork. Replace the grill’s grate and set the tenderloin on opposite side from the coals. Make sure to close the lid, and open the damper directly above the meat.If you’re using a gas grill, place the tenderloin on the grate directly above the smoker pouch or box.

, Smoking is a slow cooking process, so you have to be patient with your tenderloin and avoid opening the grill. It usually takes two and a half to three hours to smoke tenderloins that are approximately 1 ½ to 2 pounds. Make sure that the internal temperature of the pork is at least 145 degrees Fahrenheit (63 degrees Celsius) before you remove it from the grill.As a rule of thumb, it takes approximately 1 hour and 30 minutes per pound to smoke a pork tenderloin.
Because you’re cooking with indirect heat, there’s no need to touch or move the meat during the heating process.With a charcoal grill, you will need to open the lid to add fresh lit coals during the smoking process to ensure that the temperature stays at 250 degrees. Use oven mitts to remove the tenderloin and the grate, add more hot charcoal, and then replace the grate and pork so you can close the lid as quickly as possible.
A digital meat thermometer makes it easy to figure out if the pork is fully cooked.

, Once the pork tenderloin is finished smoking and you’ve removed it from the grill, wrap it in foil and allow it rest for approximately five to ten minutes. That will keep the meat juicy and flavorful. After it’s slightly cooled, slice it for serving.If you want to give your tenderloin extra flavor, you can apply barbecue sauce or more of the marinade that you used right after it comes off the grill and it’s still hot. If you’re using a marinade, just be sure that it’s fresh and hasn’t touched the raw pork.

This is the A-Number-One leftover disappearance machine, favored by sandwich aficionados and gourmands everywhere. It's easy, it's individual, and if done correctly, guaranteed to be the messiest sandwich you can wrap your mouth around.


Take two pieces of your favorite bread (bigger is better) and toast them.
Lay a little lettuce on the bottom piece so it won't get soggy too quickly.
Slather some of Aunt Mabel's cranberry sauce on top of that.
Put slices of whatever's left of your favorite turkey parts over the cranberry sauce.
Spread a layer of mashed potatoes on top of that.
If there's any gravy left, you can spread some on the mashed potatoes.
Squish some stuffing into the potatoes.
If you have candied yams, mash some up and spread it on the top piece of bread.
Wear a bib—this is going to be messy!
Variations run the gamut from simple ""toast and turkey with a little mayo"" trifles to the ""something from every single leftover bin in the fridge"" monstrosities that will require another nap afterwards. Some sandwiches can be so big and messy, eating with a knife and fork is required. The key to the best leftover sandwich on the planet is to not follow directions too closely—use your favorite ingredients, and enjoy!;
, Ideally, do this before you put the turkey away after the feast, while it's still a little warm.


Peel off pieces of turkey meat, and toss into a bowl. Use as much or as little of the leftover meat as you like. Dark meat is preferred for pulled turkey barbecue because of its richer flavor and higher fat content.
Add your favorite barbecue sauce, and mix thoroughly.
Spice it up however you like: a little chili pepper, or sriracha sauce can take this to the next level of tasty heat.
When you're ready to use it, toast a bun while you warm up the turkey.
Put a quarter cup or so on the bun, and top with lettuce or Cole slaw.
For an extra tasty sandwich, mash up and spread some of Grandma's spiced baked apples on the bread. Yummy.

, Often overlooked and discarded after the carnage of the feast, Tom Turkey's bones are still packed with rich turkey flavor just begging to be savored. By making a turkey stock, you can add delicious notes of Thanksgiving when you use the stock to cook rice, or braise a chicken, or anything else that can substitute stock for water.


Roast the bones. Peel the bones as clean as you can of any meat, skin, etc. Put the bones on a cookie sheet, and roast at 450 °F (232 °C) until everything is nicely browned.
While the bones are roasting, fill a stock pot with a couple halved onions, some celery bottoms (the part you'd normally throw away), a couple of carrots, a bay leaf or two, a couple teaspoons of thyme and sage, and any of the skin, fat, or meat that you peeled from the turkey. Keep everything in big chunks for easy removal when the stock is done.
Note: if you have a ""real"" roasting pan (not a single-use aluminum one from the grocery store), you can make your stock in that, and take advantage of all the leftover fond (browned bits of meat) from the roasting. Not only will that make for a richer stock, it'll help clean the roasting pan!
Toss the roasted bones into the pot, and cover it all with water, plus a couple inches.
Simmer gently for the day, adding more water as needed. You can also replenish the liquid with a cup of white wine now and then.
When you’re ready to decant the stock, strain out all the veggies and meat and bits of this and that with a fine-mesh strainer. Just toss that stuff—it all tastes like rubbery turkey mush now, and all the goodness has gone into the stock.
Let the stock cool. The fat will rise to the surface, where you can easily skim it off. Don't worry if you can't get it all: when the stock gets cold, the fat will solidify and you can just lift it off the surface.
Use the stock for a more refined soup, and freeze the leftovers. Frozen stock is good for 6 months, which should carry you through the winter!
Hint: use ice cube trays to freeze the stock, then store in a freezer bag—you'll have ready-made turkey flavor, an ice-cube at a time. Put 4 ice cubes into a mug, heat in the microwave, and you have a very satisfying and nourishing broth to sip on during cold winter nights (or winter nights with a cold).

, Here's a way to use your stock, and some leftover stuffing to make a hearty, yummy soup:


Put turkey stock into a pot, and bring to a boil. Use one or two cups of stock for each serving—depending on the serving size.
Add turkey, diced as large or small as you like.
With an ice cream scoop (or with your hands), make balls of stuffing, and lower the balls into the pot of boiling soup.
Lower the heat and simmer for about 10 minutes.
Turn off heat and let rest for 5 to 10 minutes.
Serve.

,


Mix together two cups of leftover turkey with as much stuffing as you like.
Place in a greased casserole dish.
Mix a can of cream of mushroom soup with 1/3 cup white wine (or milk, if you must), and pour on top of the turkey and stuffing.
Decorate with thin slices of turkey and bread crumbs.
Bake, covered, at 400° for 15 minutes.
Broil, uncovered, for 5 minutes or until the top is browned.

, Who doesn't love pie on a cold winter night? Answer: nobody!


Make a double (bottom and top) pie crust.
Bake the empty bottom of the crust for 12 minutes.
Meanwhile, dice and sauté onions, chopped carrots, celery, and potatoes until just tender.
Add some frozen peas and corn, and your leftover gravy and turkey.
You can also add some herbs and spices (salt & pepper, thyme, sage, etc.)
Adjust the consistency as needed make a very heavy, thick mixture. You can even add some leftover stuffing to make it thicker, if you like.
Pour it into the baked pie shell, add a top crust, and bake at 350ºF/180ºC for 30 minutes, or until bubbly.

, While we tend to think of turkey dinners as being evening fare, there's nothing like starting your day with a delicious reminder of the feast. Here are a couple tasty ways to use those leftovers the morning after:

Draw some kitchen twine from the top, or neck end of the turkey, under the back until it meets the wings. Pull the twine up over the outside of the wings, crossing it over the bend in each wing., Pull the ends of the twine toward each other and against the wings so they hug the body of the turkey. Pull the ends of the twine down along the breast of the bird and cross the strings under the rib cage on the inside of the leg joint.Pull the ends of the string tightly until you feel the wings are secure.

, Move both ends of the twine around the feet of the turkey so they are under the legs, but over the tail. Cross the twine under the legs, then move the ends around the back of the turkey at the tail. You may have to lift the bird a little to get underneath it. Cross the ends of the twine again. Pull the ends until they are secure., Cross the ankles of the turkey one over the other. Draw your twine up to the legs. While holding the ankles in place, cross the twine over the ankles. Wrap it around the bottom of the ankles crossing the ends again. Bring the twine back to the top of the ankles and cross them again to create a knot.Tie a knot in the twine and trim the ends if necessary.
This is the most common and traditional way to truss a turkey and will result in a compact shape suitable for the main course centerpiece for your dinner.

",How to Debone a Turkey Breast," If this is your first time deboning a turkey breast, schedule plenty of time to complete the task. Deboning a turkey breast will usually take about 10 minutes, but with practice you will become faster and more efficient., You are going to need a plastic cutting board; a sharp, thin boning knife; and of course a whole turkey breast. Additionally, make sure that your kitchen area is sanitary before you begin., It is crucial to begin with sanitary hands, otherwise you could introduce bacteria into your turkey. Be sure to thoroughly wash your hands with soap and hot water. You will want to wash your hands again when you are finished.

, Run your turkey breast under warm water and use your hands to remove any unwanted grime. Do not use soap on your turkey breast.

, If you would like to prepare your turkey breast without skin, now is a good time to remove it. Using a slicing knife and your fingers, carefully peel back the skin and discard. (This step is optional.)

, Place the turkey breast with the skin-side down on a plastic cutting board. Position the pointed end so it is facing away from you. Be sure that you have plenty of elbow room around your cutting board to work., Make a cut down the center of the breast all the way down to the bone. This may take several cuts. Make each cut deeper than the last until the bone is reached., The keel bone is a dark triangular bone in the center of the breast. This is the first and more important bone to remove. You may want to pick up the breast and bend it backward a bit in order to better expose the keel bone., Using your knife. slice through the cartilage found just above the keel bone. Once again, this may require several runs with your knife, moving deeper each time., Pick up the breast and bend it backwards even more. Try to “pop out” the keel bone a bit by applying pressure with your fingers. Then using your hands and your knife, work to free the entire bone. Pull out the bone, as well as the cartilage.If the keel bone does not pop out easily, slide your fingers underneath it on one side, then the other, working to break up any cartilage.
Once the cartilage is disconnected from the bone, it should come out easily.

, There are two long bones (one on each side) that run the length of the breast. Find the two long bones, and use both hands to bend the bones backwards, loosening them., Use the knife to work your way around the bones and cartilage of the long bones. Work carefully to remove meat and cartilage until the bone is free. Repeat on the opposite side. Save as much meat as possible., The wishbone is a thin, V-shaped bone found right between the neck and the breast. By now, your wishbone should be loose enough to simply wiggle out. If needed, use your knife to free up any meat holding the wishbone in place, and remove it., Remove the white tendon, as well as any loose connective tissue from the turkey breast. If desired, cut the turkey breasts into two halves. Using a sharp knife (your boning knife, or a more standard kitchen knife), slice down the center of the turkey breast longways. This will give you smaller servings to store and prepare., Cover your raw turkey meat with plastic wrap, place it in a plastic bag, or seal it in another air-tight container. Your uncooked turkey will be OK in your refrigerator for 2-3 days. If you do not plan to use it in that time, it is best to place your air-tight container in the freezer, where it will last for several weeks. When you are ready to use it, thaw your turkey in the fridge overnight.

, When you have finished, be sure to thoroughly cleanse your hands, your instruments, and your kitchen area. Whenever you work with raw poultry, be sure to use hot soapy water to disinfect everything.

Collect the ingredients and the tools for marinating.,
Add the ingredients to the container and let it sit for at least one-half hour.,
Cook your meat.",How to Use Tough Meat2," Marination is the process of immersing food (in this case, meat) into a solution to add flavor and to tenderize the meat. All methods of tenderizing through marination use natural acids to break down the collagen fibers. Vinegars, wine, beer, fruit and milk products all contain natural acids that can be used separately or together to tenderize meat.


The only tools needed are a non-metallic container to hold the ingredients and a good knife to cut up things like onion and garlic to be added to the marinade.
The ingredients to use will vary by the type of meat and the desired flavors to be achieved. For beef, good marinades can be made from a base of red wine, any vinegar, beer, or fruits including tomato.  Keep in mind that the flavor from the marinade will become a big part of the flavor profile for your meat. Good choices for a red wine- or beer-based marinade will include the addition of onion, oregano or basil, garlic and, of course, salt and pepper. When starting with a vinegar, good spice profiles also include onion and garlic but could also use herbs de Provence or rosemary. If you like sweetness added to beef, good fruits to use are apple and cherry although using fruits with pork and chicken are usually more successful.

, The longer the meat is left in the marinade, the more flavorful and more tender it becomes. Just for safety's sake, put the meat into the refrigerator if it is to be marinated longer than an hour.

, When the marinade is done or when you have decided that the meat has marinated long enough, either drain off the marinade and discard, cook the meat along with the marinade or use the marinade separately to create a sauce or gravy.


Almost all marinades can be made into a good sauce. Cooking the meat in the marinade adds the meat juices to the sauce. Simply remove the meat after cooking, bring the juices to a boil and thicken with flour or cornstarch. If you use flour to thicken, lightly sprinkle flour into the juices while using a whisk to distribute and to remove any lumps. Dissolve cornstarch into about 1/4 cup of water and add the solution to the juices. Then cook for at least two minutes to cook in the cornstarch.

"
"
Pound the meat.,
Try a meat tenderizing tool.,
Keep in mind that mechanically tenderized meat cooks very fast.",How to Use Tough Meat3," One method of tenderizing meat mechanically is by pounding. You can use a meat hammer but lacking that, a solid glass bottle or a drinking glass can be used as well. Use the end of the hammer with the points or the edge of the bottle or glass to pound the meat. Like slicing thinly, the pounding breaks up the collagen fibers and tenderized the meat.

, Devices can be purchased that involve the use of small blades or knives that can be applied to meat for tenderization. Some are hand held and some use a rolling mechanism to pass the meat through the processor. Once the meat has been tenderized mechanically, it can also be marinated if you like.

, Pan frying or deep frying works well because the meat cooks quickly at a high temperature.

Prepare meat for freezing by trimming, sectioning or prepping the meat for easy of handling after it has been defrosted.,
Combine tenderizing techniques to improve the tenderization process.",How to Use Tough Meat4," Freezing helps to tenderize meat because in the process of freezing, the sharp crystal created from the freezing water contained in the meat severs collagen fibers.

, For example, when freezing, add a marinade to act during the period the meat will be frozen. Include fruits with meats, especially pork that uses fruits such as apples, peaches or plums to create a truly delicious meal.Include citrus with birds such as chicken , pheasant and duck. Try using oranges (remove the rind) with duck and lemon or lime with chicken. Tangerine with pheasant is delightful.

Tuck the wings under the turkey.,
Bring the turkey legs together.,
Tie the twine around the ankles.",How to Truss a Turkey2," With the turkey lying on its back, take the tip of one wing and tuck it under the shoulder of the turkey. Do the same with the other wing. If the neck flap is long enough, pull it tight under the turkey and use the wing tips to hold it in place.Having the wings tucked under the turkey also helps balance and stabilize the turkey in the pan.

, Cross one leg over the other at the ankles. Be sure to cover the cavity at the tail of the bird with the legs. While holding the legs in place, pull some kitchen twine under the ankles, then back over the top., Cross the ends of the twine over each other. Pull the ends to tighten the twine so the legs are secure. Cross the ends of the twine again and pull to secure your knot.This is the simplest way to keep your turkey in a compact shape and keep the skin flaps closed. It is important to secure the skin flaps, which will otherwise shrink back while the turkey is cooking and leave the meat underneath exposed to direct heat, which will result in overcooked, dry meat.
Tie a double knot for more security.
Trim any excess twine using kitchen sheers.

, Grasp the twine on each side a couple of inches from the bird and slide it up under both wings until it is snug in the armpits., Be sure the neck flap is covering the hole at the top of the turkey. Draw the twine together across the neck flap, holding it in place. Cross the strings one on top of the other and pull tightly., Pull both sides along the outside of the turkey breast, staying on the inside of the wings and legs. Cross the strings under the bottom of the rib cage and pull the ends tight., Maneuver the twine under the top portion of the turkey legs, or drumsticks. Wrap the twine around back of the leg, then back over the top at the leg joint. Cross the twine, then pull the ends back under the turkey legs. Pull the ends outward to tighten the twine and elevate the legs.This style of trussing will hold the legs straight out from the body of the turkey. This allows the heat to flow around the legs, cooking them more evenly than traditional trussing. The traditional style presses the legs against the body of the bird, cutting off the source of heat to the inside of the leg.

, Flip the bird on its stomach. Pull the skin flap at the bottom of the bird over the cavity. Wrap the twine around the tail and tie it off in a knot.Trim any excess kitchen twine using kitchen sheers.

For this method, the shape of the container doesn't matter. The water must be no warmer than 40 degrees Fahrenheit (4.44 degrees Celsius) to avoid bacterial growth.Place resealable plastic bags of ice into the container to keep the water temperature cool, if necessary.;
, While still in its packaging, place the turkey breast-side down in the water. The turkey must be completely submerged in the water.If the turkey is not in its original packaging, place the turkey in a sealed, leak-proof plastic bag.

A good idea for the leftovers is to incorporate them into your stuffing recipe. Sauté them in a bit of butter or oil and add sparingly to most stuffing recipes for added flavor.
Many people choose to make broth or stock from the innards of the turkey. Cut them up, along with a diced onion, a couple carrots, as well as a couple stalks of celery, and add to a pot of boiling water. Add a bit of salt, peppercorns, and several bay leaves to the pot and boil for several hours, skimming the foam off the top every so often.;
, Run water inside and outside the turkey to clean it. Pat it dry or let it air dry.

, A brine is a bath of flavored salt water that you soak your bird in for 24 hours before smoking. Brining your turkey will add extra flavor and help it stay moist during the cooking process.Here is a basic brine recipeyou can try for your turkey:


Bring 2 gallons (7.6 L) of water to a boil in a large saucepan. To it, add 4 cups of salt, 4 cups of sugar, one bulb of garlic (cut in half), a cup of black peppercorns, and your choice of fresh herbs (thyme, rosemary, lavender, sage, and marjoram all work well). Turn off heat and allow salt and sugar to dissolve completely. Let steep for 5 minutes.
Add the basic brine to large cooler filled with 3 bags of ice, stirring. To the cooler, add 1 gallon (3.8 L) of apple cider, and four each lemons and oranges, sliced in half. Submerge your turkey in the cooler, making sure it is entirely covered with liquid.
Let your bird soak for at least 24 hours, turning the turkey every 6 to 12 hours. Try to keep the cooler in a cold place; if the temperature of the brine goes above 40 °F (4 °C), add extra ice to keep the solution cool.

, If you chose not to brine your turkey and you purchased a frozen one, you'll want to thaw it completely before smoking. Thawing a turkey in the refrigerator takes longest but is the safest method for completing the task. Place the turkey in a large bowl or pan and let it sit in the refrigerator for 1 day for every 5 pounds of bird.You can also thaw a turkey by covering it in cool water. Submerge the turkey in a sink full of cold water. It will need to stay in its cold water bath for 30 minutes for every pound of bird.

, Rub a generous amount of oil or butter over the entire bird. Sprinkle with salt, pepper and any other desired seasoning. Get creative!


A dry rub is a combination of dry spices that you rub into the skin of the turkey, coating it in flavor. For a basic but classic holiday rub, try a combination of kosher salt, pepper, dried thyme, dried rosemary, dried sage, and garlic powder.A glaze is a thick, usually syrupy mixture, that is brushed onto meat and which reduces once cooked, concentrating its flavors. Consider going with this holiday-themed glaze consisting of cranberry juice, maple syrup, apple cider, and brown sugar.Who says smoking a turkey needs to be fancy? Give basic seasoning a try. Coat the turkey liberally with oil or softened butter and rub salt and pepper over its skin. You're ready to cook.

, Of course, if you have plenty of time on your hands and don't need to speed up the process, you won't need to pre-cook your bird. But if you happen to be in a hurry and want to expedite the cooking, consider pre-cooking the turkey and blasting it with smoke afterwards.


To pre-cook your bird, place it in an oven-safe pan and cover with foil or a lid. Bake for 30 minutes at 350 °F (177 °C).

, Oil the rungs of the rack or line it with foil to keep the bird from sticking..

, Your optimum temperature for smoking a turkey is around 230 °F (110 °C), but anywhere between 220° and 240 °F (116 °C) is acceptable. It will take your smoker about 45 minutes to reach this temperature.

, Once the smoker is lit and pre-heated to be ready for cooking, add your pre-soaked wood chips to the smoker.


If you want, you can get fancy with your soaking liquids. Say, for example, you're using hickory chips to smoke the turkey. Why not reach for bourbon as your soaking liquid? Or say you're smoking with applewood chips. Why not reach for apple cider? Complement the flavor of the chips with a tasty soaking liquid.
Experiment with different wood chips to alter the flavor of the meat. Milder flavors of wood chips include alder, apple, cherry, grape, maple, mulberry, orange, and peach; stronger flavors include hickory, mesquite, oak, pecan, walnut, and whiskey barrel.Some people prefer not smoking their wood chips — or wood chunks — at all.They argue that wood needs to dry out before it produces smoke, prolonging the process. Experiment for yourself whether smoking with soaked or dry wood chips produces better flavor.

, Place the turkey on the cooking rack of the smoker with the breast up. The best part of the rack to place the turkey will depend on where the most direct heat is. You'll want to place the turkey on the side of the rack, away from direct heat. Put the lid back on the smoker.


Consider placing a drip pan underneath the turkey. If you want to save fluids and fat for some smokey gravy, place a drip pan underneath your rack to catch any fluids leaving your turkey.

, Check the smoker every hour or so to maintain the heat and smoke. Add more charcoal, wood chips or water as needed. If your smoker doesn't have a thermometer attached to it, consider placing a metal thermometer inside the cooking rack to gauge the temp when you open it.

, Your turkey will need 30 to 40 minutes per pound to smoke. The time difference is determined by your smoker and the temperature outside.


At 220 °F (104 °C), a 15 lb turkey will take between 8 and 9 hours to smoke.
If you decide to cook at a higher temperature, the cooking time will diminish significantly, but the turkey won't retain as much smoky flavor. At 325 °F (163 °C), a 15 pound turkey will take between 3 and 3.5 hours to smoke., Calculate the minimum time suggested that the turkey might take to smoke completely. When that amount of time has passed, open the lid and quickly get a reading with your meat thermometer in the thickest part of the thigh area of the bird. The turkey is done when the temperature is at 165 °F (74 °C).


If the turkey is not done yet, put the lid back on the smoker and let the bird cook another 30-45 minutes. Check for the desired temperature again.

, After removing the bird from the smoker, let it rest for around 30 minutes before carving. This will help the juices settle in the bird, making for a moister treat when you finally do cut into it.

, Enjoy your smoked turkey on its own, or with a magnificent Thanksgiving fare that includes candied yams, mashed potatoes, green beans, stuffing, and cranberry sauce.

Place your turkey.,
Turn on the water.,
Position the turkey under the water.,
Move the turkey around.,
Repeat as necessary.,
Test the turkey.",How to Thaw a Turkey Fast2," Put the turkey into the sink or tub. This method is often necessary if you don't have a container large enough to contain and submerge the turkey.In this case, you will start by putting the turkey breast up, so the water will run into the breast.

, Make sure that your water is cold! Again, it will need to be under 40 degrees, in order to avoid bacterial growth., Make sure that the water is running over and cascading onto your turkey. You don't want to waste water! Your turkey may develop a small pool of water around it. That is fine. Just make sure that the water can drain as new water runs over the turkey.

, Every five or so minutes, try to turn or rotate the turkey. Lay it on its breast, turn it sideways, or rotate it. Make sure that it stays under the water. You'll want to ensure that the turkey is under a slow, steady stream of water., You'll need to keep doing this until your turkey thaws. There isn't a specific formula as there are for some other methods, so you'll need to use your judgment. The smaller the turkey and the better the water flow, the faster it will thaw. You can poke the thick, meaty parts of the turkey like the breast and thighs to see if they feel thawed., If your turkey felt soft enough, you will still want to test it further.The easiest way to do this is by examining the chest cavity and removing the giblet bag. If the chest cavity still has ice crystals, or if the giblet bag is still frozen in, you need extra time."
"
Fill your container.,
Add salt.,
Insert the turkey.,
Keep the water moving.,
Test the turkey.",How to Thaw a Turkey Fast3," Pour cool water into a clean pot, tub, or container large enough to completely hold and cover your turkey. In this case, you will ideally want the container to be round. The water must be no warmer than 40 degrees Fahrenheit (4.44 degrees Celsius) to avoid bacterial growth.Since you will be stirring, ideally the container will be round or cylindrical.

, Salt helps reduce the freezing temperature of water.The chemistry behind this is why it is used during icy weather. While your turkey isn't a winter highway, it can use some ice too.Add a generous helping of salt to the container. Half a cup of salt per gallon of water is a good place to start.

, Place the turkey, breast side down, in the water. It can remain in its original packaging, but this will be quicker if you remove it so that water can circulate in the chest cavity. Since you won't be changing the water you won't have to worry about bacteria-laced water dripping around.

, You can either stir the water or spin the turkey with a ladle or large wooden spoon. By keeping the turkey in motion, you speed the rate at which it comes in contact with the water and transfers heat.This is why a round container is helpful. You'll need to work much less hard to keep the water circulating.

, The time you need will depend on the size of your turkey as well as your stirring skill. Test the turkey by prodding the breast to see if it is soft. If you think it is done, confirm by examining the chest cavity and removing the giblet bag. If the chest cavity still has ice crystals, or if the giblet bag is still frozen in, you need more time stirring."

This will produce a classic taste for your family to enjoy.In a small bowl, add 1/4 cup of fresh chopped parsley. Then, add one tablespoon each of sage, rosemary, and thyme. Add two tablespoons each of olive oil and melted butter, as well as half a teaspoon of both salt and pepper. The kind of olive oil you use doesn't matter.
Mix all your ingredients together until you have an even, uniform mixture.;
, If you want something a little different, try a lemon seasoning. This will make for a fresh, savory turkey.Mix 1/4 cup of unsalted butter with a teaspoon of lemon zest. Then, add a teaspoon of chopped thyme and a teaspoon of chopped marjoram.
Mix all the ingredients together into a uniform mixture.

, Many people love the taste of garlic. If you and your loved ones are fans of foods heavy in garlic, a garlic-herb rub can make for a great turkey seasoning.Mix three tablespoons of room temperature butter with two tablespoons each of rosemary and thyme.
Mince three garlic cloves and mix them in with the butter/herb mixture.

, If you want something sweeter, think about maple syrup. A maple syrup glaze can provide a somewhat unexpected but pleasant taste for your turkey.You actually apply this mixture after cooking the turkey for two and a half hours. You will mix two tablespoons of the pan juices with 1/4 cup of maple syrup. Then, rub the mixture all over your turkey.
Then, roast your turkey for 15 more minutes to let the flavor set in

Use a meat thermometer.,
Use this method if you have no thermometer.,

Check the color of the meat near the bone.,
Do not rely on the turkey's appearance or smell.",How to Tell if Thanksgiving Turkey Is Done," This is the most reliable method. The minimum internal temperature of the bird (taken in the thigh) should be 165° F; this temperature ensures that it is safe to eat.Meanwhile, the breast should be 170° F and the stuffing 165° F.Note that since a turkey (when cooked as a whole) is large, the meat temperature will continue to rise after taken out of the oven. Thus, if you want the final internal temperature to be 165° F, take it out once it has reached 160° F; its temperature will rise another 5° F outside of the oven. (Let it rest for 20 minutes; this also insures that the juices will not run out when you slice it.);
, Make an incision between the thigh, breast, and leg, then examine the juices that result. If they are run clear, your turkey is ready. If they still have red to them, it needs more time to cook., Using multiple methods will better ensure that your turkey is fully cooked. Make a cut where the bird's thigh meets its body and check the meat near the bone. It shouldn't be pink. If it is, it needs more time to cook., The color of the skin does not indicate whether the meat is cooked, nor does the smell of the bird."

Rub your mixture all over your turkey.,
Add your remaining ingredients inside the turkey.,
Cook your turkey after seasoning according to your recipe.",How to Season a Turkey2," Usually, you apply the seasoning before you cook your turkey. However, remember the maple syrup glaze is applied after the turkey's been in the oven. With other glazes, you'll rub the turkey down in the mixture ahead of time.Use enough of any mixture you choose to cover the full surface of the turkey. Rub it all over the outside of the turkey, covering areas like the legs as well.

, If you have any seasoning left over after applying a liberal layer, do not let it go to waste. Instead of discarding leftover seasoning, rub a little bit of it inside the cavity of the turkey. This will make the turkey's seasoning taste a little stronger., Once you're seasoning applied, cook your turkey according to your recipe's instructions. Instructions will vary, but turkeys are usually cooked around 325 degrees Fahrenheit (about 163 degrees Celsius) and are cooked for at least a couple of hours.You will need an oven thermometer to make sure your turkey is cooked through.

Keep filling the container until the turkey is completely submerged.
Remove the turkey and measure out the water. This is how much seasoning you will need.

, Solid seasoning will not make a poor quality turkey taste good. Before you season a turkey, make sure to pick a quality turkey at the store. Go for a turkey between 12 and 20 pounds without artificial flavors or added preservatives., If you purchase a turkey that requires thawing, read the package instructions. Make sure you thaw the turkey for as long as necessary. Your turkey will not cook correctly if it's improperly thawed, so give yourself enough time to adequately thaw the turkey.,"

You can substitute butter for a richer flavor.;
, Sprinkle boneless or deboned chicken breasts with black pepper and salt.

, Add the chicken breasts to the hot skillet. Cook briefly over medium heat, until just beginning to turn golden on each side.

, Cover the skillet with a tight lid. Reduce heat to low. Set a timer for 10 minutes and leave the chicken to cook., Leave the chicken covered and in the pan for about another ten minutes. This will keep the chicken moist and warm while you make the rest of the dish.


Get started on the pasta as soon as you remove the pan from heat.

, In a separate, large pot, put two quarts (two liters) water over high heat, plus a generous pinch of salt. This is less water than usual for this amount of pasta. This will leave us with an extra starchy water base to start our alfredo sauce.Add more water if you plan on making a more traditional, extra-rich sauce.

, Check the package instructions for recommended cooking time. Boil the pasta for a minute or two less than the label suggests.


Start on the sauce while you wait. Set a timer for the pasta so you don't forget to check it.
If using fresh pasta instead of dried, cook for about 45 seconds instead, or until al dente.
Fettuccine is the original pasta choice for this dish, but you can use any type. The dish is only a few decades old, so your Italian grandmother won't roll in her grave too vigorously., If you want to make the lighter version of this dish, save 2 cups (480 mL) of the pasta water. Drain the pasta and set aside in a large bowl.

, After the chicken has been off the heat for ten minutes, remove the lid. Make sure the chicken is cooked all the way through, with no pink meat visible. Set the chicken aside.

, Peel and chop the garlic. Toss it in the hot skillet. Stir it while cooking for about one minute, or until it releases its aroma. Set it aside.


Heat a little more olive oil or butter first if the pan is dry.

, While Alfredo sauce began as just butter and cheese, the most common version nowadays uses heavy cream. Using one of the two recipes below, bring the mixture to a boil, stirring constantly.



Extra-rich: 2 cups (480 mL) heavy cream, added directly to the skillet.

Light (ish): 1 cup (240 mL) heavy cream, 2 large egg yolks. Heat gradually in a cold pan or temper the egg to avoid scrambling the egg.

, The cheese is the centerpiece of the dish. Grated or shredded Parmigiano Reggiano will make a much more flavorful sauce than powdered parmesan.Also add a generous amount of black pepper. Stir until the cheese is melted and well-mixed.


Optionally, save ⅓ of the cheese to sprinkle on top of the dish just before serving.

, If you went with the light recipe containing eggs, gradually add the 2 cups (480 mL) leftover pasta water. Whisk constantly as you do so. This starchy water will thicken the sauce, making up for the lesser amount of cream. Bring to a boil again and cook for about 45 seconds. Stir constantly to break apart lumps., Add the pasta to the sauce and toss until thoroughly coated. Taste the sauce, adding more black pepper or salt if necessary.

, Cut the chicken into strips and lay them on top of the pasta in the serving dishes. Optionally, sprinkle with more cheese, parsley, and/or black pepper.

Lining the dish with parchment paper or nonstick aluminum foil would be another option.;
, Place the ground turkey, egg, bread crumbs, parsley, onion powder, salt, and pepper into a large bowl. Use your hands to thoroughly mix the ingredients together.


You can customize these meatballs to match your own tastes. Consider using an Italian seasoning blend instead of parsley, or freshly minced onion instead of onion powder.
The meat mixture should hold together when gently pressed.

, Divide the turkey mixture into small portions, rolling each one into 1-inch (2.5-cm) balls. Place the meatballs onto your prepared baking sheet.


Use your hands to roll the turkey mixture into meatballs. Alternatively, you can portion out the turkey mixture using a melon baller or small rounded ice cream scoop.
After placing the meatballs onto the prepared baking dish, gently press down on each one to flatten the very bottom. Only flatten the bottoms enough to prevent the meatballs from rolling around as you handle the dish., Place the dish of meatballs into the preheated oven and cook them until the insides are no longer pink.


The exact amount of time may vary depending on how large the meatballs are. You may also wish to bake them up to 5 minutes longer to help them turn brown and crispy on top.

Brown the meatballs.,
Add the tomato sauce.,
Serve as desired.",How to Make Turkey Meatballs2," Place the ground turkey, egg, bread crumbs, minced onion, minced garlic, parsley, salt, and pepper in a large mixing bowl. Use your hands to thoroughly blend the ingredients together.


Customize these meatballs according to your own tastes. For instance, you could use 1 tsp (5 ml) onion powder and 1/4 tsp (1.25 ml) garlic powder instead of using the freshly minced versions, or opt for Italian-seasoned breadcrumbs instead of using the plain variety.

, Divide the turkey mixture into portions and use your hands to roll each one into 1-inch (2.5-cm) balls. Place the formed meatballs on a plate or tray.Consider using a melon baller or small ice cream scoop to help you form evenly sized, evenly shaped meatballs.
Do not place the formed meatballs directly into your cooking skillet. You should set them aside on another surface. If you don't want to dirty another pan, place the formed meatballs onto a large sheet of aluminum foil.

, Pour the olive oil into a large skillet with deep sides. Set the pan on your stove over medium-high heat.


The skillet should have sides that are at least 3 to 4 inches (7.6 to 10 cm) high.
Skillets that are 12 inches (30.5 cm) in diameter will usually be large enough to accommodate all of the meatballs. If you need to use a smaller skillet, you may need to brown the meatballs in separate batches.
Allow the oil to heat up for at 30 to 60 seconds. Using a hot pan will make it harder for the meatballs to stick later on.

, Place the meatballs in the hot oil. Use tongs to gently rotate them so that they brown evenly on all sides.Make sure that the meatballs do not touch during the browning stage. If the raw meat touches, the meatballs may stick together. Brown the meatballs in batches, if necessary, to prevent this from happening.
The meatballs will need to cook for approximately 3 to 4 minutes on each side. Wait for each side to brown before attempting to turn the meatball since doing so will reduce the amount of sticking that occurs.

, Once the meatballs appear browned on all sides, reduce the heat to medium and pour in the tomato sauce. Cover the pan and simmer the meatballs for another 10 minutes, or until the insides are no longer pink.


Spread the tomato sauce throughout the entire skillet and turn the meatballs over so that all sides come into contact with the sauce. Note that there should be enough sauce to nearly cover the meatballs.

, You can serve the cooked meatballs and sauce directly from the skillet while the dish is still warm. Pair them with pasta, rice, bread, or salad greens.


Alternatively, you can store the meatballs in their sauce by placing them in an airtight container. They should stay good for up to three days when stored in the refrigerator, or up to three months when stored in the freezer.

The turkey, eggs, and bread crumbs should be retained, but you can adjust the seasonings according to taste. For instance, consider using minced onion instead of garlic or parsley instead of oregano and basil.

, Use your hands to separate the turkey mixture and roll each portion into 1-inch or 2-inch (2.5-cm or 5-cm) diameter balls. Place the formed meatballs onto a tray or large sheet of foil.


To make more uniform meatballs, consider portioning out each one using a melon baller, small ice cream scoop, or spoon.

, Evenly spread the slices of onion over the bottom of your slow cooker. Pour half of the crushed tomatoes on top.Consider lining the slow cooker with a special slow cooker liner before adding any ingredients. Doing so isn't strictly necessary but can lead to an easier clean-up later on. Spraying the inside with nonstick cooking spray is another option.

, Pour the olive oil into a large skillet and set the pan on your stove over medium-high heat. Allow the oil to heat and spread for at least 30 to 60 seconds.


You'll need to brown the meatballs before placing them into your slow cooker. Do not skip the browning step. Browning your meatballs will lock in more flavor and more juice, but more importantly, it can help prevent the meatballs from completely falling apart during the slow cooking process.

, Place the meatballs in the hot oil and lightly brown each side for approximately 1 minute. Turn them gently using tongs.


Do not crowd the pan or allow the meatballs to touch while browning them.
Typically, you should move directly into the slow cooking step after this. If you wish to save them for another time, however, you can cover and refrigerate the lightly browned meatballs for up to 1 day, or cover and freeze for up to 2 months.

, Place the browned meatballs in the slow cooker, layering them on top of the tomato-covered onions. Pour the remaining tomatoes on top once all the meatballs are inside.

, Cover the slow cooker and switch it onto its low heat setting. Slow cook the meatballs for 6 to 7 hours, or until no pink remains and the meatballs are tender enough to cut with a fork.


If you're short on time, you can cook the meatballs on high for 3 to 3.5 hours, instead of cooking them on low.

, You can enjoy the finished meatballs directly from the slow cooker. Eat them on their own or consider using them with pasta, sub sandwiches, or any other dish that calls for meatballs.


Place any leftovers into a covered dish and refrigerate them for up to 1 week. You can also cover and freeze them in their sauce for up to 2 months.

Notify your butcher ahead of time, to verify availability and to have them prepared for you.Do not wash the meat, or you’ll risk spreading bacteria.Ask your butcher to spatchcock the birds, unless you want to do it on your own. “Spatchcock” means to split poultry down the middle to flatten it.Examples of game birds you may want to use are duck, quail, partridge, pigeon, and pheasant.
Ideally, the sizes of the birds would be graduated, so that they can fit inside each other. However, you will be slicing them, so if they are not graduated you can set aside excess meat for another purpose.;
, Place it breast side down. Take out the meatless bony portion. Spread the bird open down the middle. Open each bird and then flip it over, pressing down to flatten it.Begin at the tail end. Use sharp kitchen scissors to make a lengthwise cut near the backbone. Turn the bird 180 degrees, then cut lengthwise along the other side of the backbone.

, Bone out the legs of the largest bird. Then cut the breasts of each bird into three parts lengthwise, and slice the legs into strips.To bone out each leg: place the leg and thigh on a work surface. Use the tip of a sharp knife to slowly and carefully slice down to the bone. Loosen the meat by cutting around the bone. Separate the meat from the bone and tendons., Rub rosemary or thyme onto the poultry, along with a bit of lemon or orange zest. Make your favorite stuffing recipe, and set the stuffing aside.


If you don’t have your own preferred stuffing recipe: Combine 10.6 oz (300g) of sausage meat, 3.5 oz (100 grams) of chopped nuts (such as pistachios), 3.5 oz (100 grams) of semi-dried cranberries, and a teaspoon (4g) of crushed juniper berries.You can use two different, complementary stuffing recipes, if desired.

, Place about twenty slices of air-dried ham or bacon in layers on plastic wrap that is 24 inches by 12 inches (60cm x 30cm). The ham should create a rectangle that is smaller than the plastic wrap.Interlace the layers of ham like a basket weave.

, Place the largest bird in the center of the layers of ham. Spread half of your stuffing mixture thinly across it. Add each bird, largest to smallest. Spread the remaining stuffing on top.


Use strips of chicken to cover any exposed ham as you go.

, Hold one side of the plastic wrap to roll all of the meat and stuffing together. Optionally, you can use a strong, clean needle and butcher’s twine to stitch your creation together (the roast only, not the cling wrap). Press the plastic wrap closed securely and refrigerate the roast overnight.Stitch extra carefully if you’re using chicken, since its skin is weaker than duck skin.

, Keep the plastic wrap on and completely sealed. Cook the roast at 167°F (75°C) for two and a half hours. Then take off the plastic wrap.Instead of a water bath, you can remove the plastic wrap and wrap the roast in foil. Roast it at 320°F (160°C) for two hours before transferring it to the roasting tray and resuming cooking.

, Cook the roast in a roasting tray at 356°F (180°C) for one to one and a half hours. The roast is done when you insert a sharp knife and the juices are clear.Use an oven thermometer if needed, to verify the temperature of the oven.

, Take it out of the oven and let it sit for at least twenty minutes. Then transfer it carefully to a serving dish.

, Carve the roast into thick slices with a large fork and chef’s knife. If you used butcher’s twine, make sure that you don’t serve that portion., You can brush it with butter or oil, or baste it in gravy. Season it with salt and black pepper, to taste.


Cornbread stuffing goes well with a five bird roast.

, Some side dishes that compliment a multiple bird roast are potatoes, parsnips, chestnuts, carrots, roasted apple wedges, and braised red cabbage. Complimentary sauces include cranberry sauce and bread sauce.


Any side dish that is commonly served around the holidays should compliment your roast at the dinner table.

, Choose an aromatic white wine such as pinot gris. You can serve a pink wine alone, or a sparkling pink wine mixed with red wine. Try a rosé or a dry cranberry wine.If you’re mixing red wine into another wine, or want to have red wine as option, try Grenache.

Identify both joints.,
Dislocate the joint between the wingette and drumette.Grab the whole wing on both ends.,
Cut through the joint.,
Dislocate the joint between the wingette and tip.,
Cut through the joint.,
Use the separated pieces.",How to Cut Chicken Wings1," A whole chicken wing has two joints connecting three sections. You should be able to visually identify both joints.The wing should bend in two places, and each bend corresponds to one joint.
The rounded end previously connected to the body of the chicken is the wingette (also called a ""flat""). The middle portion between both joints is the drumette, and the pointed end is the tip.
Once you've visually identified both joints, use your fingers to feel for the areas that seem hollow or loose. Those are the connecting points, and those are the points at which you'll cut the wing.;
, Bend it back at the joint between the drumette and the wingette, forcing the joint apart.


You should hold the wingette and drumette in either hand so that the two portions form an upright ""V"" shape. Disregard the wing tip for now.
Pull down on both portions until you hear a slight crack. Continue until the bone connected to the end of the drumette forces its way through the connecting skin.

, Place the chicken wing on your cutting board and position a sharp knife directly between the exposed joint. Press down and through the joint to cleanly separate both pieces.You'll need to use a straight, downward force to cut through the joint, but you may need to use a sawing motion to cut through the connecting skin.
Alternatively, you can cut through the exposed joint using sharp, clean kitchen scissors.

, Hold the connected wingette and tip in your hands. Wiggle or bend back the wing tip until you force the joint apart.


This part of the process is usually easier than the first part since this joint is less firm.
Hold the wingette ready while using your other hand to wiggle the tip. Do this until you can hear or feel the joint pop, then continue bending the joint back until you can reveal two bones. The smaller of the two bones is connected to the wing tip.

, Return the wing to the cutting board and use a sharp knife to cut straight through the wingette and the tip, cleanly separating both pieces.


The two pieces should separate easily with a knife. If desired, however, you can separate these portions using kitchen scissors instead.

, Use the wingette and drumette in recipes calling for chicken wing pieces. Discard the wing tips.


The wing tips have little to no meat, making them unfit for use in normal recipes. If you don't wish to completely discard them, you could save the tips and use them for use in chicken stock later.

Separate the three pieces as usual.,
Saw through the skin of the drumette.,
Push the meat down to one end.,
Secure the meat.,
Repeat with the wingette.Grab the exposed bone at the end of the wingette and push the meat onto the opposite end.",How to Cut Chicken Wings2," Before ""Frenching"" the chicken wings, you'll need to separate each whole wing into its three separate pieces following the standard method.


Discard the wing tip as usual. You can make French cuts using both the drumettes and wingettes.
French cuts separate the meat and skin from a portion of the bone. The meat sits on one end of the wing piece and the exposed bone presents itself as a neat ""handle"" for easy gripping.

, Use a sharp knife to saw through the skin at the thin bottom of the drumette. Work around the entire bottom, stopping once the skin seems completely disconnected there.Firmly pinch the exposed bone between your fingers with one hand while cutting the skin with the other hand.
Use a gently sawing motion to separate the skin. Allow the blade to do the work instead of forcing the knife through with force. The goal is to separate the skin without marring or sawing into the bone itself.

, Use the side of the knife blade to push the meat down from the thin end of the bone and further onto the thick end of the bone.


You might be able to use your hands to do this, but if it feels too slippery or too tough, use the knife.
Press the blade of the knife down so that the sharp edge lightly touches the side of the bone. Push up on the meat, rotating the drumette as needed to scrape up all sides.
Note that you may need to cut through several sinews while doing this.

, Once the meat forms a tight knob at the end of the bone, use your fingers to pull it inside-out.


This isn't strictly necessary, but securing the meat in this manner should prevent it from slipping back down along the length of the bone as it cooks.

, Fold the meat inside-out over that end to secure it, if desired.


Since the wingette is the middle section of the whole wing, you shouldn't need to separate the skin from the bone as you did with the drumette.
Force the meat from the narrow end of the wingette, exposing more of the bone there and creating a fat knob on the thicker end.
You can fold the knob of meat inside-out to help secure it, but doing so may not be necessary.

Add the following spices, sugars, and dry ingredients to the food processor and blend until almost liquid.,
Cover the entire chicken in the jerk sauce and marinate overnight, covered, in the fridge.,
Heat up an outdoor grill to approximately 350F.,
Cook for approximately 1 hour in the oven or on the barbecue until done, Flipping every 7-8 minutes.,
Remove chicken from oven or grill and serve, after it has rested for 5 minutes.",How to Cook Jamaican Jerk Chicken1," You can buy the chicken pre-quartered, or you can do it yourself easily with a sharp knife and some kitchen shears. You'll end up with four pieces -- two thighs and two breasts.To do so:


Pull the thighs away from the breast and cut them away at the joint.
Use the scissors to cut the breastbone off the chicken.
Flip the chicken back over, breast up.
Cut lengthwise through the chicken, splitting the breast in two.Squeeze fresh lime juice on the chicken quarters.;
, These vegetables will go into a food processor later, so don't worry about getting them too fine right now. You just want them to fit and chop easily in the processor.


If you're a fan of garlic, chop up 2-3 cloves as well and throw them in.
Habaneros and Jalapenos will both do as substitutes in a pinch.

, The wet ingredients are easiest to measure out first, stirred together, and then tossed in with food processor with the peppers and onions.


1/3 cup olive oil
1/3 cup distilled white vinegar
1/2 cup orange juice
1/2 cup lime juice
1/2 cup molasses
1/4 cup soy sauce, There should still be some chunks here and there, but you want this marinade to be more or less liquid. This is your jerk sauce!


1 tablespoon ground thyme (or 2-3 springs fresh thyme)
1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon nutmeg + 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon
1 tablespoon allspice (or 7-8 whole allspice)
1-2 Bay leaves
1/4 cup cilantro (optional), Yo should marinate the bird for at least 4 hours, though most chefs swear that it needs to be overnight. The acids and salt in the marinade liquids will tenderize the meat and lend more flavor to the meat., If this is a charcoal grill, it will take about 30-40 minutes to heat up, though a propane grill will be at heat within 10 minutes. If you don't have thermometer on your grill, the right heat is roughly when you can't hold your hand over the grill (6"" away) for more than 3-4 seconds., The chicken should be cooked to 160F degrees all the way through, with a crispy skin crossed with grill marks. Every 2-3 times you flip the bird, baste it with a little bit more jerk marinade., As meat cooks, the juices that keep it tender are released into the meat. If you cut the meat while it is still piping hot, these juices leak out and lead to dry, rough meat. But if you simply wait 5 minutes or so, the juices will reabsorb into the chicken, leading to a much more delicious bird."

Refrigerate the chicken overnight in an oven-safe pan to marinade.,
Heat the oven to 350 and cook the chicken for 1 hour, flipping halfway through.,
Serve hot, with rice and beans and a splash of fresh lime juice.",How to Cook Jamaican Jerk Chicken2," Remove the chicken from the fridge, rinse it off and pat it dry, then get your sharpest knife out. You can buy chicken quarters pre-cut at many stores, but it is cheaper and fresher to quarter the chicken yourself. To do so, start with the chicken breast-side up, then:


Pull the thighs away from the breasts and cut them off at the joint.
Flip the chicken over and, using a pair of kitchen sheers, cut the backbone out of the chicken.
Flip the chicken back over and cut the breast in half lengthwise, slicing through the ribcage., This recipe is rather simple, but the difference between freshly ground allspice and a jar of it from the store is remarkable. If you can't get your hands on whole allspice, substitute a full tablespoon of the spice.

, You can substitute in jalapenos if you need. Don't worry about getting them too fine, as everything will get blended up finely in a food processor later. You're just cutting it up now to make sure everything fits.

, If you'd like to take this rub a little further, you can also toss in the following spices, choosing your favorites:


2-3 cloves chopped garlic
1 teaspoon ground ginger
1 teaspoon cayenne pepper
2 teaspoons dark brown sugar
1/2 teaspoon cinnamon and nutmeg, You want a spreadable, but still not entirely wet, marinade -- a bit like wet, chunky sand. Use the ""pulse"" setting to chop it up to your desired consistency. This is your jerk marinade!

, If you don't have a food processor, you should do things the old fashioned way -- crushing by hand. You'll want to chop the peppers and green onions as finely as possible first, then start crushing it bit by bit, adding more once you have the first handful or so crushed into a nice, chunky paste.

, Lift the skin up slightly and slide your marinade underneath, spreading it across the whole chicken. Make sure you don't pull the skin off of the chicken -- you just want to lift the skin enough to get the marinade underneath.

, If you're running out of marinade, you can just use some salt and pepper, saving the rest for basting or a dipping sauce. Make sure you keep a few tablespoons of marinade to drop on the chicken as it cooks.

, At the very bare minimum, you want to let the chicken marinade for 4 hours, but overnight is the best way to spice the chicken by far. Cover it with plastic wrap and let it sit to absorb the flavors.

, Start the chicken meat sides up, basting the quarters with the leftover jerk marinade and flipping after 30 minutes. You want the internal temperature of the chicken to reach 160F. If you stick a thick through with a skewer, the juice that runs out should be clear.


If you want extra crispy skin, finish the chicken breast-side up on broil for 5-7 minutes.
You can cook this chicken on the grill ass well

, If you have any leftover jerk marinade you can pour it over the cooked chicken or set it aside as a dipping sauce. Once the chicken is done, let it sit for 5 minutes before cutting into it, then serve hot.

Remove 1 to 6 chicken breasts from the freezer.,
Place the chicken breasts on an aluminum foil-lined pan.,
Mix up your favorite spices.,
Sprinkle 1/2 to 1 tbsp.,
Place your pan in the oven.,
Remove the pan after 30 minutes.,
Place the pan back in the oven.,
Check the chicken's internal temperature with a meat thermometer.",How to Cook Frozen Chicken Breasts1," You can also set a roasting rack over a regular pan.


Raising the pan will allow the juices to drip down as the chicken cooks.;
, This will keep the pan clean and help the chicken to cook faster.

, Set a rack in the middle of the oven.


Always make sure you cook the frozen breasts at 350 degrees Fahrenheit and above to kill any bacteria that can grow at lower temperatures.If you do not want dry roasted chicken breasts, you can place the chicken in a non-stick dish. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit (190 degrees Celsius) to account for the fact that you will cover the dish. You will bake it for approximately the same time.

, It is not necessary to rinse the breasts or give them a water bath before cooking them., Arrange them so there is enough space between each breast.

, You will need 1 to 6 tbsp. of spices, depending upon how many chicken breasts you plan to cook.


Use salt and pepper and a little lemon, if you want a simple recipe. You can also buy pre-made spice mixes for chicken.
If you want a more tangy dish, pour barbecue sauce or another wet sauce onto the chicken breasts in your non-stick pan.

, of seasoning on one side of the chicken breasts. Then, flip the chicken breasts over using tongs to season to the other side.


Avoid touching the raw, frozen chicken with your hands. Use a cooking brush to apply any sauce on the chicken and use tongs to move the uncooked chicken around on the pan.

, Set the timer for 30 minutes, or 45 minutes if you aren’t planning to add sauce to the chicken.


Because you are cooking the chicken breasts frozen, you will need to increase the standard cooking time by 50 percent. So chicken breasts that would usually cook for 20 to 30 minutes should cook for 30 to 45 minutes if they are put in frozen.

, Brush extra barbecue sauce or marinade onto the chicken.

, Set your timer for 15 minutes.

, This is a very important step, as cooking time alone is not a reliable way to ensure the chicken is fully cooked.


Once the timer goes off and the chicken has been cooking for 45 minutes, insert the meat thermometer into the center of the breast. Once it reaches 165 degrees Fahrenheit (74 degrees Celsius), you can take it out and serve it.

Check the temperature of the chicken.,
Finished.

",How to Cook Frozen Chicken Breasts2," You can sear and cook frozen chicken on the stovetop whole but dicing or cutting it into strips will allow for quicker cooking time.


You can use the microwave to thaw the chicken a bit to make it easier to cut it up, but always use microwaved chicken right away.

, You can apply a seasoning mix, a sauce, or a salt-and-pepper rub before freezing the chicken or while it is thawing as it cooks.


You can also cook the chicken in a broth to add more flavor and prevent the meat from drying out.
Keep in mind seasoning put directly on frozen chicken will not absorb into the meat.

, Use olive oil, vegetable oil, or butter.Turn the pan to medium high heat and let the oil warm up or the butter melt.
Add in any broth, like chicken or veggie broth, if you are using it.

, Keep the temperature at medium heat. Cover the pot so the breasts can cook.

, Try not to lift the lid and peek at the chicken as this allows heat to escape.


Like baking the frozen chicken, cooking the chicken will still take 50 percent longer to cook than if it were thawed.
After 2-4 minutes of cooking, add in any spices or seasonings to the chicken.

, Use kitchen tongs to do this.

, Set a timer for 15 minutes and let the chicken simmer. Again, avoid lifting the lid to peek at the chicken.

, Once the chicken has cooked for 15 minutes, you need to let it sit.

, Take the lid off and check if the chicken is done by using a meat thermometer. The chicken should be at least 165 degrees Fahrenheit.


Make sure there is no pink in the middle of the chicken breasts.

Get a knife, press and chop the garlic and chili, cut the onion and chop the chicken thighs into small pieces.,
Fry your spices in oil:

,
Put three tablespoons of olive oil in a high heated large saucepan and add the spice mixture as soon as the oil is hot.

,
Stir it until the spices become brown and roasted - usually it takes a minute.

,
As soon as the spice mixture got browned, put the onions, a teaspoon salt, pepper and ginger into it.

,
When the onion becomes darker add the garlic and cook it for one minute, but don't forget to take care of the garlic because if it burns it becomes bitter.

,
Now you should see a dark sauce with your ingredients.

,
Put the salted chicken into the saucepan and roast it and put enough oil into the pot if it's not enough.

,
When the chicken gets brown start carefully adding the wine.

,
Of course, the wine has an aroma, but you'll also notice all the brown bits on the bottom of the saucepan.

Serve immediately.",How to Cook Chicken Wings," You can use a bottle of your favorite commercial wing sauce, or you can make a homemade wing sauce.


Note the wing sauce recipes provided.;
,


Melt the butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat.
Carefully add the tomato sauce, hot sauce, garlic powder, and onion powder. Stir well to mix. More hot sauce, garlic powder, and onion powder can be added if desired.
Simmer uncovered, on low heat, for two hours. Stir occasionally.

,


Combine all sauce ingredients in a medium saucepan. Stir well to mix.
Heat the sauce over medium-high heat until it boils. Reduce the heat to low or medium-low so that the sauce continues cooking at a low simmer.

,


Whisk all of the glaze ingredients together in a medium bowl.
Refrigerate until ready to use.

,


Whisk together all of the sauce ingredients in a small to medium bowl until well combined.
Refrigerate until ready to use.

, Use kitchen scissors or a sharp kitchen knife to cut off the tip of each chicken wing.Place each chicken wing on a cutting board and hold it steady with your non-dominant hand.
Use your dominant hand to cut between the joint at the top end of the tip.
Discard the wing tip.

, Cut the remaining part of the wing into two pieces by cutting between the joint with a sharp kitchen knife or kitchen scissors.


Spread the remaining portions open so that you can clearly see the joint.
Carefully cut each wing at this joint.

, If baking, broiling, or grilling the wings, marinate them in 1/2 cup (125 mL) of your chosen sauce for at least 30 minutes.


Do not use your entire batch of sauce since you may want to use some later for basting or dipping.
It is not necessary to marinate the chicken wings if you plan on slow-cooking them.
To marinate, place the wings inside a resealable plastic bag and set the bag inside a shallow dish. Pour the marinating sauce into the bag and seal. Turn the bag several times to coat the wings, and set the bag inside the refrigerator as it marinates.

, Prepare a baking sheet by lining it with aluminum foil.


You could also spray the pan down with nonstick cooking spray. Aluminum foil is less messy, but the cooking spray will still prevent the chicken wings from sticking to the baking sheet.
Choose a baking sheet or dish with shallow sides.

, Allow the excess marinade to drip off before lining the wings up.


Hold each wing above the bag of marinade for 30 seconds, or until you no longer notice any marinade dripping off.
Arrange the wings on your baking sheet in a single layer. Do not stack or pile the wings.
Discard the excess marinade.

, After the first 30 minutes pass, baste the wings using another 1/4 cup (60 mL) of the same sauce before returning them to the oven.The oven must be completely preheated before you can begin cooking the wings.

, Baste the wings every 10 minutes until done, using up to another 1/4 cup (60 mL) of sauce.


When done, the chicken should no longer be pink in the center.

, Transfer the wings to your serving dish shortly after removing them from the oven.

, Allow the broiler to preheat for 5 to 10 minutes so that it has enough time to come up to temperature.


Most broilers only have ""On"" and ""Off"" settings. If your broiler has ""Low"" and ""High"" settings, however, preheat it to the ""High"" setting.

, Transfer the wings to an unheated broiler pan.


A broiler pan is specially designed so that fat drips off meat as it cooks, so it is important that you use a broiler pan and not a regular baking sheet. Do not line the pan with aluminum foil or cooking spray, as doing so may pose a fire hazard.
Allow the excess marinade to drip off the wings before placing them on the broiling pan. Discard the marinade.
Arrange the wings in a single layer. Do not stack or pile them on top of one another.

, Cook the wings in your preheated broiler, turning once halfway through the cooking time to promote even browning and even cooking.


As the wings cook, they should be 4 to 5 inches (10 to 13 cm) away from the heating element.
Use tongs to turn the wings.
Turn the wings after they become light brown on one side.

, After removing the wings from the broiler, you can toss or baste them with an addition 1/4 to 1/2 cup (60 to 125 mL) of your chosen sauce. Serve hot.

, Rub the grill grate with a little cooking oil to prevent the wings from burning as they cook.


If using a gas grill, preheat the burners to medium-high.
If using a charcoal grill, prepare a medium-hot charcoal fire. Coat the bottom of the grill in a single layer of coals, but pile more coals toward the center.

, Drain the excess marinade from the wings and pat dry.


Allow most of the excess marinade to drip off each wing. The remaining moisture should be dried off with clean paper towels.
The wings should be quite dry when you add them to the grill. Chicken wings are known to cause flare-ups, even without a wet marinade, so you need to minimize the dripping by wiping away as much of the marinade from the surface as possible.

, Arrange the wings in a single layer on the grill.


Do not pile or stack the wings, since doing so will prevent even cooking.
Do not cover the grill.

, Cook the wings until they are brown and crisp on the outside and no longer pink on the inside. Flip the wings every few minutes to promote even charring and even cooking.If the fire flares up or if the wings begin to burn, transfer the chicken wings to a cooler part of the grill.

, Transfer the wings to a large bowl and toss them in another 1/2 cup (125 mL) or more of your chosen sauce.


You can also coat the wings with your sauce by basting them.
Serve immediately after coating the wings.

, Let your broiler preheat for 5 to 10 minutes. Meanwhile, arrange un-marinated chicken wings on a broiler pan in a single layer.


Note that the chicken wings do not need to be marinated for this recipe, but you should still separate them into parts.
The broiling steps can be skipped, if desired, but doing so will prevent the wings from developing their trademark crunchy skin.
Most broilers only have ""on"" and ""off"" settings. If your broiler has a ""high"" and ""low"" setting, use the low setting. You only need the broiler to brown the wings, not to cook them fully.
Do not line the broiler pan with aluminum foil or cooking spray.

, Place the wings in your preheated broiler and cook for a total of 20 minutes, flipping them over with tongs at the halfway mark or once you notice browning on the top side.


Broil the chicken wings roughly 4 inches (10 cm) away from the heating element.

, As soon as the chicken wings finish browning, arrange them in a slow cooker.


You will need to stack the wings in order to make them fit. This does not pose an obstacle to even cooking when using a slow cooker, however.
If desired, you can line the slow cooker with cooking spray or with a specially-designed slow cooker liner to minimize sticking and make cleaning up easier.

, Pour two cups of your preferred sauce over the chicken wings in the slow cooker.


If desired, you can give the wings a quick stir in order to coat them with the sauce. This is not often necessary, though, since the sauce will usually find its way from the top to the bottom of the slow cooker, coating each wing as it passes through.

,


You could also cook the wings on High for 2 to 2.5 hours.

, Transfer the wings to individual serving platters directly from the slow cooker.


Keep the slow cooker set to Low as you dish out the wings. If your slow cooker as a ""Warm"" setting, you could also use that.

, Making chicken tenders requires you to dunk the chicken in three separate baths, which together create the rich, delicious, and crispy coating on the outside of the chicken. Set them up now, with a little extra of each nearby if you run out while working.


The eggs should be whipped with a fork, as if you were about to scramble them.
Keep the flour and breadcrumbs nearby in case you need to refill the bowls while coating the chicken.

, You can use whatever spices you want, but generally a teaspoon of salt, some pepper is essential. From there, toss in paprika, cumin, cayenne, thyme, or whatever other spices you desire. There are few wrong answers.


You can season the fingers in a variety of ways, but they will be delicious even if you only use salt and pepper.

, You want a nice, light dusting of flour here, not large chunks or clumps.

, Again, the chicken doesn't want to be sopping wet, just evenly coated. When adding to the egg, a pair of kitchen tongs will go a long way towards keeping your hands and workstation relatively clean.

, This is your crunch, and the egg and flour together should form a sort of glue to hold everything together. When done, set the thrice-coated chicken on a plate and move on to the next strip. When choosing breadcrumbs, you have a lot of options:



Traditional Breadcrumbs are small, and lead to a lightly breaded flavor.

Panko Breadcrumbs are large and crispy, and lead to a very crunchy final finger

Flavored Breadcrumbs are a great way to simple and easily add some spice to your dish., The way you cook the chicken depends on your taste and nutritional needs. Once you have the coating on, it doesn't matter much how you choose to cook the tenders, as they are thin pieces that cook quickly and evenly without much maintenance.

"
"
Soak your chicken tenders in a dish of buttermilk for at least 2-3 hours.,
In a shallow dish, mix 1 cup of flour with salt, pepper, and 2 tablespoons of buttermilk.,
Remove the chicken strips from the buttermilk and dredge in flour.,
Cook the chicken by either pan-frying, deep-frying, or baking, depending on your preferences.",How to Cook Chicken Tenders2," Buttermilk will tenderize the chicken, and adds some much-needed fat to the lean mean, keeping the final tenders moist and delicious. You can use straight buttermilk, or create a spiced buttermilk marinade for additional flavor. To do so, simply add a half teaspoon of the following spices to your buttermilk, stir well, and use this to coat the chicken:


Paprika
Cayenne
Dried green onions
Black pepper
Cracked red pepper
Garlic powder
1 tablespoon salt, Stir with a fork until the flour clumps up lightly, almost like wet sand. The touch of salt and pepper can be augmented by an additional teaspoon of the spices mentioned above as well, though this is up to personal spice preference.If you're out of buttermilk you can use a little regular milk, or even water, to clump up the flour. These clumps create the delicious crispy coating for your tenders.

, Let some of the excess liquid drain off first. Then liberally coat each piece of buttermilk chicken in your flour mixture. Each strip should have an even coating of flour, with several big clumps attached as well.It can help to use a fork or tongs to prevent messes while working with wet chicken.

, Traditionally, buttermilk chicken is deep fried, giving it the rich (though not necessarily healthy) flavor and texture than makes southern-fried chicken so popular. But you can cook this recipe on a stovetop or in the oven without losing much, and you may even find you prefer these lighter, less oily versions."

Deep-fry your tenders at 375F/190C for restaurant quality chicken.,
Bake your chicken tenders for a healthy option that doesn't sacrifice flavor.",How to Cook Chicken Tenders3," Simple and easy, all you need is a heavy bottom skillet, pot, or pan. Fill it with roughly 1/2 inch vegetable oil and heat over medium-high until shimmering, like a pond disturbed by a light breeze. Then, add the chicken fingers, cooking on each side for 1-2 minutes before flipping.Once both sides are golden brown, place the chicken on a paper towel-lined plate to drain and cool.


Be careful of spitting oil when cooking, especially when adding cold chicken to a hot pan.
Don't crowd the pan, as this lowers the oil temperature rapidly and leads to soggy chicken. Each piece should have some room to move.
If the oil starts darkening or smoking, pour it out safely and heat up more oil. Dirty oil won't do your meal any favors., Fill the fryer with your favorite high-heat oil (vegetable, canola, and peanut are all common) and set it to 375F. Once it is ready, toss in the chicken strips, taking care not to overcrowd the pot. They should have room to move around freely, allowing all sides of the chicken to cook. Fry for 6-8 minutes or until golden brown, and cool them on a paper-towel lined plate or wire rack before serving., Baking requires the least oil, keeping the chicken much lighter than frying would. Before you start coating, pre-heat the oven to 425F and line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Bake the coated chicken for 15-20 minutes, making sure you flip the tenders at the halfway mark. When golden brown, check that the inside of one of the thickest tenders is cooked all the way through, not pink, and then cool and serve."

There is no need to rub in or add butter or oil to the chicken thighs., The chicken thighs will touch during the cooking process. Do not flip them over. This will take off some of the seasoning. It is important that the seasonings stay on the top of the chicken thighs while cooking to create a slight crispy top., Cook on low for 6 hours. The chicken thighs will be cooked through and will pierce easily with a fork. The top of the chicken thighs that were not in the chicken broth will be a little crispy."

You could use a non-resealable bowl, but using a resealable plastic container allows you to save some of the rub for later if you decide not to use the entire batch now.
Note that this recipe produces about 2 cups (500 ml) dry rub.
This dry rub is also fairly spicy. While much of the heat will fade once you dust the dry rub off the chicken, a good portion of it will still remain. If you prefer a milder taste, you can reduce the amount of cayenne pepper, chili powder, and paprika.
You could also skip the dry rub completely and simply use salt and pepper to season the chicken.;
, Transfer the cut-up chicken to a non-reactive container, like one made of glass or plastic.


A resealable plastic bag also works well and may actually make it easier to spread the spice around.

, Dust the chicken with a generous amount of the dry rub. Once you are satisfied with the amount of dry rub on the chicken, use clean hands to gently pat it down.


If you use a plastic bag, you can place dry rub in the bag, seal it, and turn it over several times to coat the chicken.
You do not necessarily need to use all of the dry rub at once, but you may do so if you prefer a stronger flavor. Otherwise, start with 1/4 to 1/2 of the mixture and add more only if needed.
Do not contaminate the unused dry rub with any that has come into contact with the chicken.

, Loosely cover the seasoned chicken and place it in the refrigerator. Let sit a few hours to overnight.


You could technically use the chicken right away, but allowing it to sit will help the chicken absorb more of the flavor from the dry rub.

, Melt the butter in a large saucepan over low heat. Slowly add the onion, garlic, and salt, cooking just until the onion becomes tender.


Use a saucepan made of a nonreactive material.
The garlic and onion must be sauteed gently. Do not allow them to brown at this stage.

, Stir the ingredients in and cook for a full minute.


You need to give the spices enough time to cook before adding the next set of ingredients. If not, the spices will not build up enough aroma or flavor.

, After thoroughly mixing these ingredients into the seasoned onions and garlic, let the mixture reach a simmer.

, Stir the molasses into the sauce. As soon as the molasses is incorporated, whisk in the tomato paste.


To make whisking the tomato paste easier, scoop it up from the can or measuring cup using your whisk and transfer it into the saucepan directly. Instead of trying to remove the paste off the whisk by ""tapping"" the utensil on the side of the pan, simply whisk the barbecue sauce with the clump of tomato paste still attached to the whisk. As you continue whisking, the paste will dissolve into the sauce.
Continue whisking until smooth. Let the sauce reach a simmer once more, still over low heat.

, Let the sauce simmer on low heat until it becomes thick and smooth.


Leave the saucepan uncovered.
Stir the sauce occasionally as it simmers.

, Transfer 1 1/2 cups (375 ml) of the sauce to a bowl to use while preparing the chicken. Place the rest of the sauce in a resealable container and store in the refrigerator.


You cannot serve cooked chicken with sauce used to prepare raw chicken, so the stored sauce is the portion that you will serve alongside the chicken once you finish cooking it.

, Simultaneously heat 1/4-inch (2/3-cm) cooking oil in a 12-inch (30-cm) skillet.

, Remove the chicken from the dry rub, shaking off any excess rub still clinging to the skin. Place the chicken skin-side down in the preheated skillet and cook until well-browned on both sides.


Turn the chicken once during the searing process.
Each piece of chicken will need to be seared for roughly 5 minutes.
Cook the chicken in batches. Do not crowd the skillet.

, Place the chicken skin-side up into the two dishes, separating the breast portions (white meat) from the leg portions (dark meat). Add 2 Tbsp (30 ml) water to each dish.


Use 2-quart to 3-quart (2-liter to 3-liter) baking pans made from glass or another nonreactive material.
The dark meat and white meat need to cook for different amounts of time, which is why the pieces should be separated into different dishes.

, Make sure that the sauce is spread evenly. Loosely cover each dish with parchment paper and follow by tightly covering each dish with aluminum foil.

, The leg portions will need to be cooked for 70 to 75 minutes, while the breast portions will only need 30 to 40 minutes.


Refrigerate the breast portions until ready to bake.

, Uncover the dish and spoon more sauce over the chicken to prevent it from drying out. Continue baking for another 10 to 15 minutes.


At this point, you can use your refrigerated serving sauce on the chicken since the meat should already be done and safe to consume.
Continue cooking until the meat is well-glazed and tender.

, The chicken should also be served alongside any remaining barbecue sauce.

, You can grill the chicken using a charcoal grill or a gas grill. The choice is ultimately yours, but either way, half the grill should be heated to a medium-hot temperature while the other half should be cooler.


A gas grill burns cleaner, but a charcoal grill will produce a smokier flavor.To preheat a gas grill, switch on the burners of one side of the grill only. If the burners have temperature control settings, choose a medium-high setting.
To preheat a charcoal grill, pile all of the charcoal on one side of the grill. Light the coals and allow them to burn down until a fine layer of white ash forms on top and the flames have burned away.

, Use tongs to transfer the chicken to the unlit side of the grill, placing the pieces skin-side down.


You can shake off some of the excess rub, but for this method, you still want a considerable amount of the rub to remain in order to produce a stronger flavor.

, Cover the grill and cook the chicken until it turns golden-brown.


Covering the grill allows more heat to build up, cooking the chicken quicker and more thoroughly.
You will need to move the pieces around halfway through the cooking process. The pieces closer to the coals or active burners will need to be swapped with the pieces furthest from the heat.
Use a meat thermometer to check the temperature of the chicken at the end of this stage. It should read about 150 degrees Fahrenheit (65 degrees Celsius).

, Transfer the chicken to the hotter side of the grill and brush your reserved sauce over the pieces.


Turn the chicken as often as necessary to make sure that it is completely coated with sauce.

, Once done, the sauce should appear caramelized and the skin should be crispy on all sides.


Turn the pieces and glaze with more sauce as needed to make sure that the chicken cooks evenly. This part of the process will require your full attention, and you will need to leave the grill uncovered.
This part of the cooking process can take another 10 to 20 minutes.

, Remove the chicken from the grill and let it rest for 5 minutes before serving it with the refrigerated portion of your barbecue sauce.

, Sweeten your favorite barbecue sauce with a little honey before using it as a glaze for your chicken.

, An elegant yet simple barbecue sauce for chicken can be created with a bottle of tomato-based Russian dressing, an envelope of dry onion soup mix, and a jar of apricot preserves.

, A beer-honey barbecue sauce can be spread over chicken to give it a more complex flavor.

, The addition of liquid smoke, when combined with a sauce made of ketchup, brown sugar, allspice, nutmeg, and garlic, gives drumsticks or whole chickens a rich, smoky flavor, even when it is not cooked on the grill.

, When made this way, chicken is cooked in a sauce made with soy sauce, ginger, garlic, brown sugar, achuete powder, onion, and lemonsito juice.

, Like most barbecue sauces, the sauce for this chicken is made with a ketchup base and a bit of brown sugar. The flavors of soy sauce and garlic are mixed in to create an interesting contrast, however.

, You can always substitute the barbecue sauce described in this recipe with your favorite homemade or commercial sauce. If you want to try something new, you could also consider a few of the following.



Make a simpler sauce. A very basic, mild, yet flavorful barbecue sauce can be made with nothing more than ketchup, cider vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, onion, garlic, brown sugar, and paprika.

Prepare a sweet and spicy sauce. A tomato base is livened up with the addition of chili powder, smoked paprika, and cayenne pepper, but the addition of brown sugar and sweet Hungarian paprika give this spicy sauce a hint of sweetness, too.

Make a mustard-based barbecue sauce. Most BBQ sauces contain ketchup, but this version combines yellow mustard with other traditional barbecue sauce ingredients to form something a little more unique.

Rinsing the chicken removes slime and ice crystals from the surface.;
, Place your non-dominant hand flat on top of one chicken breast. Hold a sharp knife with a smooth blade in your dominant hand, keeping the blade parallel to the cutting board.









To make the chicken easier to slice, start out with chicken that is mostly thawed but still partially frozen in the center. Fully thawed chicken can also be used, but it might be more difficult to slice.

,









The cutlets should each be about 1/4-in (6.35-mm) thick.
Not every slice needs to run the entire length of the chicken breast, but each slice should have the same thickness.
Repeat this procedure for all four chicken breasts.

, You can create larger cutlets that are just as thin by pounding the meat with a tenderizing mallet or rolling pin.









Place each chicken breast on top of a layer of wax paper spread out on the counter. Make sure that each piece is 2 in (5 cm) apart from the others.Cover the chicken with another sheet of wax paper.
Use a rolling pin or the flat end of a heavy meat tenderizer to pound the chicken in even strokes. Work from the center out.
Continue pounding the chicken until each cutlet is about 1/3-in (8.5-mm) thick.

, Use a fork to stir together these 5 ingredients in a medium bowl.









For best results, use a bowl with shallow sides. Doing so will make it easier for you to dip the chicken cutlets into the mixture later.
For a simplified version, you could use 1 cup (250 ml) of seasoned bread crumbs instead of the unseasoned bread crumbs, Parmesan, and parsley.
If using dried parsley instead of fresh, use 2 tsp (10 ml) instead of the full 1/4 cup (60 ml)., In a separate bowl, use a fork or whisk to beat together the egg and milk.









Beat the egg separately before you add the milk in order to make mixing the two easier to accomplish.
Use a shallow bowl or pie plate.

, Pour the flour onto a wide plate with a short lip.









Lightly shake the plate from side to side to create an even layer of flour.

, Coat each cutlet in flour, then the egg mixture, and then the crumb mixture.









Arrange your dishes in assembly-line fashion so that it is easier to transfer each cutlet from one dish to the next.
You can use your fingers to move the cutlets from dish to dish, but use a fork if you want to avoid making your hands messy.
After dredging both sides of the cutlet in flour, gently tap the cutlet against the side of the plate to knock off excess.
Dunk the cutlets in the egg mixture, making sure that both sides are well coated. Hold the cutlet above the bowl so that excess egg can drip off.
Coat both sides of the cutlet with the bread crumb mixture. Place the cutlet in the dish of crumbs so that the bottom gets coated. To coat the top, scoop additional mix over the cutlets and press it into the surface of the chicken.

,









You could also line the baking sheet with parchment paper or aluminum foil instead of greasing it.

, Place the breaded cutlets on the baking sheet in a single layer.









If you are unable to fit all the cutlets on a single baking sheet, use multiple baking sheets. Do not arrange the chicken in multiple layers.
Do not cover the baking sheet.

, Put the chicken in the oven and cook until firm to the touch.









The total baking time will vary depending on how thick it is and how thawed it is beforehand.
To check for doneness, cut into the middle of the thickest cutlet with a thin-bladed knife. The chicken is done if there is no pink inside.

, Transfer the chicken cutlets onto serving plates.









If desired, serve with a wedge of lemon on the side.

, Pour enough cooking oil into the skillet to coat the bottom and heat it over medium-high heat.









Use olive oil or vegetable oil.
Heat the oil for 2 to 3 minutes. Check the temperature of the oil by carefully sprinkling a few drops of water into the pan. If the water sizzles immediately upon contact, the oil is hot enough.

, Cook the chicken for 2 1








Flip the chicken in the middle of the cooking process so that both sides get browned.
Test the chicken for doneness by making a small cut with a thin-bladed knife in the center of the thickest cutlet. The chicken is done when no pink remains.
Do not overcrowd the pan. If you cannot fit all the cutlets into a single pan, cook them in batches, adding more oil to the pan as needed.

, Transfer the cooked cutlets to serving plates.









Serve with your choice of sauce, such as a honey mustard sauce or sweet and sour sauce.

Know what makes up a good marinade.,
Choose an acid or enzyme to help tenderize the meat.How much acid/enzyme you use will depend on how much chicken you are making.,
Choose a fat to keep the meat moist and juicy.If you are making 1 pound (455 grams) of chicken, you will need 3 ounces (90 milliliters) of fat.,
Choose your seasonings.,
Combine your acid, fat, and seasonings.,
Place some chicken breasts or thighs in a non-reactive container.,
Pour the marinade over the chicken.,
Cover the chicken, or zip the bag shut, and leave it in the fridge for 3 to 12 hours.,
Cook the chicken however you'd like.,
Let the chicken rest for 10 minutes, then serve it.",How to Make Chicken Marinade1," You can marinate chicken in just about anything, including bottled vinaigrette, but nothing beats a good, homemade marinade. You can use all sorts of ingredients in a marinade, but the trick is getting the proportions right. Of course, some recipes will use different proportions, but in general, you'd want to use the following amounts:1 part acid or enzyme
3 parts fat or oil
Your choice of seasonings;
, You will need about 1 ounce (30 milliliters) of an acid or enzyme per 1 pound (455 grams) of chicken. Here are some ideas for acids or enzymes:Acid: buttermilk, lemon juice, vinegars, or wine/beer
Enzyme: honey, milk, pineapple juice, or yogurt (including Greek)

, If you are making more chicken, plan on using three times as much fat as your acid/enzyme. Here are some types of fats that you can use:Oils, such as: almond oil, chili oil, olive oil, or sesame oil
Dairy-based products, such as buttermilk or mayonnaise

, While you could only choose one type of acid/enzyme and one type of fat, you can choose several different items for your seasonings. You will typically need 1 tablespoon per pound (455 grams) of chicken. Here are some ideas to get you started:Fresh herbs or dried herbs
Spices or hot pepper flakes
Garlic
Onions, shallots, or green onions
Fresh grated ginger or citrus zest
Maple syrup

, You can do this in a bowl with a whisk, but a blender or food processor would be better because they will help the fats and acids bind together easier.Salt makes a great seasoning, but don't add it to your marinade. Instead, add it to the chicken just before cooking it.

, You can use a glass, ceramic, or stainless steel baking dish. You can also use large, re-sealable, plastic bags. Do not use containers made out of aluminum. Aluminum tends to react with most acids; this can change the color and flavor of your chicken.You can marinate other cuts of chicken too, but boneless, skinless chicken breasts are the most popular, followed by thighs.

, You will need about ½ cup (120 milliliters) of marinade for 1 pound (455 grams) of chicken. After you have covered the chicken breasts/thighs with marinade, flip the chicken over a few times. This will help the marinade coat it more evenly. If you are using a plastic, re-sealable bag, zip the bag shut, and shake it; you can also gently ""massage"" the chicken in the marinade instead.


If you have any leftover marinade, set it aside so that you can baste the chicken with it after you are done cooking.

, The chicken must be kept in the fridge while it is marinating, or the meat could develop bacteria, and become unsafe to eat. Keep in mind that the longer you marinate the chicken, the quicker it will cook; your chicken may be done sooner than what the recipe you are using states.Boneless chicken breasts only need 2 hours.If you are using a plastic, re-sealable bag, consider placing the chicken in a baking dish. This way, if any of the marinade leaks out, your fridge won't get dirty.

, It is ready when the internal temperature reaches 165°F (74°C). If you have any leftover marinade after you set the chicken on the grill or skillet, discard it. Listed below are some ways in which you can cook boneless, skinless chicken breasts:You can bake chicken in the oven at 350°F (180°C) for 35 to 45 minutes.
You can grill the chicken over medium heat, covered, for 9 to 12 minutes per side.
You can fry the chicken in a skillet over medium-high heat for 8 to 11 minutes per side.

, Keep the chicken covered with a sheet of aluminum foil while it is resting so that it doesn't dry out. If you reserved any fresh marinade in the beginning, you can pour it over the chicken before serving it.

To save dishes, beat the egg with a fork or mini whisk in the large bowl first, then add the rest of the ingredients (except for the oil, of course).
For a twist, omit the garlic and oregano, and use 1 small, diced onion and ¼ cup (5 grams) of fresh, chopped parsley., Using your hands or a spoon, form the mixture into small balls, about 1-inch (2.54 centimeters) wide. Set them down on a smooth surface as you finish them so that they don't stick.

, If the skillet is not big enough to fit all of the meatballs, consider using only 1 tablespoon of olive oil for the first batch, and another tablespoon for the second batch. This way, you won't run into the risk of some meatballs being much oilier than others.

, This will take about 10 to 15 minutes. Avoid cramming all of the meatballs into the pan, or they won't cook properly.To make the meatballs extra crispy, roll them in some all-purpose flour first., You can serve them with some lemon wedges, tzatziki, or your favorite pasta and pasta sauce.

If you do not have rice wine, you could also use dry sherry.;
, Each piece should be about 1 inch (2.5 cm) in width and length.


Your chicken should be mostly thawed before preparing it; however, leaving the chicken partially frozen can actually make it easier to cut.

, Add the chicken cubes to the bowl of marinade and toss them gently with a fork or spoon so that all pieces get an even coating of marinade.


Allow the chicken to marinate for 10 to 30 minutes. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or aluminum foil and sit it inside the refrigerator during the marinating process.

, In another large bowl, mix together the 1 1/2 cups (375 ml) cornstarch, salt, and pepper. Stir until the ingredients are thoroughly combined.


To make coating the chicken easier, use a shallow bowl with a large mouth. You could also use a large plate with a lip or rim.
Prepare this mixture as the chicken marinates and set it aside until you pull the chicken out.

, Remove each piece of chicken from the marinade and dredge all sides in the cornstarch mixture.


Before dredging the chicken in the cornstarch, hold each marinated piece above the bowl of marinade for a few seconds, allowing the excess to drip off.
When finished dredging each piece, likely shake it to remove excess breading.

, Once hot, stir-fry the minced garlic for 1 minute or until fragrant and tinted brown.


Stir constantly as you cook the garlic to prevent it from burning.
Test the oil to determine if it is hot enough by sprinkling the pan with a few drops of water. If the water immediately sizzles upon coming into contact with the oil, the pan is hot enough.
Use vegetable oil, canola oil, or peanut oil.

, In a separate medium bowl, combine the chicken stock, tomato paste, rice vinegar, hoisin sauce, chili paste, sesame oil, sugar, and cornstarch until smooth.


Make sure that the cornstarch and sugar have become completely dissolved.
If you do not have rice vinegar, you can use white distilled vinegar, instead.
If you do not have chicken stock, use chicken broth or water.
If you cannot find chili paste, you can use 2 tsp (10 ml) cayenne pepper in its place.

, Slowly pour the seasoned chicken stock into the saucepan with the garlic. Stir continually until the sauce thickens.


The sauce should also become somewhat shiny as it thickens.
After it thickens, reduce the heat to low, cover the pan, and keep it warm until ready to use with the chicken.

,


Use a candy thermometer to check the temperature of the oil. It is ready to use when it reaches a temperature between 350 and 360 degrees Fahrenheit (177 to 182 degrees Celsius).
Use vegetable oil, canola oil, peanut oil, or grapeseed oil.

, Cook the chicken in two to four batches until golden brown and crispy on the outside. The inside should be cooked through, and each batch will take roughly 4 to 5 minutes.


Before frying full batches, test the oil by dropping one piece of chicken into it and cooking the chicken for 4 minutes. If this works well, then slowly add the remaining chicken into the oil in small batches.

, After each batch is cooked through, remove the chicken with a slotted spoon and drain the pieces on plates lined with clean paper towels.


Gently tap the slotted spoon on the side of the pan or deep fryer as you remove the chicken to help reduce the amount of oil splatter on your kitchen counter.

,


If you used a deep fryer to fry the chicken, you will need to use a separate skillet for this step.
Use the same type of oil used for the other steps of this recipe.

, Add the dried red chilis to the oil and stir-fry until just fragrant. This will only take 20 to 30 seconds.


If desired, you can chop the peppers before adding them so that they are dispersed throughout the dish more evenly.

, Pour your warm sauce into the pan and cook for about 1 minute, stirring to incorporate the stir-fried chilis.


Since the sauce was thickened separately and kept warm, you will not need to heat it very long during this step. You only need to heat it long enough to see a few bubbles start to form.

, Transfer the fried, drained chicken to the sauce and stir well so that each piece is well coated with the sauce.


Depending on how long the chicken has been draining, you may need to keep the chicken in the sauce for a few minutes in order to reheat it.

, General Tso chicken should be enjoyed warm.


Pile white or brown rice into individual serving bowls. Pour a serving spoonful of chicken over the rice and sprinkle liberally with sesame seeds and chopped scallions.

To grill the chicken, light your grill and leave it on high. Oil the grates on your grill while it is heating up. Put a few tablespoons of cooking oil in a small bow. Dip a pastry brush into the oil and brush the grates with the oil. This will help prevent the chicken breasts from sticking to the grates. Arrange the chicken breasts on the hottest part of your grates and let them cook for 2 to 3 minutes. Use your grill tongs to lift the chicken pieces and turn them over. Continue to grill the chicken pieces for another 2 to 3 minutes. Test for doneness by inserting a meat thermometer into the thickest part of the meat. Your chicken is done when the internal temperature on your meat thermometer registers 165°F (75°C).
To broil the chicken, adjust the broiler rack on your stove so that the broiler pan with the chicken pieces on it will be about 6 inches (15.2 cm) beneath the stove’s coils or flame. Turn the broiler on and let it preheat while you prepare the chicken breasts for broiling. Oil your broiler pan with cooking oil. You can brush the oil on with a pastry brush or apply the oil with a folded paper towel. Arrange the chicken breasts on the broiler pan. Slide the pan into the broiler and broil the chicken for 8 to 10 minutes. Use long-handled tongs to turn the chicken over and broil the chicken pieces on the other side for another 8 to 10 minutes. Remove the broiler pan from the oven and place it on top of the stove. Test for doneness by inserting a meat thermometer into the thickest part of the meat.

To keep this recipe as low-calorie as possible, consider using a low-calorie cooking spray. Normal cooking spray will also work, however.;
, Place the chopped onion and minced garlic in the hot pan. Stir-fry for about 2 minutes, or until the garlic deepens in color and becomes more aromatic.


The onion may also release a stronger scent during this time, but use the garlic as your guide. If you overcook the garlic at this stage, it could ruin the taste of the finished dish.

, Place the bite-sized pieces of chicken and chunks of bell pepper in the pan with the onions and garlic. Continue cooking, stirring frequently, for about 5 minutes or until the chicken lightly browns on all sides.


You can use red, yellow, or green bell peppers for this recipe, or opt to use all three. Keep in mind that red and yellow peppers tend to be slightly sweeter than green ones.

, In a separate bowl, whisk together the tomato paste, tomato passata (or tomato puree), Worcestershire sauce, soy sauce, parsley, basil, thyme, and chicken broth/stock. Pour the diet cola over the mixed ingredients and stir lightly to combine.


Note that tomato passata is ideal for this recipe, but it's an ingredient commonly found across the United Kingdom and Europe and rarely found in the United States. Canned tomato puree (U.S. variety) will work as a substitute,but for an even better substitute, puree an equivalent can of diced tomatoes in your blender or food processor until smooth.Also note that tomato paste in the United States is called tomato puree in the United Kingdom., Add the mixed sauce to the other ingredients in the pan. Stir well to combine and bring the sauce to a boil.

, Reduce the heat to medium-low and cover the pan. Allow the dish to cook at a low simmer for about 15 minutes, stirring it every few minutes to prevent it from burning to the bottom of the pan.

, Stir the snap peas into the rest of the ingredients in the pan and increase the heat to medium or medium-high. Allow the dish to continue cooking for about 10 minutes.


Leave the pan uncovered and stir the contents every few minutes. Note that the sauce should begin a gentle boil.
When finished, the chicken should be cooked through and the vegetables should be very tender. The sauce should also become slightly thicker., Transfer the chicken to individual serving dishes and enjoy it while it's still hot. You can serve it alongside rice, pasta, or potato wedges.

Serve immediately.",How to Make Diet Coke Chicken2," Meanwhile, prepare a 9-inch by 13-inch (23-cm by 33-cm) baking pan by lining it with nonstick aluminum foil.


If desired, you could lightly coat the bottom of the baking pan with nonstick cooking spray instead of using foil. Opt for low-calorie cooking spray to cut your calories as much as possible, but note that standard cooking spray can be used if a low-calorie alternative is unavailable.

, Lightly sprinkle both sides of the chicken with salt and pepper, then lay the chicken breasts in the prepared baking dish.


If you aren't sure about how much salt and pepper to use, start by splitting about 1/4 tsp (1.25 ml) of each between all of the chicken breast cuts. Salt and pepper should only accent the final flavor of the dish, so you don't need much of either.

, Arrange the onion slices evenly over the surface of each chicken breast. Lay any extra onion around the chicken in the bottom of the pan.


If preferred, you could use chopped onion instead of sliced onion. Arrange the onions over the chicken in the same manner.
You can omit the onion completely, if desired, but including it will add more dimension to the final flavor of the dish., In a separate bowl, whisk together the ketchup, Worcestershire sauce, and diet cola until well-combined and mostly smooth.An easy variation would be to omit the ketchup and Worcestershire sauce and use salsa or picante sauce, instead.Any heat level should work, from mild to hot, and you can even look for low-calorie salsa to reduce the calories of the dish even further.

, Evenly pour the mixed sauce over the chicken breasts, covering them completely. Allow the excess to run off into the bottom of the pan.

, Place the chicken in the preheated oven and bake until cooked through. Depending on the thickness of the chicken breasts, this should take anywhere from 35 to 45 minutes.


Leave the baking pan uncovered and turn the chicken breasts after approximately 20 minutes. Turning the chicken should help minimize the risk of drying it out.
Note that you only need to cook the chicken until it is no longer pink inside. Cooking it longer than necessary will dry it out. If you choose to use a cooking thermometer, the chicken should reach an internal temperature of 165 degrees Fahrenheit (74 degrees Celsius).

, Remove the finished chicken from the oven and transfer the chicken breasts to individual serving plates. Some of the sauce should thicken over the surface of the chicken during the cooking process, but you should spoon excess sauce from the pan over each serving before enjoying it.

Pour in the barbecue sauce and diet cola.,
Cover and cook on ""low"" for 6 hours.,
Serve immediately.",How to Make Diet Coke Chicken3," Lightly sprinkle salt and pepper over both sides of each chicken breast.


It's generally best to use small amounts of salt and pepper. Start with 1/4 tsp (1.25 ml) each or less, divided amongst the entire 1 lb (450 g) of chicken.
While not strictly necessary, you could place a slow cooker liner inside the slow cooker for an easier cleanup. If you are unable to find liners, you could lightly coat the bottom and sides with nonstick cooking spray instead.

, Lay the seasoned chicken in the bottom of the slow cooker first, followed by the onions and bell peppers. Try to keep the layers even.


You can use red, yellow, or green peppers for this recipe, or some combination of the three. Alternatively, you can omit the peppers completely if you don't like the taste.
You can mix the peppers and onions together, but the chicken should remain as the bottom layer. Since the heating element of the slow cooker is located in the bottom, the foods requiring the longest cooking time should be placed at the bottom.

, Evenly pour the barbecue sauce over the chicken, then evenly poor the diet cola on top of that.


There's no need to mix the two sauce ingredients together before placing them in the slow cooker.
If you don't like the taste of barbecue sauce, you could use ketchup instead.The final dish will have a milder flavor.

, Cover the slow cooker and switch it on. If using the ""low"" setting, cook the chicken for to 8 hours. If using the ""high"" setting, cook it for 3 to 4 hours.Do not open the lid while the chicken cooks. Doing so will release some of the built-up heat and may result in an increased cooking time.

, Remove the chicken from the slow cooker and transfer it to individual serving dishes. The leftover sauce should be fairly thin, but you can still drizzle it over each serving of chicken to add more flavor if desired.

Slowly turn the heat back up until it reaches a light boil., The butter will need about 45 minutes on the stove.Indian clarified butter, ghee, is often cooked a bit longer, so don't be afraid to leave it in the pot a little bit longer., Insert a thermometer into the butter. Be sure not to touch the sides of the pan. You can also use an infrared thermometer. The temperature of the butter should be 260 degrees Fahrenheit when done. Also, the liquid should be clear. Check to make sure the foam has browned.At this point, you can continue cooking the butter to make browned butter. The butter adds flavor to any recipe calling for butter. However, be careful not to burn the butter if you choose that route., Gently lower the spoon in the top of the butter, letting the foam flow into the spoon. Try to avoid dipping up the clarified butter. Reserve the foam for other purposes. You can use it to flavor oatmeal or cookies., Line a mesh strainer with four layers of clean cheesecloth. Pour the butter through the cloth into another bowl. Make sure the bowl you're pouring the butter into can take the heat., Store in the refrigerator for up to 6 monthsor in the freezer for up to a year.Though this recipe makes quite a bit of clarified butter, you can use it for many things, from scrambling eggs to sauteing vegetables. You can use it to flavor dishes, as well. However, if it still seems like too much, remember you can make any amount of butter you want.

The best cordon blue is thin, allowing every bite to have nearly equal parts ham, cheese, and chicken., If you don't have a meat pounder, you can make do by cutting the thick chicken breast sandwich style. Be careful not to cut completely through the chicken.

, You can use as much as you'd like, but remember that you want to be able to ""close up"" the chicken around your ham and cheese as well., Roll tightly, preventing air pockets or areas where the cheese inside can easily leak out. If you filleted the chicken, simply close the top of the chicken over the inside, locking in the cheese and ham.

, Keep the rolls in place by skewering each piece with at least two toothpicks. For the ""flap"" method, simply use the toothpicks to ensure the chicken stays around the ham and cheese as it cooks.

, You'll need to dip the cordon bleu in both a whipped egg (beat it with a whisk or fork) and breadcrumbs before cooking. Set up the two bowls now so that you can quickly dunk everything and get them coated without mess.If you want seasonings, add them to the breadcrumbs now. Salt and pepper are key, but thyme, oregano, rosemary all taste great as well.

, You want a light coating of liquid egg around the chicken, helping the breadcrumbs stick and retaining moisture as the meat cooks.

, Use your hands to lightly press the breadcrumbs into the chicken, helping them stick. Set the chicken aside once coated with both egg and breadcrumbs.

Lower the oven temperature to 350 if you pre-fry.
You will only need to cook the chicken in the oven for 20-25 minutes if you pre-fry it., The bacon's natural fat will help the chicken cook evenly in the oven, and you'll save the egg & crumb mess. Close chicken breasts and wrap with sliced bacon, securing the bacon with wooden toothpicks. You can then cook it like normal.

, The biggest issue here is hardness, as Swiss cheese holds its shape well under heat. Similar ""melting"" cheeses will work as well, like cheddar, Gruyere, cream cheese, and mozzarella., Looking to really make the dish your own? Skip the ham for a more flavorful or unique smoked meat. The options are endless, but in general, you want a meat that is naturally salty, thinly cut, and has a somewhat smokey flavor. Some ideas include:


Prosciutto

Cooked bacon
Pancetta
Capicola

, Most restaurant-quality cordon bleu is topped with a simple but creamy sauce to help cut the salty, crunchy texture. Frequently the dish is paired with Dijon Mustard, which provides a necessary burst of acid to completely the dish.

Melt 2 tablespoons butter on medium heat. Whisk in 2 tablespoons flour and cook until golden brown, whisking the entire time (1-2 minutes)
Add 1-1/2 cups of whole milk, 2 tablespoons dijon, and a touch of salt and pepper slowly, stirring throughout.

, When thawed, use a sturdy knife or kitchen shears to cut the wing at each of the joints. This will result in three pieces. Discard the wings tip.









Use sterile techniques. When handling raw chicken you need to be clean. Wash your hands after handling raw meat. Bleach your cutting and cooking surfaces when done to prevent cross contamination. Do not allow any produce (or any other food items) to come in contact with the raw chicken, or surfaces that have touched raw chicken.
Alternatively, instead of discarding the wing tips, you can save them for making chicken stock.

, It is up to you, but many chiefs like the extra flavor that a good marinade can add to chicken wings. Common marinade sauces are ""Honey Garlic Sauce"" or ""Hot Sauce"", but feel free to try others. If you choose to marinade your wings. Place your chicken wings in a shallow container and submerge in your sauce of choice for 1-2 hours in the refrigerator.

If you do choose to use the same type of sauce for both the marinating and final saucing, make sure you aliquot the sauce out ahead of time. You should never apply to cooked chicken any sauce that has come in contact with raw chicken.

, It is a matter of personal taste whether you want to bread your wings. If you do choose to bread, below are two popular breading recipes.









Recipe for ""Basic Breading"", enough for 2 pounds of wings: Sift 2 cups of all purpose flour, 1 teaspoon salt, 2 teaspoon pepper, and 1 teaspoon garlic powder in a large bowl or plate. Remove your marinated wings from their sauce and dredge them in this flour mixture. Make sure to get both sides of your chicken wings, shake off the extra, and place on a new clean dish.

Cook your wings.,
Drain wings.,
Sauce your wings.,
Plate.",How to Make Chicken Wings2," You may either bake or fry your wings. But whatever your method, your chicken should reach an internal temperature of 165 °F (74 °C) to be considered safe to eat. It is recommended that you use a meat thermometer to confirm this before serving.









To fry: Fill your fryer or stock pot with vegetable oil and preheat it to 375 °F (191 °C). Place the wing pieces, away from you, slowly and carefully. Wearing long sleeves is advisable, as the oil is hot and will burn you. Cook your wings until they are lightly browned. Remove the wings from the cooking oil using a wire basket or tongs.

Do not overload your fryer. While cooking, you want your wings to move freely in the oil. To accomplish this you may need to fry your wings in two, or more, batches.


To bake: Preheat oven to 375 °F (191 °C). Lay your wings, in a single layer, on a cookie sheet. Cook for 10 minutes, flip each wing, then bake another 15 minutes until lightly browned.

, When done cooking, place wings briefly onto a plate lined with paper towels. Let some of the oil drain, but only briefly. Do not let your wings cool.








, After only a few seconds rest on the paper towel, transfer your, still hot wings, to a large bowl. Once there, cover your wings with your sauce of choice. Stir to insure even coating.









The sauce used to coat your wings may be pre-bottled store bought, or the above homemade ""Honey Garlic Sauce"" or ""Hot Sauce"". It is up to you. The recipes for the ""Honey Garlic Sauce"" and ""Hot Sauce"" can be found in the ""Marinade your wings"" step.
Health note: Do not use the same marinade mixture that the raw chicken soaked in. That sauce should be thrown out. Instead use the clean portion of ""Honey Garlic Sauce"" or ""Hot Sauce"" that you set aside.

, Move your cooked, sauced wings to a serving dish or platter. Common accompaniment is celery sticks and bleu cheese dipping sauce or dressing.

, Place the chilled butter cubes and shortening in the flour mixture. Use a pastry cutter or two forks to work the butter and shortening into the flour until the dough resembles small lentils or peas.


If you have a food processor, you can make this step easier by placing the flour, salt, butter and shortening in the food processor and giving it a few pulses until the dough comes together as described above.
Don't overwork the dough, or the crust will come out too tough. Leaving larger pieces of butter will result in a flaky crust.

, Start with just a tablespoon of ice water. Use a wooden spoon to quickly work it into the dough. Pinch a bit of dough between your fingers. If it holds together, it's ready for the next stage. If it crumbles, add more ice water, mix it in, and test it again.

If you plan to make individual pies, cut the rolled-out dough into smaller shapes large enough to cover the baking dishes you plan on using., If you want to make one large pot pie, pour the entire amount of filling into a deep pie dish or cake pan or an 8-inch casserole dish. To make individual pot pies, distribute it evenly among 4 ramekins.

, Drape the crust over the top of the baking dish, or dishes. Use your fingers to crimp it around the edges so that it stays secured in place. Use a knife to make a few cross hatches in the top of the crust. If you wish, use a fork to make decorative notches around the edge of the pie. If you're making more than one pie, repeat until each pie has a crust.

, Place the pie (or pies) on a baking sheet, so that the filling won't spill over onto your oven floor as it cooks. Bake for about 20 minutes, until the crust is golden brown and slightly puffed.

",How to Make Popcorn Chicken," To make the popcorn chicken, start with 3 boneless, skinless chicken breasts. Use a knife to cut the raw chicken into pieces that are small enough to pop in your mouth.Make sure to wash your hands before and after handling the raw chicken.It’s best to use a flat knife to cut the raw chicken. A serrated knife can catch on the stringy parts of the breast.
Try to cut all of the pieces to the same size so they’ll cook at the same rate when you place them in the oil.
Trim away any fat or cartilage that you find in the chicken breast.;
, In a large bowl, combine the cut up chicken with 1 cup (237 ml) of buttermilk and 1 teaspoon (4.9 g) of sea salt. Mix well, so the chicken is coated with the buttermilk and seasoned with the salt.If you don’t have buttermilk, you can combine 1 cup (237 ml) of regular milk with 1 tsp (5 ml) of lemon juice to replace it.

, After you’ve combined the chicken with the buttermilk and salt, cover the bowl with a piece of foil or plastic wrap. Place it in the refrigerator and allow it to chill for at least 1 hour.You can chill the chicken and buttermilk mixture for up to 8 hours.

, In a plastic bag that you can seal, combine 1 cup (125 g) of all-purpose flour, 1 teaspoon (4.9 g) of sea salt, 1 ½ teaspoons (7 g) of baking powder, 2 teaspoons (10 g) of cayenne pepper, ½ teaspoon (2.5 g) of dried oregano, ½ teaspoon (2.5 g) of ground turmeric, 1 teaspoon (5 g) of onion powder, and plenty of freshly ground black pepper to taste. Close the bag and shake until all of the ingredients are well mixed.You can customize the seasonings for the popcorn chicken breading to suit your tastes. For example, you might mix some garlic powder, chili powder, paprika, or cajun seasoning into the breading.

, Remove ⅓ of the chicken pieces from the buttermilk mixture, and place them inside the plastic bag with the breading. Close the bag and shake well to ensure that all of the chicken pieces are well coated.Use a slotted spoon to remove the chicken from the buttermilk and shake well so you don’t add excess moisture to the breading bag.

, Take the chicken pieces out of the bag one at a time, taking time to shake off any excess coating. Place the breaded chicken on a foil-lined baking sheet to wait until it’s time to fry. Repeat the process with the rest of the chicken pieces until they’re all coated., In a large heavy saucepan, add 4 to 6 inches (10 to 15 cm) of canola or vegetable oil. Heat it on medium heat until a deep-frying thermometer registers the oil’s temperature as 350 degrees Fahrenheit (177 degrees Celsius).You can substitute peanut oil for the canola or vegetable oil if you prefer. It usually provides a darker golden brown color to the chicken when it's done frying, though.

, Take ⅓ of the breaded chicken pieces and carefully add them to the hot oil. Allow the chicken to fry for 3 to 4 minutes or until the chicken is cooked through and is a golden brown color.If you’re not sure whether the chicken is cooked through, cut a piece in half and make sure that the center is no longer pink.
For a healthier version of popcorn chicken, you can bake the coated chicken in the oven. Just swap the flour in the breading for 2 ½ cups of Corn Flakes that have been crushed in the food processor and use ½ cup of flour to coat all of the chicken pieces before tossing them in the breading. Place them on a foil-lined baking sheet and bake at 400 degrees Fahrenheit (200 degrees Celsius) for 20 minutes, turning them over halfway through. Make them extra crunchy by broiling them for an additional 2 minutes., When the chicken is finished frying, remove it from the oil with a slotted spoon. Place the pieces on a paper towel-lined baking sheet to absorb any excess oil.While you want to allow the chicken to drain of the oil so they’re crunchy, don’t let them sit too long. You want to serve them while they’re still hot.

, Once you’ve finished frying the first batch of chicken, fry the rest of it in the same way. When all of the popcorn chicken is fried, serve it with your favorite dipping sauces, such as barbecue sauce, honey mustard, and ranch dressing.You can also sauce the popcorn chicken directly. Toss it while it’s still warm in a sauce of your choosing, such as honey barbecue or spicy buffalo, so all of the pieces are coated and serve.

A cutting board
3 feet (0.9 m) of kitchen twine or string
A scissors
A roasting pan

, Remove any giblets, organs or neck pieces from inside the chicken's cavity. These can be discarded or set aside for later use. Rinse the chicken's outer surface and inner cavity. Pat it dry with paper towels, inside and out, before you begin the trussing process.


If you plan to stuff the chicken, go ahead and stuff it before you start the trussing process.
Wait to season the chicken until after it has been trussed.

, Center the twine under the legs so that you have equal lengths of twine extending from either side.

, Lift the ends of the twine so they are taut underneath the chicken's legs, then cross the ends over each other to form an ""x"" across the legs.

, Pull the twine tight, so the ends of the legs are pulled close together.

, Hold the ends together at the top of the chicken, near the neck. Pull the strings taught so they don't come loose.

, While keeping the twine tight, flip the chicken over so the legs are now facing away from you.


This is the hardest step of trussing chicken, so don't get discouraged if it takes you more than one attempt.
When the chicken is flipped, you should see the twine bends threaded over each thigh and under each wing.

, Position the twine under the neck bone of the chicken and tie it in a tight knot.


If the chicken's neck bone has been cut off, just position the string near the neck opening.
Make sure the string is very taught. The chicken's body should make a creaking sound as it tightens.

, Use the scissors to cut off the excess length of twine after you've made the knot to prevent the twine from burning during cooking.

Use the chicken in a recipe.",How to Spatchcock a Chicken," Use a whole, uncooked chicken with the gizzards and other innards removed. This method can be used on a chicken of any size, but you'll have the best results with a three to four pound chicken.


If you're using a chicken that was previously frozen, let it thaw overnight in the refrigerator so that it's completely de-iced before using this method.
As an aside, did you know that raw chicken doesn't need to be rinsed before cooking?Rinsing unnecessarily sprays your sink and counter with bacteria that will get killed when you cook the chicken.
This method can also be used for any other type of poultry, such as Cornish game hens or doves.;
, Start cutting right next to the tail, with one point of the shears inside the chicken's cavity. Use the shears to slice through the tiny bones alongside the backbone. Keep cutting until you've cut clean to the neck.


Make sure the shears you're using are quite sharp, or it will be difficult to cut through the meat and bone.
Be sure not to cut through the spine, but right alongside it.

, Locate the backbone by feeling it with your fingers; it's right down the center of the bird. Start on the other side of the tail, with one point of the shears inside the chicken's cavity, and cut clean through to the neck. Now you can lift the backbone out of the chicken and set it aside.The backbone makes a great base for chicken stock, so you may want to save it instead of discarding.

, Turn it over so the breasts are now facing up. Standing over the chicken, push down on the breasts with your hands to flatten the chicken. You should hear the breastbone crack as it gives under your weight. The chicken has now been spatchcocked!


As an alternative, you can use a sharp knife to crack open the breastbone.
If you want to ensure that the chicken stays in a flat shape while cooking, insert a skewer crosswise through the right breast and the left thigh. Insert a second skewer crosswise through the left breast and right thigh.

, Spatchcocked chicken is commonly roasted in the oven, where it's almost guaranteed to turn out delicious. You can also grill or fry the chicken according to the recipe you're using."

, Dredging means coating it, and it should be a nice, even coating of flour. This flour will cook to form a thin, breaded coating around your chicken.

, You could use all of one or the other, but this mixture actually has a purpose -- the two work together to keep the temperature of the oil correct while helping each other coat the chicken and, eventually, pasta. Furthermore, the richness of butter is cut by the unique, fresh taste of the olive oil, adding a new depth of flavor.

, You just want to get the outsides well-browned, but not burnt. If you didn't pound the chicken down, you'll want to turn the heat down a little and cook them slightly longer, flipping twice to ensure the middles of the chicken cook.

You can buy chicken pieces, but you may end up with too much white meat or too much dark meat. Remove all wrappings and paper from the chicken.









If you are short on time, you can purchase an already cooked rotisserie chicken at your local grocery store. This will save you the time it takes to cook the chicken and you can get right to the shredding. Note, however, that most rotisserie chicken has been seasoned.;
, Do not use warm or hot water as warm water can lead to bacterial growth in raw chicken. Pat the chicken dry and salt and pepper it if so desired. 








If you are cooking a whole chicken, you may have to remove the bag of extra parts that has been placed inside.

, There are several different ways to do this. The chicken must be cooked before it is shredded, as it will not shred easily if uncooked.










Boiling the Chicken: Place the chicken in a large pot. Cover the chicken completely with water or chicken stock. Chicken stock will give the chicken a saltier flavor. Add salt and pepper to your taste. Cover the pot with a lid and bring the water to a boil. Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium low and allow the chicken to cook for about an hour or until it is fully cooked. The chicken is done when there is no pink coloring and the meat comes off easily from the bone. If you are cooking chicken breasts, you should be able to tear parts of the chicken off easily with a fork.

Simmering the Chicken in a Skillet: (This method works best for chicken breasts.) Place one tablespoon of olive oil in a 12-inch skillet and heat on medium. Add the chicken breast top down and cook it for five minutes until it is golden brown on top. Add ¾ cup of water or chicken stock to the skillet and flip the chicken over. Place a lid on top and let the chicken simmer on medium heat for seven to ten minutes, or until the chicken is cooked all the way through. If the water or stock evaporates too quickly, you can add ¼ cup of water or stock.Using a Crock-Pot: This method works especially well if you’re cooking a whole chicken and have about seven hours before you need to serve it. Place your chicken in a crock pot. Add any seasoning you would like such as salt, pepper, paprika, etc. You do not need to add any liquid. Set the Crock-Pot to low, put the lid on, and let the chicken cook for about seven hours., Place it in a shallow pan to cool. It is best if you let the chicken cool thoroughly before you shred it, as it will be too hot to handle with bare hands when first removed from the pan or pot.








, There are several ways to do this. Make sure to remove all skin and pieces of bone.










Using your hands: Shred the chicken with your fingers as you pick it off the bone. Using your hands will result in larger pieces of shredded chicken. Simply pull the meat apart into chunks.

Using forks: Use one fork to hold the chicken steady. With the other fork, scrape and tear the chicken apart. Using forks will result in thinner pieces of chicken.Using a mixer: This method only works with chicken breasts. Using a mixer is the fastest way to shred chicken and will not hurt your hands or wrists. Place the chicken breasts into a mixing bowl and use a mixer on low speed. You don't need a high-end mixer. You can use an electric hand beater. It should take about one and a half minutes to shred two chicken breasts., See the ‘Ideas Section’ below for some great recipes that call for shredded chicken.








, Shredded chicken can be store in the refrigerator for about three days. If it will not be used in that time, freeze the chicken and then defrost it later.

Keeping the pot on, deglaze the pan with a cup of white wine or lemon broth.,
If not used above, add the juice of one whole lemon and 1/3 cup chicken broth to the hot wine.,
Add 2-3 tablespoons of fresh capers to the mixture and stir.,
Add 2 tablespoons of butter and whisk together.,
Add the chicken back to the hot pan and cook together for 1-2 minutes.,
Serve with angel hair pasta.",How to Make Chicken Piccata2," Deglazing is when cool liquid hits a hot pan, which loosens up all the flavorful burned bits on the pan's bottom to start a simple pan sauce or gravy. After the wine hits the pan, use a whisk or spatula to scrape up all the bits on the bottom of the pan, mixing them in. Note, however, that you do not have to use white wine if you don't desire:


You can also use 1/3 cup fresh lemon juice along with 2/3's cup chicken broth.

, The lemon is the essential flavor in this dish, and you need to add it at some point. You can either add it to the wine as a subtle flavor, or use it to deglaze the pan along with some chicken broth for a more intense kick.

, Let everything cook on medium-low for a few minutes, letting the flavors meld. Now is the time to add salt and pepper as well, seasoning and tasting regularly to ensure it is coming out well.

, Whisk it in so that it is all melted before moving on -- it shouldn't take long.

, This is especially important if you're using bigger chicken breasts that may not have cooked all the way through the first time (though you should avoid this at all costs when possible). You can slice the thickest breast open to make sure it is completely cooked, if worried.


If you're planning on serving the chicken later, don't add it to the sauce yet. It should be simmered to stay hot and meld flavors right before serving, as the chicken will get soggy if left in for too long.
Alternatively, simply pour the sauce over the chicken if you want a crunchier coating.

, A few fresh capers, a squeeze of lemon, and a dash of freshly chopped parsley would all be welcome guests on the plate as well. Top with some shaved Parmesan or Romano and you have an Italian dish worth sharing.

"
"
Take your chicken breasts and dip them in milk ahead of time for a thicker breading.,
Add a cup of heavy cream to the sauce, stirring until well mixed, before the chicken goes back in.,
Ignore the capers if you're not feeling like the olive-y bite.,
Chop some shallots or garlic into the pan just before deglazing to add a hint of new flavors to the sauce.,
Finished.

",How to Make Chicken Piccata3," The milk will give the flour a liquid to bind to, which leads to a thicker ""skin"" on the cooked chicken. If you do this, premix the salt and pepper in with the flour to ensure it stays on the chicken when you dredge it. The rest of the recipe proceeds like normal.

, This will give a rich creaminess to the dish that the original lacks. It goes without saying that this variation is substantially heavier and less healthy than the original, but it tastes incredible.

, Capers are traditional in chicken piccata, but they're not for everyone. They can be easily ignored, especially if you use heavy cream (as mentioned above) to give the sauce a little more thickness and body., These small roots are known as aromatics. Shallots, when cooked, have a wonderful savory-sweetness, while garlic is welcome in almost all Italian dishes if you want it. Simply mince the garlic and shallots and add to the hot oil as the chicken comes out. Cook for 30-60 seconds, then proceed with the wine and/or lemon broth.,"

Place the chicken on a clean cutting board.,
Start cutting the chicken skin at the neck.,
Cut the wing free at the first joint.,
Separate the skin from the meat over the breast area of turkey.,
Slice the skin on the back free.,
Trim the skin around the ends of the thighs.,
Cut the hip joints and snap the thighs free.,
Pull the skin completely free from the chicken.",How to Skin a Chicken1," Before you begin skinning the chicken, it’s important to ensure that your work area is ready to go. Wash the cutting board or other surface that you plan to skin the chicken to ensure that you don’t contaminate the chicken. Once the surface is clean, set the chicken on the cutting board with the breast side down.When you’re working with chicken and other meats, a plastic cutting board is usually the best option because it’s easier to sanitize and doesn’t trap bacteria as easily.If you’re washing a plastic cutting board, a chlorine-based cleaner, such as a bleach and water solution, works best. Add a tablespoon of bleach per gallon of water to create a cleaner that you can use for up to two weeks.
For washing a wooden cutting board, a quaternary ammonium-based disinfectant is usually the best option. Dilute a quaternary ammonium product, such as Mr. Clean, with water according to the directions to create a cleanser for your board.
Make sure to dry your cutting board completely before setting the chicken on it.;
, With a long, sharp knife, begin separating the skin from the other tissue at the neck of the chicken. You’ll need to slide the knife beneath the skin to separate it from the rest of the chicken. Continue working your way along until you reach one of the wings beneath the skin.It’s best to use short, precise cutting motions as you work to free the skin from the chicken, especially if you want to keep the skin intact.

, When you reach the first joint of the wing, use your knife to slice it and free it completely from the skin. Remove the wing bone and its meat from inside the skin and continue cutting the rest of the wing free from the skin, turning it inside out to make it easier.Once you’ve freed the wing that you’re working on, repeat the entire process with the other one.

, Once you’ve freed both wings, you can continue to loosen the skin from the breast of the chicken. If you don’t need the skin for another recipe and don’t care if it remains intact, you can use your knife to carefully slice it free along the breast, thigh, and back of the chicken.If you want to keep your chicken skin intact, use a tablespoon instead of a knife to separate the skin from the meat. Slip the handle of the spoon between the skin and the meat to split them, but work carefully. While the spoon handle is dull, it can still tear the skin if you’re not careful. Leave areas that won’t easily separate alone.

, The area in the middle of the chicken’s back is usually especially tough, so you need to take time to carefully cut it free with your knife. Work slowly and carefully, pulling back the skin as you go to make the process easier. Make sure to go as high as the skin allows to fully separate it from the meat on the back.If you’ve used a spoon to help separate the skin from the breast area, you’ll need to switch back to a knife to cut away the skin at the middle of the back. The spoon just isn’t strong enough to free the skin in that spot. If you don’t want to damage the skin, keep your cuts small to avoid cutting it.

, Once the skin is completely loose around the breast and back area, use your knife to cut the skin that covers the end of the bone in each thigh. Once you’ve cut the skin at the end, continue to use your knife to separate it from the thigh meat.Make sure to slice completely around the bone at the end of the thighs to ensure that the skin is free all the way around.

, Once the skin is separated enough, you can remove the thighs. Slice each one at the hip joint to ensure that the thighs are loose enough. Using your hand, snap each thigh at the joint to completely sever it from the chicken. Next, pull the thighs free from the skin, and place them on the cutting board.It’s important to use a sharp enough knife to cut through the hip joints. You may want to sharpen yours just before this step to ensure that it’s capable of doing the job.

, Once the thighs are removed, you’re ready to completely separate the skin from the chicken. As you’re working it free, pull on it back from the neck almost as you would pull up on sock. If you find any areas where the skin is still attached, use your knife to carefully separate it and then continue pulling.If you’re removing the skin simply to make your recipe healthier, discard it in the trash. If you need the skin for a certain recipe, follow the instructions for what to do next.

Prepare the pan.,
Get your chicken ready to be baked.,
Finalize your chicken dish.,
Wrap your chicken dish.,
Bake your chicken.",How to Prepare Boneless Skinless Chicken Thighs1," This is the perfect temperature for chicken to bake at, keeping the chicken juicy without drying out. Make sure that your oven is cleared out of any pots and pans you might have stored inside. You might also want to wipe out the oven so that remnants from past meals don't contaminate the chicken.;
, Place the chicken underneath a piece of plastic wrap. Use a small mallet (metal or wood) and gently pound the chicken thighs. Make sure that each of the thighs is of equal thickness, around 1/2 inch-3/4 inch. This will not only make your chicken more tender, but will allow you to cook the chicken evenly.

, This is a process which makes your chicken moist and juicy. Fill a medium sized bowl with warm (not hot) water. Stir in a pinch of salt. Let the chicken sit in the brine for 15 minutes. This will draw in moisture into the chicken thighs., Get out a large enough baking pan to fit all of the chicken thighs you plan to cook. Add 2 tablespoons (29.6 ml) of olive oil or butter to the pan. Spread it out evenly, so that your chicken will not stick to the pan. This will get your chicken brown and crispy., Take your chicken out of the brine. Brush the chicken with either olive oil or butter. Use your hands and press into the outside of the chicken any seasonings you would like. Some popular combinations are lemon pepper, barbecue, and or garlic herb., Put the chicken in the pan laced with olive oil or butter. Tuck in herbs and lemon wedges next to the chicken thighs if you like. These will add an extra layer of flavor to your dish., You have two options here. One is to wrap the entire dish in tinfoil. Make sure that the tinfoil wraps around the edges of the pan, and is secure. The other option is to wrap in parchment paper. If you choose this option, place the piece of parchment paper inside of the dish, directly on top of the chicken. You can either go along with baking, or place this directly in the refrigerator to cook later on., Place the pan into the oven. Close the oven and set your kitchen timer for 20 minutes. After the 20 minutes is up, take your chicken out and rush your chicken with another layer of oil or butter. Add in any extra spices you want to in this step. Place the chicken back in the oven for another 10 to 15 minutes.

Pull the skin away from one side of a breast.,
Grasp the skin at the joint side of a thigh.,
Tug the skin away from the meaty end of a drumstick.",How to Skin a Chicken2," When you want to remove the skin from a chicken breast, place the breast on a clean cutting board so the skin side is facing up. Choose one side of the breast and take hold of the skin to carefully pull it away from the meat.Don’t worry if the skin doesn’t pull off in one piece. Just grab the remaining piece and tug until all of the skin is removed from the breast.

, To skin a chicken thigh, it’s important to start at the joint where the skin is usually most strongly attached. Grab the skin right where it connects to the joint and pull it off in one piece. If you meet any resistance along the way, use a sharp knife to cut the skin free.If you feel like your fingers on slipping on the slick skin, you can use a paper towel to grab it and get better traction. Dipping your fingers in salt can also help, but be sure to pour the salt into a small dish and throw the remainder away after use so you don’t contaminate your salt with bacteria from the raw chicken.

, When you’re removing the skin from a chicken drumstick, you should take hold of the meaty end, not the bone. With a firm grip on the skin, pull down toward the bone until it comes off the end. It should come off in one piece, but if the skin tears, just grab the remainder and pull it off the end.If any small bits of skin get stuck along the bone and you want to remove them, use a small knife to carefully scrape them off.

Allow the chicken to cool.,
Use a knife to free an edge of the skin.,
Peel the skin off.",How to Skin a Chicken3," You can usually easily remove the skin from a cooked chicken by hand, but that means it’s important to ensure that it’s not too hot to handle. That way, you won’t burn yourself. After you’ve finished cooking the chicken, let it sit for approximately 10 minutes.You’ll know that the chicken is cool enough when you can touch it without discomfort.
To ensure that the chicken retains enough heat to eat, you may want to set a piece of foil over it as it cools.

, Cooking the chicken actually helps loosen the skin from the meat, so there may be an edge that you can easily grab hold of without much effort. However, in some cases, the skin may not be loose enough for you to grasp, so you’ll need to take a knife and gently slide it between the skin and meat. When the skin lifts up, grab it between your fingers.It’s usually best to cut the cooked chicken into pieces before you start to remove the skin.

, Chicken skin typically becomes crispy when you cook it, so in most cases, it’s easier to peel it off after it’s cooked. Pull the skin from one side of the chicken to the other to remove it. It probably will not peel off in one clean piece, so you may need to repeat the process a few times to remove all of the skin.Leaving the skin on the chicken while it cooks can actually help keep the meat tender and juicy. Removing the skin prior to eating, though, gives you much of the same health benefits as skinning the chicken before you cook it.

Make sure that each piece is about 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) thick. This will allow you to cook your meat evenly, and ensure that your chicken is tender., Obtain a medium sized bowl and pour in warm (not hot) water. Mix in a pinch of salt. Put each of your pieces of chicken in the brine for 30 minutes. This will allow your chicken to soak in moisture and be more juicy when you eat it., While your chicken is soaking in the brine, make a marinade. A good combination is olive oil, salt, pepper, herbs, garlic, and lemon zest. You can also use sesame/soy sauce, or barbecue sauce. When the chicken is done in the brine, place the chicken in a plastic bag. Pour the marinade in with the chicken and close the bag.Press down against the bag with your fingers to get the marinade up close and personal with the marinade.
Place the marinade bags into the fridge and let them sit for four hours.

, If you decide not to do a marinade, you can use some simple ingredients to season your meat. Simply sprinkle salt, pepper, and garlic powder over the chicken thighs. Press the spices in with your fingers. These will help lock in moisture and make your meat more tender., If your grill hasn't been used in a while, or has been used way too often, it is wise to clean it down. Soap and water usually work fine. When you get done washing, spread some olive oil over the grate in order to keep your chicken from sticking., Generally, you should grill chicken between 375 to 450° Fahrenheit (190 to 230°C). However, some suggest you set your grill up to 550° Fahrenheit (290°C). For precaution's sake, set your grill lower, and cook a tad bit longer., Place the chicken onto the grill. Make sure they are equidistant from one another so they cook evenly. Cook the chicken two to three minutes on both sides. You should see grill marks (dark lines) if the chicken is cooking properly."

Use a thermometer.,
Rest your chicken.,
Plate the chicken.",How to Prepare Boneless Skinless Chicken Thighs4," Place a kitchen thermometer into your chicken. Your chicken is ready to eat when it is 160° Fahrenheit (74°C). If the chicken is any lower than this, it is not safe to eat. Continue cooking until the correct temperature appears on the thermometer., Take your chicken and set it on a plate. Give your chicken 5 to 10 minutes of rest before you cut into it. This is a great time to apply any extra barbecue sauce you might have. If you cut into the thigh too early, the moisture will leave.

, Sit the chicken on a clean plate. You can slice it, or leave it whole. Add some lemon wedges and a lettuce leaf for appearances. You can sprinkle some extra seasoning overtop, or drizzle some sauce onto the chicken. Dip your side dishes onto the plate as well.

Use caution when cooking frozen chicken.,
Preheat the oven.,
Dress the chicken.,
Cook the chicken.",How to Safely Cook Chicken from Frozen1," If you are cooking any parts of a chicken from frozen, there is an increased risk for foodborne illness. To kill any pathogens in the chicken, be sure to cook the meat to an internal temperature of at least 165°F (74°C). Always prepare from frozen chicken in the oven or on the stovetop and, as a rule of thumb, cook it about 50 percent longer than you would thawed meat.For example, it would take about two hours to roast a thawed 5-pound (2.25 kg) roasting hen at 350°F (177°C). If frozen, a similarly sized chicken would take about three hours to cook thoroughly at the same temperature.
Check the internal temperature of the meat by inserting a meat thermometer into thickest part of the breast and the innermost part of the thigh and wing. If the thermometer does not ready 165°F (74°C), continue cooking the bird.
Do not try to cook the frozen chicken in a slow cooker. The appliance will not get hot enough to kill the pathogens in the meat. It also leaves the meat sitting for too long at unsafe temperatures.;
, Turn on your oven and heat it to 350ºF (177ºC). While your oven warms up, put the frozen chicken breast-side-up in a large roasting pan. This will ensure that the densest meat of the bird gets thoroughly cooked.Depending on the size of the chicken, you may also be able to use a Dutch oven instead of a roasting pan.

, If the bird is not frozen closed, try to remove the giblets from inside of the chicken. Once you remove the giblets, stuff the bird with your favorite ingredients, such as lemon, onion, rosemary, and thyme. Then rub the exterior of the chicken with olive oil and sprinkle it with salt and pepper.If you cannot access the inside of the bird, wait until it has cooked for about 45 minutes to remove the giblets. Use tongs and an oven mitt to remove the giblets and insert any stuffings that you want.

, Place the seasoned chicken in the oven uncovered and roast for about 90 minutes. Then increase the temperature of the oven to 450ºF (232ºC) and cook the chicken for another 15 to 30 minutes. This will help brown the skin. Remove the pan from the oven and serve once a meat thermometer placed into various parts of the chicken reads 165°F (74°C). These cooking times are based on a 4-pound (1.8 kg) chicken. Be sure to adjust the roasting time based on the weight of your chicken.
Let the chicken rest for 10 to 15 minutes to cool before carving.
If there is any pink or red meat, place the whole bird or uncooked pieces back in the oven until they turn white and there is no red in the juices.

To experience the most authentic flavor, use boneless, skinless chicken thighs when preparing this dish. Note that other boneless cuts, including chicken breasts and tenderloins, can be used instead if preferred.;
, Use a serrated knife to cut the chicken into bite-sized pieces. The exact size can be between 1 and 2 inches (2.5 and 5 cm), but try to keep the entire batch as evenly sized as possible to promote consistent cooking.


To make the chicken easier to cut, consider freezing the chicken beforehand and using it while it's mostly thawed yet still partially frozen. The meat will be firmer and easier to slice through at this stage, and it can continue thawing during the marinating stage.

, In a small bowl, whisk together the egg, minced garlic, chopped ginger, minced green chilli, soy sauce, salt, and black pepper. Continue mixing until the ingredients seem well-combined.The egg should coat the outside of the chicken, making it easier for the batter to adhere to the surface in later steps. While using the whole egg is best, you may opt to use only the egg white if you wish to do so for health reasons.

, Place the chopped chicken into a large resealable plastic bag. Pour the marinade over the chicken, seal the bag, and turn the bag so that the marinade evenly coats the pieces of poultry. Allow this mixture to rest in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes.


If you do not have a large plastic bag, you can toss the marinade and chicken together in a large bowl. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or foil before letting it sit.
To prevent harmful bacteria from growing, marinate the chicken in the refrigerator instead of letting it sit out at room temperature.
Marinating the chicken causes it to become moister, more tender, and more flavorful. You should let it sit in the marinade for at least 15 minutes, but marinating the chicken for 30 to 60 minutes would be ideal.

, Pour 4 Tbsp (60 ml) of vegetable oil into a large wok or frying pan. Set the pan on the stove over medium-high heat., While the oil heats up, whisk together the cornstarch, all-purpose flour, and water in a medium to large bowl. Continue mixing until a smooth, medium-thin batter forms.


To prevent lumps in the batter, consider sifting the cornstarch and flour together first using a fine-mesh sieve. Gradually whisk in the water, scraping the sides of the bowl as you continue to fully incorporate all three ingredients together.

, Using a slotted spoon, remove the chicken pieces from the bag of marinade and drop them directly into the bowl of batter. Toss the chicken gently to coat all sides.


When removing the chicken from the marinade, pause above the bag or over a sink so that any excess marinade can drip off. After draining the excess, you can toss the chicken into batter.
Note that it might be easiest to coat the chicken in batter if working in batches. If you choose to do this, you should also cook the chicken in batches so that all of the chicken in the pan at any given time can cook at the same pace.

, Lift the chicken from the bowl of batter, letting the excess drain off and back down into the bowl. Toss the chicken into the pan of oil and reduce the heat to medium.


Use the slotted spoon the help break apart the chicken after dropping it into the oil. If you do not do this, the chicken may stick and cook together.

, Stir-fry the chicken in the hot oil for 3 to 5 minutes, or until the pieces are lightly browned on the outside and no longer pink on the inside.Do not overcook the chicken. You'll need to expose the chicken to additional heat during a later step, and too much overall heat can cause the chicken to become dry and unsavory.

, Using the slotted spoon, remove the chicken from the hot oil and transfer the pieces to a plate lined with paper towels.Similarly, you can line the plate with clean paper bag material, parchment paper, or any other food-safe absorbent paper. Any of these materials should help wick away the excess oil from the chicken.
Set the plate of chicken aside for now, but keep it warm

, Remove the pan from the stove, then pour the remaining 2 Tbsp (30 ml) of vegetable oil into it. Return the pan to the stove, turning the heat back up to medium-high.


Note that you may need to allow the pan to sit off the heat for several minutes before adding the oil. If you add oil to an already hot pan, you'll increase the amount of splatter it produces.
It's a good idea to use medium-high heat instead of high heat while cooking the vegetables. The intense heat should sear the vegetables while allowing them to stay crisp. Lower heat, on the other hand, is more likely to increase the cooking time and make the vegetables soggy.

, In a small bowl, whisk together the chilli sauce, ketchup, soy sauce, white vinegar, and sesame seed oil until evenly combined. Set the sauce aside.


To increase or decrease the amount of heat in this recipe, simply increase or decrease the amount of chilli sauce used during this step. Increase the chilli sauce to 2 Tbsp (30 ml) for a very spicy dish or omit the chilli sauce completely for a mildly spicy dish; the spice in the chicken marinade and the chillies used in the stir-fry will still add some heat to the dish overall, even if you do not add any chilli sauce to the combined stir-fry sauce.

, Toss the sliced onion into the hot oil. Cook, stirring frequently, for about 5 minutes or until the onions turn translucent.During this time, the onions should also become more aromatic and slightly wilted. Do not allow the onions to start browning, however.

, Add the minced garlic, sliced bell pepper, and chopped chillies to the pan of onions. Continue cooking the entire mixture for another 2 or 3 minutes.


Ideally, this blend of vegetables should be cooked until the garlic is lightly toasted and peppers and chillies are just barely tender-crisp.

, Pour the prepared sauce into the pan. Toss it together with the vegetables until the vegetables seem thoroughly coated.

, Place the cooked chicken back in the pan. Toss it with the vegetables and the sauce, continuing until the sauce coats everything and the chicken has been heated through.


This step should only take another 1 or 2 minutes. As soon as everything is warm, remove the pan from the stove.

, Transfer the finished dish to a large serving platter. Garnish the chilli chicken with chopped green onion, and enjoy it while it's still hot.


Chilli chicken is conventionally served alongside fried rice, steamed rice, or plain Chinese-style egg noodles. You can serve the chicken dish directly on top of the side, but the chilli chicken and starch side are usually served in two separate bowls.

Freeze the breasts individually.,
Preheat the oven.,
Add breading.,
Bake the breasts.",How to Safely Cook Chicken from Frozen2," When you bring the chicken breasts home from the grocery store, place them in single layer in a freezer bag. Make sure that there is some space between the breasts. If they freeze together, it will be hard to separate them and you will likely have to thaw them.You can also freeze the breasts flat on a plate or tray and then transfer them to a freezer bag.
This is a good strategy for freezing any individual chicken parts.

, Preheat your oven to 425ºF (218ºC). While the oven warms, lightly oil a baking sheet. You can use olive oil, vegetable oil, or any other preferred cooking oil or fat. Then place four boneless skinless chicken breasts on the tray.If you are cooking frozen chicken breasts without breading, preheat the oven to 350ºF (177ºC).

, As the oven warms, mix 1/3-cup (113 g) dry breadcrumbs, ½-teaspoon (3 g) salt, ¼-teaspoon (1.5 g) of black pepper, ¼-teaspoon (1.5 g) garlic powder with one tablespoon (15 ml) of cooking oil. Spread about one teaspoon (5 ml) of mustard on the top of the frozen chicken breasts. Then sprinkle the breadcrumb mixture onto the breasts, making sure that the mix sticks to the mustard., Place the tray in the oven and cook the breasts for about 30 to 40 minutes. Insert a meat thermometer into the thickest part of the breast to make sure that it is cooked thoroughly. If the temperature is below 165°F (74°C) or if there is any red or pink meat, put the breasts back in the oven and let them cook until they are white and the juices run clear.If you are cooking four frozen 4-oz (28 g) chicken breasts without any breading, you should cook them at 350ºF (177ºC) for 30 to 45 minutes. However, it is important to remember that the cooking time depends on the size of the chicken breasts.

Season the legs before freezing.,
Preheat the oven.,
Cook the drumsticks.",How to Safely Cook Chicken from Frozen3," Because it is difficult to get seasoning to stick to frozen chicken skin, it may be easier to season your drumsticks before freezing them. Before you put them in the freezer, coat your drumsticks with your desired seasoning or rub. This will freeze the seasoning to the skin and make it easier to pull the legs from the freezer and toss them in the oven when you are ready to cook.This is a great way to season any individual pieces of chicken before you freeze them.

, Heat the oven to 350ºF (177ºC). While the oven warms, remove your drumsticks from the freezer and place them on a tray. For a side, you may also want to add some chopped vegetables like carrots and onions or a few sliced potatoes to the tray., Place the tray in the oven and cook the drumsticks for about 50 to 60 minutes. Once the time is up, insert a meat thermometer into the thickest part of the drumstick to make sure that it is cooked. If the temperature is below 165°F (74°C) or if there is any red or pink meat, put the breasts back in the oven and let them cook until they are white and the juices run clear.When you are taking the temperature of the drumsticks, try not to touch the bone with your thermometer. This will give you an inaccurate temperature.

Finely mince garlic and other fresh ingredients.,

Wash the chicken and pat it dry.,
Place the raw chicken and marinade in a food storage container.,
Refrigerate the chicken for at least four hours.,
Bake it in the oven.,
Cook it on the grill.,
Saute it on the stovetop.",How to Marinate Chicken," In order for the flavors of fresh ingredients like garlic, onion, peppers and ginger to be absorbed into the skin of the chicken, it's important to mince them as finely as possible. This way they'll coat the chicken entirely rather than flavoring just one area.






;
, Place all the marinade ingredients in a bowl and use a whisk to stir them together well. The oil should become mixed in with the other ingredients, rather than separating.









You can put the ingredients in a blender and pulse for a few seconds to make sure they are thoroughly combined.
Some cooks like to put the marinade ingredients in a jar and shake them up.

, The beauty of marinades is that many ingredients can be substituted for other ones. If you don't have one on hand, check your cabinet to see what you do have. Consider these convenient substitutions:

Substitute lemon juice for vinegar, or vice versa
Substitute any kind of oil for olive oil, or vice versa
Substitute honey or maple syrup for sugar, or vice versa

, The same marinades taste great with chicken breasts, thighs, legs, or wings. Marinate an entire chicken or choose to cut it into parts. You can also marinate either bone-in or boneless chicken.








, This removes any leftover flavor from the packaging the chicken came in and gets it ready to absorb the marinade.








, Find one that just fits the chicken, so when you pour the marinade over it, the liquid will cover most of the chicken parts. Put a lid on the container when you're finished.









You can use a food storage bag if you don't have glass or plastic containers.
Don't use a metal container; the chemicals in the metal can react with the marinade and change the flavor.

, During this time the flavors in the marinate will become one with the chicken. You can marinate a chicken for just four hours or leave it in the refrigerator overnight for maximum flavor.







, Marinated chicken tastes great when it's baked. Just preheat the oven to 400 degrees, place the chicken in a baking dish, cover it with aluminum foil, and bake until the internal temperature of the chicken reaches 160 degrees.









The amount of time you need to cook the chicken depends on how much chicken you have. It will usually be about 40 minutes for 1 pound of chicken pieces.
Pour the extra marinade over the chicken before baking for extra flavor.
When the chicken is almost finished cooking, remove the aluminum foil and put it back in the oven for a few minutes for a crispy exterior.

, Grilled marinated chicken is a treat, but it requires a little finesse to get it right. Heat the grill, then position the chicken pieces so they get indirect heat; otherwise, you may accidentally overcook them.








, Heat a large skillet with a little olive oil. When the pan is hot, place the chicken pieces in the skillet and put a lid on top. Cook the chicken slowly for about 1/2 an hour; the pieces are ready when they've reached an internal temperature of 160 degrees.

Remove the chicken from the lemon juice mixture and place it in the middle of the plastic wrap sheet.

, As you roll it, compress as much air out of the plastic wrap and chicken as possible. You want the plastic to be as tightly wrapped around the chicken as possible so that the chicken poaches properly., Roll the wrapped chicken along a flat surface (like a cutting board) just like you would roll a rolling pin. This will wrap the plastic evenly more tightly around the chicken., Repeat this wrapping process with the other chicken breast.

You may want to turn on your overhead vent/fan or crack a nearby window, since the curry paste becomes pungent as it heats up.Curry paste can be purchased at most general grocery stores, as well as specialty Asian grocery stores.
If you have a very low tolerance for spicy foods, you may want to use half of the suggested amount of curry paste rather than the entire thing.

, Stir the oil and paste mixture frequently. Continue to be cautious, as the oil may continue to pop and sputter as it fries. Allow the paste to fry in the oil for about two minutes., Open both cans of coconut milk. Use a spoon to scoop out the coconut milk solids and add them to the curry mixture. Leave the watery milk part in the cans for now., Stirring frequently, fry the solids in the oil and paste mixture. Continue frying until the oil starts to separate from the rest of the mixture, appearing as small oil beads on top of the curry paste. This should take approximately two minutes., Thaw your chicken and cut it into 1 inch (2.5 cm) pieces. Carefully add the chicken to the curry mixture; watch out for popping oil. Stir the contents of the pot well to fully combine the ingredients.

For a vegetarian version of the dish, omit the chicken and cuttlefish balls. You can serve with just zucchini, or fry pieces of tofu separately and add them to the sauce right before serving., Dump the watery coconut milk remains in both cans into the pot with the curry mixture. If you’re using cuttlefish balls, go ahead and add those too. Stir well to combine the ingredients., Reduce the heat to medium-low and allow the mixture to gently simmer for about 20 minutes, stirring occasionally. Use a knife to carefully slice through one of the chicken pieces to confirm it has cooked through completely. If it hasn’t, give it a few more minutes., Wash the zucchini and chop them into thick wedges that resemble half-moons. Once the chicken is done, add the zucchini to the pot. Stir gently. Allow the mixture to continue simmering for a few more minutes, until the zucchini pieces are tender., Tastes differ when it comes to fish sauce, soy sauce and sugar in curry sauces, so there’s no set amount to add. Most people aim for a balanced flavor, so add a little bit of each, then stir and taste the sauce. Continue to adjust the seasonings as needed until you’ve achieved the flavor you like., Curry is traditionally served with white rice, although you can certainly substitute with rice noodles, if you prefer. Combine the rice and water in a large pot and follow the package instructions for boiling until the rice is softened and cooked through., To add more veggies to the dish and create a satisfying crunch, quickly sear baby bok choy and red peppers together in a wok or skillet. Add them to the curry sauce right before you ladle the sauce over the bowls of rice., Portion out the cooked rice in bowls, then carefully ladle the hot curry sauce over each bowl. Most people choose to cover the rice completely with the sauce, but individual preferences can be addressed when it comes to amount of sauce used., Set the table with the bottles of soy and fish sauce so that individuals can customize the flavor as needed. If there are leftovers, put them in two separate airtight Tupperware containers – one for the rice and one for the sauce. Place them in the refrigerator. The leftovers will keep for about five days."

Enjoy.",How to Make Stuffed Chicken Breast," You'll need a relatively thick cut of meat, and regular boneless, skinless chicken breasts are usually sufficient. Avoid anything labeled tenders, filets, or thin-cut.You'll also need a sharp, smooth paring knife with a 3 to 4 inch (7.6 to 10 cm) blade. Avoid serrated knives since these won't be able to pierce through the side of the chicken without sawing it.;
, Place one chicken breast in the center of the cutting board, aligning it vertically. Hold it steady with your non-dominant hand.


Press gently. If you apply too much pressure, the knife might have difficulty sliding through the chicken.
Keep your fingers centered and slightly offset to your non-dominant side to keep them out of the way of the knife.

, Using your dominant hand, hold the knife at a perpendicular angle to the chicken breast. Slid it into the side of the chicken breast at the approximate midpoint.


If one side is thicker than the other, pierce the chicken closer to the thicker side.
The knife should be halfway between the top and bottom of the chicken breast.
Only slide the knife about two-thirds of the way through the side of the chicken. Do not cut through to the other side.

, Glide the knife up the side of the chicken, expanding the initial cut upwards. Remove the knife, insert it back into your starting position, and slice the same side open downward.


The entire time, keep the knife centered between the top and bottom of the chicken breast. Do not pierce through to the other side.
Note that the easiest way to stuff chicken breast is to cut this side completely so that it can open like a book—a culinary technique known as ""butterflying."" If you'd like to minimize the cut space along the side and keep more of the stuffing in the chicken, however, try the advanced pocket technique:

From your starting cut, carefully saw the tip of the knife up and toward the outside edge of the chicken breast without cutting back through the original side or expanding the opening.
Flip the knife around and repeat the same motion toward the bottom side of your original pocket. Again, you'll need to avoid expanding the opening.



, If you cut one side completely open, use your fingers to pry the chicken breast open like a book, continuing until it can lie with the ""spine"" flat on the cutting board.Depending on how deep the original cut runs, you may need to cut the opening a little wider using the knife before the chicken breast will lie flat enough.
If you used the pocket method instead of the butterflying technique, place your finger inside the pocket opening and work it into the inner cavity, breaking any loose fibers and expanding the opening as much as possible., The stuffing itself only consists of butter, garlic, salt, and parsley.


Grind the salt and minced garlic into a paste using a mortar and pestle or the back side of a spoon.
Mix the parsley into the garlic paste.
Work the softened butter into the paste, as well, mashing until the ingredients are thoroughly combined.
Wrap the entire mixture in plastic wrap and chill it for 15 minutes before using it to stuff the chicken.

,


You can opt to use marinara sauce to add another dimension of taste to this stuffing, but it isn't necessary; the cheese and pepperoni are flavorful enough.
If you do use the sauce, however, note that you should only spread a thin coating over the bottom of the open chicken breast to prevent the dish from getting too messy. Add the sauce first, followed by the solid ingredients.

,


Consider broiling the bell pepper before chopping it. Slice the bell pepper in half, remove the seeds and inner membranes, and broil it for 15 minutes, or until it becomes charred. Peel away the skin and finely chop the flesh.
Combine the chopped bell pepper with the feta cheese, olives, and basil. Use this mixed stuffing to fill the prepared chicken breasts.

,


Toss the chopped apple with lemon juice in a medium mixing bowl. This should help prevent the apples from browning prematurely.
Add the cheese, bread crumbs, and thyme to the coated apples, tossing until evenly mixed. This completes the mixed portion of the stuffing.
When stuffing the chicken breasts, spread the Dijon mustard over the open bottom first. Follow the mustard with the prepared mixed stuffing.

, Mixed stuffings should be spread evenly across the open chicken breast, while stuffings consisting of separate ingredients should be layered over the open chicken breast.


If there are any sauces or other spreadable items involved, spread them over the chicken breast first. Follow this with any cheese, meat, vegetables, fruits, and seasonings, in that order.
Note that if you used the pocket technique instead of the stuffing technique, you'll need to stuff all of the ingredients through the narrow opening you created in the side of the chicken.It can be difficult to layer ingredients through such a small opening, so that technique works best for mixed stuffings.

, Fold the open chicken back into its original form, sandwiching the stuffing in between the top and bottom halves.


Depending on how loose the ingredients are, you may need to use your fingers to hold them in place as you fold the chicken breast over. Don't be afraid to reposition the stuffing once the chicken is back in form, too.

, Stick two toothpicks through the top and bottom layers of the chicken breast. Position both near the open edge, and place one near the upper edge and the other near the bottom edge.If preferred, you could tie the chicken breast together using clean kitchen twine instead of using toothpicks.
Note that this is usually only necessary if you follow the butterfly technique. You probably won't need to do this if you used the pocket technique.

, Meanwhile, prepare a baking sheet by lining it with parchment paper or aluminum foil. Coating it with nonstick cooking spray would also work.


Note that it might be in your best interest to preheat the oven before you begin preparing the chicken and stuffing depending on how long it takes your oven to preheat.

, The simplest way to dress up the top of the chicken breast is to brush it with a little butter, which will help it brown, before sprinkling it with some salt and ground black pepper.Another option would be to coat the chicken breast in breadcrumbs.

Cook for 4-5 minutes on each side.",How to Make Quinoa Coated Chicken Fingers," Start with 1-2 pounds of boneless white meat chicken tenders, making sure to remove all visible fat and gristle. You can also use whole chicken breasts cut into thick slices. Place the strips on a clean plate and keep them separated from your other ingredients.2 pounds of chicken will produce enough fingers to feed about four people.
Tenderize the chicken strips by giving them a thorough pounding or soaking them in buttermilk for several hours.;
, Steam 2 cups of red or white quinoa in a rice cooker or on the stovetop. Allow the quinoa to cool to room temperature, or chill it in the refrigerator for half an hour while you prepare your other ingredients.You can also toast quinoa in the oven. This will eliminate excess moisture and make the grains more tender.Pulse the cooked quinoa in a food processor to give the breading a finer consistency.

, Spread the cooked quinoa out in a shallow pan or baking sheet. Shake in ½ cup of finely ground dried breadcrumbs. Stir the mixture together by hand until the breadcrumbs are evenly distributed throughout the quinoa.Try panko breadcrumbs for added texture and crunch.
Incorporate additional herbs and seasonings into your breading mixture, such as fresh parsley or parmesan cheese., Crack two whole large eggs into a medium-sized bowl and whisk them together. Sprinkle the chicken strips with kosher salt, pepper, garlic powder, paprika and any other seasonings of choice. Submerge each piece of chicken in the wash, then set them aside.Seasoning the chicken before you dunk it in the egg wash will ensure that the flavor gets locked inside rather than simply cooking off.

, Run each chicken strip through the quinoa and breadcrumbs, pressing the breading lightly against the outer surface with your fingertips. Turn the strips over on the other side and repeat. By the time you’re finished, the chicken should be entirely covered.For extra crispy chicken fingers, bread the strips twice.
If you’re having trouble getting the quinoa breading to stick, add a splash of whole fat milk or one egg white to help hold the dry ingredients together.

, Set the oven to convection heat. While it’s warming up, take a large baking sheet and grease it with cooking spray. You can also line the baking sheet with nonstick parchment paper if you prefer.Greasing the baking sheet may cause the chicken fingers to turn out slightly darker and crispier due to the direct heat of the cooking surface.
Parchment paper makes cleanup quick and easy, and may help the chicken cook more evenly.

, Lay the chicken strips out on the baking sheet in rows. Make sure to leave a little space between each. This will allow them to cook more evenly and keep them from sticking together. If you wish, you can brush the chicken strips with a little extra oil prior to baking.Baking is preferable to pan-frying if your goal is to prepare the maximum number of chicken fingers at one time.

, Place the baking sheet in the oven on the center rack. Set a timer for 15 minutes. As the chicken cooks, the breading mixture on the outside will begin to lightly brown, while the little bits of quinoa will create a delightful mottled color. Keep an eye on the chicken fingers as they bake to prevent them from getting too done.Every oven is different. Depending on the heat of your oven, the chicken fingers may not need the entire 15 minutes. Watch their progress closely and use your best judgment to determine when they’re done.

, Use a pair of metal tongs to flip the chicken over and expose the opposite side to the circulating heat. Once they’re done on the first side, they’ll most likely only need another 10-12 minutes to finish cooking. When they’re done, the meat inside should be solid white and juicy.Because of the thick breading, it may be hard to tell when the chicken fingers are ready to come out of the oven. Cut into the middle of a strip and take a look at the color of the meat to see how it’s coming along.
Let the chicken strips cool for a few minutes before digging in. This will be the hardest part!

, Cover the bottom of the skillet with about half an inch of oil. The skillet or pan you use should be spacious enough to prepare 3-5 chicken strips at a time. Avoid overlapping the strips, as too much friction can cause the breading to slough off.The type of oil you use is up to you, but it should be one with a high smoke point that’s well-suited for frying. Canola, peanut and sunflower are all good choices.There’s no need to change out the oil in the skillet between batches.

, Turn on the cooktop and let the oil heat up. Once it begins to bubble steadily, reduce the heat to a medium setting. Have a spare plate or serving dish on hand for fresh chicken coming out of the skillet.Frying the chicken strips with too intense a heat can quickly burn them.

, Carefully lower each piece of chicken into the hot oil. Use tongs or hold the strips by one end to avoid burning yourself accidentally.Cook especially large portions of chicken fingers in individual batches.
The oil may pop and splatter once it’s reached a proper cooking temperature—handle the skillet with caution. Consider wearing an oven mitt and long sleeves for protection.

, You’ll notice the edges of the strips beginning to brown when the first side is done. Flip the strips over (again, use an implement like tongs or a fork to stay out of scalding distance) and fry them for another 2-3 minutes, or to the desired doneness. Remove the strips from the heat and allow them to cool, then enjoy!Eyeball the strips individually to make sure they’ve had enough time to cook on each side.
Remove the chicken strips before they get too brown. The oil will continue cooking the outside for another minute or so after they’ve been taken out of the pan.
Serve quinoa-coated chicken fingers with your favorite dipping sauces, like pesto, chimichurri or homemade barbecue honey mustard."

",How to Make Skillet Chicken Pot Pie," Your choice of a skillet is extremely important when making your skillet chicken pot pie. Make sure not to use a skillet that is too small or too large. Start in the middle, and feel free to use larger or smaller skillets after you’ve perfected your pot pie.


Use an 8-inch skillet.
The skillet can be cast iron, stainless steel, or non-stick.
Make sure the skillet is free of rust or grime.;
, Spices and broth are critical elements of your pot pie as they’ll add flavor and moisture to it. Without the proper spices and broth, your pot pie won’t taste right.


You can use vegetable broth or chicken broth. If you use low-sodium broth, you’ll have to add more salt later.
Consider garlic, sage, thyme, pepper, and parsley. Spices can be fresh or dried -- whatever you prefer., Next to chicken, vegetables are the main substance of your pot pie. Without a variety of vegetables, your pot pie may lack flavor and be boring. Thus, make sure to add at least a few key vegetables. Consider:


Onion (1 small)
Carrots (2 medium).
Squash (1 or 2 small).
Celery (2 or 3 stalks).
Green peppers (1 medium)., Your chicken is one of the most important items for the chicken pot pie. The better the chicken, the tastier and better your pie will be. Make sure to include:


Breast meat. Feel free to use white or dark meat.
A half a pound to a pound, depending on how much chicken you want.
Buy it precut in quarter inch to half-inch cubes., The final thing you’ll need for your pot pie is a pastry puff or some other sort of pre-made pastry to lay over the vegetables, chicken, and broth.


Make sure you buy extra pastry material in case you run out. Try using 2 8-ounce pastry rolls.
Feel free to experiment with different types of pastry topping. If you prefer a seasoned or flavored topping, try it out. If you want a slightly sweet topping, use one., The first step in preparing your pot pie will be to cut your ingredients to your desired size. Ultimately, your ingredients should be cut so that they will cook easily and be easy to eat.


Cut your vegetables and chicken in quarter or half inch squares.
Slice your onions and garlic, if you use them, in small pieces.
Make sure to separate your ingredients into different bowls.

, The first step in cooking your pot pie is to cook the ingredients in your skillet on a stovetop. By doing this, you’ll be able to combine your ingredients together while they’re cooking. This will lessen the amount of time your pot pie will need to be in the oven, ensuring your crust won’t burn.


The burner should be on medium-high.
Put a tablespoon of oil in the skillet. Feel free to use olive oil or vegetable oil.

, When putting in your vegetables, you want to make sure to put them in deliberately and to time which ones you put in first. Make sure to:


Put your onions and green peppers in first. Allow them to cook for a minute or two before adding anything else.
Place your carrots and celery in next.
Drop the rest of the vegetables in.
Wait 2-4 minutes before adding anything else., There are a variety of spices and flavors you can add to your chicken pot pie to suit your personal taste. Feel free to experiment and customize as you see fit. Make sure to use your spices in proper proportions.


While you can be liberal with garlic, avoid more than 3 or 4 cloves.
Think about a tablespoon or two of sage.
Add maybe a half a tablespoon or a full tablespoon of thyme.
Put in a teaspoon of pepper. Consider more, if you like your pot pie peppery.
Add parsley to your taste.
Allow your vegetables to cook for two minutes before moving on., After adding your vegetables and spices, it’ll be time to pour broth in. The broth will add moisture and flavor to your pot pie, so make sure you add the appropriate amount for your pie.


Pour in half a cup of broth at a time.
Taste and then add an appropriate amount of salt.
Bring to a boil and then reduce heat to a simmer.
Add chicken after reducing heat.
Wait 8 to 10 minutes before moving on., The final step in making your pot pie is to take your pastry material and lay it completely over the top of the skillet. Take care when doing this, as the pastry top is the signature characteristic of the skillet chicken pot pie.


The pastry material will cover the filling and go over the edges of the skillet.
With a knife, cut 4 to 6 slits in the crust so that the pie will be able to vent heat., Preheating is essential, since you want to make sure the pie is cooked properly and evenly.


Consider preheating the oven while you are finishing preparations of the pot pie, for example, before you put the pastry top on your pot pie.
Set your oven to 375 degrees., After preheating, you need to carefully place your pot pie in the oven. Make sure not to displace the pastry top when putting it in the oven.


Put the skillet on the middle shelf of your oven. You want to make sure that it’s not too close to either the bottom or top heating elements.
Your pot pie should be in the oven for 15 to 20 minutes.
Set a timer for 20 minutes., Finally, you’ll be able to remove your pot pie from the oven. However, you need to make sure your pie has cooked properly, for the right amount of time, and at the proper temperature.


Verify that the temperature is still at 375 degrees.
Remove your pie once the pastry top is golden brown.
Allow your pie to sit and cool off for about 10 to 15 minutes after removing it from the oven., Serving your pot pie is also a relatively tricky endeavor, since there is no bottom crust to hold the pie together. As a result, you'll have to do a little extra work to provide a unique dining experience.


Cut the crust with a bread knife.
Use a pie server to remove the crust and place it on a small plate.
Take a large serving spoon to scoop out the pie filling and place it a large serving plate.
Relocate the pie crust from the small plate to on top of the pie filling.
Consider serving your pot pie with a fruit salad, sweet potatoes, or green vegetables like brussels sprouts, broccoli, or green beans.
Think about garnishing your pot pie with fresh parsley or rosemary.,"

Divide the chopped lettuce over each wrap and place some of the sliced chicken breast or chicken tenders on the lettuce.Keep in mind that if you use chicken tenders, you'll probably need about 2 pieces for each wrap.

, Finish filling the wraps by dividing 1/2 cup (130 g) of chunky salsa over each wrap. This will work out to be about 1/8 of a cup (around 33 g). You should also divide and scatter 1/2 cup (134 g) of sliced pimiento-stuffed olives on the wraps along with the sliced avocado.You can easily leave out or substitute other ingredients. For example, instead of avocado, you could use strips of red bell pepper or roasted red peppers.

, Fold one half of the wrap over the filling towards the other side. Tuck in the ends so the filling is contained and roll the wrap over itself towards the other side. Roll all four wraps and serve them whole or sliced in half.If you need to refrigerate the wraps, you can wrap them tightly in plastic wrap and keep them in the refrigerator for up to 4 hours.

Butterfly the chicken breasts.,
Pound the chicken breasts.,
Season the chicken.",How to Make Mushroom Chicken Marsala1," Chicken marsala is made with thin pieces of chicken that taste delicious breaded and lightly fried. Most chicken breasts are an inch or two thick, so it's necessary to butterfly them. To do this, lay a breast on a cutting board. Use a sharp knife to slice it in half lengthwise, stopping about 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) from the other side. Open the halves of the breast; as you can see, you now have a ""butterfly""-shaped piece of chicken that will cook much more quickly than a regular breast.









It's no big deal if you slice all the way to the other side, and end up with separated ""butterfly wings.""
If you have breasts that are already sliced thin, skip this step.;
, Place the chicken pieces on a cutting board. Lay a piece of plastic wrap over them. Use a mallet, a meat tenderizer or the bottom of a heavy glass to pound the pieces until they are each about 1/4-inch thick.








, Sprinkle salt and pepper over each piece of chicken. Turn the pieces over and sprinkle them on the other side. If you wish, add a pinch of cayenne pepper to spice things up a little.

, Pour oil into a cast iron skillet, dutch oven, or another heavy frying pan. Place the pan over medium high heat to heat the oil. Add a little more oil if necessary; it should rise up the sides of the pan by about 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm), but not enough to submerge the pieces of chicken.








, When the oil is hot, lay a few pieces of chicken into the pan. Let them fry on the first side for about 4 minutes, then use tongs to flip them over and fry them on the other side for another 4 minutes. The chicken should be cooked through and golden brown when you remove it from the pan to drain on a plate lined with paper towels. Continue frying the remaining pieces of chicken in this manner.

",How to Make Pan Sauce for Chicken," For a meal large enough for four, you’ll need 4 chicken breasts. Sprinkle as much salt and freshly ground black pepper as you’d like over both sides of the breasts so they’re nicely seasoned.Get creative by adding your favorite seasonings to the chicken breasts. A pinch of Italian seasoning adds some herb-infused flavor, while a little Cajun seasoning brings a little heat.;
, Throw a large skillet on the stove, and add a tablespoon (15 ml) of olive oil. Let the oil heat over medium-high heat until it shimmers, which should take about 5 minutes.You'll get the tastiest pan sauce with a stainless steel skillet.
You can swap butter for the olive oil if you like.

, Once the oil is nice and hot, toss the seasoned chicken breasts into the skillet. Let them cook for about 5 minutes, or until they’ve got a good sear on the outside., When the first side of the chicken breasts are done, flip them over. Let them cook for another 5 minutes on the other side, or until they’re just cooked through.If you’re unsure whether the chicken is fully cooked, an instant-read food thermometer comes in pretty handy. The breasts should hit an internal temperature of 165°F (74°C).

, After you’ve cooked the chicken through, take them out of the pan with a pair of tongs. Leave them on a plate that's off to the side until you’re finished making the sauce.Keep the chicken nice and warm by throwing some foil over it.

, After you've gotten the chicken out of the skillet, immediately dump a minced shallot inside. Cook it in the drippings from the meat over medium-high heat until it's golden brown and soft, which should take about 2 to 3 minutes.Keep the shallots from burning by giving them a good stir with a wooden spoon as they cook.
If there aren't enough pan drippings to make about a tablespoon (15 ml), add a little more olive oil to the skillet.
If you’re a fan of mushrooms, swap 1 cup (75 g) of thinly sliced mushrooms for the shallots. Or go for the best of both worlds with a combo of mushrooms and shallots.
Boost the sauce's flavor by mixing in your favorite herbs and spices, such as thyme, rosemary, and/or minced garlic.

, When you're done sauteing the shallots, add ¼ cup (59 ml) of white white to the skillet. Wait for the wine come to a simmer, and use your wooden spoon to scrape up the tasty brown bits from the bottom of the pan to help flavor the sauce.Not a fan of white wine? Red wine, beer, cider, or any flavorful liquor that you like works just as well. For example, bourbon makes for a rich, smoky tasting sauce.

, Keep the skillet on medium-high, so the wine mixture continues to simmer. Let it cook down for another 3 minutes, so you wind up with just half the liquid that you started with.You don't have to reduce the sauce by exactly half. Just get it as close as you can.
Check out how much the liquid’s reduced by tilting the pan to the side every so often. When it looks like about half of the liquid is gone, you’re all set.

, After you’ve cooked down the wine mixture, stir ¾ cup (177 ml) of chicken stock into the skillet. Bring the mixture to a rapid simmer and cook it until you only have ½ cup (119 ml) of liquid, which should take about 3 to 5 minutes.Don't have any chicken stock on hand? Use beef or vegetable stock instead.

, When you've only got about ½ cup (119 ml) of liquid in the skillet, add 2 tablespoons (28 g) of butter. Whisk it slowly into the mixture so the butter melts completely.You can swap a splash of cream for the butter if you prefer.

, Once the butter’s melted, add 1 ½ teaspoons (4 g) of cornstarch that’s been mixed with 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of chicken stock to the skillet. Whisk it in so it's fully blended, and let the sauce simmer for about a minute so it gets nice and thick.Whisking in the cornstarch mixture makes for a creamier, thicker sauce. If you like a thinner sauce, skip it.
Fix a sauce that's too thick by mixing in little more stock until you get it as thin as you want.

, When the sauce is finished cooking, add it to a measuring cup so it’s easier to pour. Give the sauce a taste, and add salt and pepper if necessary. Drizzle the sauce directly over the chicken breasts, or set it out on the table so everyone can add their own.Store any leftover sauce in an airtight container in the refrigerator. It’ll stay fresh for about 3 days.

Preheat the oil over medium-high heat until it reaches a temperature of 350 degrees Fahrenheit (180 degrees Celsius).You could also use a deep-fryer if you have one. Otherwise, nearly any heavy-bottomed pot should work.
Check the temperature of the oil with a cooking thermometer. It must remain between 350 and 375 degrees Fahrenheit (180 and 190 degrees Celsius) throughout the entire cooking process. Adjust the heat as needed to keep it within this range.;
, Place the flour and ground black pepper in a large resealable plastic bag. Seal the bag and shake to combine.


If you don't have a large enough bag, combine the flour and pepper in a large bowl. Mix well to spread the pepper throughout the flour.

, Place the chicken in the bag of seasoned flour, seal the bag, and shake well until the pieces are completely yet lightly coated.


It might be easiest to coat the chicken in batches. Work with one-quarter to one-third of the pieces at one time, and remove the previous batch before adding the next one.

, Place the coated chicken in the preheated oil and fry until they are cooked through and begin to float.


Fry the chicken wings in two or three batches to avoid over-crowding the pan. If you try to fry too many at once, the pieces may stick together and the temperature of the oil may drop too low.
Note that each batch will usually take 8 to 10 minutes.
The chicken wings should no longer be pink inside when finished, and the juices should run clear. If desired, you can also check for doneness with an instant-read meat thermometer. The thermometer should read 165 degrees Fahrenheit (74 degrees Celsius) once the chicken is ready., Transfer each piece of finished chicken into a shallow bowl filled with lemon juice. Toss gently to coat the chicken.


You do not need to drain the oil off the chicken before dunking it in lemon juice, but you should hold each piece above the oil for several seconds to allow some of the excess oil to drip off.

, Take the wings out of the lemon juice and transfer them to a serving plate. Season well with lemon pepper.

Spray the foil with nonstick cooking spray.Even if you use nonstick aluminum foil, you should still spray the foil with cooking spray to further reduce the risk of sticking.

, Place the chicken on the baking sheet and evenly coat the top side of each piece with cooking spray.Arrange the pieces skin-side up during this step. Make sure that they remain in a single layer and do not overlap.
The cooking spray should help the seasoning stick to the skin of the chicken. You could also brush the surface with a small amount of olive oil or canola oil to accomplish the same effect.

, Generously and evenly sprinkle the lemon pepper seasoning over the chicken wings. Use roughly half of the total desired amount.


If you do not have lemon pepper seasoning, make your own mixture by combining equal parts ground black pepper and dried lemon zest.

, Use tongs to turn the wings over to the uncoated side. Spray this side with cooking spray and sprinkle it with the remaining lemon pepper seasoning.


Note that the skin-side of the wings should now face down. Leave it that way for the time being.

, Place the baking sheet in the preheated oven and bake the chicken until done, turning the wings once halfway through the the cooking process.


Use tongs to flip the chicken pieces after approximately 15 minutes, then continue baking the chicken for another 20 minutes or until the skin turns brown and crispy.
If some of the lemon pepper seasoning stuck to the foil, you can add more upon flipping the pieces.
The finished wings should no longer be pink inside, and the juices should run clear. An instant-read meat thermometer should reach 165 degrees Fahrenheit (74 degrees Celsius) when inserted into the meat and away from the bone.

Mixing the brine in a resealable bag works best, but you can also prepare it in a large mixing bowl. Simply stir the ingredients together until the salt and sugar dissolve, then cover the bowl with plastic wrap while brining the chicken.

, Place the chicken in the brine and seal the bag. Let it sit in your refrigerator for 45 to 60 minutes.


Turn the bag after the first 30 minutes so that the brine evenly soaks into all sides of the chicken wings.

, After 60 minutes, remove the chicken from the brine. Rinse off the excess brine and dry each piece with clean paper towels.


Discard the leftover brine after removing the chicken.
You can grill the wings immediately after removing them or wait another hour. If you choose to wait, place the wings on a baking sheet lined with clean paper towels and return it to the refrigerator. Allow the chicken to dry and chill uncovered.

, Lightly coat the grate of a gas or charcoal grill with oil, then preheat it for cooking with indirect heat.For a charcoal grill: pile the coals on either side of the grill and place a foil drip pan in between the two mounds. Keep the grill grate above the coals and the pan.
For a gas grill: preheat the grill with all burners set on high heat, then turn the center burner off and adjust the temperature to 400 degrees Fahrenheit (200 degrees Celsius). Place a drip pan in the center, keeping it beneath the grill grate.

, Place the wings in a large mixing bowl and add the olive oil. Toss well to lightly and evenly coat the wings.


If excess oil remains in the bowl after you coat the wings, drain it before proceeding to the next step.

, Sprinkle in the lemon pepper seasoning. Toss the chicken wings to coat all sides.


Add the seasoning 1 Tbsp (15 ml) at a time, tossing well after each addition. Continue until the chicken pieces are coated to suit your own personal tastes.
If you don't have lemon pepper seasoning, you could prepare your own by combining equal parts dried lemon zest and ground black pepper.

, Place the chicken wings on center of the grill grate (the indirectly heated area). Grill, flipping as needed, until the skin is crispy and the chicken is done.You'll need to flip the wings with tongs every 15 minutes or so to evenly brown the skin.
The finished chicken pieces should reach an internal temperature of 165 degrees Fahrenheit (74 degrees Celsius). The juices should also run clear, and the inside should no longer be pink.

Set the temperature to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (177 degrees Celsius) and allow it to heat fully.Pay attention to the oven so you know when it’s reached the desired temperature. It should beep or flash an indicator light to alert you.;
, In shallow bowl, mix 3 tablespoons (23 g) all-purpose flour with ¼ teaspoon (1.25 g) of black pepper together. Next, take 4 boneless, skinless chicken breast halves (approximately 1 ½ pounds of 680 g) and roll them through the flour and pepper mixture. Press the chicken into the seasoned flour to ensure that it’s well coated. Set the remaining flour mixture aside for later use. The flour mixture will stick better to the chicken breasts if you dry them slightly between pieces of paper towel before dredging them.Make sure to shake off any excess flour from the chicken before browning them. An excess of coating on the chicken may cause them to burn.

, In a large skillet, heat 2 tablespoons (30 ml) vegetable oil over medium-high heat.Add the chicken breasts to the pan, and cook until they are browned. That typically takes 3 to 4 minutes for each side.Make sure that the skillet you use is large enough to fit all of the chicken breasts in a single layer. If you crowd the chicken into the pan, it won’t cook evenly.
You don’t have to worry about the chicken breasts being cooked all the way through because they will finish cooking in the oven.

, Once the chicken breasts are browned, remove them from the skillet and place them in a single layer in a 9-inch (23-cm) square baking dish. Don’t grease the dish because the other ingredients will prevent the chicken from sticking during baking.Use tongs to transfer the chicken breasts from the skillet to the baking dish. That will keep you from burning yourself.

, In a medium saucepan, melt 1 tablespoon (14 g) butter over medium-high heat. Add 1 medium onion that’s been chopped to the pan, and cook for approximately 5 to 7 minutes or until the onions are tender.Stir the onions frequently with a wooden spoon or heat-safe spatula to ensure that they cook evenly.

, When the onion is tender, mix the remaining flour mixture left over from dredging the chicken into the pan. Stir the ingredients together until a thick paste forms., After the flour mixture is fully incorporated with the onions and butter, start to add the rest of the seasonings. Slowly pour 1 cup (237 ml) chicken broth and 3 tablespoons (44 ml) lemon juice into the pan. Next, sprinkle 2 teaspoons (5 g) dried basil and ½ teaspoon (2.5 g) dried thyme over the mixture. Mix well so all of the ingredients are fully combined.Take care when you’re pouring the chicken broth and lemon juice into the hot pan so you don’t get any splashback that might burn you.

, When all of the ingredients are well blended, bring the lemon mixture to a boil over high heat. Allow the ingredients to cook for approximately 2 minutes or until the mixture thickens and starts to bubble.Make sure to stir the sauce constantly so it cooks evenly and doesn’t stick to the bottom of the pan.

, Once the sauce is done, pour it over the chicken breasts in the baking dish. You may want to use a spoon to ensure that all of the chicken is evenly covered. Next, place a lemon slice on each breast and sprinkle 2 tablespoons (30 g) minced fresh parsley over the chicken as well.If you don’t have any minced fresh parsley on hand, you can substitute 1 tablespoon (15 g) dried parsley flakes.

, After the chicken breast halves are arranged in the dish with the sauce, lemon slices, and parsley, cover the dish with a lid and place it in the preheated oven. Allow it to bake for approximately 25 to 30 minutes or until the juices from the chicken run clear.If you don’t have a lid for your baking dish, you can cover it with a piece of foil.

, Once you remove the lemon chicken from the oven, it’s important to let it rest so the juices have time to settle. Give the chicken about 10 minutes to rest before you serve it.Make sure to spoon some of the lemon sauce over the chicken breast halves when you place them on plates for serving.

",How to Make Jamaican Curry Chicken," Take 4 pounds (1.8 kg) of skinless chicken and carefully cut it into small pieces. The pieces should be the size you'd like to serve. For example, you might want to just cut a thigh in half while cutting a breast into 3 or 4 pieces, depending on the size of your chicken.You can use boneless chicken which will make it easier to cut or you can use bone-in chicken for richer flavor.;
, Place your chicken pieces in a large bowl. Sprinkle the chicken with 2 teaspoons of salt, 1 teaspoon of ground black pepper, 3 tablespoons of the curry powder, and 4 cloves of minced garlic. Use your hands or a spoon to stir the chicken so that all the pieces are completely coated with the seasoning. Refrigerate the chicken for 1 hour.You can mince the garlic with a sharp knife or use a garlic press.
You can use any kind of curry powder you like, although Jamaican curry powder works great in this recipe.

, Carefully chop 1/4 of a small red bell pepper and 1/4 of a small green bell pepper into fine pieces. You should also chop 1 large onion. Heat 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add 1 teaspoon of cumin seeds to the pot and saute them for 30 seconds. Add your chopped vegetables., Continue sauteeing the vegetables over medium-high heat and add 1 teaspoon of dried thyme or 1 sprig of fresh thyme, 1 teaspoons of salt, 3 tablespoons of curry powder, 1 tablespoon of ketchup, and 1 tablespoon of West Indian hot pepper sauce. Saute the vegetables until they're tender, about 6 to 8 minutes.If you don't want your Jamaican curry chicken to be too spicy, you can leave out the West Indian hot pepper sauce.

, Carefully measure out 1 cup (235 ml) of boiling water and add it to the pot with your sauteed vegetables. The water should quickly come to a boil. Add your refrigerated chicken pieces to the pot and stir the mixture. Add the remaining 2 cups (470 ml) of boiling water and let it come back to a boil.The sauce should coat and almost completely cover the chicken. This will help to keep it moist as the chicken cooks.

, Turn the heat down to medium and add 2 medium potatoes that you've cut into 6 pieces each. Cover the pot with a lid and let the Jamaican curry chicken simmer for about 30 minutes. The chicken should be tender and the sauce will thicken up when it's ready to serve.The curry should be lightly bubbling as it simmers. Avoid a rolling boil since this could cook the chicken too quickly and make it tough.

, Prepare the Jamaican curry chicken by seasoning and sauteeing the chicken and vegetables. Instead of simmering the curry on the stove, transfer the curry to a slow cooker. Cover the slow cooker with the lid and turn it on to low. Let it cook for 45 minutes to an hour.If you want your vegetables firmer, consider keeping them separate from the curry when you're sauteeing. Then you can add them to the slow cooker to cook.

, If you find that the Jamaican curry chicken is too spicy for your liking, try stirring in about 1/2 cup of shaken coconut milk. Taste the curry again and add more coconut milk as you need to make it creamier and less spicy.


You can use full-fat coconut milk or lite coconut milk (which is a little runnier).

, You can serve the Jamaican curry chicken with steamed white rice or with traditional Jamaican rice with peas. Jamaican rice and peas are made with rice, coconut milk, kidney beans, and seasonings.


You can make the Jamaican rice and peas using canned kidney beans or you can soak dry beans overnight to use in the recipe.

, You can also round out a meal of Jamaican curry chicken by serving it with a green salad and flatbread like roti. You could also serve steamed vegetables or mashed potatoes on the side.


You could also serve the Jamaican curry chicken with rice noodles.

, When it is completely liquid, mix in the honey, pineapple juice, mustard, salt, and curry powder. Stir well to combine. The heat should cause the honey to thin.


Handle the hot melted butter with care. Be sure to use a microwave-safe container, like one made from glass or ceramic.

, Make sure there's about an inch of space separating each piece so that they can cook evenly. Spoon the sauce over the pieces of chicken, giving each a thick coat.


For a quicker cleanup, you can try laying a piece of foil over your cooking sheet and using a cooking spray or a light brushing of oil to prevent sticking.

, After 30 minutes of cook time, carefully remove the tray from the oven and turn the pieces over. Put the tray back in and start checking on the chicken for done-ness about every ten minutes or so.


Your chicken is done when the thickest part of the meat is soft and white all the way through and the juices run clear. Ideally, the outside of the chicken should have a pleasant golden-brown shade at this point.
The FDA recommends an internal temperature of about 165 degrees F (about 74 degrees C).A food thermometer can help here.

, When the chicken is done, remove it from the oven. Don't cut into it just yet — let it sit for about five to ten minutes so it can cool. After this, simply serve with your favorite side and enjoy!


Letting meat sit briefly after cooking can also improve its texture. During this resting period, moisture displaced by the cooking process is gradually re-absorbed by the muscle fibers in the meat, giving you a more tender, juicy bite. This is why cutting into meat as soon as it comes out of the oven will cause lots of juice to run out but cutting into it after 10 minutes or so will produce much less juice., This chicken dish is inspired by the flavorful cuisine of India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and the rest of South Asia. Try it with some delicious sides from the region, like the following:

Pair this dish with your Southern favorite.",How to Make Honey Chicken2," While you're waiting for it to warm up, grease a foil-lined roasting pan with cooking spray or a small amount of oil.

, In a bowl, mix flour, cinnamon, turmeric, and nutmeg. Sprinkle generously with salt and pepper as you wish.

, If you intend to eat your chicken with no skin, remove it before the dredging process in the next step. Leaving the skin on increases the fat and calorie content of the meat, but it can taste great — the choice is up to you.To remove the skin, simply pry it away from the meat with the tip of a knife and peel it away. Use the knife to cut the skin away at the base.

, Take each piece of chicken and roll it in the flour mixture, coating both sides well. Transfer each coated piece to a new plate. If you run out of the mixture, make additional batches as needed.

, Once all the chicken pieces are dredged in flower, beat the egg with milk in a small bowl. Pour your breadcrumbs into a separate bowl. Now, take each piece of chicken, dip it in the egg wash, and roll it in the bread crumbs, giving each a thick coat.


You can use Panko or the breadcrumbs of your choice. Pick a breadcrumb style with a texture that appeals to you. You can even make your own if you have the time.

, Place the chicken pieces skin side-up (if you left the skins on) in the greased baking pan. Leave an inch or two of space between the pieces so they cook all over.


To help the chicken get a crispy exterior, you can spray them with a light coat of cooking spray or brush their tops with oil.

, After about 30 minutes, you can check on the chicken for done-ness. You're looking for a crisp, golden brown exterior and meat that's soft and white all the way through. The juices should run clear. As noted above, chicken is typically done at an internal temperature of 165 F.

, Melt butter in a small bowl, then mix in honey, cinnamon, and lemon juice. Give your chicken a delicious honey-cinnamon exterior by applying it to each piece with a brush or paper towel after about 25 minutes. Brush lightly to give the chicken a thin coat — you want the meat sweet but crisp, not dripping with sauce.

, When the chicken is done, remove it from the oven and transfer to a clean platter. Let the pieces sit for about five to ten minutes, then serve.

, Crisp fried chicken is a Southern delicacy. It goes well with almost anything, but a few sides that you may want to specially consider are:

The original recipe recommends using two layers of foil — the sauce used for the chicken can be hard to get off of the pan if it bakes in., Mix together honey, both kinds of oil, soy sauce, garlic, ginger, and pepper in a small bowl. Stir well to combine.

, You can put the thighs on the foil-lined pan and pour the sauce over them or pour the sauce into a sturdy plastic bag with the chicken and turn the bag to coat. Either way, make sure the chicken gets an even coating of sauce before arranging the pieces in the pan.


Once the pieces are well-coated, arrange them in the pan with an inch or two of space between each piece. Pour the extra sauce over the chicken.

, Check on the chicken after about 20 minutes or so. If it appears to be quite black already, cover the meat with another layer of tin foil and return it to the oven. This should help keep it moist and slow the searing process that blackens the chicken's surface.

, When the chicken is done all the way through, remove it from the oven and let it sit for five to ten minutes. Serve and enjoy!


If you wish, you can save the leftover liquid from the cooking pan and use it as a sauce for your meal. This is an especially good choice if you are eating your chicken with rice or another neutral side dish.

, The soy flavor used in this dish is surprisingly versatile, so you can pair it with a lot of different flavors. Here are just a few ideas from Asian cuisine that might naturally accompany it well:

Add the onion and garlic, and sauté until the onions begin to get translucent and start turning brown. This should take 1-2 minutes.Instead of an onions, you can also use a shallot.
Try peeling and grating the onion instead of chopping it.The onion will cook faster this way.At this stage, you can add 1/2-3/4 cup of wine to your sauce if you want. If you add the wine, allow it to bubble until the color turns dark and the sauce is reduced by half.;
, Add the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, oregano, basil, salt, and pepper to the pan. Stir together and bring to a boil.


Other herbs you can add to your sauce are parsley and a bay leaf. You can also add red pepper flakes for a bit of heat.You might also want to add a pinch of sugar to the sauce. This can counteract some of the acidity in the sauce.

, When the sauce begins to boil, reduce the heat and let it simmer for about 25 minutes, stirring occasionally.The sauce is done when it has thickened and is no longer watery.


One variation of the sauce is to stir in some grated Parmesan cheese during the last 10 minutes the sauce is cooking.

, If you are pressed for time or don't want to bother with a homemade sauce, just use pasta sauce from a jar.

, Before you beginning preparing your chicken, preheat your oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit.

, Slice the chicken breasts in half. Do this along the fat, rounded sides to butterfly them open. Then, place them in a plastic bag and pound them to an even thickness. The chicken breasts should be very thin, around 1/8""-1/2"" thickness.Pounding the chicken helps to tenderize the chicken. It also evens out the chicken so the thick and thinner spots don't fry differently.The plastic bag protects the room from the chicken just in case any raw chicken parts go flying as you pound it.

, In the first large bowl, place the flour. In another bowl, place the egg. Beat the egg after placing it in the bowl, and season with a little salt and pepper. In the third bowl, combine panko, rosemary, thyme, parsley, and cheese.


Panko crumbs are Japanese bread crumbs.
Instead of Parmigiano-Reggiano, you can use Parmesan cheese, mozzarella cheese, or an Italian blend.

, Start by placing the chicken in the first bowl to coat with flour. Remove and shake off the excess. Then, place the chicken in the second bowl and coat with egg. Let the excess drain off. Then coat the chicken evenly with the breadcrumb mixture in the third bowl.An alternate way to cook the chicken is just to coat it in flour instead of the egg and breadcrumbs.For a lighter, healthier version, use egg substitute instead of eggs.Another lighter, healthier alternative is to sprinkle an extremely light coating of flour on the chicken before adding the egg and breadcrumbs.

, In a large frying pan, heat the oil on medium to medium-high heat. Drop the chicken into the pan and cook on each side until the chicken is golden brown. It should take about 3-5 minutes. Make sure not to crowd the chicken in the pan when placing multiple cutlets in it.Reduce the heat if the crumbs are burning.
For a healthier version, bake the chicken instead of frying. To do this, place the chicken on a wire rack or on a cooking dish coating with cooking spray. Bake at 375 degrees. If you are baking with a wire rack, cook for 20-25 minutes. If you are baking in the baking dish, turn the chicken over after 10 minutes, cooking it for a total of 20 minutes.Another healthy alternate is to skip the breading process completely. Instead, you can marinate the chicken in olive oil and garlic, then place directly into a baking dish before adding the sauce.

, Pour your tomato sauce into a 9x13 baking pan. After the chicken has browned, place it on top of the sauce. Spoon sauce over each piece of chicken, then sprinkle with basil.Top with Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese.


Instead of Parmigiano-Reggiano, you can use Parmesan cheese, mozzarella cheese, or an Italian blend.

, Place the baking dish in the oven and bake until the sauce is bubbling and the cheese has melted and turned a golden brown color on top.This should take about 5-7 minutes.


If you are choosing the healthy alternative and baking the chicken in the sauce, bake for about 20-25 minutes. Check the chicken to see if it is cooked. If it is still raw in places, cook for longer. Place the cheese on top of the sauce about 5-7 minutes before you are ready to take the chicken out.

, Remove the chicken parmigiana from the oven. Serve a cutlet with additional sauce over a bed of whatever pasta you prefer. You can use spaghetti, angel hair, or even rotini.

Crack the egg into a shallow bowl with a pinch of water and beat well.,
Fill another shallow bowl with flour and one more with breadcrumbs and cheese.,
Using tongs, dip the chicken in the egg mixture, letting any extra run off.,
Drop the chicken in the flour, turning to coat.,
Press the floured chicken into the breadcrumbs, coating both sides in crunchy crumbs.,
Put enough olive oil in a large skillet to lightly cover the bottom.,
Cook the chicken on the hot stove for a few minutes on each side, until golden brown.",How to Make Chicken Parmesan1," You only need a bit, enough to keep the chicken from sticking. A pat of butter or non-stick cooking spray could also work, though the Italian flavor of olive oil makes it popular.
, In order to ensure it is all cooked well, most cooks aim for pieces around 1







, Imagine you're prepping scrambled eggs and turn the egg(s) into one consistent, yellow liquid.








, The chicken needs to be coated in all three ingredients -- egg, flour, and breadcrumbs. These shallow dishes make it easy to flip the chicken into each dish, getting everything well-coated without a ton of mess.


If you want a special seasoning (adding spice, a touch of oregano, etc,) add it to the flour and stir it in evenly. You could also use flavored breadcrumbs.
Keep an extra egg, flour, and breadcrumbs nearby if you run out-- all you have to do is add a little more., You don't want the chicken to be soaking wet, just a coated. This mixture will hold the flour down and ""cook"" it into a delicious breaded coating.








, It can help to keep using the tongs, but don't leave big clumps of flour on the chicken. You simply want it to be dusted with flour in a nice, even coating., This sometimes takes lightly pressing the breast down into the crumbs, though this isn't strictly necessary if it sticks on its own. Set aside and repeat this whole process with rest of the breasts, coating in egg, flour, and then crumbs.









Remember to mix the Parmesan and breadcrumbs beforehand to ensure they are well-mixed.
While any breadcrumbs will work, many chefs love the extra crunchy ""panko"" style., Heat to medium-high heat, just as the oil starts smoking, You want to cook the outsides of the chicken quickly, browning them, while allowing the rest of the dish to finish in the oven.

, Wait 1-2 minutes, and flip them. They should be a nice golden-brown. Remember that they will finish cooking in the oven -- if the outside looks delicious and appetizing, it is good to go!









This chicken is not yet fully cooked! Do not eat it until it has been finished."
"
Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil on the stove over medium heat.,
Add the whole chopped onion, a teaspoon of salt, and stir.,
Add 2-3 finely chopped cloves of garlic as the onion is cooking.,
Optionally, add 1 cup of red wine to the pan and stir, cooking until most of the liquid is gone.,
Once the onions have softened, add one 28-ounce cans of plum tomatoes, with juices, and stir.,
Add in salt, pepper, and any desired spices, like a bunch of fresh basil.,
Bring briefly to a boil, then simmer until thickened and ready to eat.",How to Make Chicken Parmesan2," Use a large saucepan, preferably with a heavy, thick bottom. Heat the oil up until it is just starting to release a little bit of ""smoke"" from the surface.









The next steps add chopped onion and garlic, which should be cut ahead of time.

, The onions will need to cook for 3-4 minutes, until soft and translucent. Adding salt as the onions hit the pan unlocks their sweet-savory flavor-- salt added with heat tends to draw out moisture and provide a more richly cooked ingredient than only adding salt at the end.







, Try to do this quickly, after the onion has only been cooking for 1-2 minutes. The garlic, which is much smaller than the onion pieces, is at risk of burning if you leave it in as long as the onions.








, This should only take a few minutes, and all of the alcohol should burn off. Use your spoon to scrape up any bits that cooked to the pan, as the wine will loosen them up. This wine will add a welcome depth and complexity to your dish, but is not strictly necessary. You could, instead, add a cup of stock, broth, or just a 1/2 cup of water, using this to loosen the burned bits and then moving on.

, Use a food processor or blender first to turn the tomatoes into a smooth, consistent liquid if desired. You can use pre-diced tomatoes, too, or a mixture of canned tomatoes, 1 can tomato puree, and 1 cup warm water if needed. If you want a super smooth and silky sauce, wait to do the blending until later, just adding the whole tomatoes now and letting them cook.









Want to use fresh tomato? You'll need to blanch and peel your tomatoes in advance. To do so, put 7-10 Roma tomatoes in boiling water for 1 minute, then immediately dunk them in ice water. Use your fingers to pull the loosened skins off, squeeze out the seeds with a strainer (saving the liquid) then cook., Taste the sauce frequently as it cooks, making small seasoning adjustments here and there instead of trying to do it all in one big batch. Some common spices to add include:









Bay leave
Oregano
Black and crushed red pepper
Parsley , Use high heat to get the whole mixture to boil, then drop it all down to low so that there are just a few heat bubbles breaking the surface. Let it keep cooking, stirring, testing, and seasoning regularly, until it reaches your desired consistency and is ready to serve.









If the sauce gets too thick, add a ladle-full of pasta water (if cooking pasta with the dish) to the pan and stir in. The starchy water will help it bind the sauce the pasta while thinning it out without much flavor loss.A touch of water, water + tomato paste, or chicken/vegetable broth can also help thin out a sauce if it cooks for too long."
"
Place the cooked breasts in your baking dish and cover gently with sauce.,
Coat liberally with mozzarella cheese.,
Cook, uncovered, until the cheese is brown and bubbly.,
While the chicken finishes, cook and drain 1 lb of spaghetti, drizzling with a little butter and olive oil when done.,
Serve the chicken on top of a bed of pasta with a spoonful of fresh sauce.",How to Make Chicken Parmesan3," Use a ladle to pour over the tops of your chicken, putting generous dollops on every breast. This sauce will keep the chicken moist and flavorful as it cooks.







, You can use shredded, or you can cut rounds off of a log of fresh cheese. Be generous, and be sure to put as much as you can on top of the chicken so that it melts on top.








, A thermometer inserted into the chicken needs to read 165 degrees F to ensure that the meat is fully cooked. If the cheese is burning, but the meat still isn't done, cover it all with aluminum foil and cook for another 2-3 minutes. The foil should protect the cheese from any scalding direct heat., Save about a 1/2 cup of the pasta water before draining it out. Be sure to add the butter and olive oil when done -- the mixture of oils helps the sauce stick to the pasta. Furthermore, the starchy pasta water helps the sauce bond to the starchy pasta as well, so be sure to save this extra moisture., The chicken, baked into it's gooey, cheese, tomato-y pan, could use a fresh dash of your warm sauce, perfectly melding it with your pasta. Don't forget a dash of freshly grated Parmesan for a decadent final dish.

Toss well so the chicken is coated, cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and refrigerate overnight.Be sure to wash the chicken thoroughly and pat dry before combining with the salt and pepper.
If you don’t want to use a whole chicken, you can substitute 3 lbs of chicken wings or chicken tenders instead.;
, In a medium size bowl, mix together 2 large eggs, 1 cup (237 ml) of buttermilk or whole milk, and 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of a vinegar-based hot sauce until well blended. In a separate medium size bowl, whisk 2 cups (250 g) of all-purpose flour together with 2 teaspoons (8 g) of sea salt until they’re well mixed.You can use either buttermilk or whole milk in the recipe, but keep in mind that the buttermilk will provide a tangier flavor.
Tabasco is a common vinegar-based hot sauce that you can find at most grocery stores.

, Take the chicken pieces out of the refrigerator, and press them into the flour mixture to coat both sides. Next, dip them in the milk mixture so all of the chicken is covered.Shake the chicken pieces after you dredge them to get rid of any excess flour.
Be sure to allow the excess milk mixture to drip back into the bowl when you’re coating the chicken pieces., Once you’ve dipped the chicken in the milk mixture, place them back in the flour mixture to again coat both sides. Shake off any excess, and place the chicken on a large plate or baking sheet.http:

, Fill a 6 quart (5.7 L) saucepan with 2-inches (5 cm) of vegetable oil, and heat it over medium high heat. Use a deep fry thermometer so you know when the oil has reached 325 degrees Fahrenheit (163 degrees Celsius).If you don’t have a large enough saucepan, you can use a Dutch oven for frying the chicken.

, When the oil reaches the right temperature, place the chicken in the pan in batches, making sure not to crowd the pan. Allow the pieces to fry until crispy and golden brown, turning them over once.If you quartered your chicken before frying, the breast pieces should take approximately 15 to 17 minutes to fry, while the leg pieces should take about 18 to 20 minutes.
If you cut the chicken into 8 pieces, they should take approximately 7 to 10 minutes to fry.
If you’re using wings or chicken tender, you may only need to fry them for 5 to 7 minutes.
To ensure that the chicken is cooked through, have an instant-read thermometer on hand. Test the thickest part of each piece and make sure that the internal temperature is at least 160 degrees Fahrenheit (71 degrees Celsius) for white meat and 165 degrees Fahrenheit (74 degrees Celsius) for dark meat.

, When the chicken pieces have finished frying, remove them from the oil with tongs. Place them on a wire rack that’s set across the top of a rimmed baking sheet so the excess oil can drain away.When you’ve finished frying all of the chicken, turn the heat on the pan off and allow the oil to cool slightly so it’s ready for the next step., Use a ladle to carefully add ½ cup (118 ml) of the frying oil to a medium size heatproof bowl. Stir in 3 tablespoons (16 g) of cayenne pepper, 1 tablespoon (12.5 g) of packed light brown sugar, 1 teaspoon (3 g) of chili powder, ¾ teaspoon (3 g) of sea salt, 1 teaspoon (2 g) of black pepper, ½ teaspoon (1.5 g) of garlic powder, and ½ teaspoon (1 g) of paprika, and mix until well blended.Hot oil can burn the skin easily, so take care when you’re pouring it into your bowl to mix with the seasonings.
If you don’t want the chicken to be too hot and spicy, you can reduce the cayenne pepper to 1 or 2 tablespoons (5.3 to 10.6 g).

, While the chicken and the spicy mixture are both still warm, use a pastry brush to coat the chicken pieces on both sides with the oil mixture. If you don’t have a brush, you can use a spoon to carefully pour it over the chicken., The hot and spicy chicken should be served warm, so as soon as it’s coated with the oil mixture, plate it up. Depending on the size of the chicken, place one or two pieces on a white sandwich bread and garnish with sliced pickles."

You can also use a mortar and pestle to make a garlic-ginger paste, grinding the two together until smooth. This is a slightly more traditional take on the dish.;
, While this step is small, don't skip it. Meats can't brown until all the moisture is gone, so rinsing and patting dry will always lead to a tastier dish. Cut the breast into roughly 1-2"" pieces and set aside. Try and keep them all the same general size.

, The most common options for western cooks are Serranos and jalapenos. Slice them lengthwise, remove the seeds, and then chop into small pieces.


The seeds are the spiciest part of the peppers -- adding them will give the dish a serious kick.
Wash your hands with soap and water after handling green peppers, especially before touching your eyes.

, You want high sides to contain the liquids and ensure the chicken heats up evenly. If you have one, your best bet will be a ""kadai,"" which is a Pakistani/Northern Indian wok perfect for chicken karahi., When the wonderful aroma of the two ingredients fills your kitchen you're ready to move on. Make sure your other ingredients, as listed above, are ready so you don't burn your garlic-ginger combination.

, All you're doing right now is browning the outside of the chicken, bringing out the bird's richest flavor. Note that this all happens very quickly -- you need to keep moving to keep the garlic and ginger from burning., Many spices need a little heat to release their best flavor, which is called ""toasting."" This step is common in many Indian and Pakistani dishes, but be careful -- you only need 10-20 seconds before the spices start to burn.


If you're nervous about burning the spices, simply add them with the tomatoes in the next step., You want the chicken to be about halfway covered up with the liquid so that the simmering sauce cooks the chicken completely through. If you need a little more liquid in the sauce, add a pinch of water or cream. If using garam masala and fenugreek, add them now.A simmer means there are some bubbles lightly breaking the surface, but the whole pot isn't bubbling like it is boiling.
Stir the pot 2-3 times as it cooks, but otherwise leave it covered to finish cooking and preserve moisture.

, If you added extra cream or water this could take 10 minutes, but the total thickening time is up to you. If you like a thicker curry, leave it on for longer. If you want something a little more soup-like, take it off after 4-5 minutes.

, The dish is frequently served with a grain of some sort, but it can be eaten straight as well. For the best dish, try your chicken Karahi with:


Naan
Roti
Chappati

Rice"
"
Add a diced onion before the garlic and ginger, cooking for 2-3 minutes, for a Northern Indian version.,
Chop a green bell pepper into 1/2"" cubes and add with the tomatoes.,
Puree the tomatoes in a blender if you don't want any chunks.,
Add 1/2 cup cream or cashew milk for a richer, slightly less spicy sauce.,
Substitute lamb or beef for chicken to get an entirely new dish without a new recipe.,
Finished.

",How to Make Chicken Karahi2," The onion brings a savory sweetness to the dish. Simply cook the onion in the hot oil until it is translucent. This means it is more or less see-through.

, This is a continuation of the Northern Indian variation of the dish. Add the green pepper with the tomatoes so they cook in the liquid but still have some crunch., This step isn't necessary, but some people prefer a completely smooth sauce for their chicken karahi. If so, get blending, but know that the step isn't entirely necessary.


For a perfectly smooth sauce, which some restaurants insist on, you can remove the chicken right as the sauce finishes up. Put all of the liquid in a blender and blend until you have a perfectly smooth sauce, then add the chicken back in and serve.

, This leads to a creamier, slightly less intense dish. Some recipes require a form of cream, but this is likely a later ingredient brought in by Indian and Western cooks, as it resembles tikka masala. Add the cream with the tomatoes, stirring the liquids together until smooth and blended, then cook like normal.


For a slightly tangy taste, you could also use a 1/2 cup of plain yogurt., As long as you cut it into bite-sized, quick-cooking pieces you'll be perfect. Cook it just like you would normally cook the chicken.

Serve.",How to Make Chicken Curry1," This recipe for chicken curry serves 4 people. Here's everything you need to make tasty chicken curry:


1 kg whole chicken (cut into 12-16 pieces)
3 large onions (chopped)
3 medium tomatoes (chopped)
4-5 tbsp tomato puree
2 tsp coriander powder
1 tsp turmeric powder
1 tsp garam masala powder
2 cloves
1 bay leaf
1 inch (2.5 cm) cinnamon
1 black cardamom
1 tsp cumin seeds
1 tbsp ginger (chopped finely)
1 tbsp garlic (chopped finely)
1 green chili
1 cup water
Salt to taste
2 tbsp fresh coriander, chopped
1/2 tsp red chili powder (to taste)
3-4 tbsp oil
;
, You can use vegetable oil or olive oil, though ghee will give your curry chicken the most authentic Indian flavor. Here's what you should do:


As soon as these spices begin to crackle, you can add the cumin seeds, wait about five seconds, and then add the diced onion.
Turn the heat down to medium and sauté the onions until they're soft and translucent, which should take about 2-3 minutes.
After that, add the ginger and the garlic.
Then, turn the heat up to medium-high and continue sautéing the onions until they are light brown.
Continue stirring the ingredients to combine the flavors.


, Let the turmeric and coriander blend in with the other spices for a minute and then add the chicken pieces, just a few at a time, until they fill the pan. If you add too many pieces of chicken at once, then it'll make the oil in the pan spurt up, so be careful. As you add the chicken, keep stirring the ingredients and flipping over the chicken so that it is sealed and evenly cooked and coated in the onions.

, Here's what you should do next:


Add a cup of hot water.
Cover and cook till the chicken is almost done.
Add the garam masala and about half of the chopped coriander (you'll need the other half for the garnish).
Add little hot water to make gravy of a desired consistency. Cook till done.

, This process will allow the chicken to fully cook and to stew in the vegetables and spices for a bit. Sure, frying it or cooking it over higher heat will get the job done faster, but your chicken won't get that same authentic flavor. 

, Once your chicken curry is cooked, take a bite and add salt and pepper or any spices to taste as needed. Garnish with fresh coriander and serve with plain rice or chapati (Indian bread).

, Enjoy this tasty chicken curry dish while it's hot.
