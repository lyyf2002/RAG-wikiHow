Serve.",How to Make Chicken Curry2," Using a slow cooker takes much more time, but the end result is worth it. Here is everything you'll need to make delicious chicken curry in a slow cooker:


2 tbsp red wine vinegar
1 tbsp all-purpose flour
1 tbsp tomato paste
2 tsp garam masala, plus more for sprinkling
2 tsp Madras curry powder
2 cloves garlic, halved
1 14.5-ounce can diced tomatoes
1-inch piece fresh ginger, peeled and cut into pieces
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
1 pound red skinned potatoes, cut into 1/2-inch pieces
2 pounds chicken thighs, skin removed (about 8 thighs)
1 5-oz package baby spinach
1/2 cup chopped cilantro

, You can add salt and pepper to taste, but it's recommended that you use about a 1/2 teaspoon of salt and a 1/4 teaspoon of pepper in a blender or a food processor.

, Puree the ingredients together to make the stew for the curry chicken. It should be blended pretty well, with just a bit of chunkiness.

, Ideally, the slow cooker should be 5 1/2 to 6 quarts large. Spread the potatoes evenly so they are well distributed across the bottom of the pot. You'll be placing the chicken on top of them, so you want to make sure the chicken can impart its tasty flavor to the potatoes pretty evenly.

, Sprinkle the chicken with one teaspoon of garam masala and one teaspoon of curry powder along with a fair amount of salt and pepper to taste. You can make this mixture in a bowl and then sprinkle it over the chicken, or even press the chicken into the mixture. Just make sure that you season both sides of the chicken.

, Carefully place the chicken over the potatoes in a single layer.

, This will give the chicken and potatoes the delicious curry flavor you're looking for.

,, Once you've prepared your chicken curry, you can throw in the spinach and stir it until it's wilted. This should take less than a minute.

, Now, just sprinkle cilantro over the dish and season it further with salt and pepper to taste.

, Your slow-cooked chicken curry is all ready to go. You can enjoy this dish as it is, or serve it with naan on the side, which will help you scoop up the delicious sauce. You can also add some chutney or Greek yogurt to the dish — sour cream will be a substitute for the chicken curry in a pinch.

Once you make the powder, you can season the chicken with it before you cook it. (In a pinch, you can just buy some curry powder, but where's the fun in that?) Here's what you'll need:



For the curry powder:

1 tbsp cumin seeds
1 tbsp mustard greens
1 tbsp fenugreek seeds
1 tbsp anise seeds
1 tbsp black peppercorns
1 tbsp coriander seeds
½ tbsp allspice
1 tbsp turmeric powder



For the curry chicken:

3 tbsp vegetable oil
4 skinless chicken legs, split
2 sliced medium onions
4 minced cloves of garlic
1 tbsp minced ginger
½ medium chili pepper
2 tbsp chopped fresh thyme
3 cups chicken stock
2 cups coconut milk
Juice of ½ lime
Salt and pepper to taste
4 tbsp curry powder



, This recipe will help you make the curry powder to have some to spare when you're done cooking the chicken. Here's what you need to do to make it:


Toast the cumin, fenugreek, anise, mustard, black peppercorns, coriander seeds, and allspice in a small skillet over high heat. Do this for at least a minute or two, until the spices become fragrant.
Remove the spices from the heat and cool them.
Grind the spices in a spice grinder and then combine them with the turmeric powder.

, You can season the chicken while you're waiting for the oil to heat up. It should take a minute or two.

, Use about 4 tablespoons of the curry powder to season the chicken. Make sure to evenly cover all sides of the chicken with the powder.

,, This will cook these ingredients in the spices as well as the aroma of the fried chicken.

,,, This will impart a rich, irresistible flavor to the chicken.

,, Partially remove the lid of the pot as you cook the chicken, occasionally skimming the mixture to remove the extra fat. The chicken should be ready when it falls off the bone. After the hour mark, check on it often to make sure you don't overcook it.

If you do not, you can use a wine bottle, canned food, or a pan or pot.Start pounding the chicken on the thickest part. This is usually found near the center of the chicken. Use gentle strikes as pounding too hard can damage the meat.
Move outward, working from the center to the sides.
Pound out each chicken breast until they are all 1/4 of an inch thick.;
, Add the flour to a small mixing bowl. Then, add a small amount of salt and pepper. Use a wire whisk to mix everything together., Egg wash helps coat the chicken for cooking.

Heat it over medium-high heat.Olive oil is ready when it has a watery, glistening appearance. You can also toss in a small bit of food, like a piece of garlic or onion. If the food sizzles immediately, your olive oil is ready to use., As the olive oil heats, work on coating the chicken breasts. First, coat them in the flour mixture. Then, dip them in the egg wash, coating them completely in that as well. Allow any excess egg wash to drip off each chicken breast before proceeding with the cooking process., Place each chicken breast in the skillet. Keep the heat at the medium-high setting. Cook the chicken beasts for two minutes on each side, or until each side is golden brown.Do not worry if the chicken breasts are not cooked all the way through. You will be cooking them more later.

Plan on portioning out about 500 grams (18 oz) or approximately 1 pound of chicken for this recipe.
White breast meat works very well in this recipe, but you can also use dark leg meat, or any combination of white and dark meat depending on your personal taste.
You can leave the skin on or remove it, depending to your personal preference.
500 grams is about equivalent to 4 small or 2 large boneless chicken breasts.;
, It might sound counterintuitive, but the U.S. Department of Agriculture warns that rinsing off raw meat can actually spread bacteria, even up to three feet if your sink faucet has strong water pressure. Proper sanitization is vital, thought, when working with raw chicken since it can harbor dangerous bacteria like salmonella.The key is to ensure sanitization through other methods that are effective methods than washing the meat.


Avoid cross-contamination by preparing your raw chicken on a different cutting board and with different utensils than you would use to work with other ingredients. If you must reuse these items, make sure that you thoroughly sanitize them with hot water and antibacterial soap after they’ve touched the raw meat.Be sure to thoroughly wash your hands after handing the raw meat and before touching any other ingredients and utensils.Make sure that the liquids you marinate the raw chicken in will be thoroughly cooked. Never reuse extra marinade if it has touched the raw chicken., Pre-treat your meat to some flavor before you apply the marinade. This will help to impart even more flavor.


Use a fork to poke some holes into the meat. This will allow your seasoning to penetrate into the meat and infuse it with flavor.
Sprinkle on a generous pinch of salt.
Gently rub in about 1 tablespoon (15 ml) each of fresh garlic and ginger, crushed into a paste. To make a paste, chop the garlic and ginger into small pieces, sprinkle with a pinch of salt, and then use the flat side of a chef’s knife to press down on the pieces and smash them into a paste.If you decide to leave the skin on your meat, you can gently separate the skin from the meat and apply the paste between them. Your paste will have more contact with the meat this way, and the skin will hold it in place.
Leave the chicken to pre-marinate while you make the main marinade (about 15 minutes).

, This robust marinade is made by combining several different spices.


Wash your coriander leaves and green chilies first.
Place all of your marinade ingredients into a food processor or blender and pulse until it becomes a smooth, fine paste.

, It’s smart to use a non-corrosive mixing bowl when applying the marinade so that it doesn’t chemically react with the spices.


Place your prepped chicken pieces into a non-corrosive mixing bowl and cover it with the marinade.
Gently massage the mixture into the meat.
Cover the mixing bowl with plastic wrap, tin foil, or another tight fitting lid.

, Leave your chicken to marinate in the refrigerator for at least 3 hours, or preferably overnight for maximum flavor infusion.


The more the paste settles onto the meat, the tastier the dish becomes.
Be sure to let it marinate in the refrigerator, not at room temperature, so that your meat doesn’t spoil.

, Take your chicken out of the refrigerator about 10 minutes or so before you're ready to cook. Allowing the meat to slow come to room temperature before introducing it to a hot skillet it will help the meat cook better and stay tender., To get a good sear on your meat, it’s important to use the right kind of skillet and get it up to the right temperature.


Ideally, use a Chinese wok or kadai (a round, deep cooking pot used in Indian and Pakistani cooking). If you don’t have a wok or kadai, you can also use a cast iron frying skillet with tall sides to prevent any oil from splashing up on you.
Use medium-high heat to warm your cooking oil in the skillet, then add the butter. Using oil and butter will help to control your cooking temperature and keep your oil from getting too hot.If you prefer to skip the butter, thought, that’s fine too.

, Once your butter and oil are hot (slightly shimmering), slowly and carefully add your chicken pieces.


Stir and toss frequently for about 5 minutes. This helps to ensure even cooking and prevent sticking.
Add any remaining marinade. Be sure to bring it to a boil, to kill off any bacteria.
Reduce to medium heat, cover, and cook for approximately 15 minutes or until the chicken meat is cooked all the way through.
You can check your chicken’s doneness by using a tip-sensitive thermometer. Check the meat in several spots, making sure to hit the thickest and center-most spots. You should reach a temperature of 165 °F (73.9 °C) to kill off bacteria and reduce your risk of food-borne illness., After you’ve cooked the chicken, it’s a good idea to take a taste and see if any additional salt or seasonings are needed.

, Traditional garnishes include onion and tomato slices, but you can use fresh cilantro leaves, lemon slices, or whatever else you’d like to add as your own personal touch.

, Chicken Cafreal is especially delicious when enjoyed with some other classic Indian side dishes.


Include a side of warm brown or jasmine rice, or some warm Naan bread to soak up the juices.
Pour a glass of Feni (a Goan alcoholic beverage flavored with cashew or coconut), white wine, or pale beer if you are old enough.

",How to Make Chicken Casserole," You can create a chicken casserole without a recipe by following a standard formula.


To make a casserole that serves approximately four people, you'll need 1 cup (250 ml) cooked chicken, 1 cup (250 ml) of vegetables, 1 to 2 cup (250 to 500 ml) of starch, and 1-1/2 cups (375 ml) of a binder. If you wish to use a topping, prepare roughly 1 cup (250 ml).Double the above proportions to make a casserole that can serve up to eight people.
You'll also need to use the right baking dish. Use an 8-inch (20-cm) square baking dish or 2-qt (2-L) baking dish when preparing chicken casseroles that serve four people. For larger casseroles, opt for a 9-by-13-inch (23-by-33-cm) baking dish.;
, The chicken is the star of your casserole, but you'll also need to decide on vegetables, starches, binders, and toppings.


The best vegetables will depend on the flavor profile you wish to meet, but popular choices include carrots, corn, peas, mushrooms, celery, broccoli, onion, green beans, and peppers. Frozen mixed vegetables can also be used.
The common casserole starches include pasta, potatoes, and rice. For chicken casseroles, prepared stuffing can be used, as well.
The binder typically consists of a white sauce made from a blend of ingredients. ""Cream of"" condensed soups are common bases, with Cream of Chicken and Cream of Mushroom soups being among the most popular choices. Thin the soup out with a little water or milk if the it doesn't spread well on its own.
Toppings are only optional, but popular choices include breadcrumbs, crushed cereal flakes, cheese, and crushed crackers.

, Dried herbs can maintain their flavor more effectively than fresh herbs when exposed to intense or prolonged heat. Since casseroles can take 30 minutes or longer to cook through, dried herbs are usually the better option.


To enjoy the flavor of fresh herbs with your chicken casserole, consider sprinkling chopped fresh herbs over the top of the casserole during the last 5 to 10 minutes of cooking time. The shortened time will allow the fresh herbs to maintain their flavor in spite of the heat.

, The chicken should be completely cooked before you add it to the casserole. Let it cool slightly after you finish cooking it, then cut it into bite-sized pieces.


You can boil, bake, saute, or grill the chicken. Either cook it plain or add seasonings that will complement the flavor palate of the finished casserole.
To save time, you can use packaged, pre-cooked chicken or cut up the meat of a whole rotisserie chicken.
Note that 1-1/4 lb (565 g) of chicken breast will usually produce roughly 3 cups (750 ml) of cooked chicken. You can also get the same amount of meat from a whole 3 lb (1350 g) chicken., Most notably, you'll need to partially cook the starch ingredient and any root vegetables you plan to include.Since these foods take a longer time to cook than many other ingredients, partially cooking them before you toss them into the casserole can ensure that everything finishes at the same time.
Follow the package instructions when cooking pasta or rice, but stop cooking them 2 to 4 minutes before the suggested cooking time so that they don't get overdone.
Cook root vegetables, like carrots and onions, by steaming, boiling, or roasting them. If you plan to use potatoes or yams as your starch, you can cook them using any method, as well. Remember to only cook the vegetables about halfway to three-quarters doneness, however.

, Any ingredients that don't need to be cooked before you add them to the casserole should still be brought to room temperature before you assemble the dish. This includes frozen vegetables and frozen pre-cooked chicken.


Using frozen ingredients will increase the overall cooking time. For some small ingredients, like frozen peas or frozen corn kernels, this may not be too detrimental to the overall casserole, but it becomes a bigger problem when you use larger chunks of frozen food. While the frozen food is brought up to temperature, the warm ingredients in the casserole can overcook. The overcooked ingredients can dry out or create hazardous hot spots in the dish.

, Some vegetables can retain excess moisture, which may cause the casserole to become runny and unappetizing. Drain as much liquid from the vegetables you plan to use before assembling the dish.


Thoroughly drain any cooked vegetables, especially if you cooked the vegetables in water. Allow them to sit in a colander for several minutes to remove as much water as possible.
Pour frozen vegetables into a colander. As they defrost, the excess water should drip away from them.
Use your hands to squeeze any excess moisture from thawed frozen greens like spinach.
If you plan to use fresh or canned mushrooms, cook them beforehand. Most mushrooms have a high water content, and the only way to remove that excess water is with heat.

, Prepare the appropriately sized baking dish by greasing it with nonstick cooking spray.


You can also line the baking dish with nonstick aluminum foil for an even easier cleanup. Doing so is especially ideal when you plan to freeze and reheat the finished casserole later.

, Combine the cooked chicken, vegetables, starch, and binder in a large bowl, stirring until evenly mixed. Pour the contents of the bowl into the greased baking dish.


If you plan to use dried herbs or other seasonings, mix them into the binder separately. Similarly, if the binder consists of multiple elements (e.g. two soups and a little milk), combine all of the binder ingredients before adding the solid ingredients.
After the binder and seasonings have been mixed together, you can combine the binder mixture with the chicken, vegetables, and starch.

, Toppings aren't strictly necessary, but adding a topping can give the casserole a final hint of flavor and greater visual appeal.


Evenly sprinkle your topping of choice over the top of the chicken casserole. Resist the urge to cover the entire top in a thick layer of cheese or other toppings since doing so could make it difficult for the heat to penetrate the surface and reach the inner ingredients.

, For casseroles prepared in an 8-inch (20-cm) square baking dish, you'll usually need to cook them for approximately 30 minutes. Casseroles prepared in a 9-by-13-inch (23-by-33-cm) baking dish may require 5 to 10 additional minutes.


You'll need to adjust this cooking time based on the size of the pan. For deeper pans, increase the cooking time by 25 percent. Likewise, for shallower pans, decrease the cooking time by 25 percent.If you added a topping, keep the casserole covered for the majority of the baking time. Remove the foil during the last 5 to 10 minutes so that the topping can brown. If you did not add any topping, you can leave the casserole uncovered for the entire cooking time. Doing so will help create a crispier top.
Test for doneness by inserting a wooden skewer or knife into the center. Feel the utensil immediately after removing it. If the casserole is adequately hot throughout, the utensil should also feel hot to the touch.

, Once the casserole is ready, remove it from the oven and allow it to sit for at least 5 minutes before you cut and serve it. During that resting time, the various flavors of the casserole can meld together more thoroughly.


When the resting period has ended, simple cut the casserole into slices and transfer each slice to an individual serving dish. Enjoy!

, Assemble the casserole in a foil-lined baking dish, leaving enough foil hanging over the edge to cover and seal the dish. Place the entire dish in the freezer and allow the entire casserole to freeze into a solid block.Once the casserole has frozen, wrap the foil over and around the casserole, then lift the frozen mass out of the baking dish. Clean and reuse the baking dish as desired.
Place the foil-wrapped casserole into a large freezer-safe plastic bag or container. Store it in your freezer for up to three or four months.

, Allow the casserole to completely thaw in your refrigerator for 24 to 48 hours. Roughly 30 to 60 minutes before you plan to cook it, remove it from the refrigerator and let it drop down to room temperature.


Increasing the cooking time to cook a partially frozen casserole can have bad consequences. Some of the ingredients can overcook while others remain frozen, and the outer edges may burn while the center remains cool.

, After thawing the chicken casserole, bake it in an oven preheated to 375 degrees Fahrenheit (190 degrees Celsius) for 30 to 40 minutes, or until the casserole is heated through.


Let the chicken casserole rest for 5 minutes before servings.

Enjoy.",How to Make Chicken and Waffles," Prepare two baking sheets by lining them with parchment paper or aluminum foil.


You will need one baking sheet for the fried chicken and one baking sheet for the waffles.
Note that the oven is not strictly necessary since it will not be used to cook the chicken or the waffles. It can be very useful, however, since you need to cook the food in batches and need a way to keep the earlier batches warm while finishing the later batches.;
, Place the eggs, water, and hot sauce in a medium mixing bowl. Beat together with a whisk until evenly combined, then set aside.


If you use the full amount of hot sauce, use the minimum amount of water. If you skip the hot sauce completely, use the maximum amount of water.
You could also reduce the amount of hot sauce without eliminating it completely. No matter how much you use, make sure that you have a total of 3/4 cup (180 ml) liquid between the water and hot sauce.

, Pour the oil into a deep, heavy stockpot. Place the pot on the stove and heat on medium until the oil reaches a temperature of 350 degrees Fahrenheit (180 degrees Celsius).


Check the temperature of the oil using a candy thermometer.
If you do not have a cooking thermometer, test the oil by dropping a small dollop of finished batter into it. The batter should float to the top and immediately begin to sizzle if the oil is ready.
Note that the temperature of the oil will fluctuate throughout the cooking process, so you will need to keep an eye on it the entire time. Adjust the temperature controls of the stove as needed to maintain a consistent temperature.

, Place the two ingredients in a second medium bowl and stir them together with a mixing spoon until evenly mixed.

, You can use bone-in or boneless chicken for this dish. Bone-in pieces can be used as they are, but boneless chicken pieces can either be used as they are or pounded flat using a meat mallet.


If you want to eat the chicken and waffles separately, then you do not need to flatten the chicken. If you want to eat the dish sandwich style, however, flattening the pieces out first is strongly recommended.
To flatten the chicken, begin by slicing each thawed chicken breast in half horizontally, roughly two-thirds of the way through the piece.

Open the piece up and spread it out as flat as possible in between a top and bottom layer of wax paper.
Starting at the center, pound the chicken with a meat mallet or rolling pin until it is roughly 1/4 inch (0.6 cm) thick. Remove the chicken from the wax paper when done.


Alternatively, you could buy thin-sliced chicken breast or use chicken tenderloins.

, Sprinkle both sides of the chicken with salt and garlic powder. Use a generous amount of salt and a light amount of garlic powder.


The amounts provided in the recipe list are only estimates. You can add more or less according to your own tastes.

, Dip each piece of chicken into the egg mixture. Allow the excess to drain off into the bowl, then dredge each piece in the seasoned flour.


Make sure that all sides of each piece are coated.
Instead of coating all of the pieces at the same time, you should coat each piece immediately before you intend to fry it.

, Place the chicken in the hot oil one piece at a time and fry for 5 to 14 minutes.


Thin, flattened pieces of chicken may only take 5 to 8 minutes.
White meat, boneless or bone-in, could take 8 to 10 minutes.
Dark meat, boneless or bone-in, will usually take 13 to 14 minutes.

, Use tongs or a slotted spoon to remove each piece of chicken from the hot oil. Place the chicken on a plate covered with several layers of clean paper towel. Allow the excess oil to drain off for a few minutes.

, If you prepared the chicken before preparing the waffles, you will need to keep the pieces warm as you cook the rest of the food. Do so by transferring the fried chicken to one of your prepared baking sheets and keeping the cooked pieces in the preheated oven.

, Follow the manufacturer's instructions to preheat your waffle iron to a medium-high heat.


Most waffle irons already have a nonstick coating, but it is still a good idea to spray both sides with a light coating of nonstick cooking spray.
If the temperature controls are labeled as “high,” “low,” and so on, set the control to medium or medium-high. If the control allows you to specify a certain doneness based on color, choose “medium golden” or “medium golden brown.”

, Prepare a baking sheet by covering it with aluminum foil or parchment paper.


If you already made the chicken, then your oven should already be preheated.
As with the chicken, you will use the oven to keep earlier batches of waffles warm while you cook later batches.

, Combine the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a medium mixing bowl, stirring the ingredients together until evenly dispersed

, In a separate small bowl or measuring cup, combine the buttermilk, egg, and vegetable oil. Beat by hand with a whisk or fork until the ingredients are well combined.

, Slowly pour the wet mixture into the dry mixture. Use a fork or whisk to beat the mixtures together, stopping shortly after all the dry ingredients have been moistened.


It is acceptable for a few small lumps to remain in the batter, but any large lumps should be beaten out before you press on.
Avoid over-beating the batter. Doing so could cause the air bubbles to deflate, thereby creating dense, chewy waffles instead of light, airy ones.

, Pour enough batter into the preheated waffle iron to cover the bottom iron.


Note that the precise amount of batter you should use will vary depending on your waffle iron. You should refer to the manufacturer's instructions to verify that you are adding the correct amount.
You may find it easiest to use a ladle when pouring the batter into your waffle iron. If you attempt to pour straight from the mixing bowl, you might make more of a mess.

, Close the iron and cook the waffle until it turns a medium golden brown color.


Remove the waffles with a heat-resistant spatula or similar utensil. Avoid forks and other sharp utensils, however, since the pointed metal can scratch the nonstick surface of the iron.

, Transfer the cooked waffles to your prepared baking sheet and place them in the oven. Keep the early batches warm as you finish preparing the rest of the waffles.

, Combine the two ingredients in a medium stainless steel saucepan. Mix gently with a whisk to spread the thyme throughout the cream.


Fresh thyme works much better for this recipe than dried thyme, but if you want to use dried thyme, cut the amount used to a third. In other words, only use 1 tsp (5 ml) dried thyme.

, Place the saucepan on the stove and cook over medium-high heat, stirring frequently, for 10 minutes or until the liquid is reduced to half its original amount.


Stirring the mixture prevents the cream from curdling.
Do not allow the cream to boil too rapidly since it is more likely to burn or curdle at a high temperature.

, Remove the saucepan from the stove and add both Dijon mustards and the salt. Whisk well until the mustards melt down and the entire sauce is even in color and consistency.

, The sauce can be kept on the eye of the stove with the heat turned off until you are ready to use it. Serve the sauce while still warm.


To save time, you can make the sauce a day or two in advance. Transfer the finished sauce to an airtight plastic container. Cover it, then refrigerate the sauce for up to three days. Reheat chilled sauce over medium-low heat on the stove, stirring constantly, when ready to serve.

, You can eat the chicken and waffles by arranging them side-by-side on the same serving plate or by stacking them together sandwich style.


To serve the dish sandwich style, place one more more flattened pieces of fried chicken in between two waffles.

, Drizzle the dish with warm Dijon cream sauce. For a more traditional taste, skip the cream sauce and serve the chicken and waffles with butter, maple syrup, and hot sauce, instead.


If preparing the dish sandwich style, place these condiments on the chicken in between to the two layers of waffle rather than on the outer sides of the waffles.

, Your meal is ready—dig in while it's still warm!

After the skin has been removed, rinse them under cold water. Once clean, use a cutting board and kitchen knife to cut each potato into chunks. The size is up to you, though one to two inch pieces are recommended for a stew.You can also cut the sweet potatoes into wedges if you would prefer larger slices.;
, You can use any type of chicken you like. For example, try a pound of boneless, skinless chicken breasts, or five to six bone-in, skinless chicken thighs. It is also up to you whether you’d prefer to cut the chicken into smaller portions or leave it whole. Cutting the chicken into chunks will allow it to cook faster. However, if you cook the chicken whole you should be able to shred it easily with a fork once it’s finished.


Just make sure that the chicken is properly de-thawed and skinless before using.

, Try adding a variety of vegetables to your stew. For example, many common recipes include either spinach or kale, but you can add anything like carrots, onions, or mushrooms. Make sure to clean each vegetable before using it. You should also make sure you peel both the onions and carrots before chopping, as well as removing the stems on the spinach and kale before doing the same., Similar to the vegetable options, you can choose any spices you’d like to season your stew. If you want something flavorful, yet mild, try using dried rosemary, salt, pepper, and a bit of white wine. If you’d prefer a spicier dish, use paprika, chili powder, and ginger. You can even take a bolder route with ingredients like garlic, paprika, coriander, cumin, lime juice, and coconut milk for a Brazilian inspired dish. It’s up to you!, Pour two-three cups of water into a large pot or saucepan and bring the water to a boil. Once boiling, add your diced sweet potatoes. You want to keep the stove on high heat until the potatoes are cooked through. This should take around ten minutes. After this time, remove the pot or saucepan from the heat and dump the sweet potatoes into a colander to drain., Without cleaning, put the pan or pot back onto the heat and add a tablespoon of coconut or olive oil. Then add your chicken. You want to fry the chicken until it starts to brown on both sides, which should take around eight to ten minutes if whole and five to eight if chopped.


It’s okay if you’re chicken isn’t fully cooked at this point, as you will be cooking it further as you put the stew together. Just make sure that you are allowing the pieces to brown without burning.

, Before you finish cooking the chicken, throw your vegetables into the pan. You can do this two to three minutes before the chicken fully browns. However, make sure you are paying attention to cook times.


For example, onions are going to take longer to cook than sliced mushrooms. Also, kale and spinach cook very quickly and will be done once they start to wilt.

, Once the chicken and vegetables have been cooked, pour 500ml of chicken stock or broth over them and into the pot. Bring the broth to a boil and then turn down the heat to allow it to simmer. Allow the mixture to cook for ten minutes, stirring occasionally.

, After cooking for ten minutes, check to make sure your chicken has cooked through. Do this by cutting into a piece and looking at the inside color. If it’s pink, then you need to cook the chicken longer. However, if the inside is white, your chicken should be done.

, After your stew has been cooking for ten to twelve minutes, add in the sweet potatoes you cooked earlier. Be careful when dropping these items into the stew as you want to avoid splashback. Once the potatoes are in, add any additional spices you want, like salt, pepper, or rosemary. Leave the stew to cook further for five minutes until finished., Taste the chicken first to see if it's fully cooked and tender. You should be able to pull pieces apart easily with a fork. Then make sure that the vegetables are soft, yet crisp. You should also be able to notice that the broth has thickened.


If you feel like your stew is thin, even with an additional five minutes of cooking, try adding cornstarch. Simply mix two tablespoons of cornstarch in a separate bowl with a tablespoon of water in a separate dish. Stir until smooth and then add to your stew., When eating, ladle the stew into deep bowls with wide rims. This will help allow the stew to cool naturally so you don't risk burning yourself when eating it. The wide rim of the bowl is also perfect for any additional food items like bread., Though stew is hearty on its own, it's best enjoyed with an accompaniment like bread or potatoes. Try serving your stew with a few slices of artisan sourdough. Butter the bread and dip the pieces into the stew to soak up the broth while eating.


You can also substitute potatoes for the bread. Try a creamy mashed potato or crispy roast potatoes. The choice is yours!

, Before you store your leftover soup in the fridge or freezer, cool the pot in an ice bath in the sink. This will help bring the temperature down where it needs to be for freezing. Then ladle the stew into gallon or quart-size freezer bags and label them with the date. Lay these bags flat in the freezer so they are easy to store together once frozen.To reheat, simply let the stew to defrost in the fridge overnight and then cook over low-heat on the stove.

Store the broth in an air-tight container in the freezer, and it will last for up to six months., Set your oven to 375 F (191 C). This is a simple and convenient one-dish meal, and it requires very little preparation and equipment.


Aside from a stirring spoon, you only need an 8-by-11-inch baking dish., Place the water, rice, soup, and spices in the baking dish and stir to incorporate. Lay the chicken breasts on top of the rice. Be sure to spread them out so they don’t overlap, otherwise they won’t cook evenly.


Instead of mushroom soup, you can use an alternative cream soup or a combination of mushroom, celery, and chicken.For a more traditional style chicken and rice, you can also cut the chicken into bite-sized pieces and mix it in with the other ingredients.

, Season the top of the chicken with additional pepper and paprika, to taste.Cover the dish with either a lid or a sheet of tin foil. You can also sprinkle other spices on top of the chicken, such as:Rosemary
Marjoram
Oregano
Tarragon
Chili powder
Sage

, Bake the covered casserole for about 45 minutes, until the chicken and rice are cooked. Chicken is cooked when it reaches an internal temperature of 167 F (75 C).If you don’t have a thermometer, cut open one of the chicken breasts and make sure there's no pink left in the meat.

When the oil is hot and ready, the surface will shimmer and glisten like wind blowing across the surface of a pond., Stir in the onion and bell pepper. Cook these for about five minutes, stirring frequently, until they're soft. Then add the garlic and cook for an additional minute.


Don’t cook the garlic for longer than a minute, or it could burn and become bitter., Pour in all the juice from the tomatoes as well. Season with more salt and pepper, to taste, or use the same ratios as before. Bring the mixture to a boil, then lower the heat and simmer for 20 minutes.After the mixture comes to a boil, place a lid on it while it simmers.
A good dry wine for cooking chicken and vegetables is a chardonnay or sauvignon blanc., After 20 minutes of simmering, add the peas. Put the lid back on, and continue simmering for a few minutes to heat the peas through. This will take about two minutes.Once the peas are heated, remove the saucepan from the heat.

Chicken -- you can cut up a whole 3 or 4 pound chicken, giving you two wings, two legs, two breasts and two thighs, or you make this dish using only chicken breasts, drumsticks, or thighs -- it's up to you.
You will also need salt and pepper and some good quality olive oil.;
, Wash the chicken thoroughly in cold running water, then pat dry with a sheet or two of paper towel.


Coat the bottom of your roasting pan in olive oil, then add the chicken and toss to coat. Sprinkle both sides of the chicken pieces with a generous amount of salt and pepper.
Arrange the chicken pieces skin side up, with the larger sections (the breasts and thighs) towards the center of the roasting pan. Make sure the chicken pieces aren't crowded together.

, Place the roasting pan in an oven preheated to 400 °F (204 °C) and cook for 30 minutes. Then reduce the heat to 350 and cook for an additional 10 to 30 minutes, depending on the quantity of chicken.


In general, you need to assign 14 to 15 minutes of cooking time for every pound of chicken. For example, cooking a 4 lbs chicken takes approximately an hour.
It's very important that the chicken is thoroughly cooked, so don't rely on cooking time alone. Check the juices by poking the chicken breast with a sharp knife -- they should run clear once the chicken is fully cooked. If they are pink, the chicken is not cooked yet.
If you have an instant-read thermometer, use it to check the temperature of the thickest part of the chicken. The breasts should register an internal temperature of 165 °F (74 °C), while the thighs should register at 170 degrees, when fully cooked. , If the chicken hasn't browned to your liking, you can place it under the broiler for the last 5 minutes of cooking time.


Once browned, remove the chicken from the roasting pan, place it on a serving dish and cover with aluminum foil.
Allow the chicken to rest for 5 to 10 minutes before serving. During this time you can make the gravy (described below), if desired.

, The easiest way to make a tasty chicken gravy with minimal effort is to use the drippings from the roasting pan.


Place the roasting pan over a medium heat on the stovetop and use a spoon or spatula to scrape any drippings from the bottom of the pan.
Add half a cup of chicken stock (homemade or store-bought) to the pan to aid with the deglazing process.
Transfer the contents of the pan to a small saucepan and cook over a medium heat until the gravy reduces to the desired thickness.Serve in a gravy boat alongside the baked chicken.

, To make this flavorsome spiced chicken, use the same method for baked chicken as described above, but sprinkle the chicken with the following spice mixture before cooking:


Combine 1/4 teaspoon of garlic powder, 1/4 teaspoon of onion powder, 1/4 teaspoon of dried oregano and 1/4 teaspoon of paprika in a bowl, then sprinkle it over both sides of the chicken before cooking., To make this delicious variation of baked chicken, you will need:


3 tbsp Dijon mustard, 3 crushed garlic cloves, 2 tbsp butter, 2 tbsp white wine, 2 tsp salt, 2 cups dry bread crumbs.
Sauté the mustard and garlic in butter for about 4 minutes over moderate heat. Add the wine and continue to cook for another couple of minutes. Spoon this mixture over the uncooked chicken and toss to coat.
Dredge the chicken with breadcrumbs and cook according to the instructions in the previous section.

, A simple mixture of herbs and seasoning give this baked chicken a delicious Italian twist.


Prepare the chicken according to the directions given in the section above. In a small bowl, mix 1 1/2 teaspoons of dried parsley, 1 teaspoon of dried basil, 1 teaspoon of garlic pepper and 1 teaspoon of salt.
After tossing the raw chicken pieces in olive oil, sprinkle the herb mix evenly over both sides of the chicken and cook according to the method described in the section above., To make this sweet and spicy baked chicken, you will need the following ingredients:


1/2 cup of honey, 1/3 cup Dijon mustard, 3 teaspoons of curry powder, 3 tablespoons of butter (melted), 1/8 teaspoon ground pepper, dash of cayenne pepper.
Combine all of these ingredients in a bowl, add the chicken pieces and toss to coat in the honey mixture. Cover the bowl with foil or plastic wrap and leave to marinate in the refrigerator for an hour or two.
Place the marinated chicken pieces on a greased roasting pan and cover with tin foil. Cook the chicken pieces according to the instructions given in the section above, basting the chicken with the leftover sauce 2 or 3 times during cooking. Remove the tin foil for the last 15 minutes of cooking.

, This lemon and garlic baked chicken is simply bursting with flavor -- perfect for family dinners or for serving guests!


You will need: 1 large white onion, 1/2 cup of dry white wine, 1/2 cup of chicken broth, 5 crushed garlic cloves, 5 to 7 tablespoons of freshly squeezed lemon juice, 1 teaspoon of dried tarragon or thyme, salt, pepper and paprika (for seasoning).
Roughly chop the onion and add it to the roasting dish, around the olive oil-coated chicken pieces. Combine the wine, lemon juice, garlic, chicken broth and herbs in a jug, then pour over the chicken and onions.
Sprinkle the chicken with the salt, pepper and paprika, then bake according to the instructions given in the section above. Baste the chicken with juices once or twice during cooking.

",How to Cook a Whole Chicken in the Oven," Depending upon the size of the bird, it can take between 1 and 3 days to defrost in the refrigerator. It is recommended that you cook soon after defrosting to avoid food borne illness.;
, Place a rack in the middle to low middle of the oven, depending upon the size of the whole chicken.

, Remove other kitchen appliances, dishes and silverware to reduce cross contamination. Ready your roasting pan or Dutch oven nearby for easy transfer.

, Place the packaging directly in the trash.

, Throw them away if you do not want to use them for a gravy.

, Stick your fingers between the breast and the skin. Move your hands underneath the skin to loosen it for seasoning.

,, Roast chicken is versatile, and it can be flavored according to the regional aromatics, fruits and vegetables you prefer.


Try lemon pepper or lemon garlic chicken. Lemon, onions and garlic are the staples of the aromatics that help to flavor the whole chicken. Pepper or garlic can be used to season the surface of the chicken as well as the inside cavity.
Consider herb seasonings, such as a combination of rosemary, sage and thyme. You can use a generic poultry seasoning or Italian seasoning if you do not have access to fresh herbs.
Spanish or Mexican flavors, such as chili pepper, paprika, garlic or cayenne will make the chicken's surface spicy. Use the pre-seasoned extra meat for tacos and enchiladas. Adobo seasoning is a combination of paprika, oregano, garlic and pepper that comes pre-packaged at specialty stores and supermarkets.

,


Slice 1 to 2 lemons in half to place inside the chicken cavity.
Cut up onions or shallots into quarters.
Peel garlic cloves. You will want to place anywhere from 2 to 10 garlic cloves, depending upon preference.

, Combine 2 tbsp. (30ml) of unsalted melted butter with 1/2 tsp. (0.9g) salt, 1/2 tsp. (0.9g) of pepper and 1/2 tsp. (0.9g) to 1 tbsp. (30g) of dried or fresh herbs. You can use a ratio of 1 to 3 with measuring dried or fresh herbs, since dried herbs are more potent.


You can also substitute canola oil or olive oil for the butter. The fat will help to brown the surface of the bird.

, Place them underneath the skin on the surface of the chicken meat.

, Place them inside the cavity of the chicken. Make sure there aren't any ingredients falling out; however, it can be tightly packed.

, The breasts should face upward on the rack.

, Place them below the roasting rack.


If you are using a Dutch oven, place the root vegetables on the bottom of the pan, then place the chicken on top. This will help the juices drip down into the pan as they cook.
If you want smaller vegetable slices, wait 20 to 30 minutes, to place them underneath the roasting rack. This will prevent overdone vegetables.

, This means you wrap the drumsticks with twine and tuck in the wings to keep the cavity closed.


Trussing the chicken is not necessary. It can increase the cooking time, because the heat does not reach the dark meat as easily.

, Allow it to roast at 450 degrees Fahrenheit (232 degrees Celsius) for 20 minutes. This will brown the bird and seal in juices.

, Let it roast for 1 hour to 1 hour and 30 minutes, depending upon the size of the bird, the evenness of the oven and the altitude.

, It should read at least 170 degrees Fahrenheit (77 degrees Celsius). If it does not, allow it to roast for 20 to 30 more minutes before checking again.

, Place the chicken on an unheated surface or a cooling rack.

,,,, You will need to return to the bird to take the rest of the meat off the bones for use in future recipes.

If you plan using some of the marinade during or after grilling, set some aside now. Once the raw chicken touches the marinade, you cannot reuse it.

, Cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and leave it in the fridge for at least 1 to 2 hours. It would be better if you let it marinate for 4 to 12 hours, however., Scrape the grate clean. Dip a folded paper towel into vegetable oil, then wipe the grate with it. The grate needs to be glossy with oil. Turn the heat up to high.Consider having a two-zone fire, with the heat focused on one side. That way, if the chicken cooks too quickly, you can move it to the other side of the grill to finish cooking over a lower temperature., If you are using a two-zone fire, place the chicken on the hotter part of the grill. This way, you can move it to the cooler part if it is cooking too fast. The chicken pieces can be close together, but they should not be touching.

, Cook the chicken until the underside turns brown, about 3 to 5 minutes. Use a pair of tongs to flip the chicken over, then cook it for another 3 to 5 minutes.The chicken is ready when the center is no longer pink and the juices are clear.


If you are cooking bone-in chicken, give it another minute or two on each side.Unlike beef, chicken must be completely cooked through. If you want to be extra safe, stick a cooking thermometer into the thickest part of the chicken. The temperature should read around 170°F (77°C).

, This allows the juices to settle back into the meat.Keep the chicken covered with aluminum foil while it is resting so that it doesn't get cold or dry out.

Place the chicken breasts into a plastic, zippered bag, then pound them flat with meat mallet.,
Season both sides of the chicken with salt and pepper.,
Heat a skillet over medium-high heat until it starts to smoke a little.If you aren't using a nonstick skillet, lightly coat the skillet with about 2 to 3 teaspoons of cooking oil.,
Arrange the chicken in a single layer on the skillet.,
Lower the heat to medium, then cook the chicken for 8 to 12 minutes, turning it occasionally using a spatula.,
Serve the chicken, or use it in your recipe.",How to Cook a Chicken Breast3," The chicken breasts need to be about ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) thick. Focus on the thicker parts of the chicken breast first; you want the breasts to be the same thickness all around. This will help them cook faster and more evenly.No meat mallet? No problem! Use a rolling pin or heavy jar instead.
Can't find any plastic, zippered bags that are big enough? Use two sheets of plastic wrap instead.
Don't wash the chicken breasts before hand. You can cut away any excess fat if you'd like, however.
This method is not recommended for bone-in chicken.

, You can also use your own spices, seasonings, and rubs.

, Tilt the pan from side-to-side to help the oil spread across the entire surface. If you are using a nonstick skillet, then you don't need to coat it.

, The skillet needs to be big enough to big enough to fit all of the chicken breasts in one layer with some space in between each breast. If the skillet is too small, the chicken will steam instead., It is ready when the inside is no longer pink, and the juices are clear. The temperature should read 170°F (77°C).


Stick a cooking thermometer into the thickest part of the chicken. It needs to read 170°F (77°C).
If the chicken is browning too quickly, lower the heat to medium-low.

, Sautéed chicken is tasty on its own, especially if served alongside some rice. You can also slice it up, and serve it on top of a salad, or use it in a sandwich.

Cover the chicken with water.,
Bring the water to a boil over medium-high heat, then let it simmer, covered, over low heat for about 10 to 15 minutes.,
Take the chicken out of the saucepan and serve it.",How to Cook a Chicken Breast4," It's okay if the chicken breasts overlap, but they will cook more evenly if they don't.Skinless, boneless chicken is the best for this method, but you can use bone-in chicken as well.
Do not wash the chicken breasts beforehand, as this will only spread bacteria. Any bacteria will be killed during the cooking process.

, At this point, you can also add in some soy sauce for extra flavor.

, The water should be 1 to 1½ inches (2.54 to 3.81 centimeters) above the chicken. How much water you use will depend on the size of your saucepan.

, The thicker the chicken breasts are, the longer they will cook. They are ready when the meat is no longer pink inside.If you are using bone-in chicken, it will need to cook for about 20 minutes., Use a pair of tongs so you don't burn yourself. You can serve the chicken as is, or you cut or shred the meat, and use it in your recipe. You can also discard the water, or strain it, and use it as a base for soups or sauces.

Decide which type of chicken you are going to buy:



Fresh, raw chicken: This chicken either comes whole or in pieces.,
Know how the chicken you are buying should be like:



Fresh, raw chicken: Buy fresh, raw chicken that is cold to touch.,
Check to see if the chicken is wrapped well in plastic or placed in a tightly sealed plastic box.,
Avoid buying chicken with tags that say ""reduced price"" or ""quick sale"".,
Look at the use-by date.,
Know the labels on your chicken well.,
Buy the chicken last.,
Put the chicken in another shopping bag on its own.,
Store the chicken in the chicken in the fridge straight away when you arrive home.",How to Buy Chicken," For a roast dinner, buy the whole chicken and buy the chicken in pieces for other small things. It is generally cheaper to purchase the whole chicken but it takes a lot of effort to cut the whole chicken into pieces. This chicken must be stored in the refrigerated area.

Cooked chicken: This chicken is for a quick and convenient meal at home. You will not have to prepare much for a meal when buying this chicken. It should be consumed as soon as possible so consider purchasing it carefully. This chicken must be stored in an oven-like area.

Frozen chicken: This chicken is great if you plan on using the chicken for future use instead of now. It can come either in whole or pieces. Usually the pieces have a breadcrumb coating over them (e.g. chicken nuggets). This chicken must be stored in the freezer section.;
, Fresh, raw chicken must be stored at or below 4°C (39°F) at all times. Look at the fat carefully on the fresh chicken. The fat should be a white to deep yellow colour and definitely not grey.Cooked Chicken: Buy cooked chicken that is over 60°C (140°F). While you probably aren't allowed to bring a thermometer into a supermarket, you are able to check the temperature by touching the chicken. The chicken should feel very hot; if the chicken doesn't feel very hot, don't buy it. Cooked chicken should be stored in a plastic bag while resting at a consistent temperature of 60°C (140°F) or higher. Ask a shop assistant what temperature the cooked chicken is resting at.

Frozen Chicken: Buy frozen chicken that is very cold and hard to touch. Press down on the chicken to see if it is hard. The chicken must feel as hard as a rock. If the chicken feels the slightest bit softer than a rock, do not buy it. Frozen chicken must be stored below 4°C (39°F) at all times.

, If there are any cracks and/or dents in the packaging, don't buy the chicken. Packaged chicken must also be sealed properly. Alert a shop assistant if a seal has been broken. Fresh, raw chicken with leaking juices coming out must be avoided.

, Tags are usually placed because the packaging has been damaged or the use-by date of the chicken is nearing. Although the tag may say ""still fresh"", it is best to buy chicken without any tags to ensure that you are safe.

, There should be two dates printed on the packaging: the date the chicken was packaged and the date the chicken should be used. If you see a chicken that is past the use-by date, notify a shop assistant and get him or her to remove it to prevent others getting sick.


Fresh, raw chicken must only be on the supermarket shelves for 2 to 3 days.
Cooked chicken must only be in the supermarket for one day. It is best to buy the cooked chicken earlier in the day as it will be much fresher.
Frozen chicken can be stored in the freezer sections of the supermarket up until the use-by date on the packaging.

, Look out for these labels:



Free-range: This label does not necessarily mean that the chicken lived outside for its entire life. The chicken just had been granted access to outside.

Certified Organic: This means that food given to the chicken was free of chemical fertilisers, pesticides, animal by-products and other non-organic additives. The chicken also had to be free range.

, Chicken must be stored at either below 4°C (39°F) or over 60°C (140°F) to prevent the salmonella bacteria multiplying. Avoid buying too many groceries if you are going to buy chicken. The longer the chicken has to wait, the more dangerous it can get.

, A cooler bag is best if you are going to buy raw chicken. If can't find a cooler bag, try placing ice packs at the bottom of a strong shopping bag.

, If the chicken is cooked, place in the fridge or consume immediately.

Place the livers in cold water.,
Let the livers soak.,
Drain the bowl.,
Pat the livers dry with paper towels.",How to Clean Chicken Livers1," Fill a glass bowl with cold water – not as cold as ice water but colder than room temperature. Place the livers in the cold water. If possible, don’t lay them on top of one another., You should leave the livers in the cold water for about fifteen minutes. This gives the water time to coagulate the blood, which will make it easier to remove., After fifteen minutes, hold the livers in place and dump the water out of the bowl., Take one liver out at a time and pat it dry with a paper towel. Make sure you blot both sides of the liver. If you find some of the blood is stubborn, you might have to wet a paper towel and wipe the blood off."

Lay out the livers.,
Look for connective tissue.,
Trim the meat away from the connective tissue.",How to Clean Chicken Livers2," Lay out all of the livers you’re trimming so that they are flat. This might require that you unfold the livers, as they often come out of the container balled up., Livers have connective tissue running through them, similar to what you might find on a chicken breast. This tissue is usually white or pink and is stringy.You should also look for any greenish parts on the liver, as these will cause the liver to taste bitter., Using a sharp knife or scissors, trim the meat away from the connective tissue. This might take more than one or two passes with the knife, since each liver can have multiple areas with connective tissue."
"
Collect chicken livers from whole chickens.,
Buy the livers from a butcher.,
Clean and freeze the chicken livers.,
Make chopped liver.",How to Clean Chicken Livers3," If you are in the habit of buying whole chickens, you'll actually be purchasing livers at the same time. Some chickens have multiple hearts and multiple livers, so you might get more than one per chicken.Don't use livers in giblet gravy - it can give the gravy a bitter taste.

, You can buy whole livers from the butcher or the meat department of your local grocery store. These livers tend to be of a better quality than what you'd get in a whole chicken, since the processing of whole chickens means the livers might be mangled.Livers from the grocery store or butcher may come in a jar, or they might be fresh. Ask your butcher how they package them.

, Before you store the chicken livers, you should clean them so that they're ready to be used when you want them. Once you've cleaned them, lay them flat in a freezer storage bag and lay the bag flat in your freezer.Use the livers within three to four months of freezing them.

, The most popular way to prepare chicken livers is by making chopped liver. Melt 5 tablespoons (2.5 ounces) of fat (either chicken fat or butter) in a pan, then sauté 2 cups (16 ounces) of sliced onions in the fat. Remove the onions, but pour the fat back in the pan, and sauté 1 pound of chicken livers until they're brown on the outside and no longer pink on the inside. Mix the livers, onions, and 3 hard-boiled eggs together and chop them finely. Season with salt and pepper and either serve within two hours or store in an airtight container in the refrigerator."

Remove the backbone.,
Open the chicken and find the breast bone.Spread the chicken open as wide as possible to make it easier to find and remove the breast bone.,
Cut along both sides of the breast bone.,
Flip the chicken over and flatten.",How to Butterfly a Chicken," The chicken should be breast-side down, with the backbone facing up.;
, Start on one side at the bottom cavity and cut a straight path to the top cavity. Make the same cut on the other side of the backbone.


Stay as close to the backbone as possible. The closer the cut is to the backbone, the less meat you'll lose.
Use sharp, durable kitchen shears. Sawing the backbone away with a knife will be much more difficult and may increase your chances of accidentally getting cut.

, You should be able to lift the backbone out using your fingers and without needing to do any additional cutting.


Freeze the backbone, if desired. Chicken backbones can be used to create stock or soup.

, The bird should now be breast-side up, with the opened back facing your cutting board.

, Press down on the wing and leg joints using the heels of your hands. Use your body weight to apply as much pressure as possible.

, Adjust the oven rack to the middle position so that there is enough room to fit your roasting pan.

, Use a gentle patting motion to dry the outside of the chicken Do not scrub the skin dry and do not dry the inside of the chicken.


Use paper towels. Avoid using cloth dish towels. Salmonella and other bacteria could be lurking on the surface of the bird, making disposable paper towels a much healthier option.
Think twice before rinsing the chicken. Home cooks have been rinsing chicken for years, but the USDA actually warns against doing so since bacteria on the raw chicken spreads more easily through water and could contaminate other surfaces. If you do decide to rinse the chicken to remove blood, only use cold water.

, Use your hands to evenly rub 1 teaspoon (5 ml) of salt and 1 teaspoon (5 ml) of pepper over the skin of the chicken.


You can use more or less salt and pepper, if desired. The correct amount is mostly a matter of personal taste.
Add thyme, rosemary, and basil for a more aromatic blend. Mix about 1 tsp (5 ml) of each herb to create a blend before spreading it over the chicken. Salt and pepper to taste. Create a spicier blend with paprika, chili, garlic, parsley, and oregano. Mix together 1 tsp (5 ml) paprika, 1/4 tsp (1.25 ml) chili powder, 1/4 tsp (1.25 ml) garlic powder, 1/2 cup (118 ml) fresh chopped parsley, and 1/4 cup (60 ml) fresh chopped oregano. Also salt and pepper the chicken to taste.
Rub some of the seasoning blend beneath the skin. Doing so gets the flavor of the seasonings onto the meat, preventing the flavor from sticking to the skin alone. This is especially important if using spices other than salt and pepper.

, Center the chicken in the pan, open-side down and breast-side up.


Point the wings inward. Since there is less meat on the wings, they should be pointed in toward the legs to prevent them from cooking too quickly. You can also leave them flat in the roasting pan, but the meat is more likely to dry out if left flat.

, Many cooks prefer to roast vegetables alongside the chicken in order to add another dimension of flavor to both the vegetables and the chicken.


Peel and cut four potatoes. You can cut the potatoes into wedges or 1/2-inch (1.25-mm) slices. Slide the potatoes in between the chicken and the sides of the pan.
Create a vegetable medley. Cut 1 red onion, 2 zucchini, and 2 yellow squash into 1/2-inch (1.25-mm) slices. Surround the chicken with the vegetables, distributing each vegetable evenly around the chicken., Melt 3 Tbsp (45 ml) of unsalted butter and spread the butter over the top of the chicken with a pastry brush. Only use as much of the butter as necessary to lightly coat the skin.


Pour the remaining butter over the vegetables in the pan, if you added them. Give the vegetables a quick toss with a fork to coat them evenly with the butter.
Substitute olive oil in place of the melted butter for a healthier alternative. Olive oil will add enough moisture and flavor to the meat, but it tends to have a lighter taste and less cholesterol.

, After the first 30 minutes, rotate the pan 180 degrees.

, The skin should be golden-brown and slightly crispy. Turn off the oven and remove the chicken.


Check to make sure its done using a meat thermometer. Insert the thermometer into the thickest part of the meat, but do not allow the thermometer to touch the bone since the bone will be hotter than the meat itself. The internal temperature of the meat must reach 160 degrees Fahrenheit (70 degrees Celsius).

, Allow the chicken to rest for 15 minutes before carving to let the juices redistribute.

, The chicken should be breast-side down, with the backbone facing up.


Spatchcocking is slightly different from butterflying because the breast bone is removed along with the backbone, allowing the bird to become even flatter than it would be if butterflied. It is primarily used for smaller fowl, such as Cornish game hens and pheasants. It can also be used with chickens, however.

, Start on one side of the backbone and cut a straight line from one cavity the other. Repeat the cut on the other side of the backbone.


Use sharp, sturdy kitchen shears. Shears will allow you to safely make clean cuts, but sawing out the backbone with a knife will increase your odds of accidentally cutting yourself.
Make the cuts as close to the backbone as possible. Cutting too far away from the backbone will cause you to lose more meat.

, You should be able to lift it out with your fingers.


Save the backbone for later use. Chicken backbones can be frozen and used later for stock or soup.

,


The breast bone will be diamond-shaped.

, Trace the perimeter of the bone with your knife, but do not cut through the breast meat beneath. Slide your fingers beneath one side of the bone and pry it out.


Use a paring knife to make the initial cut. Since you don't want to make a clean cut through the meat, you should avoid using kitchen shears. A paring knife will allow you to cut into the meat without cutting through it.
Use kitchen shears to separate the bone from the meat. The breast bone may stick to the breast meat beneath the bone, making it difficult to pull the bone out. If this happens, use your kitchen shears to snip away at the meat directly beneath the bone in order to detach it.

, The breast-side should face up and the opening should be flat on the carving board. The legs should face inward, touching slightly."

Learn about different cuts.,
Know about broilers, fryers, and roasters.,
Understand stewing chicken.,
Learn about capons.,
Think about meat from roosters.,
Pick chicken with a good “use by” or “sell by” date.,
Examine the chicken.,
Purchase chicken from a farmer’s market or butcher, if possible.",How to Choose the Right Cut of Chicken1," Chicken is a relatively simple meat to understand in terms of different cuts. This is because the chicken is divided into two major cuts, the breast and the legs. From there, chicken is divided into smaller cuts.


Breast is the upper part of the chicken and consists mostly of white meat. Tenderloins are a part of the larger breast cut.
The leg includes the upper thigh and drumstick, and consists of darker meat.;
, This meat is from young chickens and can be used for a wide variety of dishes. Thus, this is some of the most versatile and sought-after chicken meat.


As the names imply, this chicken is good for broiling, frying, or roasting. It can be used, however, for a wide variety of other dishes.
This is some of the most common chicken you’ll find in supermarkets., Stewing chicken meat tends to be tougher and stringier than other meat. Thus, people often use it for stews, soups, and similar dishes.


Stewing chicken is often from older chickens.
Many people tend to prefer dark meat from stewing chickens for chicken soup and similar dishes., Capon meat has much more fat on it than other types of chicken. In addition, its meat has more flavor and is more tender. Thus, capon meat is popular for a wide variety of dishes.


Many people prefer to roast, bake, or sauté capon meat.
Capon meat is widely available at butchers and supermarkets.
Capons are roosters that have been castrated., This meat tends to be very lean and has low fat content. The meat, though, tends to be stringy or ropey. Thus, people tend to use it for stews, braises, and certain traditional foods.


You probably won’t be able to find rooster meat in the grocery store.
If you want rooster meat, you may want to visit an Asian market near you., The use by date is a recommendation from the grocery store concerning the freshness and safety of the food. If you buy a chicken with a use by date that expires soon, you may be getting chicken on its way to being spoiled.


Depending on refrigeration and whether preservatives were used, chicken might have a couple of weeks before the use by or sell by dates expire.
Try to pick the cut of chicken that has the longest time left before expiration.
Uncooked chicken usually lasts 1 or 2 days before spoiling after you open it., Before picking a chicken, make sure to examine it. By handling it and smelling it, you’ll gain a lot of information about whether it is a good cut of meat. Without doing this, you may wind up picking what seems to be the right cut of meat, but it could be loaded with preservatives or even be partially spoiled. Avoid chicken that:


Smells sour.
Has a chemical smell. This means it may contain substantial amounts of preservatives.
Looks yellow or green. However, make sure to distinguish the light yellow fat on some cuts of meat from pieces that have soured., Perhaps the best cuts of chicken you can buy are those you’ll get at farmer’s markets or fresh from farmers or butchers. These cuts tend to be very fresh.


These cuts may not have any preservatives intended to prolong their shelf life.
You’ll be able to verify the type of diet the chickens consumed and whether they were given antibiotics."
"
Buy chicken breasts.,
Rub each chicken breast with olive oil or another similar oil.,
Season your chicken according to preference.,
Preheat your broiler.,
Place your seasoned chicken breasts on an oven-proof cooking sheet.,
Put your cooking sheet with the seasoned chicken under the broiler.,
Leave the broiler door ajar during the entire broiling process.

,
Watch carefully as you make broiled chicken.,
Turn chicken over with metal tongs when one side has browned.,
Brush the exposed side of the chicken with a basting of barbecue sauce, olive oil, Italian dressing or other marinade.,
Brown the chicken until the breasts are fully cooked.",How to Broil Chicken Breasts," You can purchase either fresh or frozen chicken breasts. If you choose frozen chicken breasts, however, keep in mind that you'll have to completely defrost them before broiling. You can broil chicken breasts with or without skin.;
, To do so, you can use your fingers or a pastry brush. The olive oil adds flavor and helps the seasonings adhere better to each chicken breast.

, Choose from pre-made or homemade seasoning combinations. Nearly all seasoning will include both salt and pepper. Other herbs and spices could include any combination of garlic, thyme, fennel and more.

, Depending on the make and model of your broiler, this could take up to 10 minutes.

, Spray with a nonstick substance to prevent sticking. Space each chicken breast several inches from each other so they don't touch while broiling.

, The meat should be approximately 5 to 6 inches (12.5 to 15 cm) from the heat source.

,, Broilers are extremely hot and chicken can easily burn if not monitored. Place foil on the edges of the chicken breasts if they begin to brown to prevent burning on the thinner parts of the chicken.

, Don't use a fork to turn over the chicken breasts. Piercing the chicken will cause the juices to escape and make your chicken dry.

, Additional basting keeps the chicken moist, even when broiled at extreme temperatures.

, Cooking times will vary depending on the thickness of the chicken breast. Chicken is done when the juices run clear and it has reached an internal temperature of 170 degrees Fahrenheit (about 77 degrees Celsius). This can be checked with a meat thermometer.

Place your roasted chicken on a carving board, breast side up.,
Wait at least ten minutes.,
Gather your carving tools.,
Start with the legs (thigh and drumstick).,
Remove the drumsticks from the thighs.,
Carve the breasts.,
Make a deep vertical cut along one side of the breastbone, using the breastbone as a guide.,
Remove the wings.,
Pick the carcass clean.",How to Carve a Roasted Chicken," Cover it with foil to help it finish cooking. Unless your cutting board has grooves to catch juices, you’ll want to place it inside a cookie sheet with sides in order to catch the juices. You can also carve on a plate., Some chefs recommend up to 30 minutes. This keeps the bird moist by allowing the moisture pushed out during cooking to redistribute throughout the meat., You’ll need a well-sharpened boning knife, sturdy fork, and serving plates or a platter. Have paper towels or a rag handy to wipe your hands and clean up any mess you make as you go.A boning knife has a long, thin blade with a curved tip. The blade can be stiff or flexible. Flexible blades are preferred for poultry.If you don’t have a boning knife, any long thin knife will work. You can even use a chef’s knife if desperate, but expect things to get a little messy.

, Pull a leg away from the chicken, rotating so that it pops out of joint, and cut through the connective tissue. Repeat with the other leg.If you cannot cut through, you may have hit bone. Move the knife closer to the joint and try again.If you are having trouble removing the leg, you may want to first try cutting around the top and bottom of the leg.Another method is to set the chicken breast-side down, make a cut to reveal the joint, and then rotate and bend the leg away from the body until it pops out of joint. Use the knife to cut through any remaining skin or cartilage.As you separate the leg, be sure to get the “oyster”, a delicious bit of meat towards the back of the chicken, just above the thigh. You can scrape it free with the tip of your knife., Place the leg skin side down on the cutting board. Locate the joint that connects the thigh to the drumstick and cut straight down as you pull apart. If you meet resistance, reposition the knife and try again. Repeat with the other drumstick., Magazines like to show the cook carving slices straight off the breast, but that technique requires a very sharp knife and lots of practice. It is easier to remove the entire breast before carving it.

, Work the knife down and from the tail end to the wing end of the chicken. As you cut, work the meat away from the ribcage until the entire breast has been removed. Repeat with the other breast.If you are having difficulty removing the breast, try making a second cut along the bottom of the breast and perpendicular to the first (towards the chicken’s ribcage).You can serve the breasts whole, cut into large pieces, or sliced thinly, as you prefer.

, Pull the wings away from the carcass and cut through the connective tissue at the second joint. They should come off with one swift cut., Don’t be afraid to get your fingers dirty! There are bits of chicken that you simply can’t get off with a knife. Feel free to pick them off and save them for soup or chicken salad. The carcass can be boiled to make chicken stock.

Pick how you will cook your meal.,
Determine how much time you have.,
Compare the cost of different cuts.,
Save money by buying in bulk.",How to Choose the Right Cut of Chicken2," The method of cooking your chicken is extremely important in determining the cut of meat you should use. This is because the thickness, flavor, and texture of a cut will be impacted by the cooking process.


If you choose to bake your chicken, you can pick just about any specific cut of meat, but the amount of time you bake may vary on thickness.
You can fry (pan fry or deep fry) just about any cut of meat, but make sure to fry thicker pieces longer and to pull out smaller pieces so they don’t overcook.
If you decide to grill or BBQ your chicken, you’ll have to make sure you cook specific pieces for longer or shorter amounts of time as they may dry out.
When stewing meat, you’ll want to either drop in whole pieces and allow them to fall apart in the stew or broth, or you can precut them.
Make sure you're prepared for the slow cooking process. You may need to invest in a slow cooker or a crock pot., The more time you have, the more choices you have when it comes to the specific cut of chicken. Thus, you should determine exactly how much time you have before you pick a specific cut of chicken.


The bigger and fleshier the piece of meat, the longer you’ll need to cook it. Thus, make sure you reserve long periods of time, like an hour or more, for large pieces like breasts or even entire birds.
If you have very little time, you should choose a small cut of meat. For example, pick wings or legs if you need to grill chicken in less than half an hour., When choosing the right cut of chicken, you need to consider the costs of each one. Ultimately, the cost of each cut might influence what dish you prepare.


The cost of different cuts of chicken will vary based on region.
Breast fillet and breast tenderloin are the most expensive cuts of chicken.
Wings and drumsticks are often the cheapest pieces of the chicken.
Whole chickens, on the average, are substantially cheaper than buying individual cuts., You can potentially save a lot of money by buying chicken in bulk. In the end, you'll be able to drastically lower the cost of any cut of chicken you want by buying in quantity.


Purchase chicken at a wholesaler like Costco, Sam's Club, or BJ's.
Freeze chicken you won't use within a few days.
Buy chicken from a farmer or at a farmer's market.
Purchase whole chickens and cut them up yourself."
"
Choose your recipe.,
Cook wings.,
Prepare breasts.,
Use a whole chicken.,
Cook thighs and drumsticks.",How to Choose the Right Cut of Chicken3," Depending on the recipe, you’ll need to pick a specific cut of meat. Without picking the right cut of meat for your recipe, your dish won’t appear or taste right. Ultimately, though, there are countless recipes for you to choose before you pick a cut of meat.


Follow the recipe directions carefully. If it tells you to use breast meat, use breast meat.
Many roasted or broiled chicken recipes often call for white meat cuts like the breast.
Dark meat, the leg cut, is often used for stews and soups.
People often use both breast and leg cuts for fried chicken., Chicken wings are one of the most popular chicken dishes. Because of this, there is a wide variety of recipes you can choose from when cooking chicken wings. Consider some of the following:


Baked parmesan garlic chicken wings
Crispy buffalo wings
Slow-cooker barbecue wings, As the meatiest part of the chicken, many people prefer the chicken breast above other cuts. Fortunately, there are many ways to prepare chicken breast. Consider:


Lemon herb grilled chicken
Honey mustard chicken breast

Fried chicken breast, You can also use the entire chicken to prepare a meal for the whole family. By cooking the whole chicken, you'll be able to use all of the cuts of the chicken. Think about these different recipes for an entire chicken:


Roast chicken
Teriyaki chicken
Sage and garlic chicken, Thighs and drumsticks are a popular chicken dish. Drumsticks especially are a great dish to serve as appetizers, at barbeques, or other events. Try:


Grilled drumsticks
Deep fried drumsticks
Soy drumsticks

Cook the chicken whole or cut it into parts.",How to Butcher a Chicken," Place the chicken directly in the stream of cold water from a faucet. As you wash the chicken, pull out any pin feathers that may still be embedded in the skin.


Use an outdoor sink if you have one available, since washing a chicken can be a messy job.
Shake off the excess water when you're finished.;
, Lay the chicken on its back on a large cutting board. Use a butcher knife to apply pressure on one of the leg joints where the top of the foot meets the bottom of the drumstick. Press down to cut off the foot. Repeat to cut off the other foot.


Make sure to place the knife directly in the joint, between the two tendons, for a clean slice. You shouldn't have to slice through bone.
Discard the feet, unless you plan to use them in a recipe.

, Stretch the neck across the cutting board, and use a knife to slice into the top of the neck just below the head. Pull the head upwards and slice through the esophagus and trachea. Discard the head.

, Lay the chicken on its back and stretch out the neck. Use the knife to make a horizontal slice into the neck skin about halfway down. Make two vertical slices from the first slice to the top of the neck. Insert your fingers at the horizontal cut, grip the skin, and pull it off the neck.


Use the knife to help loosen the skin as you pull it back.

, First identify the esophagus, a soft tube that runs the length of the neck. Pull it up from the neck and find the crop, a fleshy sac the chicken uses to store food, nestled at the base of the neck near the breasts. Loosen the crop and pull it free from the chicken.


The crop is attached tightly to the body of the chicken, so you'll have to work it free.
Take care not to break the crop open, since it it is likely to contain food the bird was in the process of digesting. If you do break it open, just remove as much of the tissue and its contents as possible.
If the crop is empty of food, it may be more difficult to locate. It will be lying flat against the breast.

, Push down the neck skin and place the neck against the cutting board. Use the knife to slice around the meat at the base of the neck on all sides, cutting around the bone. Using one hand to steady the body, grasp the neck with the other hand and twist it off.


You may find it easier to pick up the chicken and twist off the neck with one hand.
Either discard the neck or save it to make chicken stock.

, The glad is a flap at the tail of the bird. Use a knife to cut about half an inch up the tail, and slice off the gland. Discard it.

, With the chicken on its back, use the knife to make a slice right above the cloaca at the tail end of the bird. Insert your fingers into the hole and pull it larger.


Avoid slicing into internal organs when you make the cut.
Since enlarging the hole will put pressure on the intestines, feces might leak out. If this happens, wash the chicken right away.

, With the chicken on its back, place one hand on the breast area of the chicken to steady it. Reach your other hand into the cavity you created, over the top of the internal organs. Close your hand around the guts and pull them outward. Repeat until all the guts have been removed.


This process should be done slowly and carefully. Take extra care not to break the gall bladder, which is a small greenish organ.
When all the guts have been removed, find the gall bladder and make sure it isn't broken. If it is, the chicken meat has been contaminated by bile.
The intestine will still be attached to the chicken with the intestinal vent. Use the knife to cut this away, making sure not to cut open the intestine itself.
Discard the guts, or keep the gizzards and livers to use in a recipe.

, The heart is located at the center of the chicken's chest, and the lungs are attached to its backbone. Use your fingers to gently detach the organs and pull them out.

, Thoroughly wash the chicken both inside and outside the cavity. Make sure no tissue or blood remains in the chicken. Pat it dry with paper towels when you are finished.

, If you aren't planning to cook the chicken right away, make sure it is stored properly. Do not leave a chicken at room temperature for more than a few minutes after it has been butchered.

, Consider making whole roasted chicken, or cutting the meat into wings, thighs and breasts for individual meals.

Go slowly.",How to Clean Chicken Gizzards," You can either raise your own chickens for slaughter or purchase your chicken products at a grocery store or local butcher shop. They are also sometimes available at farmer’s markets. It’s even possible to order gizzards online via various grocery delivery programs, including some on Amazon., Wipe down your countertop, butcher block, or cutting board with a clean, wet towel. Locating your workspace near a sink is a good idea as it makes it easier to wash your hands and rinse off items as needed., Many people believe that it is a good idea to use your sharpest knives to butcher a chicken and to clean out a gizzard. Others argue that the grit within the gizzard can damage sharp knives and that only dull ones should be used. It is your choice as to what you select, but be aware that it may be more difficult to remove the thin membrane with a dull knife.If you choose to use a chopping board, make sure that it is one that is heavy and won’t move while you are cutting into the gizzard. Plastic cutting boards are usually more sanitary than wood ones, but they have a tendency to be lighter and move more.

, Rinse off your knives with soap and water before placing them on your work area. As a last step, keep the water on warm and lather your hands up with soap. Rinse your hands under the water until they are completely clean. Dry them with a fresh towel.If you choose to wear gloves, make sure that they are well-fitting. Gloves that are too loose can make it more difficult to hold on to the gizzard.

, If you bought a whole chicken frozen, place it in the refrigerator until it is fully thawed. It should take 24 hours of fridge thawing time per five pounds of meat. It is also possible to thaw the gizzards by placing them in a sealed plastic bag and then submerging them in a sink filled with cold water. Drain and refill the sink with cold water every 30 minutes until the gizzards are thawed. Estimate 30-60 minutes of thawing time per pound using the cold water method.If you thaw your gizzards in the sink, make sure that the plastic bag stays sealed to prevent the spread of potentially dangerous bacteria or germs. Wipe down the sink with an antibacterial cleaner after use.

, If you bought a chicken whole, after it is defrosted, you’ll want to reach inside the cavity and remove the plastic giblet package. This package will contain the neck, kidneys, heart, and gizzards. Pull out the gizzards to use., If you are butchering a fresh chicken, then you will want to look for the gizzard at the end of the intestines. It will almost look like a second stomach. Reach your hand into the interior cavity and gently lift the gizzards out, taking some of the intestine with you if necessary. Just make sure to keep the intestines intact or you could risk polluting the meat and gizzard., Go slowly and be very careful as they can be a bit slippery. If the gizzards are covered in blood or debris, then rinse them with water before setting them down., Hold the gizzard down firmly, but not enough to change the overall shape. Take your knife and cut the gizzard in half, slicing all the way through until you have two separate pieces. It is best to make just one smooth cut per gizzard., Once you make the incision, you will see a variety of debris inside the gizzard. Rinse out the inside of the gizzard, moving the water stream around in order to clean out all of the debris. It may take you several minutes to complete this process. Keep going until the flesh looks totally clean.This cleaning process is very important because the gizzard is a part of a chicken’s digestive system and can have matter inside that is not safe for human consumption., As you hold the gizzard under water, it might be helpful to use your fingers to rub against the flesh of the interior to loosen any stubborn debris. Keep gently scrubbing until you feel that everything is smooth.Be aware that the inside of a gizzard can appear to be brown or black due to the presence of sediment. This is a natural and not a cause for a concern if the gizzard is properly rinsed.
The debris can sometimes be rather larger and include pieces of rock and grass., When the interior of the gizzard is clean, you will see a yellow-tinted lining in the inside. Remove the lining by peeling it away from the rest of the gizzard’s flesh. It should come off fairly easily, but you may need to make a slight cut at the side of the gizzard to start the separation process.The lining can be differentiated from the edible flesh because it will feel rubbery in texture., When the lining has been removed and discarded, rinse the gizzards again with water. Then, place them on a fresh cutting board, patting them dry with paper towels. Keep going until there is very little moisture visible on the skin of the gizzard., Place the cleaned gizzards in a container until you are ready to cook them. Make sure that the container is tightly sealed and is clean on the inside to avoid cross-contamination., Go through and wash all of your knives and cutting boards under warm water and soap or place them in the dishwasher under the sanitize function. When everything else is clean and wiped down, go ahead and do a final hand wash.Don’t forget to wipe down the counter space with a cleaner.

, You can prepare gizzards in a variety of ways, including boiling, baking, frying, or simmering. Experiment with different methods until you find one that you prefer. Many people place the gizzards in brine for at least a few hours before cooking in order to improve the texture. Look for a great brine recipe online and then adapt it to suit your personal tastes., Throughout the entire preparation and cooking process, make sure to take your time. Otherwise, you might injure yourself with a knife or damage the gizzard beyond use. It is better to go slowly and create an edible final product. If it is your first time cleaning gizzards, buy a few extra just to be on the safe side."

Defrost your chicken if it has been frozen.,
Wash your chicken.,
Give your chicken some extra flavor.,
Flatten the chicken.,
Line the bottom of the broiler tray beneath the grate with aluminum foil.,
Preheat the broiler to 180 °F (82 °C).








,
Place the broiler tray directly beneath the broiler element.,
Broil the chicken.,
Take the chicken out once it has browned on one side.,
Continue broiling the chicken for an additional 5 to 10 minutes.,
Check the internal temperature of the chicken.,
Turn off the broiler element.,
Rub more sauce on the chicken (optional).",How to Broil Chicken," The best way to do this is to transfer the wrapped chicken from your freezer to your fridge 24 hours before you want to cook. If you are on a tighter schedule, there are other methods to defrost chicken that take less time.






;
, Hold your chicken under cold running water. Make sure that you do not use warm or hot water because hot water can lead to bacterial growth.








, There is a limitless number of ways you can flavor your chicken. Get creative and try new combinations of seasonings and marinades. If you are following a specific recipe, add your seasonings now. Don’t forget salt and pepper!








Oil and season your chicken. Rub cooking oil such as olive oil on the chicken to get a crispier outside texture. Add seasonings like thyme, oregano, lemon, garlic, or any other herb or seasoning to add some pizzazz to your poultry. You can also use a store bought rub like Cajun or spicy chili rub. To most thoroughly coat the chicken, pour the oil and seasonings into a plastic, sealable bag. Put the chicken inside, seal the bag, and shake.

Marinate your chicken. Pour your marinade into a bowl and let the chicken soak in the marinade for two to eight hours. Make sure to keep the chicken and marinade in the fridge while it soaks. Leaving it for eight hours or more will ensure the most flavorful results.

Brine your chicken. Brine gives chicken an extra salty flavor and can be combined with many different seasonings. Mix coarse salt into warm water and add your desired seasonings. Some people also add sugar to their brine. Let the chicken soak in the brine for two to eight hours (keep it in the fridge while it is soaking.)

, Make the chicken as flat as possible before broiling to help ensure an even cooking. Butterfly the chicken if you’re using a whole breast or bird.







, Do this before you place the chicken on it. The foil will catch any drips from the chicken and will make cleanup easier. Do not line the grate itself with aluminum foil, as this will prevent the drippings from falling away from the element.








,, Do this if your broiler is at the top of your oven. Set the oven rack approximately 5 to 6 inches (12.7 to 15.2 cm) below the element so the chicken is right beneath the element if using an oven broiler.









If you do not have a broiler tray you can use a baking sheet instead.
If using a slide out broiler beneath the oven, set the broiler tray directly on the bottom rack.

, Broil thinner cuts for 10 minutes and thicker cuts for 15 minutes.








, Turn it over and rub a little bit of cooking oil (such as olive oil) on the uncooked side. Doing this will ensure that the chicken browns and gets a little crispy.









Use a spatula to turn the chicken over, rather than a fork. This will prevent the juices from escaping the meat before it's done.

, Keep in mind that if the chicken broils for too long, it could become very dry. Leave the chicken in until it has browned.








, Use a meat thermometer to determine whether or not the chicken is done. The internal temperature should be 180 °F (82 °C) for chicken thighs and drumsticks, 170 °F (77 °C) for breast meat and 165 °F (74 °C) for patties.








If you do not have a meat thermometer, take the chicken out and make a small cut in it. If the chicken meat is pink or shiny and grayish looking, it is not done. Your chicken should be white and opaque.
You should also check the color of the juices. The chicken juices will run clear when it is cooked all the way through.

, Remove the chicken when it is cooked through.








, After you take the chicken out of the broiler, you can give it a little extra flavor by adding sauce. Apply the sauce to the chicken with a cooking brush, butter knife, or spoon.

Put the rest in a small, airtight container and store it in your pantry. It should last there for several months.;
, In a medium bowl, whisk or stir together the flour, salt, pepper, thyme, tarragon, ginger, ground mustard, garlic salt, and oregano until the ingredients appear to be evenly distributed.You should have just enough coating mix for this recipe, so you should not need to save any. If you choose to make a double batch, however, take what you need for this recipe and save the rest in an airtight container. It should last in your pantry for a few months, as well.

, Rinse the chicken under cool running water and pat it dry with clean paper towels.

,


Extend one leg as far away from the body as possible and cut through the skin to reveal the inner meat.
Bend the leg back until the ball joint pops out of the socket.
Cut the leg off from the body, slicing through the joint as-as close the-the backbone as possible.
Repeat this process with the other leg.

, Look for the line of fat lying in between the drumstick and thigh portion of one leg. Cut along this line to separate the two portions.


Repeat this step with the other leg.
Note that this line of fat marks the location of the joint, and it is the joint itself that you need to cut through.

, Cut through the ribs and collarbone on both sides of the body of the chicken using sharp, clean poultry shears. Pull away the back and the neck when finished.


You should be able to remove the back and neck in one piece.
These portions are usually discarded, but you can also save them for use in chicken stock. Place them in a sealed bag or container and refrigerate for up to 3 or 4 days.

, Cut and twist the breast meat away from the remaining bone.


Turn the chicken so that it lies with the breast skin facing down.
Draw your knife through the breast, splitting it from the neck end to the breast bone. Score down the length of the breastbone, as well.
Place your thumbs on either side of the breastbone and bend the breast portion of the chicken back until the top of the bone starts peeking out. Loosen the bone with your fingers and pull it out.
Split the rest of the breast meat in half using your knife. Make the cut along the mark left by the breast bone.

, Cut off one wing at the joint nearest the breast meat, then separate the wing into two pieces by cutting in between the second wing joint.


Repeat this with the second wing.
You should leave some of the breast meat attached when separating the wing from the body of the chicken.

, Cut one side of the chicken breast in half, getting two pieces. Repeat with the other side of the chicken breast.


The pieces you cut away should be as equal in size as possible.

, Pour 4 cups (1 L) of water into a large bowl and add 1/4 cup (60 ml) salt. Stir to combine, then place the chicken pieces in the water and allow them to soak for 60 minutes.


Do not drain the chicken. You will remove it and add it directly to the coating mix when the times comes instead of letting the chicken dry first.

, Pour the canola oil into the pressure cooker and set the pressure cooker on the stove. Heat the oil on high until it reaches a temperature of 375 degrees Fahrenheit (190 degrees Celsius).


Make sure that your pressure cooker can be used on the stove. It should have a flat bottom, rather than sitting on elevated feet. Most pressure cookers are made from metals that are safe to use on the stove, but you should check the instructions that came with the pressure cooker to verify that stovetop use will not damage it.

, In a large bowl, combine the baking powder, 1 Tbsp (15 ml) Cajun seasoning, 1 cup (250 ml) frying mix, the cornstarch, the pepper, and the salt, whisking until everything appears to be evenly combined.

, Slowly pour up to 1/2 cup (125 ml) of water into the dry batter ingredients, whisking continuously. Stop adding water once you have a thin, smooth batter.


You may not need the full 1/2 cup (125 ml), so it is important that you add the water slowly. The batter should be thin, but if it becomes too watery, it may not adhere to the chicken.

, Remove a piece of chicken from the salt water using tongs and toss it directly into the batter. Use your tongs to turn the chicken in the batter until all sides are coated. Repeat this as needed, working with one piece of chicken at a time, until all the chicken has been coated.


Hold each piece of chicken over the bowl of salt water for a few seconds to allow the excess water to drip off. You need the skin to be moist, but it should not be dripping wet.
It is best to drop the chicken directly into the hot oil after coating it. If you place the chicken on a plate beforehand, some of the coating might wipe away.

, Fry each piece for 2 to 3 minutes or until the coating becomes crisp and lightly golden.


Remove the finished pieces of chicken from the hot oil using tongs and transfer them to a plate lined with several layers of clean paper towel. All pieces should be on this plate before you move onto the next step.

, After frying the chicken, pour off all but 1/4 cup (60 ml) of the oil.Add 1/4 cup (60 ml) of water to the pressure cooker, as well, before continuing on.


You should avoid using more than 1/4 cup (60 ml) of oil in your pressure cooker while the pressure cooking function is active. Oil and other fats rise to a much higher temperature than water and water-based liquids, and when heated in a pressure cooker, the oil could overheat and cause burns.
Make sure the water is warm to hot when you add it to the hot oil. Adding cold water could produce steam and cause the oil to splatter.
It is strongly recommended that you wear oven mitts when you do this step to avoid burning yourself on the oil or the hot pressure cooker.

, Put the chicken back in the pressure cooker. Tightly secure the lid onto the pressure cooker and cook the chicken inside for another 10 to 12 minutes, or until it is no longer pink in the middle.


Make sure that the pressure cooker trivet or rack is in place before you return the chicken to the basin and cover it.
Consult the manufacturer's instructions to determine how to engage the pressure regulator.
The pressure should usually be set to 15 lb (6.8 kg). Consult the instructions for brand-specific guidelines on pressure.
Do not attempt to open the pressure cooker during the cooking process.

, Pull up the pressure valve and allow the vapor to completely escape before unlatching and removing the lid.


You must allow the vapor to escape before you open the lid. If you open the lid too quickly, you could actually burn yourself on the burst of steam that will rush out.

, Remove the chicken with tongs and transfer the pieces to another plate lined in fresh paper towels. Allow the excess oil to drain off for about five minutes.


During this time, you are also allowing the chicken to cool slightly. While you'll want this chicken to be hot when you eat it, the internal temperatures will usually be a little too hot when you initially pull the chicken out of the pressure cooker.

, You should enjoy the chicken while it is still freshly cooked and warm.


The chicken can be saved, but it can become soggy when you reheat it, so it is best eaten when freshly cooked.
If you do choose to save the chicken, place it in an airtight container and refrigerate it for up to 4 or 5 days.

",How to Boil Chicken,";
, The skin and bone adds thickness to the chicken breasts, essentially doubling the amount of time they need to cook.

, These strips of chicken are very thin, so they usually finish cooking in 10 minutes or less. This amount of time also applies to boneless chicken breast cut into 2-inch (5-cm) pieces.

, The addition of a bone adds more cooking time to this cut. Moreover, as dark meat, thighs need to cook for a little longer than breasts.

, Since drumsticks have less meat on them than thighs, they do not usually need to cook for quite as long.

, Add another 10 to 20 minutes onto the cooking time for each additional 1 lb (450 g).

, The exact size stockpot you need may vary depending on how large your chicken pieces are and how much room they take up inside the pot. As a general rule, the chicken should take up roughly 1/4 to 1/3 of the space in your stockpot.


An 8-quart (8-liter) stockpot is fairly standard and will usually be enough to hold a whole chicken. A larger stockpot may be needed for birds bigger than 4 lb (1800 g), though.
You can use an 8-quart (8-liter) stockpot for boneless chicken breasts, but you could also opt for a smaller stockpot so that the water will boil faster.

, Pour enough cold water into the stockpot to cover the chicken completely.


Cold water is preferable to warm water.

, You can sprinkle anywhere from 1 tsp (5 ml) to 1 Tbsp (15 ml) salt into the water. A smaller amount is better for boneless chicken breasts and chicken tenders, but a larger amount may be better for whole chickens.


Note that the salt is only optional. You could boil the chicken without salt, but it will be much blander as a result.

, Cover the stockpot and boil the chicken on medium heat. Follow the recommended cooking time listed in this article for your cut of chicken.

, Place enough chicken broth into your stockpot to fill the stockpot halfway.

Chicken broth intensifies the flavor of the chicken, so it becomes less bland than chicken boiled in water.






You can use pre-made broth, but if you do not have pre-made broth, you can combine chicken broth granules with water. You usually need 1 tsp (5 ml) or one cube of chicken bouillon per 1 cup (250 ml) of water.






Use chicken stock instead of broth for an even richer, deeper flavor.







, Cutting the vegetables up allows more of the flavor to seep into the cooking liquid.

Peel the onions and cut them into halves or quarters.






Wash the carrots with water and slice them into 1-inch (2.5-cm) coins.






Rinse the celery and cut it into 1-inch (2.5-cm) slices.







, Transfer the chopped vegetables to the stockpot. The vegetables add dimension to the flavor of the broth.


Strictly speaking, the vegetables are not needed. Chicken can be boiled in plain broth.

, Transfer the chicken to the stockpot. If necessary, add more broth or water to the stockpot so that the chicken is completely covered.

, Bring the broth the a boil over high heat. Cover the pot, and reduce the heat to medium or medium-low so that the chicken simmers slowly.


Cook according to the recommended cooking times listed in this article.
Remove the chicken with tongs or a slotted spoon when done.






If desired, strain the cooking liquid and save the broth as stock for future recipes. You can store stock in the refrigerator for 3 days or in the freezer for 2 months.
You will likely end up discarding the vegetables used in this recipe, since the texture will turn mushy. The primary purpose of the vegetables in this recipe is to add flavor, not to serve as a side dish.

, Pile the chicken into your stockpot and cover with enough water and apple juice to completely cover the chicken.

For a stronger apple flavor, pour 2 quarts (2 liters) of apple juice into the stockpot before filling the rest of the stockpot up with enough water to cover the chicken.






For a more subtle apple flavor, pour equal parts apple juice and water into the stockpot simultaneously.






You could also use apple cider instead of apple juice. Apple cider tends to have a sharper taste, which some find preferable to the milder taste of apple juice.






Make sure that the combination of chicken, water, and apple juice fills between 1/2 and 3/4 of the stockpot.

, The savory taste of the vegetables in this recipe balances out the natural sweetness of the apple juice.

Peel the onion and cut it into halves or quarters.






Rinse the carrots under running water and cut them into 1-inch (2.5-cm) coins.






If using cloves of garlic, mince 4 cloves of garlic. If using garlic powder, use 1/2 tsp (2.5 ml) of the seasoning.






You can use anywhere between 1 tsp (5 ml) and 1 Tbsp (15 ml) chopped fresh thyme. If using dried thyme, cut this down to 1/3 the amount.







, Disperse the onion, carrots, garlic, and thyme in the apple juice mixture.

, Bring the liquid up to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat so that the liquid only simmers, then cover and let cook according to the amount of time indicated in the ""cooking times"" section.

, About 10 minutes before the chicken finishes cooking, begin preparing the apple. Peel the apple, core it, and cut it into small slices.


The addition of the apple near the end of the cooking time will infuse an even stronger apple flavor into the chicken.

, Strain out the chicken when done and serve without any of the vegetables, fruit, seasonings, or cooking liquid.


The other ingredients serve to infuse the chicken with flavor as it cooks. The ingredients themselves, however, will be too soft and mushy to be very appetizing at this point.

, Add the dry white wine and chicken broth first. Then, fill the pot with enough water to reach the halfway point.

Wine can infuse chicken meat with a tremendous amount of flavor, but using too much could be overpowering.






Only use chicken broth in equal parts with the wine. Otherwise, the flavor of the chicken broth could end up competing with the flavor of the wine.






Dilute with water only as necessary.

, Toss the pearl onions, salt, pepper, garlic, parsley, oregano, and thyme into the cooking liquid.


Pearl onions do not need to be cut beforehand.






If you do not have pre-minced garlic on hand, you could mince or crush 6 cloves of garlic instead.






If using fresh herbs, add 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of each herb. For dried herbs, cut this amount down to 1 tsp (5 ml) each.







, Bring the cooking liquid up to a boil over medium-high heat. Let sit at this temperature for 2 to 5 minutes before reducing to a simmer.


Doing this allows some of the flavor of the seasoning to be released and some of the bitterness of the wine to cook off.

, Add the chicken to the cooking liquid using tongs. Bring the liquid back up to a boil before reducing the heat again.

, Cover the stockpot and boil the chicken at a steady simmer for the recommended cooking time indicated.


Serve the chicken only. The liquid and other ingredients are meant to add flavor, not to be served alongside the chicken.

Prepare the chicken breasts.,
Place the chicken breasts into a re-sealable plastic bag.,
Add 2 beaten eggs into the bag.,
Seal and shake the bag.,
Add the bread crumbs and other seasonings.,
Seal and shake the bag again.,
Cook the chicken breasts according to your recipe.",How to Bread Chicken2," Rinse the chicken breasts, cut away any excess fat, then pat them dry with a paper towel. Pound them into cutlets or cut them into smaller pieces, depending on your method of cooking and recipe.

, Get a large, sturdy, Ziploc bag that's large enough to hold 1 gallon (3.8 liters). The bag must be sturdy, otherwise it may rip during the next few steps.

, Crack the eggs into a small cup first, then beat them with a fork until they turn pale yellow. Pour the beaten eggs into the bag right over the chicken breasts.

, Zip the bag shut firmly, then shake the bag to coat the chicken. You can also move the chicken breasts around with your fingers, turn the bag upside down, or toss it around. Make sure that the chicken breasts are evenly coated.

, Plan on using about 1½ cups (135 grams) of bread crumbs. It is better to use too much and have some left over than not using enough and getting a clumpy mess. If you want fancier breaded chicken, add in some seasonings, such as salt, dried herbs, or grated Parmesan cheese.

, Be careful not to touch the chicken breasts too much during this step, even through the bag. This will prevent the bread crumbs from accidentally rubbing off. Keep shaking the bag until the chicken breasts are evenly coated with bread crumbs. Don't worry if you have some crumbs left in the bottom of the bag.


Discard any left over mixture. Do not reuse it.

, Use a pair of kitchen tongs to pull the chicken breasts out of the bag. You can cook them by frying or baking. Make sure that you could them thoroughly; chicken is not like beef and must be fully cooked.

"
"
Fill a large, cast iron skillet with your desired cooking oil.,
Heat the oil over high heat.,
Place the breaded chicken breasts into the oil.,
Fry the chicken for about 3 minutes.,
Flip the chicken and continue frying it for another 3 minutes.,
Drain the chicken on a wire cooling rack.,
Serve the chicken.",How to Bread Chicken3," Choose a neutral-tasting cooking oil that has a high cooking point. The following oils are great choices: canola, peanut, or vegetable.Fill the skillet with ¼ inch (0.64 centimeter) of your chosen oil.Don't use extra-virgin olive oil; it'll give the chicken a bitter taste.
Use two skillets at the same time to speed things up.

, You are ready for the next step when the oil is simmering and almost smoking. It should read about 375°F (191°C) on an instant-read thermometer., It's best if you do this with a pair of tongs, but you can use your fingers if you are careful. To prevent the oil from splattering onto you, lay the chicken away from you., Gently swirl the pan to help distribute the oil. If you need to, rotate the cutlets around to help them brown evenly. Keep the oil at a steady bubble, and fry the chicken until it is browned and crispy on the bottom. This will typically take about 3 minutes., You can do this with a pair of tongs or a spatula. Keep cooking the chicken until it is brown and crispy on both sides, about 3 minutes. The juices should run clear if you stick a skewer into it.

, You can use paper towels, but this will make the chicken soggy. If you want to keep the chicken nice and crispy, set it down onto a wire cooling rack. Slide a foil-lined baking sheet under the rack to catch any drips and protect your counter., Tartar sauce, ketchup, and lemon wedges are all popular garnishes, but you can serve the chicken however you like.

Before you begin cooking, remove your chicken from the refrigerator and spread it out on a plate. Allow 20-30 minutes for the chicken to sit before you begin cooking.Bacteria begins to grow if raw chicken is left unrefrigerated for more than 2 hours.;
, The next step in preparing your chicken is to trim any fat using a sharp knife, and discard the fat. Then rinse your pieces of chicken under cold water.







, Your pieces of chicken need to be dry in order to properly brown. Using paper towels, carefully blot each piece of chicken on both sides until it is dry.







, To brown your chicken, you’ll want to use either olive oil, canola oil, corn oil, or butter. Measure out 1-2 Tablespoons of your chosen oil and add it to a heavy skillet. Then heat this over medium-high heat until hot.








Non-stick pans are not designed to be used for high-heat cooking.Instead, use a stainless steel or iron skillet.

, If your recipe asks you to season the chicken, now is the time to do so. Sprinkle salt, pepper, or other seasoning on each side of each piece of chicken.







, Use tongs to place the chicken in a single layer without crowding it. If the chicken is too crowded in the pan, it will steam rather than brown. If you have more chicken than will fit in your skillet, brown your chicken in two or more rounds.







, Leave the chicken to cook in the pan on medium-high heat for 8-10 minutes. It is important not to flip, turn, or stir the chicken during this time.







, Using a set of tongs, carefully flip each piece of chicken. If the chicken sticks to the bottom of the pan, give it another minute before flipping. After your chicken is flipped, give it another 8-10 minutes to brown on the other side.







, After the chicken has been browned on each side, remove each piece of chicken using tongs. Place your chicken on a clean plate and set it aside.







, If you were not able to fit all of your chicken into your skillet without crowding, you’ll need to repeat this process with the rest of your chicken. Begin by adding 1-2 teaspoons of fresh oil to your hot pan, then add your chicken. Cook it on each side, then remove it from the pan.







, Now that all of your chicken has been browned, you can continue with your recipe. Bake, braise, or simmer the chicken according to your instructions. Chicken is fully cooked when it is no longer pink in the middle and an internal thermometer reads 165 F (73.8 C)."

, Cover grill and allow to cook for 25-35 minutes, until chicken is golden-brown and 150 F at the bone. 







,, In small batches, move chicken over the coals on the other side of the grill.








, Remove quickly, after about three to five minutes. 








If the skin becomes black and charred before the meat is done, the coals are too high. Use the grill scraper to distribute coals underneath the rack more evenly.
If the skin is flabby and the meat isn't cooking through, the coals are too low. Stoke them with a scraper to get the heat up, or throw in a few more quick-light coals.

, Make sure to use fresh chicken breasts within two days of placing them in the refrigerator.


If using frozen chicken, thaw it in the microwave or in a pot of cold water.
Frozen chicken can be stored up to nine months.

, This helps remove bacteria and odors that may have been produced while the chicken was inside its packaging.

, This will prevent the chicken from steaming in the oven, rather than baking.


Throw away the paper towels immediately, and wash your hands with warm, soapy water before proceeding. All surfaces that touch raw chicken will need to be disinfected after you have finished your preparation.

, Because boneless, skinless chicken is low in fat, it can dry out very easily in the oven.


You may use a substitute for olive oil, such as canola oil, grapeseed oil, or another cooking oil.

, Turn them over and sprinkle the opposite side as well. A light seasoning will add a lot of flavor to your chicken.


For a spicier dish, sprinkle the pieces with cumin, chili powder, cayenne pepper, or a combination of the three.
Experiment with other spices and flavorings of your choosing.

, Spread some olive oil over the surface of the pan to keep the chicken from sticking. You may also use a roasting pan, placing the chicken on a wire or metal section and allowing the fat and juice to drip down onto the pan below.

, Place the chicken pieces in the pan. Place the pan on the middle rack of the pre-heated oven.

, If you are baking only one or two chicken breasts or thighs, the cooking time will be less. If you are cooking 6 breasts or more, the baking time will be longer.

, The best way to check if chicken is done is to insert a meat thermometer into the thickest part of the breast or thigh. Chicken is done when it reaches a temperature of 160 degrees Fahrenheit (71 degrees Celsius).


If you do not have a meat thermometer, lift the chicken breast to ensure that its juices are clear rather than pink.
To make absolutely sure that the chicken is done, insert a knife in the thickest part of the meat and check to be sure it is white and opaque. If it's still pink, it needs to cook longer.

, Place the chicken breasts or thighs on a plate. Allow them to rest for five minutes to lock in the moisture.


Cutting the meat open immediately will let the moisture run out onto your plate instead of keeping the meat juicy.

, Make sure to wash the inner cavity. If your chicken came with a bag of offal inside of it, remove it at this time. It is important to wash under cold water, rather than warm water, because using warm water increases the chance of bacterial growth.

, Get the chicken as dry as possible. When there is less moisture the chicken will bake better. If there is too much moisture on the chicken, it may steam rather than bake., You could also put in a lemon wedge, an apple, or herbs. These ingredients will help to flavor the inside of the chicken. You can also sprinkle the inside of the chicken with salt and pepper. Tie the legs together using kitchen twine.

, Now is the time to decide if you want to rub your chicken with anything such as olive oil, a small amount of bacon fat, or butter. Don’t forget to salt and pepper the chicken as well. Make sure to coat the chicken evenly on all sides.

, Make sure that the oven has reached 400°F (204.4°C). Allow the chicken to bake in the oven for 50 to 60 minutes, for a 2 to 3 lb. (0.9 to 1.4 kg) chicken.Another option is to cover the pan and chicken with tin foil. Bake the covered chicken for 60 minutes. Uncover the chicken and bake it for another 20-30 minutes, or until clear juices run from the meat. This method makes for an even crispier exterior.

, Let it cool for 15 minutes before slicing it up. Discard the kitchen twine.

Obtain a meat tenderizing tool.,
Use it on boneless cuts of chicken.,
Cover the meat with a piece of plastic wrap.,
Pound the meat.",How to Tenderize Chicken1," These are generally wooden or metal mallets with a bumpy head that are used to pound meat to make it more tender. You can buy a meat tenderizing tool from any kitchen supply store. If you don't have a tenderizer, you can use a clean hammer in its place, though this will be less effective than a tenderizing tool since it has a smooth head.;
, Boneless chicken breasts or thighs can be processed with a meat tenderizing tool. Don't attempt to tenderize bone-in cuts of meat, since you'll shatter the bones. If you have a bone-in cut of meat you want to tenderize in this manner, remove the meat from the bone first., This will prevent small pieces of meat from scattering over your countertop when you pound it.

, Use the meat tenderizing tool to pound the meat evenly over the entire surface. Keep going back and forth over the meat until it's as thin as you want it to be for the recipe you're using. This is a great method to use before cooking meat using a fast method, such as grilling or frying. Pounding both breaks down fibers in the meat and allows for very fast cooking.

If you want to save time on cleanup, line the bottom of the roasting pan with enough aluminum foil to cover evenly. When the chicken is done cooking, cleaning is as easy as throwing the aluminum foil away.

, Toss to coat evenly with the olive oil.

, Baked chicken can be taken to new heights with lemon, onion, carrot, garlic, thyme, rosemary, cayenne pepper, and so much more. Browse cookbooks or the internet for combinations that spark your fancy.

,, Place the baking dish or roasting pan into the preheated oven, uncovered, and bake for 30 minutes, then reduce the heat by 50 degrees and bake for approximately another 30 minutes.

, Poke a fork into the chicken pieces. If the juices run clear, then the chicken is done. If not, return the chicken to the oven and check again in 5 minutes.

, Give the chicken 5 minutes after you remove it from the oven. This allows the juices to reabsorb into the meat, making the baked chicken moist and tender rather than dry.

",How to Bake a Chicken3," Butterflied chicken is when you remove the backbone and splay the chicken out flat on your pan. Butterflied chicken takes far less time to cook than traditional baked chicken. Because of the uniformity of the bird, many also believe butterflied chickens to be juicier.

, If you are using a convection oven, 425° (218° C) is acceptable.

, Make sure to rinse the cavity, removing any gizzards or internal organs that may have come with packaging. Pat dry after washed.

, Place the chicken breast-side down.


Using kitchen shears, cut along one side of backbone, going the length of the chicken.
Cut along the other side of the backbone, going the length of the chicken again. Remove backbone.
Like a book, open the chicken and locate the keel bone in the center of the bird. It will feel like cartilage and be shaped like a long tooth.
Slice across the membrane that holds the keel bone, place two fingers underneath the bone, and pop it out.
Turn the chicken over and spread it out like a butterfly, with the legs pulled toward you.

, Cover with aluminum foil if desired to cut down on cleanup afterward.

Take the chicken breasts out of the oven.",How to Bake Chicken2,", Use only cold water, as warm water leads to bacterial growth. Pat the chicken dry with paper towels so that the skin gets crispy when it is baking.

, You can rub them with olive oil and herbs, or use a spice rub--it’s really up to you. It’s always good to sprinkle some salt and pepper on the chicken as well. To thoroughly season your chicken, place the oil and seasoning in a big sealable plastic bag. Place the chicken breasts inside the bag, seal it, and then shake until the chicken it thoroughly coated.


You can also marinate your chicken. Choose your favorite marinade, rub the chicken in it, and let the chicken sit for roughly four hours. Marinating the chicken overnight will result in the most flavor.

, Make sure that all of the breasts are flat and not overlapping (ie. they are laid out in a single layer.)

, If the juices from the chicken are clear, it is fully cooked. If you have a meat thermometer, the internal temperature of the chicken should be 160°F (71.1°C)., If you are uncertain about whether the chicken is done or not, cut into a small portion of the breast.

"
Use a plain yogurt or buttermilk marinade.,
Marinate the meat for an hour or more.,
Experiment with other types of marinades.",How to Tenderize Chicken2," Yogurt and buttermilk contain enzymes and acids that work together to break down the proteins in chicken meat, causing it to become more tender. That's why so many cooks know that soaking chicken in yogurt or buttermilk overnight before frying chicken results in the very best fried chicken imaginable. The same trick can be used to prepare any type of chicken for any cooking process.If you want to use yogurt, generally use a plain yogurt. Flavors such as vanilla yogurt may come out unpalatable.
Some flavored yogurt, such as lemon, lime, coconut, or other fruit flavors that work well with chicken can yield wonderful results.
Full fat or low-fat yogurt both work fine. The chicken will have a slight yogurt flavor, which pairs well with peppers and other spices.
Buttermilk is a little milder and will not affect the flavor of the chicken. If you do not have buttermilk on hand, you can make it. Simply add 1 tablespoon (30 mL) of white vinegar to a cup-sized measuring cup. Fill up the rest of the cup with whole or low-fat milk. Let the mixture sit for 5 to 10 minutes, until it curdles. You can use this in place of buttermilk.

, Overnight is best, but marinating the chicken in buttermilk or yogurt for just an hour or so will make a big difference in the texture of the meat. To marinate it, simply place the meat in a container and pour enough plain yogurt or buttermilk to cover it. Close the container and let it sit in the refrigerator until you're ready to use it.


You can season the marinade with spices and salt to brine the chicken while it's marinating.
After the chicken is done marinating, shake or rinse off the excess buttermilk or yogurt before using it in your recipe.

, They will tenderize differently. There are hundreds, maybe thousands, of marinades and brines to choose from, both homemade and commercial. But realize that not all marinades will tenderize equally. Some will yield a firmer chicken, and not actually tenderize.


Using a very acidic marinade, like one with vinegar or lemon juice, may slightly toughen the meat. Acid-based marinades infuse the meat with great flavor, but you may have to get very aggressive with mechanical tenderizing.This works best when you're making a curry. You cannot really detect the fruit in the finished curries, but you may be able to in dishes without a strong-tasting sauce.For a mushy chicken, use an enzyme-based marinades that contain pineapple or meat tenderizer. These may do the job a little too well, causing chicken meat to become ""mushy"". Of course, this may be the desired outcome, and this may be fine for dishes that call for very soft chicken.
Alternatively, use a fruit marinade. If you want the chicken to be as tender as possible, and don't mind if it gets a little mushy, you can take advantage of the enzymes naturally found in certain fruits. Peel and puree a Kiwi fruit, pineapple, or mango and mix with your raw chicken pieces. Keep it covered in the refrigerator for about an hour.
Try soda as a marinade. An easily available and surprisingly good marinade is a soft drink. The highly acidic properties of pop chemically break down the chicken, and the flavor is delicious. Simply cover your chicken with your choice of soda, and add about a teaspoon of salt. If you do not have quite enough soft drink, add some water to the mixture

Cola flavors tend to work well: Coca Cola, Pepsi, RC, etc.
Lemon-Lime flavors also work well: Sprite, Mountain Dew, 7 Up, Sierra Mist, etc.
Moxie (an uncommon American soda brand) also works very well.

Pick your cooking method.,
Do not overcook the bird.,
Try a ""low and slow"" cooking method.,
Allow the meat to rest after cooking.",How to Tenderize Chicken3," There are many ways to cook chicken, but here are a few examples:

Blackening the chicken: Take a pan, put 1 tbsp (30 mL) oil (olive oil adds extra flavor!!) and heat up the oil. Meanwhile, season the chicken using whatever spices you like. Cover the chicken with the spices, and then place in the pan. Cook until no longer pink on the inside.
Oven-baking the chicken: Season chicken and place in a greased baking pan. Bake 30-40 minutes, or until no longer pink.
Grilling the chicken: Transfer the tenderized,seasoned chicken to the grill and cook until done.
Stewing the chicken: In a proper stew, it is virtually impossible to produce tough chicken. This is one of the many reasons chicken stews of various types are found throughout the world. This can use both plain or marinated cuts of chicken.

, Overcooking can lead to loss of moisture and proteins tightening up into bubblegum consistency. Experience will help you judge when chicken is done, but even professional cooks will still test with a thermometer to be certain. Test the temperature of the bird using a meat thermometer to determine whether it has reached the correct internal temperature. For most cuts of chicken, this will be 165 °F (74 °C).


Use a probe thermometer when cooking a whole bird, plunged into the deepest part of the breast. Use an instant read for smaller cuts like breasts and thighs.

, Though seemingly contradictory to the ""do not overcook"" warning, low, slow cooking breaks down proteins, allowing for a more tender experience. This type of cooking also allows time for flavors and juices to penetrate into the meat, giving even more juiciness. It works best with bone-in thighs and other dark meat, or you could roast an entire chicken this way., Cover it with heavy-duty aluminum foil and let sit for 5 to 10 minutes. This allows the juices to redistribute in the meat. If you cut it right away, the juices are more likely to drain out immediately instead of reabsorbing into the meat. This is especially important for whole roasted chicken or roasted chicken parts.


While this advice is absolutely true, be assured that carving right away will also not take your succulent chicken into a dry mess of a meal.
It also makes sense to wait until the chicken is cool enough to handle, anyway. A chicken just out of the oven is too hot to cut into without risking burns. Chicken that hot will also burn when bitten into.

"
"
Know your source.,
Keep in mind that old chicken is tough chicken.,
Consider the cut of poultry used.",How to Tenderize Chicken4," It is difficult to judge the quality of chicken just by looking at the meat, so the best thing to do is buy your chicken from a reliable source. The store brand may or may not be as reliable as a nationwide brand name. The organic poultry farmer may or may not provide a more tender chicken, although if bought at a farmer's market he or she may be able to guide you to a good choice., In the United States, meat chickens are processed at only a few weeks old to ensure tender flesh. However, it is possible to cook older ""stew hens"" such as found on hobby farms or backyard coops. As the term suggests, stewing the meat is the suggested cooking technique, as the older flesh tends to be tougher.

, Dark meat chicken contains more fat, and therefore can be rendered more moist and tender in dishes that work well with dark meat. Breast meat and other white meat tends to be a little tougher. However, if you use a good buttermilk marinade or a meat tenderizer, it can still turn out quite tender.

",How to Apply Dry Rub to Chicken," Because spice rubs are common among many cultures, there is no universal spice rub recipe.;
, For best results, place it in the refrigerator 24 hours before you want to rub the chicken. This will allow it to defrost more evenly than placing it in the microwave.

, The following is an example of a southern barbecue chicken rub.


Place 1 cup (201 g) of brown sugar, 3 tbsp. (21.7 g) of dry mustard, 2 tbsp. (14.5 g) of garlic powder, 2 tbsp.(14.5 g) of onion powder, 1 tsp. (5 g) of seasoning salt, 1/4 tsp. (0.5 g) of cayenne pepper, 1 1/2 tsp. (3.1 g) of smoky chipotle powder.

,,,,,


You can use many types of chicken for dry rubs, such as breasts, thighs, wings, drumsticks and any mixture of them. If you are using a whole chicken, it is a good idea to cut it apart before rubbing it, to ensure that you get the rub on as many surfaces as possible.

,,


You can also place it in the refrigerator for an hour, if you do not have a night to let the chicken sit. The longer it is left to sit, the more it will take on the flavor of the rub.

,,, Make sure it is no longer pink inside before serving.


Alternatively, you can sauté the chicken in a pan covered in hot oil. You can also sear the edges of the chicken for 5 minutes on a grill or in a pan and then place it in the oven at 350 degrees Fahrenheit (177 degrees Celsius) for 20 to 40 minutes.

Feel the chicken.",How to Tell if Chicken Is Bad1," As it starts to spoil, the color fades to grey. If the color of the chicken begins to look duller, you should use it soon before it goes bad. Once it looks more grey than pink, it is already too late.









Raw chicken colors can range from appearing grey to having yellow spots that aren’t skin.
If you begin to cook bad chicken it may continue to look dull and not become as white.;
, Raw chicken that has gone bad has a very potent odor. Some describe it as a ""sour"" smell, while others liken it to the scent of ammonia. If the chicken has begun to take on an unpleasant or strong odor of any sort, it is best to discard it.









Chicken can start to smell bad while cooking, it is best to discard it if it starts to smell less appealing.

, Is it slimy? The touch test is a little more difficult than the color or smell test because chicken naturally has a glossy, somewhat slimy feeling to it. If this slime remains even after rinsing the chicken under water, however, there is a good chance that the chicken has spoiled. If the chicken feels unusually sticky, it has almost certainly gone bad.

, Sometimes this is not possible if the chicken has been breaded or if the color was altered by a glaze or marinade. If chicken that cooked white begins to look grey, it is no longer safe to eat.








, Mold is one of the most obvious signs of rotten, decaying, bad chicken. If green, or black fuzz, or any organic growth of any kind has begun to form on the chicken, it has gone very bad and should be discarded immediately. Even the smell of chicken this 'off' may make you ill.








, If you feel uncertain about whether or not cooked chicken is still good, but do not want to waste it if it still is, you can cautiously take a bite. Instead of chewing and swallowing the chicken immediately, though, you should pause and carefully analyze the flavor.









If it tastes “off” or seems a little sour, spit it out and discard the rest.

Check the ""Sell By"" date.,
Check into how thoroughly the chicken was stored.,
Find out where and for how long the chicken was stored.It depends also depends on how you stored the chicken.",How to Tell if Chicken Is Bad4," This alone is not always a good indication of whether or not raw chicken is still good because the ""Sell By"" date only dictates at which point chicken can no longer be sold to consumers. Instead of relying on the ""Sell By"" date, it is best to use it as a means of confirming whether or not chicken you suspect has gone bad is actually past its prime.









If you purchase fresh, refrigerated chicken from a store and freeze it, it can last up to nine months past this date, as long as it was fresh when purchased., Cooked chicken goes bad faster if it is exposed to air, and improperly stored chicken is more likely to be bad.









Chicken should be stored in shallow, airtight containers or heavy-duty freezer bags.
It could also be wrapped tightly in aluminum foil or plastic wrap.
Example: In order to remain safe to eat, whole chicken should be cut into smaller portions and any stuffing should be removed prior to refrigeration or freezing.

, After these time periods elapse, there is a higher chance that the chicken will have gone bad.









In the refrigerator, raw chicken should be used in one or two days, while cooked chicken stays good for about three to four days.
In the freezer, cooked chicken can remain good and safe to eat for up to four months while raw chicken can be good for up to a year.

",How to Make Chicken Stir Fry2," To serve four, you should prepare approximately one pound of boneless, skinless chicken breasts or thighs. Traditional stir-fries generally go easy on the meat and heavy on the vegetables, but it's up to you.


Make sure to wash the chicken well in cold water first, dry off with some paper towel and place on a clean chopping board.
Trim any fat off the chicken using a sharp knife, then cut into 1/4-inch thick bite-size slices.
For extra flavor, marinate the chicken before cooking. Combine 1 tablespoon of minced garlic, 1 1/2 teaspoons of cornstarch, 2 teaspoons of soy sauce, 2 tablespoons of rice wine or dry sherry and 3/4 teaspoon of salt. Pour the marinade over the chicken and stir to combine. Leave to sit (refrigerated) for as little as five minutes or as long as an hour before cooking.

, A flat bottomed, carbon steel wok is the best type of pan to prepare your stir-fry in. You can also use a flat-bottom frying  pan, but you miss out on using the sides of the pan as cooking surfaces, unlike a wok. You may also have trouble with ingredients falling out of the pan when preparing a large amount of stir-fry.


Do not buy a non-stick wok. Non-stick woks are less than useless for high-heat stir-frying; they are downright dangerous. This is because non-stick coating is not supposed to be heated to a very high temperature, but all wok cooking happens at a high temperature.
Use a fish spatula or other thin, flexible spatula for stirring.

, Nearly any combination of vegetables can be used in a stir-fry, so it is easy to adapt to your personal tastes and preferences. Some chefs recommend choosing only 2-3 vegetables for a stir-fry, as they believe that keeping it simple will prevent the dish from being too busy, while also saving you from too much prep work. Others take more of an ""everything-but-the-kitchen-sink"" approach. Go with whatever sounds good to you, or whatever you happen to have in your kitchen.


When preparing the veg, try to chop everything into pieces of approximately the same size. This prevents one vegetable from becoming overcooked while another is still raw.
Regardless of uniform size, some vegetables will still cook quicker than others. Place all of the chopped veg into bowls, separated according to their cooking times. This will make it easy for you to throw all of the vegetables with longer cooking times into the wok together, while keeping the fast cooking veg separate. If you are unsure of how long each vegetable takes to cook, here's a quick guide:

Mushrooms will need five to ten minutes, depending on their size and type.
Cabbage, spinach and other greens will take approximately four to six minutes.
Veggies like asparagus, broccoli, carrots and green beans will take between three and five minutes.
Peppers, peas, courgette and squash will only need two to three minutes.
Bean sprouts are the fastest of all, with a cooking time of less than a minute.



, You can add further variety to your chicken stir-fries by trying out different sauces. Stir-fry sauces can be spicy, sweet, salty or nutty and can lift a stir-fry from healthy and boring to flavorsome and exotic. You can buy stir-fry sauces at the supermarket, or make your own. Here are some ideas:



Lemon sauce:

1/4 cup lemon juice
1 teaspoon lemon zest
1/4 cup chicken broth
1 tablespoon soy sauce
2 tablespoons sugar



Sweet and sour sauce:

1/4 cup chicken broth
2 tablespoons soy sauce
2 tablespoons cider vinegar
1 tablespoon brown sugar
1/2 teaspoon hot red pepper flakes



Satay sauce:

4 rounded tablespoonfuls chunky peanut butter
3 tablespoons dark soy, Tamari
3 tablespoons honey
1-inch ginger root, peeled and minced
1 clove garlic, crushed
1 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
1/2 orange, juiced



, Stir-fried chicken and vegetables are usually served with some form of carbohydrate, in order to make the dish more filling. The carbohydrates can be mixed in with the stir-fry, or served on the side. You have several options when it comes to deciding what to eat with your stir-fry.


Brown rice, this is probably the healthiest option.
White rice, such as basmati or jasmine.
Noodles, such as Chinese ramen-style or rice noodles.
Pasta, such as angel hair.
Nothing! Stir-fries can be just as tasty eaten on their own. This is a good option if you are trying to limit your carb intake.

, Add the finishing touch to your stir-fry by choosing a garnish. Garnishes add color, flavor or texture, while also contributing to the presentation of the dish.


Toasted cashew nuts or sesame seeds, sliced scallions or chili peppers, raw bean sprouts or freshly chopped herbs such as cilantro, parsley or basil all make great garnishes.

Store your thawed chicken in the refrigerator.",How to Defrost Chicken1," This is the safest way to thaw your chicken, however it does take longer than other methods.


Place your chicken at the front of the bottom shelf while it defrosts to prevent excess juices from getting on other food in the refrigerator. If your chicken has already been unwrapped, place it in a pan or bowl so that the juices do not leak.;
, The standard rule says that 1 pound (0.453 Kg) of chicken takes 5 hours to defrost in a refrigerator.Keep in mind that thawing a whole chicken in the refrigerator can take more than 24 hours. Plan accordingly., The chicken will no longer be covered in frost and will be squishy to the touch.


Check to see if your whole chicken is defrosted by placing your hand in the major cavity of the chicken. If there are ice crystals within the chicken, it needs to be defrosted for a longer period of time.

, Chicken that has been thawed can be safely stored in the fridge for 1-2 days. Once a chicken has been thawed it should not be refrozen.

The beer can will get extremely hot during the grilling process, so use thick gloves when handling the chicken.If possible, use something like tongs to lift the chicken out of the grill.
You should also use gloves when separating the beer can from the chicken.

, Never forget to use an oven thermometer on a chicken. This is a step you should not skip over. If you don't have a meat thermometer, purchase one before making beer can chicken. The center of the chicken will be cooled by the beer can, so there is a particularly high risk of overcooking when making beer can chicken., Beer cans are not designed to be safe to cook at high temperatures. There's some plastic lining the cans, which can contaminate your chicken. While most people who eat beer can chicken do not experience any health problems, beer cans are not designed for this purpose and it's not clear whether beer can chicken is 100% safe for consumers.

Alternatively, line the baking dish with nonstick aluminum foil or parchment paper instead of spraying it with cooking spray.;
, Sprinkle it with salt and pepper, to taste, and drizzle the olive oil over it.


You can season the chicken directly in the baking dish to minimize the number of dishes you dirty. Alternatively, you can do so on a separate plate or in a bowl to reduce the amount of mess in the baking dish.
If you are unsure of how much salt and pepper to use, start with roughly 1/4 tsp (1.25 ml) salt and 1/8 tsp (0.625 ml) black pepper.
Use a basting brush to brush the olive oil over the chicken for a more thorough coating. The oil helps the chicken to stay moist and to brown in the oven. Melted butter or another type of vegetable oil will also work.
If desired, you could also use a baking sauce instead of oil. Brush a homemade or commercial sauce, like a barbecue sauce, over the chicken thighs using a basting brush.

, The chicken should be browned on top and have an internal temperature of 180 degrees Fahrenheit (82 degrees Celsius).


Use an instant-read meat thermometer to check the internal temperature. Stick it into the center of the thickest thigh to get an accurate reading.
If the chicken thighs are not done, return to the oven and continue cooking in five minute increments until the correct internal temperature is reached.

, Remove the chicken after it finishes cooking and let it rest, covered, for 10 minutes.


Cover the pan with aluminum foil. You do not need to create a tight seal, however. The foil can simply rest on top.

Use approximately 1/4 tsp (1.25 ml) salt and 1/8 tsp (0.625 ml) black pepper if you do not have an established preference.
Marinating can also be overnight if desired.

, Make sure that there is space between the rack inside the pan and the bottom of the pan.


It is important to use a broiler pan with a rack inside, rather than a baking pan. The rack inside a broiler pan keeps the meat out of the hot fat and oil that drips off the chicken, which helps prevent fires from breaking out.
It doesn't matter which side faces up when using boneless skinless thighs. If you use bone-in thighs, however, make sure that the bone side faces up. If you're cooking chicken with skin, it often tastes better to put the skin side up, too, so that it can crisp up a little.

, Do not cover.


Place the broiler pan 4 to 5 inches (10 to 13 cm) under the top heating element of the oven.
Carefully turn the chicken over after 10 minutes pass. Brush this side with oil and continue cooking an additional 10 minutes.
Thick thighs or bone-in thighs may need to be cooked for a total of 25 to 35 minutes, instead.The skin or meat surface should be medium browned and glossy. If it is fully cooked before the interior is done, finish by baking normally at lower heat such as 300 degrees Fahrenheit (149 degrees Celsius) to diffuse heat into the interior without unnecessarily drying or scorching the outside.

, Pull out of the oven once the chicken thighs are thoroughly browned and at an internal temperature of 180 degrees Fahrenheit (82 degrees Celsius).


As a rule of thumb, the juices should also run clear and the meat should no longer be pink.Check the temperature with an instant-read meat thermometer. Stick the thermometer into the thickest part of the thickest piece. If using bone-in thighs, make sure that the thermometer does not touch the bone.

If desired, you could also season the chicken with other spices and herbs. A dash of garlic powder, chili powder, onion powder, or Creole seasoning would work well for this recipe. If using a simpler butter or lemon sauce, rather than a barbecue sauce, a generous dash of parsley or oregano could work, as well.

, Use at least a 3 to 4 quart (3 to 4 liter) slow cooker and make sure that the lid is able to fit securely on top.


If desired, lightly coat the slow cooker with nonstick cooking spray or use nonstick slow cooker liners. These precautions are not necessary, but they can help to prevent chicken from getting stuck onto the side of the cooker.

, Whisk these ingredients together in a small bowl.


For added heat, consider whisking in up to 1/4 tsp (1.25 ml) hot sauce.
Alternatively, you could also create a different sauce for the chicken to cook in if you do not like the taste of barbecue sauce. Just make sure that there is at least 3/4 cup (185 ml) liquid for the chicken to cook in. For instance, you could make a simple sauce with 1/2 cup (125 ml) chicken broth, 3 Tbsp (45 ml) butter, and 2 Tbsp (60 ml) lemon juice.

, Cover the turkey and freeze it until it is hard. This makes it hard and easier to cut into thin strips Two hours should be more than enough., Try not to have any strips thicker than 1/4 inch, but even thinner is fine if possible. You should try and keep the slices the same width so they all dry out at the same speed. If you are having trouble, let them thaw out for 20-30 minutes until they are softer and use the sharpest knife you have.


Tuck your fingers into your hand and use the knuckles on your non-cutting hand to guide the knife. This way, if the knife slips, you cannot take off a finger.
An electric knife, used for cutting tough meat and bone is often the easiest way to smoothly cut through frozen turkey evenly.
Cut parallel to the grain, which are the strands of meat running up and down the turkey.

, Combine the 1/3 cup soy, ¼ cup Worcestershire, 2 tsp brown sugar, ½ tbs. spices (red pepper, black pepper, garlic and onion powder, cumin, as desired), 1 tsp. salt, 1tbs. liquid smoke, in a bag and shake it gently to make sure everything is well mixed.

, Mix the turkey in the bag, using your fingers to lightly massage the marinade all around the turkey. Letting the turkey soak in the marinade overnight gives it flavor and makes the meat more tender, making it easier to turn into jerky.


Press the air out of the bag before putting it in the fridge.

, Remove excess marinade so that the turkey is mostly dry.


If you are worried about food-borne bacteria you can boil the turkey in the marinade before continuing. Simply add it to a skillet and boil it for 5 minutes before cooling, removing, and patting dry. This will also lower the time needed to dry the jerky in the oven., Dehydrators will make perfect jerky every time, and are built to evenly dry out the meat. Leave the meat in the dehydrator for 10-12 hours, or until it is your desired texture.If you do not have a dehydrator, you can use your oven as well. The principles, low heat, letting moisture escape, will be the exact same.

, The pieces should not overlap, but they can be close together. If you are willing to clean your oven later, you can put them directly on the oven racks, or you can place a pan underneath a wire rack.

, You need the door to be open in order for the turkey's moisture to escape. Some older ovens may have trouble keeping this temperature, so use an oven thermometer to make sure the heat stays consistent.Some recipes call for a 150˚F oven and others a 200˚F oven. Any temperature in this range is acceptable, but it will affect how long it takes to dry.

, The jerky is done when you can bend it without breaking it. The skin will crack but still bend in your hands. That said, the texture is largely up to you, so dry it until your liking as long as it is hard and thus fully ""cooked.""


Depending on the oven and the thickness of the jerky, this may take all night.

, Jerky does not need to be refrigerated, making it a great backpacking or traveling food, and it will last for a long time in dark and well-sealed container.

",How to Make a Good Turkey Burger,"


Dark turkey meat from the thigh and leg is moister than breast meat and has more flavor. Choose a combination of both to add moisture and flavor when making turkey burgers.
Look for packages labeled ""ground turkey meat,"" which is usually about 90 percent white meat and 10 percent dark. Packages labeled ""ground turkey breast"" contain only white meat and will be lower in fat, but could dry out faster during cooking.;
,


Ground turkey has a mild flavor, so seasoning will add flavor to the finished turkey burger. Try fresh black pepper and grill seasoning or season it to suit your menu.
Avoid adding salt to turkey burgers. Salt will draw moisture out of the meat and make the burgers dry out faster.

,


Adding an egg to the mixture will add moisture to the ground turkey to prevent the burger from drying out. The egg will also help hold the burger together.

,


Include finely chopped onions, scallions, mushrooms, bell peppers or fresh herbs to your turkey burgers. The vegetables will add flavor and release moisture as the burger cooks.
Add a dash of Worcestershire sauce or a tablespoon of mustard, sour cream or salsa when you form the burgers. This will add flavor and moisture to the turkey burgers.

,


Thin burgers will dry out faster and could crumble when placed on a grill.

,


Use a non-stick pan or grill grate to cook your turkey burgers. This will reduce the chances of the burgers sticking or falling apart.
Add oil to the pan or brush the grill grates with oil to prevent sticking and to help the burgers brown.
Heat the pan or grill for about 5 minutes before adding the turkey burgers. A hot pan or grill is the key to getting a good sear on the outside of the turkey burger and sealing in flavor.

,


Let the turkey burgers cook undisturbed for 3-to-4 minutes. Flip them once, then leave them alone for another 3 minutes. Flipping the burgers only once helps them hold together and gives them a good sear on the outside.

If you’re just buying dinner for yourself, you can stick with a small turkey. But if you’re cooking the bird for a family get-together, you’ll need a larger turkey.Generally, you’ll need about 1.5 pounds of turkey per person. So if you have 10 guests, you’ll need at least a 15 pound turkey.
It’s best to err on the side of caution and end up with leftover turkey than to end up with a situation in which some people don’t get any (or don’t get enough).
If one turkey just won’t do, don’t be afraid to buy two smaller turkeys. After all, when you’re making the turkey ahead of time, you’ll be able to spread out your cooking.;
, Many turkeys come with a bag inside them stuffed with giblets. The giblets is a collective term that refers to the turkey’s heart, gizzard, liver, and neck. Usually, you’ll just discard this bag.If you want to create a richer turkey broth, you freeze the giblets in their bag, then toss them into the pan you’ll be cooking the turkey in later.

, Make some creamy mashed potatoes, then spoon them into a baking dish. Use a spatula to smooth the top. Let the potatoes cool a bit, then place four or five slices of cold butter over them. Place the whole pan in an extra-large resealable plastic bag and close it. Push as much air out of the bag as possible before sealing it.Label the bags with the date you made the potatoes.
Mashed potatoes will stay good for two months frozen.
To reheat the potatoes, put the pan – still in the bag – in the fridge overnight. When you’re ready to reheat- the mashed potatoes, remove the pan from the bag and cook it in the oven for 25 minutes at 300 degrees Fahrenheit (149 degrees Celsius).

, Place turkey in a shallow roasting pan with the breast up. Preheat your oven to 325 degrees Fahrenheit (162 degrees Celsius). Sprinkle 2 teaspoons of poultry seasoning and 1 teaspoon of pepper all over the bird. Tuck the wings under the turkey and tie the drumsticks together with a thin string., Roast the turkey for half an hour. While the turkey is roasting, mix 3 cups of chicken broth, ½ cup of minced fresh parsley, ¼ cup of lemon juice, 1 tablespoon of minced thyme (or 1 teaspoon of dried thyme), 2 teaspoons of grated lemon peel, and 2 minced garlic cloves in a small bowl.The best way to ensure you don’t overcook your turkey is to set your watch or timer for 30 minutes after putting the turkey in the oven.
If you use a pre basted turkey, you don’t need to make the lemon juice mixture.

, Slowly pour the mixture over the turkey. Keep the oven on while you do this so that you don’t have to wait to reheat the oven for the turkey’s second round of roasting. While you have the turkey out, place an internal thermometer in the center of the turkey with the prong thrust at least 2 inches deep into it., Roast the turkey for about 3.25 hours. Every 30 minutes or so, take a spoon and scoop some of the liquid that collects in the bottom of the pan over the turkey. You’ll know the turkey is ready when your internal meat thermometer reads 180 degrees Fahrenheit (82 degrees Celsius).As you did the first time, use a timer or watch to ensure you don’t overcook your turkey.
If the turkey is browning too quickly, place a layer of foil over it while it cooks.
You can check the internal meat thermometer toward the end of the cooking time. Just open the oven a bit and take a peek at it. If the thermometer reads less than 180 degrees Fahrenheit, keep the turkey cooking.

, Remove the turkey from the oven again. Skim the fat from the juice in the bottom of the pan and discard. Let the turkey cool for about 20 minutes. Then, slice it up into serving-sized bits. Decide when you intend to use your turkey. The way you store your turkey for later use will decide how you store your turkey. If you plan on eating the turkey within three days you can just place it in the fridge. In this case, though, wrap portions of the turkey in plastic wrap before putting it in resealable bags or containers. Don’t place broth in the container if you’re simply refrigerating it.If you’re eating your turkey in more than three days, allow the turkey to cool a bit more. Spoon the broth that accumulated at the bottom of the cooking pan over the turkey in the containers. Put lids on each container. Place the containers in the freezer. They will stay good for up to three months. Label the containers with the date you cooked the turkey.
If you have a lot of extra broth, you can jar it and freeze the jars. Fill the jars only 75% of the way before freezing. Place the jars in the fridge overnight to thaw when you’re ready to use it., If your turkey was frozen, you’ll need to thaw it before you can reheat and eat it. The best way to do this is place it in the fridge.For a slightly faster thaw, you could place the turkey container in the sink or on the countertop. Just don’t forget it’s there or it could heat up too much and spoil.
Don’t let your turkey stand at room temperature for more than one hour., Preheat your oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (176 degrees Celsius). Place the turkey you want to eat in a baking dish. Cover the dish with foil. Bake for about one hour, or until your instant meat thermometer reads 165 degrees Fahrenheit (74 degrees Celsius).


You can check the turkey with an instant cooking thermometer toward the end of the cooking time. Just open the oven a stick the thermometer in the turkey meat. Wait about 20 seconds for the thermometer to get a reading. If the thermometer reads less than 165 degrees Fahrenheit, keep the turkey cooking.
If you wanted, you could mix up another batch of the garlic and lemon juice baste you used to bake the turkey and spoon some over the turkey before you reheat it.

, Take the turkey out. Spoon 1.5 cups of the liquid that collected in the bottom of the pan into a small bowl. Using a wire whisk, mix in 1 tablespoon of melted butter and 1 tablespoon of flour. Pour the mix into a small pot. Bring to a boil and continue stirring for about two minutes. Serve the gravy with the turkey. The mixture should yield about 2 cups of gravy.

Pull the skin over the meat and rub it with butter.,
Sprinkle the skin with salt and pepper.,
Lay the turkey legs in a roasting pan.,
Bake the turkey drumsticks.,
Let the meat rest for fifteen minutes before serving.",How to Cook Turkey Drumsticks1,";
, Grip the skin near the bone and gently peel it toward the top of the drumstick. Don't pull it off entirely; just peel it back, so you can tuck butter and seasonings underneath. Turkey drumsticks are much larger than chicken drumsticks, so you'll only need one per person (two at most).
Recent studies have shown that rinsing poultry isn't necessary, and in fact disperses bacteria around the kitchen surfaces. No need to rinse your turkey after removing it from the packaging.

, This will keep the meat moist while the drumsticks bake. For larger drumsticks, you can use up to three tablespoons of butter.


To make the butter easier to spread, bring it to room temperature before applying it to the turkey.
Use olive oil in place of butter if you're calorie conscious.

, With the skin still pulled down, sprinkle salt and pepper all over the turkey legs. For more flavor, try rubbing a tablespoon of chopped herbs onto the buttered turkey meat while the skins are still pulled back. Rosemary, thyme and sage make great seasonings for turkey.

, Stretch the skin back over the meat and rub another tablespoon (or up to three) of butter over the skin of the turkey. This will help the skin crisp up as it bakes.

, Use a liberal amount of both salt and pepper to bring out the best in the turkey's flavor.

, Use a pan large enough to easily hold all of the legs with no overlap. If you want to catch the drippings, use a metal roasting rack over a drip pan.

, Place them in the preheated oven for 45 minutes. Turn them over and cook for another 45 minutes. Insert a meat thermometer into the thickest part of the meat. They are ready when the internal temperature reaches 180ºF/82ºC.


To ensure that the turkey stays juicy, you can baste it every 20 minutes with a turkey baster or spoon. Use the drippings as your basting liquid, or baste with extra melted butter.
Larger drumsticks may take a total of two hours to finish cooking.

, This gives the juices time to reabsorb into the flesh, making the meat juicy. Serve whole or remove the meat from the bone.

, Sprinkle the meat all over with salt and pepper. If you want to add spices and other seasonings, spread mixed spices all over each drumstick to coat the skin. Try these delicious combinations:


For hot and spicy drumsticks: combine 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper, 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder, 1/2 teaspoon black pepper and 1/2 teaspoon salt
For herb-encrusted drumsticks: combine 1/2 teaspoon dried basil, 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme, 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder and 1/2 teaspoon salt

, Lay them on a part of the grill that isn't getting a stream of direct heat, since this will cook them too quickly.

, This will ensure they cook evenly on all sides. Keep going as each side turns golden brown and crispy., Insert a meat thermometer into the thickest part of the meat. The drumsticks are ready when the internal temperature reaches 180ºF/82ºC.

,, Since the drumsticks are so large, you might have trouble fitting more than two. You can lop off the ends of the bones if necessary.

, The liquid is necessary to flavor the turkey and help it cook evenly and slowly in the slow cooker. Fill up the slow cooker until the turkey legs are completely submerged.


For extra flavor, add a packet of onion soup mix to the pot.
Or add the following: 1 teaspoon salt, 1/2 teaspoon pepper, and 1 teaspoon garlic powder.

Buy it by the pound.,
Thaw it if it's frozen.,
Remove the packaging.,
Consider marinating the turkey breast.",How to Cook Boneless Turkey Breast1," Boneless turkey breast can be bought fresh or frozen by the pound. Turkey breasts are much larger than chicken breasts, so you'll want to factor that in when you decide how much to buy. A serving size of turkey breast comes out to 1/4 to 1/2 pound per person. Since cooked turkey keeps well in the refrigerator, you may want to buy extra so you'll have leftovers for sandwiches.


If you're buying fresh turkey, look for tender pink breasts with no spots of discoloration. If you're buying fresh turkey that comes prepackaged, make sure to use or freeze it before the expiration date.
Choose frozen turkey breast with no signs of freezer burn. Uncooked turkey breast can be kept in the freezer for up to nine months.;
, If you try to cook your turkey from a frozen state, it will take an incredibly long time. Using a refrigerator to thaw slowly is the recommended method. The night or so before you plan to cook the turkey breast, place it in the refrigerator so it can slowly thaw. You'll need to allot 24 hours of thawing for every 4 to 5 pounds of weight.


Leave frozen breast, still in its packaging, in the refrigerator for as long as necessary to thaw it out. Put the breast on a plate or tray to catch any juices that might drip out of the packaging as the meat thaws.
If you're pressed for time, thaw the turkey in cold water bath. Submerge the still-wrapped turkey in a large bowl or sink of cold tap water. Replace the water every half hour with fresh cold tap water.Allot half an hour of thawing time per pound of weight using this method.
Use a microwave for the fastest thawing alternative. Remove all packaging from the turkey breast. Place it on a microwave-safe dish to catch any juices. Use the power setting and cooking time recommended for thawing or defrosting meat in the user’s manual.

, Once the breast has thawed, remove any packaging it came in. Fresh or frozen turkey breast often comes wrapped in plastic netting, and you want to be sure to remove this before cooking the turkey. If your breast came rolled up like a roast, unroll it before cooking.

, While using a marinade isn't required, it results in tender, flavorful meat. Make your marinade at least an hour before you plan to cook the turkey. Choose any store-bought marinade to flavor your turkey, or make your own. Place the turkey in a large food storage container and pour the marinade over it. Use one-fourth cup of marinade into the container for every pound of turkey meat.Let it marinate for one to three hours before cooking.


You can whip up a quick marinade by mixing 1/2 cup vinegar, 1/4 cup olive oil, 4 teaspoons minced garlic, 1 teaspoon pepper and 1/2 teaspoon salt for every four pounds of turkey.
Be sure to place the meat back into the refrigerator for the duration of the marination.
Because thawing at high temperatures (cold water bath and microwave) can encourage bacteria growth, it’s recommended that you cook fast-thawed meat immediately. Therefore, you must slow-thaw your turkey breast in the refrigerator if you plan to marinate it for a few hours before cooking.

"
"
Choose a turkey breast large enough to feed the number of people you plan to serve.,
Decide if you will stuff your turkey breast.,
Rinse the turkey breast with cold water.,
Season the turkey.",How to Cook a Turkey Breast1," Turkey breasts are usually between 2 and 8 pounds (0.9 to 3.6 kg).;
, This is generally not possibly on smaller cuts of turkey. If you are using a breast that is 7 or 8 pounds (3.1 to 3.6 kg), stuffing is an option.

, Pat it dry with paper towels when you are done rinsing.

, You can use injectable marinades like some people do with their Thanksgiving turkey, or you can keep it simple with some salt and pepper sprinkled over the turkey breast.


Try putting softened butter or thin slices of citrus under the skin. This will keep the breast moist during cooking and provide flavor.
Rub the breast with olive oil or butter. You can also marinate the breast in a liquid or a brine (water and salt) the night before you plan to cook it.

"

Clean your bird.,
Slice off the outer layer of muscle on the turkey breast prior to cooking it.,
Bake the turkey the same way you would a store-bought turkey of its size, but baste it more frequently.,
Deep fry the turkey in a special outdoor deep fryer.",How to Cook a Wild Turkey," Pluck the feathers, and skin the bird. Cut off the head and feet. Clean out the intestinal cavity.


Place the bird in a large pot of boiling water, if you have not used the other method to clean your bird. There should be enough water in the pot to keep the bird submerged, but not too much to boil over. This method will soften the feathers to allow them to be easily plucked. After boiling the bird until it's softened, cut off the head and feet and then clean out the intestinal cavity. There is not an exact boiling time, as this will be determined by the size of the turkey.;
, This will help the meat to stay tender. You can either fry or bake your wild turkey. There are a variety of wild turkey recipes available.

, The additional basting liquid will prevent the turkey from drying out, which will help tenderize the meat. An ideal baking temperature is 350 degrees Fahrenheit (177 degrees Celsius). Cook the turkey for approximately 15 minutes per lb., or 30 minutes per kg. The turkey is considered done when the internal temperature, which is measured with a meat thermometer at the thickest point of the bird, reaches at least 165 degrees Fahrenheit (77 degrees Celsius).

, This is ideal if you don't like the idea of baking the turkey. The fat and oil from the fryer will help keep the turkey moist. Deep frying should never be done inside due to the risk of fire. Pay special attention to the oil levels, as you do not want the oil to spill out of the fryer once the turkey has been added. Cook the turkey at 350 degrees Fahrenheit (177 degrees Celsius) for 3 to 3.5 minutes per lb. (6 to 7 minutes per kg) or until the turkey has a golden brown color.

Experiment with other spices if you like certain flavors. Add ground sage, oregano, and rosemary to mix things up.
You can also add 1/2 cup of Parmesan cheese for extra flavor.

, Scoop about 1/3 cup of the mixture into the palm of your hand. Use both hands to shape it into a patty. Place it on a plate, then move on to the next patty. Continue until you've shaped all of the meat into patties.

, Place a pan or a cast iron skillet over medium heat. Pour the oil into the pan and let it heat up for a minute or two. Swirl it around the pan to coat the bottom, so the burgers won't stick.


You can also cook these burgers in the oven under the broiler. Turn on the broiler and let the oven heat completely before cooking.
Using the grill is another good alternative. Heat up a grill to medium high.

, Place the patties into the pan. Fit as many as you can in the pan without the sides touching. Cook the burgers on the first side for 3 minutes, or until a brown crust forms. Flip them over and cook them on the other side for another 3 minutes. Remove the burgers to a plate when they're finished cooking.


You can lay slices of cheese on the burgers after they've been flipped. To melt the cheese, cover the pan with a lid.
Season the burgers with additional spices to form a ""blackened""-style crust.
Don't overcook the burgers or they'll get dry pretty quickly, since turkey has a low fat content.

Slice the turkey breast.",How to Cook Boneless Turkey Breast2,", The larger your turkey breast, the longer it will take to cook. When roasted at 325 °F (163 °C), turkey breast requires approximately 25 minutes cooking time per pound.For a smaller four to six pound turkey breast, set aside between 1 1/2 and 2 1/2 hours. For a larger six to eight pound turkey breast, set aside between 2 1/2 and 3 1/2 hours.
If you're cooking at an altitude of 5,000 or more feet, you'll need to add five to ten extra minutes' cooking time per pound.

, Rub the turkey breast with olive oil, and sprinkle the skin with a few pinches of salt and pepper. If you wish, sprinkle dried thyme, oregano, sage or basil on the turkey.


If you want to use fresh herbs, chop them roughly and insert them under the skin of the turkey, so they'll cook right against the meat to flavor it.
If you like the taste of lemon with poultry, try slicing a lemon and inserting the slices under the skin, to be removed after baking.

, Spray an oven-safe roasting pan with non-stick spray or vegetable oil to prevent the turkey from sticking to it. Place the turkey breast in the roasting pan skin-side up.

, Roast the turkey until the internal temperature is 155 °F (68 °C) as measured by a meat thermometer.Cooking the turkey at a lower heat (325°F) helps make sure that the breast doesn’t dry out.


If you want to make sure the breast stays moist, you can baste the top of the breast periodically throughout the cooking process. Use either a large spoon or a turkey baster to pour the pan liquid over the surface of the breast.
For crispy skin, turn on your broiler and broil for five minutes after it has been brought up to an internal temperature of 155 °F (68 °C).

, Cover the turkey with foil and let it rest on a countertop for several minutes. During this time, juices from the turkey will reabsorb into the meat. Skipping this step will result in drier meat.

Finished.

",How to Cook Boneless Turkey Breast3," Since a slow cooker operates at a much lower temperature than an oven, it takes much longer for the turkey breast to reach an internal temperature of 155 °F (68 °C). This enables you to turn it on and forget about it for several hours as you go about your day.


Using the ""low"" setting, a smaller four to six pound turkey breast will take five to six hours to cook in a slow cooker. A larger six to ten pound breast will require eight to nine hours.
Using the ""high"" setting will result in lower cooking time, equivalent to that of a conventional oven.

, Remember that it must be thawed and unwrapped before cooking. It's also a good idea to remove the skin. You can't crisp the skin in the slow cooker, so you may as well discard it before cooking.

, Anything you add to the slow cooker will simmer with the turkey breast all day, creating an amazingly flavorful final product. You can make your own seasoning mix or use a mix bought from the store. Try one of these:


Make your own by combining 1 teaspoon dried minced garlic, 1 teaspoon seasoned salt, 1 teaspoon Italian seasoning and 1 teaspoon pepper.
If you don't have the right spices, you can use a packet of onion soup mix or a bouillon cube or packet. Dissolve one cube/packet in a cup of hot water and add it to the slow cooker.

, The great thing about a slow cooker is that it’s one-pot cooking that can’t be messed up, so go ahead and throw whatever vegetables and herbs you have in the fridge in there, so long as they make sense with turkey. Potatoes, carrots, and onions are all great options for vegetables, as are parsley, sage, and oregano for herbs.


Chop vegetables into larger chunks to prevent them from breaking down too much over a long cooking time.
If you don’t have fresh herbs in your fridge or garden, you can replace them with dried herbs from your spice rack.

, Add enough water to cover the top of the turkey, so it won't dry out as it cooks. You can also use chicken broth in place of water.

, Depending on how much time you have, you’ll set it to either high or low. Remember that if you set the slow cooker to low heat, it will take somewhere between five and eight hours to cook; if you set it to high heat, it will take much less time.

, Make sure the internal temperature of the turkey reaches at least 155 °F (68 °C) by using a meat thermometer. Insert the end of the thermometer into the thickest portion of the breast, being careful not to poke the thermometer all the way through the breast. Wait for the display to stabilize before reading the temperature.

Place the breast in a roasting pan and add liquid such as chicken broth, wine or water to the bottom of the pan.
Cover the roasting pan loosely with aluminum foil while it cooks. This will allow the skin on the turkey breast to brown and keep the meat moist.
Roast for 20 minutes per pound. For example, a 5 pound (2.26 kg) turkey breast will take one hour and 40 minutes to cook.

,


Place the turkey breast on the grill and lower the grill cover. This will evenly cook your turkey and prevent heat flare-ups.
Flip the turkey breast with tongs or a spatula. Do not use a knife or a fork, otherwise you will pierce the meat and allow liquid to come out. This could result in dry turkey.
Check internal temperature with a meat thermometer. Grilling turkey breast will always result in a darkened skin, so it can be hard to accurately determine when the turkey is done cooking. Make sure the thermometer reads 165 degrees Fahrenheit (73.8 Celsius).

, This will provide a unique flavor for your turkey.


Follow the directions on your smoker. Most smokers are charcoal, electric or gas, and your cooking instructions will depend on which kind you have.
Make sure you do not use a stuffed turkey breast in your smoker. It may not cook well, and smoked stuffing does not often have a pleasant taste.

, Deep fried turkey is often good at keeping the meat moist.


Use an outdoor propane fryer or an indoor electric fryer.
Heat the oil in the fryer and put the turkey breast into the oil for frying.
Cook for 4 to 5 minutes per pound. For example, a 5 pound (2.26 kg) turkey breast will cook for 20 to 25 minutes.

, The internal temperature should reach 150 to 165 degrees Fahrenheit (66 to 74 degrees Celsius), though the USDA recommends 180 to 185 degrees Fahrenheit (82 to 85 degrees Celsius). The reason for the difference is the way the birds are raised; they are far less likely to carry bacteria.

Buy a frozen turkey.,
Keep it in the freezer until the day you are ready to cook it.,
Estimate how long it's going to take.,
Preheat the oven to 325 °F (163 °C).

,
Take the frozen bird, remove the plastic wrapping, and place it breast down on a rack in a roasting pan.








,
Place the bird into the preheated oven.








,
After 2 hours, turn the turkey breast up.,
Remove the giblets now if they are ready – if not monitor the turkey every 15 minutes and remove the package when you can.,
Monitor the temperature of the bird using an instant read thermometer.,
Remove the turkey from the oven, loosely cover with aluminum foil, and let the turkey rest for at least 10 minutes while the juices redistribute.








",How to Cook a Frozen Turkey," If you can find a turkey made to be cooked from frozen that is fine. If not, choose a turkey that has been processed. You are not going to be able to brine this turkey or to do much in the way of adding flavor, so look on the label for one that has been ""enhanced,"" ""basted"" or described as ""self-basting.""






;
, This is the big advantage. There will be no need to thaw this turkey for days in advance.








, For timing estimates, start with the number of hours and minutes that a thawed turkey of the same size would take to cook, then add an extra fifty percent. For example, if a thawed turkey would take around four hours, cooking the same turkey from the frozen state would take around six hours. But, always determine whether the turkey is safely cooked by using a thermometer, not a clock. The turkey is done when the thermometer says it is done.








,,,, See if the giblets and neck that were most likely packaged, in paper of plastic, in the neck and body cavity are loose enough to remove.








, Do not let a plastic bag containing the giblets melt. If a plastic packet deforms or melts, chemicals may leech into the giblets and the surrounding turkey meat. Neither the giblets nor the turkey should be eaten in that case. A paper giblet bag is safe. After taking the giblets from the turkey, put some onions, celery, citrus or whatever you like to flavor your bird in the cavity.








, The turkey is done when the deepest part of the thigh registers 170 °F (77 °C). and the breast registers 160 °F (71 °C). Because you cooked the turkey from the frozen state, the larger mass of breast meat will thaw and cook more slowly. At the same time, the lesser mass of thigh and leg meat will thaw and cook more quickly. This roasting dynamic allows the breast to register only 160 °F (71 °C), maintaining its moisture, while the deepest part of the thigh reaches a temperature of 170 °F (77 °C).

Check that the turkey is thoroughly thawed.,
Remove the turkey from its packaging, setting the raw bird in a large bowl in your kitchen sink or on stack of paper towels on the counter.,
Rinse the turkey with cold water, getting all outside and inside surfaces clean.,
Dry the turkey prior to preparing it for the oven.,
Clean your work area thoroughly with soap, hot water and bleach products.",How to Clean a Turkey," If you try to cook the bird with large portions of it still frozen, it will not cook evenly, and someone at your table could wind up becoming ill from under-cooked poultry. To determine if it's still frozen, simply press down and gently squeeze the bird (still in its wrapper) to see if you detect any hard, very cold spots.


Thawing in a bowl or the kitchen sink of cold water takes roughly 30 minutes per pound. The wrapping should be free of any tears to minimize any cross contamination of bacteria. Remember to change the water every 30 minutes or so to keep it cold; never use hot water.
Thawing in the refrigerator should take roughly 24 hours for every five pounds, so a 15-pound frozen turkey could take roughly three days to thaw completely.
If you are cleaning a fresh (never frozen) store-bought turkey or a turkey brought home from a hunting trip, you won't need to worry about the thawing step.;
,


Be careful when cutting the wrapper off as it often has cooking instructions or other warnings on it that you may wish to read. If this is a wild turkey from a hunting trip, the wrapping it is in will obviously not be the plastic wrapper covered in writing.
You may want to cut a small hole in the wrapper and hold the bird over the sink to drain any excess water from thawing into the sink before you cut the package open.

, You may want to rinse two or three times. If any tiny pin feathers remain on the bird, either missed in the packing plant or while cleaning a wild turkey, simply pull them out by applying pressure where the quill is attached to the skin.


To clean the inside cavities of the bird, you'll need to release its legs from the metal or plastic brackets holding them together. You can then reach inside, pull out the bag of giblets and either discard them or set them aside momentarily if you plan to cook them to make gravy.
If you find a few ice crystals inside, run a little lukewarm water into the cavity until the ice crystals are gone. If you find a large chunk of ice crystals inside, remove the ice chunk and then leave the bird in a sink of cold water just briefly to continue thawing. (Don't leave it too long to avoid the development of harmful bacteria.)
Turn the turkey over to clean the small cavity that's usually covered with a flap of skin on the backside of the bird.

, Turn it on end so the large cavity is pointing toward the drain and shake it gently to remove remaining water from inside the turkey. Place it on paper towels on the counter or in a large dry bowl then pat the turkey dry with paper towels and transfer it to the prepared roasting pan.

, This includes the sink, cutting boards, counter top, bowls and utensils. Use diluted bleach, an antibacterial kitchen spray with bleach or a soft scrubbing bleach product and hot water to kill bacteria. Then wash your hands thoroughly with hot water and an antibacterial soap.

How to Roast a Turkey With Moist White Meat;
, If you have one available, place the turkey on a rack in the pan so the drippings fall to the bottom of the pan and are easy to get to.









Some people choose to baste from the drippings in the bottom of the pan, while others choose to make a special mixture separately to put over it. What you use to baste is up to you.

, You'll want two timers: one for the basting intervals and one for the whole time. How long you put it in for overall largely depends on the size of your turkey.









Set your basting timer for 30 minutes. You will be basting at every 30 minute interval.

, Pull out the rack part-way. Open the roasting pan lid, or pull back the foil tent cover a bit. Look at the meat. Is it starting to get a little tan? Excellent. Your turkey is ready for its first basting session.









Some people do prefer to baste every 20 minutes or so. However, the shorter the interval, the more you'll be strapped to the oven.

, A bulb baster is a special rubber tool to suck up and pour out liquids. It's like a large, soft syringe. If you don't have one, a spoon or cup will work just as well.








, Take some of the liquid you prepared for basting and pour it gently all over the surface, using your spoon, cup, or bulb baster. Use any kind of stock, wine, butter, oils, gravy, or juices. The idea is to keep the turkey meat moist.









It's easiest to use the juices at the bottom. However, if you have a recipe for an herb butter, a marinade, or a gravy, that's great, too.

, Reset the timer for 30 minutes. Go watch an episode of your favorite TV show or pick up a book, but don't go too far away!








, Soon, once again, you will have liquid on the bottom of the pan. Now use that instead of any liquid from a bowl. Whether you used the original meat juices or something else, it is now at the bottom of the pan, infused with meat juices, ready to be reused again.








, Don't let the turkey stew in juices. This will make the meat soft instead of giving it that golden outside, crispy rind.









This is why a small rack in the roasting pan is best. With a rack, it stays out of all the juices.

, Use some of the juices as a gravy base, or pour some into a bowl for table dressing over stuffing, vegetables, potatoes, etc. Don't let it go to waste! That juice has been stewing for hours with delicious turkey juices.








, Many people choose to forgo the basting entirely and instead wrap the turkey in a foil tent – basically just a layer of aluminum foil loosely over the turkey. This keeps the juices in, serving the same purpose as the basting.









This is more convenient in that once the foil is placed, you can set it and forget it, instead of going into the kitchen every half hour for maintenance.

, Instead of getting into the pan and dealing with hard-to-get-to juices or melting butter and herbs and getting sticky, just spray the turkey with apple juice! If you have a spray bottle, it's incredibly convenient.









Of course, you could always infuse the apply juice with honey, herbs, butter, or anything else you can imagine for a more savory touch.

, Want to put a trendy take on your turkey? What's better than bacon? Fry up some bacon, add in some paprika, garlic, or maybe some onion, and keep the juices. Set the bacon aside on paper towels to dry. Then pour the bacon juices all over the turkey.









When the turkey is near done, chop up the bacon and sprinkle it over the turkey., A brined turkey is one that is kept in a large bucket or cooler for around 12 hours with a mixture of water, salt, broth, honey, and other additives. It's a great way to ensure that your turkey stays incredibly moist, and no basting required!


You still have to cook the turkey as normal, and using a foil tent is a good idea. Some people choose to use wood chips on the bottom of the pan to give it a roasted hickory taste. If this sounds interesting, check out the article!

Keep thawed turkey in the refrigerator.,
Preserve pre-stuffed turkeys in the freezer.",How to Store an Uncooked Turkey," Turkey packagers choose packaging that is secure at keeping out bacteria and best retains the meat's freshness. Removing the original packaging and leaving a naked bird or replacing it with your own wrapping exposes the meat to bacteria and increases the potential for spoilage. The packaging must be leak-proof––check with the retailer prior to purchase.;
, Freezing the bird is the best way to retain quality and freshness if you do not plan on using it for a while.

Place the whole turkey in your freezer or deep freeze. The ideal temperature for your freezer is 0 degrees Fahrenheit, or -18 degrees Celsius. This temperature ensures the bird remains completely frozen.






The bird can safely remain in the freezer for up to 1 year. Fresh parts of the bird can be kept for up to 9 months in the freezer. Ground fresh turkey can be kept in the freezer for 3 to 4 months. After this amount of time, the quality of the meat will diminish., Allow for 1 day thawing in the refrigerator for every 4-5 pounds of turkey.If thawed in cold water, leave the turkey in its original packaging and refresh the water regularly to ensure that it stays cold.






Turkey can also be thawed in the microwave oven (if it fits). If you use this method, the turkey must be cooked immediately following the thawing, as the microwave will most likely result in uneven thawing and will start to cook some of the turkey., A whole, uncooked, thawed turkey can be stored in the refrigerator for 1 to 2 days. If kept undisturbed in the store packaging, you can store store-bought turkey in the refrigerator for up to 5 days, or until the ""use by"" date marked on the packaging. The refrigerator should be at a temperature under 40 degrees Fahrenheit (4 degrees Celsius).

Secure a tray under the turkey to catch any juice that might escape from the packaging. This will keep the refrigerator and other food in it clean and free from the risk of germs from the raw juices.






Place the turkey in the coldest part of a refrigerator, which is at the far back on the bottom shelf.

Let it rest.",How to Roast a Turkey," This can be done one of two ways:









Place the turkey still in its wrapper on a large tray, such as a cookie sheet, to catch any juices. Slide the turkey-laden tray onto the bottom shelf of the refrigerator. Allow one day of thawing per four to five pounds of turkey. Start defrosting a 20 pound turkey on Saturday to ensure it will be ready to cook Thanksgiving morning.
Place the turkey still in its wrapper in the sink and cover with cold water. Change the water every 30 minutes. Allow 30 minutes per pound (a 20 pound Turkey will take 10 hours to thaw). Cook immediately. The USDA also provides the following information on how to defrost a turkey safely.;
, Stick your hand in the cavity and remove any packages, or liver, heart, neck, and other things you may find inside of the bird. If desired, save everything but the liver for giblet gravy. Fry the giblets or, except for the liver (which has a non-turkey-like flavor that, although pleasant to many, would make the drippings or gravy taste odd), just leave them to roast and eat them. The gizzard and heart are tough, so cut them up––do not give them to a small child who could possibly choke on them.








, Hold the turkey under room temperature or cold water and rub it gently with your fingers. Make sure there isn't any dirt, pieces of feathers, etc.








, Use a cloth or paper towel, pat it dry; don't rub it. Make sure you dry the whole bird, inside and out, as much as you can. If you use a cloth towel, put it straight into the washing machine afterwards.








, Try to keep it centered to promote even heating.








, Spread a tablespoon or two of olive oil over the skin of the turkey. This will help brown the turkey nicely, as well as promote a really crispy skin.








, Sprinkle oregano, rosemary, garlic powder, and pepper lightly over the top of the turkey. Put some on the inside as well.









Quarter the onion and put it all inside the turkey. Put the three garlic cloves in with the onion. Make sure that both are peeled. After this is done, pour in broth until it is surrounding the turkey (about 1 cup).
Insert a meat thermometer into the thickest part of a thigh making sure it does not touch the bone. An electronic thermometer with a cord extending to the outside of the oven and an alarm for a particular temperature is particularly convenient. Even with these, leave the pop-up thermometer to help confirm that you are not long overcooking the turkey due to a measurement error.

,, When the oven is at temperature, place the turkey in oven (bottom rack) and until meat is 161°F (72°C). Allow about 15 minutes per pound.





If you're using a roasting bag, shake a turkey size oven bag with 1 tablespoon of flour. Place the bag on the roast pan. Slide the turkey breast side up, in the bag. Twist tie shut. Cut slits in the bag. Do not add any broth. Make sure the bag isn't hanging over the edge.
If you're not using a roasting bag, put about a quarter-inch of water in the pan and cover the pan with its lid or some foil. Basically the turkey should steam for most of the cooking time. Check on the turkey every hour or so and replenish the watery liquid if it is almost all gone.

, Uncover the turkey and turn your oven to Broil for ten minutes. Make sure to keep a close watch on it during this time as ovens vary and broil is usually a very high temperature. If you are using a roasting bag, open the top completely before broiling.









Start this process when the turkey is still a few degrees from done temperature, because it will continue to heat.
You may wish to remove a meat thermometer, especially a more expensive and probably more fragile electronic one, so the intense radiant heat does not destroy it. In that case, err on the side of potentially warming the turkey a few degrees more than you expected, to make sure it's safe.

, Remove the turkey from the juices and place on a cutting board. Remove any stuffing. Loosely cover with tinfoil and wait 20 minutes before slicing to prevent the turkey from losing all of its juices. Use this time to make gravy.

",How to Prepare a Turkey Dinner," A traditional roasted turkey is easy to make with minimal equipment and little experience. Sprinkle the cavity and the outside with salt and pepper. You can chop up onions, garlic, lemon and herbs to stuff into the cavity. For a unique twist, rub white truffle butter under the skin of your turkey.






;
, If you have a slow cooker, this method makes a tender and delicious turkey with minimal fuss. You'll need to stick to a turkey breast that weighs 7 pounds (3 kg) or fewer so that it will easily fit in your slow cooker. You'll also want to broil (grill) the turkey after you finish cooking it, so that you can brown the skin and make it crispy.








, For something different, make deep-fried turkey. The turkey takes less time to cook and comes out moist and delicious. You'll need a deep fryer or a large pot for your cooking oil. If you don't have a deep fryer, then you'll need to rig a metal handle to raise and lower your turkey in and out of the hot oil.








, A smoked turkey needs to be thawed and pre-cooked for half an hour before placing it in your smoker. If you cook turkey in a smoker, then you'll definitely need a meat thermometer to check the temperature. The interior meat can look pink while the outside of the turkey looks dark, even if the turkey's internal temperature measures 165ºF (74ºC).








, This recipe combines raisins, sweet potatoes and cornbread to create a nutritious alternative to traditional stuffing recipes. While it's fine to use canned sweet potatoes, you can boil or roast sweet potatoes for an even fresher flavor.








, Combine sausage, cooked vegetables and roasted chestnuts to make a stuffing that will serve 4 to 6 people. The inside should be fully cooked while the top is browned and crispy.








, This stuffing recipe is great if you have no more room in your oven to prepare additional dishes. The dish is cooked in the microwave, which will both free up room and save lots of time.








, Whether you're cooking your turkey for Thanksgiving, Christmas or another time of year, you need to follow some important safety instructions before you roast a stuffed turkey. Check out the method for stuffing the turkey in the suggested article, and the delicious stuffing recipes included.








, Skip the canned glop and try this recipe for making cranberry sauce from fresh or frozen cranberries. To give the sauce additional flavor, add some fresh orange zest.








, This recipe involves cooking sweet potatoes and then adding a crunchy nut and brown sugar topping. Add marshmallows to the top if you want. Also, try 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon of lemon extract in the sweet potato filling. You'll be surprised how good it tastes.








, Take fresh asparagus and wrap it in lightly cooked bacon before you grill it or roast it. A dash of balsamic vinegar also makes a good addition to this dish.








, Fresh-baked dinner rolls will be a hit when served along with your turkey dinner. Add some chopped thyme to your dough to give the rolls a holiday twist. But if you don't have time to make fresh rolls, just pick up some fresh rolls at your local bakery or grocery store.








, Autumn is a great time to enjoy freshly harvested apples, but you can make apple pie any time of year by following this delicious recipe. Granny Smith apples are traditional, but you can also try Galas or Cortlands.








, Are you tired of using squished pumpkin from a can? Use a fresh sugar pumpkin to add class to this traditional autumn dessert. Fresh pumpkin requires a bit of extra prep time, but the taste difference will be worth it.








, Mincemeat is a suitably spicy, cinnamon infused addition to the traditional turkey dinner. You can easily prepare meatless mincemeat by combining chopped raisins, candied orange peel, brown sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves and the zest of an orange or a lemon. Combine these ingredients and soak them in brandy for a day or so before baking your pie.








, Carrot cake with cream cheese frosting will let you use up those carrots in your fridge while also creating a great dessert. You can adapt the recipe to make carrot cake cupcakes if you want to prepare something a little less formal.








, Good choices for turkey include a hearty chardonnay or a light pinot noir. Look for wines with flavor notes, like apple or pear, that complement the other dishes.

",How to Cajun Deep Fry a Turkey,"


In addition to turkey (appropriately sized according to your dinner plans), you will need Cajun marinade or ingredients to make your own, a chef's syringe to inject the flavoring, peanut oil and any additional seasonings according to personal tastes.
Pre-mixed marinades, complete with injectors can be purchased from grocery and specialty stores. To make your own, consult the Web for recipes or be adventurous and try experimenting with your own flavors.;
, Do not stuff a turkey you plan to Cajun deep fry.

,,


It can take up to an hour for the peanut oil in the turkey fryer to heat to the appropriate temperature.

Make the seasoning rub.,
Dry the turkey and rub it with seasoning.,
Place the garlic, onion, and thyme in the slow cooker.,
Cook the turkey breast.,
Let the turkey rest.,
Strain the liquid from the crock pot.,
Make gravy while the turkey rests.,
Crisp the skin under the broiler.,
Serve the turkey breast with the gravy.",How to Cook a Turkey Breast in the Crock Pot," Place dried seasonings into a small bowl and stir them with a little bit of oil until they're combined. The seasoning includes flavorful ingredients (like onion and garlic powders) and paprika, which will give the turkey breast a little color as it bakes. For the seasoning, mix together:1½ teaspoon of garlic powder
1½ teaspoon of onion powder
1 teaspoon of paprika
2 teaspoons of salt
5 grinds of black pepper
1½ tablespoons of olive oil;
, Remove one fresh or thawed turkey breast from the package. It should weigh around 4 pounds (2 kg) and have the skin on. Pat the turkey breast with paper towels until the turkey is dry. Cover the turkey breast with the seasoning rub. Use your hands or a pastry brush to spread it along the sides and top of the turkey.Most turkey breasts will come with the bones, but you can also cook a boneless turkey breast.
According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, you should not rinse the turkey breast before you season or cook it. Rinsing the turkey can actually spread bacteria near your sink and work space., Cut one head of garlic in half horizontally and place it cut-side down in the slow cooker. Take one unpeeled garlic and cut it in half as well. Set the onion cut-side down in the slow cooker. Add 5 sprigs of fresh thyme or 2 teaspoons of dried thyme.There's no need to chop or mince the fresh thyme. Leaving the springs whole will make it easier to remove them once the turkey has cooked.

, Lay the seasoned turkey breast directly onto the garlic, onion, and thyme in the bottom of the slow cooker. The garlic and onion should raise the turkey up so that it's not touching the bottom of the slow cooker. Turn the slow cooker on low and cook it for 6 to 7 hours. If your turkey breast weighs more or less, use these guidelines:5 hours on low for a 2 pound (1 kg) turkey breast
6 to 7 hours on low for a 4 to 6 pound (2 to 3 kg) turkey breast
8 to 9 hours on low for an 8 to 10 pound (4 to 5 kg) turkey breast

, Test the temperature of the turkey using a thermometer. Once it's reached 165 degrees F (73 C), it's safe to eat. Insert a sturdy wooden spoon into the turkey cavity. Hold several paper towels in your other hand and press the paper towels against the end of the turkey while you lift up with the handle of the spoon. Carefully lift the whole turkey out of the crock pot and set it on your carving board. Let the turkey rest for 20 minutes.Allowing the turkey to rest will help the juices redistribute within the turkey breast. This will keep it from drying out.
You could also use two large meat forks to hold and lift the turkey breast out of the crock pot.

, Set a large measuring jug or cup into your sink. Place a mesh strainer over the measuring jug. Put on oven mitts and hold the crock pot. Pour the liquid from the bottom of the crock pot through the strainer and into the measuring jug. Remove the mesh strainer and discard the vegetables. You should have about 2 cups (475 ml) of liquid that you'll use for the gravy.If you don't have enough liquid, add chicken broth or water to get 2 cups.

, Melt 4 tablespoons (55 g) of butter in a medium-sized saucepan over medium heat. Stir in 1/4 cup (30 g) of flour and cook it for one minute. Slowly pour in 1/2 cup of your turkey liquid and whisk constantly to prevent lumps. Keep adding more of the liquid as you whisk. The gravy should thicken as it cooks. Taste the gravy and season it with salt and pepper to taste.If you like a thick gravy, cook it longer or use less of the turkey liquid. For a gravy that's easy to pour, you'll probably want to use all 2 cups of turkey liquid.
If you have lumps in the gravy, you can use an immersion blender to quickly blend the gravy until it's smooth.

, Turn the broiler on to high and ensure that your rack is low enough to allow the turkey to fit in the oven. If you can, try to place the turkey about 12 inches (30 cm) below the broiler. Set the cooked turkey on a sturdy baking sheet or dish and set it on the rack. Broil the turkey for 3 to 5 minutes. The skin should turn crispy and golden brown.Avoid walking away from the broiler while the turkey is crisping. If it browns quickly, you'll need to pull it out of the oven to keep it from burning.

, As soon as the turkey skin is golden, carefully remove it from under the broiler and carve it. Place the carved pieces on a warmed serving platter and serve it right away. Set the gravy out on the side so guests can serve themselves.If you choose to keep the turkey warm in the oven for a while before serving it, the turkey may become dry or even tough. If you must keep it warm before serving it, wrap it well and broil it just before you do serve it.

Ensure that you have an ample oven.,
Get a roasting pan.,
Brine the bird.,
Truss (or tie up) your bird.,
Roast your bird.,
Transfer turkey to a carving board, let rest for 30 to 40 minutes, and carve, serve, and eat your turkey.

","How to Brine, Truss, and Roast a Turkey"," Turkeys are large birds-usually between 12 and 22 pounds. You should have an oven that allows hot air to circulate the bird at all angles. Be sure your bird has at least 6 inches (15.2 cm) of clear space from skin to oven wall so that it will cook evenly. If your oven is small, try using a breast of turkey or a whole chicken instead.;
, Any roasting pan will do, as long as it's large enough to allow 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm) of space between the pan edge and the turkey, and the bird is suspended above the bottom of the pan. Use a roasting rack, and if you don't have one, improvise. Create a crosshatch of carrots and celery. If you do this, though, it may be trickier to flip the bird during the cooking process.

, Brining involves soaking the turkey in a salt water bath. It makes crispier skin and more flavorful meat.


Put cold water in a large container. 2 gallons (7.6 L) is sufficient for most birds, but if your bird is bigger than 18 pounds, you may need more.
Add 1 cup of salt per gallon to the container. The size of your turkey doesn't influence the amount of salt used. PLEASE NOTE: unless you want a really salty bird, do not brine a kosher or self-basting turkey. They already contain a lot of sodium.
Dunk your turkey into the brine solution and put the container in the refrigerator. Allow the bird to soak in the brine for 4 to 6 hours. The bigger the bird, the longer it should soak.
Remove the bird from the brine and rinse it well under cold water. Pat dry with paper towels.

,


If you are going to stuff your turkey, do it just before you truss it. If you would rather cook the stuffing separately, try stuffing the cavity loosely with garlic cloves, fresh thyme, carrots, and celery, after salting and peppering it thoroughly.
Tuck the tips of the drumsticks into the skin at the tail to secure and tuck the wing tips behind the back.
Thread cotton twine through the eye of a trussing needle and sew up the cavity with a few stitches. Only a few-any more and you run the risk of your bird cooking unevenly.

,


Adjust the oven rack to the lowest position and preheat the oven to 400 °F (204 °C), or 425 degrees for a turkey larger than 18 pounds. Melt 1/4 cup butter in a saucepan, then brush the butter to cover the surface of the turkey. Grind a lot of cracked black pepper over the bird.
Put the turkey breast side down on the roasting rack and roast for 45 to 60 minutes, depending on the size of the bird.
Remove the pan from the oven and reduce the temperature to 325 °F (163 °C). Use clean potholders or kitchen towels to rotate the turkey breast side up and baste the entire surface with pan drippings.
Continue to roast, basting every 20 minutes, until the thickest part of the breast registers 165 °F (74 °C) and the thickest part of the thigh registers 170 to 175 °F (77 to 79 °C) on an instant-read thermometer. (About 50 minutes to 2 hours longer).

Make the brining solution two days before roasting.,
Add spices and seasonings.,
Untie and remove any string or trussing.,
Wash the bird inside and out under cold water.,
Dunk the turkey.,
Try this as an alternative.,
Keep cool.,
Turn the bird.,
Remove the turkey from the brine.",How to Brine a Turkey," Dissolve the salt and brown sugar in 2 cups of boiling water. Allow to cool and then refrigerate overnight.






;
, Mix the brine solution, cold water, and any other brine ingredients you want to use, in a large container. You can add spices and seasonings according to your own preferences and availability. You can even substitute some of the water with cold tea, fruit or vegetable juices, stock, cider, wine or light beer. Changing the brine liquid is part of the fun of experimenting!








, Check that the wings and legs are not squashed against the body; rather, they should be free to soak in the brine.








, Rinse thoroughly.








, Sink the bird into the liquid, adding more water if necessary to completely submerge it. If the turkey keeps floating up, find a way to weigh it down, such as a tray with something heavy placed on top of it.








, Take two clean, fresh roasting bags or kitchen trash bags just off the roll or out of the box:









Put one inside the other to make a double bag.
Put the turkey (without innards) inside the double bag and pour in the brine.
Squeeze the double bag until all the air is expelled.
Tie off the top so it won't leak.
Now, no matter which way you lay the turkey down, it will be covered with brine. It will fit anywhere and you won't have to worry about turning it halfway through the process in the middle of the night. Just be careful when lifting it to pick it up from the bottom.

, Refrigerate the bird in its brine, or put into a cool place (no more than 40°F/4.4ºC) and leave it for at least ten hours.









Ideally, the turkey should be kept refrigerated during the brining. If that isn't possible, keep the container (like a cooler box) somewhere cool, such as in a basement.
Ice packs or reusable gel packs may be used to maintain the temperature, but do not put ice directly into the brine as this will dilute the solution. The turkey and brine solution must be kept below 40°F/4°C at all times.

, About halfway through the brining process, turn the bird over to ensure even brining throughout.








, Rinse inside and out under cold water, and dry thoroughly using kitchen towel. Allow to come up to room temperature for an hour before you plan to roast. This helps to ensure proper and safe heat penetration.

Place the cooked turkey on a clean wooden board.,
Allow the turkey to stand at room temperature for 10-15 minutes or longer after roasting.,
Check the quality of the knife before proceeding.,
Warm the serving platter.",How to Carve a Turkey1," To check that the turkey is cooked, pull away a leg. If the juices run clear, then it's cooked. It'll be easiest if the legs are placed away from you.;
, The juices will spread within the turkey, making the meat evenly moist.


This also gives you time to prepare last-minute dishes. Tenting with foil will help keep the bird warm and is also recommended to help keep the meat firmer and juicier.

, The key to a good carving knife is its sharpness; also, it should have a blade long enough to carve the breast into neat slices, meaning that it should extend about 5 cm (2"") beyond the meat on both sides to allow for the sawing action.


Do not use serrated knives or a chopper. It can also help to have a large carving fork to hold the turkey in place.

If using a carving fork, it should be short, with curved prongs. This type of fork will hold the turkey firmly without damaging the meat, giving you total control over the carving and slicing.


Some people like to use two knives. They will use the carving knife for slicing the turkey into thin strips and a cook's knife to divide the bird into joints.

, This is important because it will help the carved meat to retain its heat for longer. You'll be eating this thing for the next six hours, so it's best to be prepared (do you have your sweatpants ready, too?).


Remove any trussing string and foil before carving at this stage.

The joint should snap free. If not, it can easily be cut with your knife. Don't be afraid to use a little force.

, Carve close to the body, especially near the turkey's back. Note the succulent orb of meat at the base of the back, called the oyster. Consume it as the cook's reward!

, An easy way to find the joint is by feeling with your finger. It should cut easily.

, Cut slices parallel to the bone. This task can be assigned to someone else to save time while you move on to carve other parts of the turkey.

Season the turkey.,
Make the metal handle.,
Prepare the burner.,
Prepare the oil level.,
Dry the pot.,
Add the oil.,
Check the temperature.,
Fry the turkey.,
Finish the frying.",How to Deep Fry a Turkey," Begin by sprinkling cayenne pepper over the top of the turkey and around the legs, rubbing it in as you go. Then turn it on its side, sprinkle more cayenne and rub it in. Completely turn the turkey over upside down before sprinkling and rubbing the underside. Continue until the entire body has been well covered and rubbed.









There are many different ways to season the turkey, so feel free to look up recipes. Most of them involve rubbing the turkey with seasoning or injecting it with marinade.
Try to get the rub under the skin as the skin is often tossed on a big bird once it gets overcooked.;
, This method is recommended if you do not have a deep frying basket. Place the turkey on its shoulders (where the head would be) and begin to spear the wire through it, just underneath the breast and by the wings. Carefully pull the wire through and loop the wire around about three times to make a metal handle. Twist the ends of the wire around your handle so there are no sharp ends.









It is very important to do a little test to make sure that your handle is totally secure when lifting up the turkey. Only when you are convinced that the handle is strong enough should you move onto the next step.
To get the oil to the hard to reach spots, make incision in the leg skin where it pulls against the body to allow the oil better access.

, The frying of the turkey must be done outside, in a dry and well ventilated area and not near anything flammable. Set the gas burner on a level surface because this is one of the safest options to ensure that the fryer doesn't tip over. Keep the propane tank as far away from the fryer as possible and make sure it is not on, under or near any flammable materials. When not set up properly, a deep fryer can explode. Read the instructions that came with your fryer.









Never use the fryer in the garage or on the deck when oil is in the pot.

, Fill the pot halfway with water. Then roughly half fill the bucket with water, which should represent the same weight as your turkey. Place the bucket into the pot to make sure the water does not go past the top of the bucket; it should be at least 5 or 6 inches (12.7 or 15.2 cm) below the rim. If it is too high, then discard some of the water. The water line will represent the quantity of oil you will need, so make a note of it. Remove the bucket and tip away the water from the pot.









Alternatively, you can put the turkey itself in the empty pot and add enough water to just cover (1-2 inches above) the turkey. Again, the level should be at least 5 or 6 inches (12.7 or 15.2 cm) below the rim. Take the turkey out and measure the depth of the water with a ruler. Dry the turkey thoroughly afterward.

, It is extremely important to thoroughly wipe the pot dry with some kitchen roll. You must not leave any water in the pot as hot oil and water can be a very dangerous combination.








, Pour the oil into the pot to the level where the water was. You should have somewhere between 3–5 inches (7.6–12.7 cm) of oil in the pot. Light your gas burner and adjust to a high setting, then place the pot carefully down onto the burner plate. Place the thermometer into the oil and allow the oil to heat to a temperature of 350 °F (175 °C). The time it takes to heat to cooking temperatures varies.









You should monitor the temperature throughout the heating and cooking process. Depending on your burner and outside conditions, the oil can heat up to dangerous levels very quickly.
Put on a protective jacket/apron and gloves. You may also wish to put on safety goggles to keep oil from splashing in your eyes.

, Once the oil has reached 350 °F (175 °C), you're ready to fry. Make sure you have on your protective gloves and jacket when handling the turkey or working around the hot oil. With the metal hook attached to the wire loop handle of your turkey, lower the turkey with extreme care into the hot oil. Even with the bird patted dry, there will be a violent reaction when it hits the hot oil. Do this very slowly and be aware of any hot splashing oil.









It is strongly recommended to turn off the burner while the turkey is being submerged, then to turn it back on once the turkey is in. Boiled over oil hitting the burner is the cause of most accidents.
For a large bird, use a pole of some sort like a hockey stick. Put it through the handle and have someone help lower the bird into the pot. This will help keep your distance from the oil as it reacts to the bird.

, Allow 3-4 minutes of cooking for every 500 grams (17.6 oz) (1lb). Monitor the temperature by leaving a candy thermometer in the oil (hung from a copper wire) as the turkey cooks. Never leave the hot oil unattended during the cooking process! When the bird is dropped and the fluids begin to cook out, the boiling off of these fluids tends to cool the oil, after which the oil temperature may tend to rise. Halfway through the cooking process, check to see how the turkey is doing by briefly lifting it out of the pot, again using the metal hook attached to the wire handle. Then lower it back into the pot for the rest of the cooking period.


Cooking time can vary based on factors such as outdoor temperature and the temperature of the bird.
If the oil begins to smoke at any time, lower the heat. Overheated oil can lead to combustion.
To control the temperature if it starts to rise, adjust the burner to turn down the heat.

, Once the turkey begins to float to the top of the oil, allow it cook for an additional 15 minutes. Once cooked, carefully remove your turkey from the pot, give it a little shake to disperse the excess oil and transfer it back onto its platter. Check the internal temperature with the meat thermometer. The temperature should be at least 165 degrees F (75 degrees C), but preferably 170 degrees F (77 degrees C) in the breast and 180 degrees F (82 degrees C) in the thigh. Turn off the flame. Let the oil cool completely, making sure it's in a spot where nobody (especially kids and pets) will run into it. Remove the wire and serve.

, Sear the chops for 2 minutes on each side, or until each side is well-browned.Pork chops are notorious for drying out when cooked, but there are a few ways to prevent this. Searing the meat is one of the simplest ways. Searing the surface of the meat creates a barrier along the surface, thereby locking more of the moisture inside.

, Lower the heat to medium, cover the skillet, and let the chops cook for another 5 to 10 minutes.


To accurately determine whether or not the pork chops are safe to eat, check the center of the thickest chop with a meat thermometer. The internal temperature of pork chops must reach at least 145 degrees Fahrenheit (63 degrees Celsius) before the pork is safe to eat.If you do not have a meat thermometer, you can determine if the pork chops are done by cutting into the center of the thickest cut. If the meat is white, it is likely safe to eat.

If you are concerned about the bag leaking, you could place it on top of a plate or in a small baking dish after adding the pork.
If you do not have a large enough or thick enough plastic bag, you could skip it altogether and mix the marinade together in a small glass baking dish.

, Seal the bag and toss gently to coat all sides of the pork.


If using a glass baking dish, place the pork inside the dish and flip several times to soak each side of each chop. Cover with plastic wrap or aluminum foil.

, Turn the bag or flip the chops every few hours to ensure that all sides get equal exposure to the marinade.


As a general rule, a longer marinating time will create juicier, more tender pork chops. If you marinate the meat for too long, though, it can actually become tough. Try to avoid letting the pork chops sit in the marinade for much longer than 8 hours to half a day.

, Place the butter or vegetable oil in a large skillet and heat over medium-high heat until the butter melts or the oil becomes smooth enough to easily spread over the entire surface of the pan.

, Add the garlic and cook, stirring continuously, for about 1 minute. It should become fragrant and lightly browned.


You will need to stir the garlic constantly as it cooks. Garlic burns pretty quickly, and if you take your eyes off of it for more than a few seconds, it could easily blacken. If this happens, remove the pan from the heat, wait for it to cool, then wipe out the oil and the burnt garlic before trying again with fresh oil and fresh garlic.

, Cook the chops for 2 minutes on each side in the hot oil, or until each side is notably browned.


The process of searing and braising pork chops on the stove can go a long way in preventing the meat from drying out. The seared surface locks in more of the pork's natural moisture, while the braising liquid infuses the meat with additional moisture as it cooks.

, Pour the broth into the pan and bring it to a steady boil.


Let the chops sit in the broth at a full boil for 30 to 60 seconds before proceeding. This way, the broth will have plenty of time to reach a good heat.

Note that this cooking method can also be used with a deep fryer, but frying breaded pork chops on the stove is possible as long as you have a sturdy enough stockpot.

, Gently toss together the flour, paprika, salt, garlic powder, and black pepper until the spices appear evenly distributed throughout the flour.

, Add the egg and buttermilk to a shallow bowl and whisk for 30 to 60 seconds, or until a consistent color forms.


If there are still dark yellow streaks of egg yolk in the mixture, keep whisking. The egg and buttermilk must be mixed as thoroughly as possible.

,


This initial coating of flour helps bind the egg to the meat. You can skip this initial layer of flour, but the final coating is more likely to slide off after you finish frying it if you do not have this extra layer of flour binding the egg to the meat.

, Working one chop a time, dip each chop into the egg and buttermilk mixture, soaking well. Hold the chop above the bowl for a few seconds after dipping it to allow the excess egg mixture to drip off.


The meat and buttermilk help lock in moisture during the cooking process. The mix also helps bind the coating together as it fries in the hot oil.

, Still working one chop at a time, toss each back into the flour mixture, coating all sides once more and shaking off the excess.


This is your final coating, and it will form a yummy, crispy layer on top of the pork after you fry it. If you want something with more crunch, you could coat the pork in a final layer of dried bread crumbs or finely crushed crackers instead of more flour.

, Carefully lower each chop into the hot oil using long-handled tongs. Do not be alarmed if the oil immediately sizzles upon contact with the pork.


You may find it easiest if you only fry one or two of the pork chops in the oil at the same time. If you attempt to fry all four, you could overcrowd the stockpot, which could affect the way the chops cook.

, Each pork chop should take about 6 to 8 minutes to cook.

Marinaded pork chops are great both baked and broiled. They retain moisture well.
The type of vinegar you use will alter the way the marinade tastes. Apple cider vinegar adds a subtle fruit taste and generally makes a good accompaniment to pork. Wine vinegars have a more potent, complex taste, and balsamic vinegar offers a blend of sweet and sour flavors. You can experiment with various types of other flavored vinegars until you find one that appeals to your personal sense of taste.
Experiment with the ingredients of the marinade as desired. In general, marinades need to have an acid, like vinegar, and an oil. Other flavors can be contributed depending on the sweeteners, condiments, spices, and herbs you use. For example, another popular choice for pork chops is a marinade consisting of soy sauce, garlic, and ginger. Other acids, like pineapple juice or lemon juice, can be used instead of the vinegar.;
, Place the pork chops in the dish or bag with the marinade and turn several times to coat evenly.








, Allow the pork chops to sit in the marinade for at least 30 minutes so that the meat can absorb the flavors.









A marinade also helps tenderize and moisten meat.
The longer you allow the pork to sit in the marinade, the more flavorful it will become upon being cooked. If you leave it in for more than a few hours, however, you can actually cause the pork to become even tougher.

, Beat the egg with a whisk in a small bowl with shallow sides. Whisk in the milk until combined.









Breaded pork chops are better baked than broiled. They are more generally more common than marinaded pork chops, and the breading actually helps to prevent the meat from drying out by partially shielding it from direct heat.
An easy way to beat an egg is to crush or pierce the yolk first before quickly whisking the yolk and white together.

,









Crush the mix until fine crumbs are formed.
If using cornbread mix or dry bread crumbs, no crushing is necessary.
Both pork stuffing mix and herb stuffing mix work well.

, Dunk the pork chops in the egg wash one at a time, coating all sides. Hold each pork chop over the bowl for a few seconds to allow excess egg to drip off.









Egg acts as a binding agent and helps adhere the coating onto the meat.

, Place each pork chop, one at a time, in the resealable plastic bag holding the crushed stuffing mix or crumbs. Seal the bag and give it a shake to coat all sides of the chop.








, Prepare a baking pan by coating it with melted butter or nonstick cooking spray.

Both marinades and breaded pork chops can be baked.
Nonstick aluminum foil or parchment paper can also be used instead of butter or cooking spray.

, Arrange the pork chops in a single layer, evenly spaced apart inside the pan.









If desired, you can drizzle a small amount of melted butter over breaded pork chops to help them brown. Spraying them with a butter-based cooking spray will have a similar effect. Note that this may not make a difference in pork chops prepared with a marinade, however.

, After 10 minutes, flip the pork chops to ensure even cooking. Continue baking until there is no longer any pink and the juices run clear.









Note that for some marinades, the juices will always have some tint of color due to the color of the marinade.

, Let rest for at least 3 minutes before serving.








, Pull out a broiler pan with an interior rack.

Broil marinaded pork chops, but avoid using this method with breaded pork. The intense heat is likely to burn the coating too quickly.
Most broilers only have an ""on"" setting, but if yours has separate ""high"" and ""low"" settings, preheat it to ""high.""
A broiler pan is the best option because the rack keeps the meat raised above the rendered fat that drips off into the bottom of the pan. This can prevent the fat from becoming too hot and catching fire.
Do not line the broiler pan with aluminum foil or coat it with nonstick cooking spray or butter.

, Place the chops on the rack, spacing them evenly apart and in a single layer.








, Place the pan on the top rack of the oven.









Cook for 5 minutes or until the top begins to brown.
Flip and continue cooking until the other side is also brown.
The finished pork chops should have no pink inside.

For extra crispy breading, use Japanese Panko-style bread crumbs.;
, Crack two large eggs into a mixing bowl. Add 1/8 cup of milk and beat in the egg. Together, the two will create a thick liquid known as a ""wash"" used to prepare the pork chops to be breaded.Use 2% milk fat or higher so that the egg wash is thick enough to cling to the chops.

, If time allows, leave the chops to sit in the liquid for several minutes on each side to ensure that they are thoroughly covered. The thickness and moisture of the wash will allow the breading to stick to the pork chops better.The egg will also enhance the texture of the pork chops and help cook the outside.

, Once the chops have been soaked in the egg wash, place them in the container with the breading mixture. Use both hands to press the breading into the chops to make sure they get completely coated, and remember to do both sides. The pork chops are now breaded and ready to be cooked.As an alternative, soak the chops in the egg wash and then place them in a gallon Ziploc bag containing the breading mixture. Shake the bag to get a nice, mess-free coating on the chops., Pour about 1/4 cup of canola oil into a large skillet and turn the cook top on to a medium heat. If you’re serving company, the skillet should ideally be large enough to cook 3-4 chops at a time.

The hot oil will splatter as the pork chops cook. Keep a safe distance away from the skillet, or make sure to minimize the amount of exposed skin on the arms.

, Use the tongs or meat fork to check the underside of the chops to make sure they’re cooking evenly. Once the first side of the chops begin to take on a light golden-brown color, turn them over. Let them cook for 2-3 more minutes on the opposite side until done.Eating undercooked pork can be a health hazard. A little pink is okay, but use a meat thermometer to make sure the internal temperature is at least 145 degrees., Remove the pork chops from the skillet and place them on a separate plate lined with paper towels. The paper towels will absorb excess oil so that the chops will a nice, crispy finish instead of being overly greasy. After frying, the outside of the chops will be extremely hot, so allow them to sit for about 5 minutes before you dig in.


Remove the paper towels and transfer the pork chops to a separate serving dish before serving.

, Set the oven to bake and preheat it to 425 degrees. If you’ve chosen baking as your preferred cooking method, you can begin preheating the oven while you bread the pork chops.If you’re worried about burning the breading on the chops before they are completely cooked, set the oven to a lower temperature around 350 degrees and cook for an extra 20-30 minutes., Select a baking sheet large enough to accommodate the pork chops you’ve breaded. Spray it down with a light coating of cooking oil. Starches have a tendency to stick to metal surfaces when they get hot, so spraying your baking sheet first will spare you a mess later on.Use aerosolized canola oil or another similar cooking spray.

, Arrange the pork chops around the baking sheet so that they’re not touching. The chops will cook more evenly if they are well spaced-out. If you want, you can spray the tops of the pork chops with another light layer of oil to make sure that they get nice and crispy on both sides.Place particularly thick chops near the center of the baking sheet to expose them to more constant heat while cooking.

, Set a timer for 20 minutes and put the pork chops in the oven. Keep an eye on them as they cook. Take the chops out at the 10 minute mark and turn them over to ensure that they get done throughout. When 20 minutes is up, remove the pork chops and let them cool for a few minutes before serving. Enjoy!Turning the pork chops is optional, but can provide a more consistent finish to the breading.
Use a meat thermometer to take a reading of the internal temperature of the pork chops before eating. They should be around 145-160 degrees once they’re done."

Cook the meat as desired.",How to Tenderize Meat with Beer," All beers contain potentially tenderizing enzymes, but the style of beer you select will have a dramatic impact on your food's flavor.


Very light beers, such as pilsner, light lagers, and some pale ales, tend to add very little flavor to foods. Very intense beers, like porter and stout, tend to add an unpleasant bitter, smoky, or burnt taste to your dish.
Instead, aim for a beer with a ""middle-of-the-road"" flavor profile, both in terms of hops and malt. Amber ales, nut browns, and extra special bitters (ESBs) are great choices for marinating and cooking foods.;
, Of course, you can simply soak the meat in beer alone to tenderize it. However, to further boost the flavor of your meat you can choose herbs, spices, and other flavorings to add to the beer marinade. Soy sauce and ginger could be added to an Asian-style marinade, for example. Fresh or dried rosemary, thyme, basil, and oregano could be added to an Italian-style dish.

, Zip-top plastic bags are ideal for marinading meat, because they allow you to push unnecessary air out and minimize the amount of marinade needed to contact the meat.


Begin by seasoning your meat with salt and black pepper, and then add it to the plastic bag. Pour your beer marinade carefully into the bag and over the meat.
Zip the plastic bag closed, pushing as much air out as possible before sealing it. Swish the bag around a bit to ensure that the beer marinade is contacting the meat across its entire surface area.

, You will notice some improvement in the meat's tenderness after only 15 minutes. If you have more time to prepare your dish, however, let the marinade soak for at least an hour. You can also allow the meat to marinate overnight, but be aware that very long marinade times tend to lend an unappealing gray color to the meat.

, After marinating your meat in beer, you can cook it using any preparation. If using a braise or stew method, consider pouring the entire contents of your plastic bag into the cooking liquid. If sautéing or frying the meat, you may want to pat it dry before cooking to remove excess moisture. Adding moist meat to hot oil can cause dangerous and messy splatters.

Spread a little mayonnaise, mustard, or barbecue sauce on the bread and press the sandwich together. You can also add slices of meatloaf to grilled cheese sandwiches or substitute meatloaf for meatballs in a meatloaf sub sandwich.


If you want to serve a crowd, divide the meatloaf among slider buns. Add a little sauce and melted cheese. Heat a batch of sliders in the oven and serve them once they're warm.;
, Fry up eggs in a skillet along with diced potatoes or hash browns. Once the eggs have almost set, crumble up a few slices of meatloaf and stir it into the skillet. Finish frying the hash, so the meatloaf is completely heated. Serve the meatloaf hash with ketchup or hot sauce.


You could also slice bell peppers or onions to add to the skillet.

, Layer tortilla chips, cheese, scallions, and crumbled meatloaf on a large baking sheet. Place the nachos in a hot oven for about 5 minutes, so the cheese melts and the meatloaf heats up. Serve the nachos with sour cream and salsa.For a take on queso fundido, crumble meatloaf into melted cheese. Broil the cheese dip until it bubbles and serve it with tortilla chips.

, Place shredded cheese and crumbled meatloaf on a corn or flour tortilla. Set another tortilla on top and place the quesadilla in a hot skillet. Cook the quesadilla until the tortilla becomes crisp. Flip it over and finish cooking the quesadilla, so the cheese melts. Slice the quesadilla and serve it with salsa or enchilada sauce.You could also bake the quesadillas, if you don't want them to be as crisp.

, Lay flatbread (like naan or pita bread) on a baking sheet and spread pizza sauce on them. Crumble the meatloaf and divide it among the flatbread. Add your favorite pizza toppings and cheese. Cook the flatbread meatloaf pizzas until they're hot and the cheese melts.For a twist, use barbecue sauce instead of pizza sauce. You can also add hot sauce for a little heat.

, Shepherd's pie traditionally calls for ground lamb or beef cooked with vegetables. To save time and use your meatloaf, just slice the meatloaf and place it in a casserole dish. Cover the meatloaf with gravy and vegetables (like peas and carrots). Top the shepherd's pie with mashed potatoes and bake the dish until it's completely heated.You could also crumble the meatloaf and stir it into the vegetables.

, It's a snap to make homemade chili. Just combine tomato sauce, beans, and crumbled leftover meatloaf in a large sauce pot. Simmer the chili for several hours to develop the flavors. Serve the meatloaf chili with saltine crackers or cornbread. Or stir leftover meatloaf into one of these soups:Italian wedding

, You can use leftover meatloaf in place of ground beef in most casserole or pasta recipes. For example, cook ziti noodles and combine them with the crumbled meatloaf, sauce and cheese. Bake the casserole until the cheese is bubbly. You could use leftover meatloaf with traditional lasagna recipes.Make a quick casserole by combining tater tots, crumbled meatloaf, cheese, and pasta sauce. Cook the casserole until the tater tots become crisp and the cheese melts.

, While gravy is usually made with breakfast sausage or ground pork, you can quickly make a meatloaf gravy. Just crumble the meatloaf in a skillet and stir in flour to coat the meat. Stir in milk and cook the gravy until it thickens. Serve the gravy with biscuits.


You could also cut the meatloaf into small cubes instead of crumbling it.

, For a well-rounded meal that uses up even more leftovers, make a stir fry. Heat a wok or skillet over medium-high heat and add the leftover meatloaf along with leftover cooked rice. Stir in your choice of vegetables (like peas and diced carrots). Fry the mixture until it's completely heated.


To get the rice crispy, start with cold, leftover rice. This will also prevent it from clumping together as it cooks.

, Use diced or crumbled leftover meatloaf in place of ground beef in your favorite taco or burrito recipes. Just heat the meatloaf in a skillet and fill the taco shells or tortillas with the meat and your favorite toppings.For extra flavor, you can sprinkle taco seasoning or a mixture of cumin, paprika, and cayenne pepper onto the meatloaf.

Keep in mind that using metal tools to tenderize your meat will break up both the meat’s connective tissue and the meat fibers themselves.;
, There are two options that will work the best during mechanical tenderisation. Either you can use an actual meat tenderizer (which looks like a Medieval torture device) or a knife. The choice is yours.

, Tenderizing meat essentially means that you are pre-chewing the meat with a tool to make it thinner and more tender.








If you are using a meat tenderizer, hold it in your hand and bang on the meat like you would with a hammer and nail. Hit the meat evenly over the whole surface, flip it over, and continue to hit the meat with the mallet.
If you are using a knife, make cuts or scores that go across the muscles fibers. Your cuts should be long and thin but necessarily very deep.

If you are including meat (or tofu, etc.) in your recipe, begin by cutting it into small, thin pieces so that it cooks quickly. Speed is key when it comes to stir fry cooking - you'll want your ingredients, especially any meat, to cook as quickly as possible.;
, Most stir fry dishes include vegetables of some sort. As with your meat, you'll want your vegetable pieces to be fairly small and thin so that they'll cook quickly. This means that any peppers should be cut into thin slices, any onions should be chopped up, etc. Below are just a few of the vegetables you might consider adding to your stir fry - feel free to add more as you please!


Bell peppers
Hotter pepper varieties (red peppers, etc.)
Water chestnuts
Onions
Carrots (sliced or cut thin)
Broccoli
Garlic
Pea pods (especially thin snow peas)

, Traditionally, stir fry dishes are cooked in a steep, sloping style of cooking pan called a wok. However, it's possible to use flat-bottomed Western style pans as well. All that's important is that pan is made from sturdy metal and that it can contain all of your ingredients. Set your pan (with no ingredients yet inside it) over a stovetop burner on medium-high heat for about 1 to 2 minutes.


Usually, a wok is at the right temperature when it starts smoking. You can also test your pan's heat by tossing a drop of water in - if the water droplet sizzles and boils away immediately or ""dances"", your pan is hot enough. , You won't typically need much oil - you're stir frying, not deep frying. At this point, you'll also want to add any seasoning and/or spices you're using in your dish. You have many options here. You may, for instance, choose to drop in some red pepper flakes for a spicy kick or add a dash of a liquid ingredient like soy sauce to the oil for a classic flavor. The choice is yours - below are just a few more suggestions!


Sherry or rice wine
Minced garlic or garlic powder
Salt and pepper
Ginger (if using, take care not to burn)

, If you're including meat or another protein source, add it first. If your pan is hot enough, it will sear very quickly. Once an initial sear is obtained, keep the meat in motion, stirring very frequently until it is just cooked through. This usually requires about 5 minutes.


Note that the addition of meat will lower the temperature of your pan temporarily. To counteract this, you may want to turn the burner up slightly for a minute or so.

, When your meat is just barely done, you'll want to start adding your vegetables. Start with thick, firm vegetables that take a relatively long time to cook - you'll want to give these a head start of several minutes to soften up before adding the other veggies. Below are a few common vegetables that may take extra time to cook:


Broccoli
Snow peas
Carrots
Onions

, Next, add the rest of your vegetables. These veggies shouldn't take more than a few minutes to soften. Vegetables you may add at this point include:


Bean sprouts
Mushrooms
Any vegetables from a pre-cooked or ready-made package

, Finally, add any sauce you desire to your stir fry. While you may previously have added a dash or so of liquid flavor, you'll now want to add the main portion. However, it is best to be fairly conservative with your sauces. Try not to add too much sauce at once, as this can make the vegetables soggy in addition to lowering the heat of the wok. Below are a few examples of sauces you may want to add at this point.


Soy sauce
Peanut sauce
Oyster sauce

, Give your stir fry a chance to cook and reduce slightly. Continue to stir as needed - if you're confident, you can even ""flip"" your ingredients with a quick wrist motion every once in a while. After just a few minutes, the vegetables and sauce should be done.

, Congratulations - you've just made your first stir fry dish. Enjoy your stir fry on its own or use one of the ideas provided below to round out your meal!

, What use would this article be without mention of this ubiquitous Asian staple food? Rice provides a neutral, filling carbohydrate base for the veggies, meat, and sauce in your stir fry. Stir fry and rice can make a great, full meal on their own or serve as the main course of a larger culinary experience.


You have tons of options when it comes to rice - not only are there many different types of rice to choose from (brown, red, jasmine, basmati, and so on), but there are also many different ways to prepare rice. For instance, try fried rice for a hearty treat or opt for plain brown rice for maximum nutrients.

, Another great carbohydrate to go along with stir fry is noodles. Traditionally, of course, stir fries are paired with Asian varieties of noodles, but there's no rule preventing you from using other sorts of noodles. If you're adventurous, you can even apply stir fry techniques to Italian pasta dishes - you're only limited by your own imagination!

, The procedure above details a ""generalized"" sort of stir fry - in truth, there are countless dishes prepared in this style, each with their own unique flavor. One of the most famous of these is bok choy, a dish made from Chinese cabbage. Not only is this dish packed with delicious flavor - it's also fairly nutritious and low in calories. Put your stir fry knowledge to the test by frying up this great dish as a side or snack!

Check for the smoke ring.",How to Smoke Meat," Meat smoking experts like to say that all you need to smoke meat is a hole in the ground. While that may be true, using equipment designed for smoking will make the process go a lot smoother and give you more reliable results. If you want to give smoking a try, but aren't sure if you'll do it more than once, you can use your charcoal grill to smoke meat.Otherwise, consider investing in one of the following types of smokers:


A wood smoker. Wood smokers are known to produce the most flavorful results. They are fueled by hardwood blocks and chips, which impart their strong flavor to the meat you're smoking. Wood smokers can be tricky to use, though, because it's necessary to monitor them carefully and keep feeding them wood to keep the temperature steady.
A charcoal smoker. This is a great choice for both beginners and experts. Charcoal smokers are fueled by a mixture of charcoal and wood. Charcoal burns longer and steadier than wood, so charcoal smokers are easier to use than wood smokers. You can create a charcoal smoker out of your backyard grill if need be.
A gas smoker. These are easy to use - you don't have to monitor the temperature all day long - but the final product won't have as much flavor as meat smoked in a charcoal or wood smoker.
An electric smoker. With an electric smoker, you can put the meat inside, turn it on, and forget about it until the meat's done hours later. However, electric smokers aren't the best for flavor, and they also tend to be pretty expensive.;
, Meat can be smoked with a variety of different hardwoods, all of which impart a unique flavor to the meat. Some are stronger than others, and some pair better with certain types of meat. You can mix different types of wood that have properties you like. Depending on what kind of smoker you're using, you'll either need enough wood to burn all day long, or just enough to flavor the meat while charcoal, gas or electricity does the work. Choose from these options:



Mesquite will give your meat a delicious but very strong smoky flavor. If you want to use only mesquite, use it with smaller cuts that won't have a very long cooking time. For bigger cuts that will require all-day cooking, mix mesquite with a milder type of wood.

Hickory has a strong flavor pairs best with red meat.

Oak is good for cooking big cuts of red meat that need to smoke all day long, because its flavor is more subtle than that of mesquite or hickory.

Cherry is a great complement for beef or pork.

Apple wood has a sweet taste that's delicious with pork or poultry, and you can use it to smoke fish, too.

Maple is another sweet wood that pairs well with pork or poultry.

Alder is light and sweet, perfect for poultry or fish.

, In fact, some smokers are called ""water smokers,"" and they're designed to incorporate water into the process. But you can smoke using water in a charcoal or wood smoker, too. All you have to do is put a pan of water inside the smoker, and make sure it stays full throughout the day.


Water smoking can help regulate the temperature when you're smoking a big cut of meat that will need to cook for many hours. For smaller cuts of meat that don't have a long cooking time, it's not necessary to use water.
If you purchase a smoker, make sure you read the instructions before you decide to use water.

, If you're working with a small charcoal grill or another type of smoker where you're not actually using the wood as fuel, you can use wood chips instead of big pieces. Since chips tend to burn up quickly, they need to be soaked in water so they last longer. Bigger pieces, such as chunks and logs, can be left dry.


To prepare wood chips, soak them in water, then wrap them in aluminum foil. Poke holes in the top so the smoke can get out.

, Each smoker has different specifications as to how to get it ready to start smoking the meat. If you're using wood or charcoal as fuel, light up your materials in the grill and wait until they burn down and are no longer producing flames. The meat should not be placed directly over high heat; rather, you want to push the coals aside so the meat cooks low and slow over indirect heat. Throughout the cooking process, you'll add more coals and wood to keep the smoker going. The goal is to keep the smoker in the range of 200–220 °F (93–104 °C) the whole time.


If you have an electric or gas smoker, all you need to do is turn it on according to the manufacturer's instructions. Place your wood chips or pieces where they belong in the smoker - again, check the instructions to make sure you do it properly.
You might want to invest in a thermometer you can keep inside the smoker to monitor the temperature.

, The smoking technique can be used on any type of meat, but it's usually best for tough cuts that need a long, slow cooking time. The slow cooking process breaks down the fat and connective tissue so that the meat becomes extremely tender. You also want to choose meat that will taste good with a smoky flavor. Here are a few types of meat that taste great smoked:



Beef ribs, brisket, corned beef

Ham, pork crown roast, pork spare ribs

Turkey and chicken drumsticks

Salmon, trout, lobster, tilapia

, It's common to use a brine, marinade or rub to add moisture and/or flavor to meat before smoking. Of course, the smoke itself will impart a huge amount of flavor, so it's not absolutely necessary to use one of these preparation methods - however, it can add an element of depth and ensure that your meat comes out as juicy as possible.



Brining is often used to treat ham and poultry before smoking. If you plant to brine your meat, mix up a brine recipe and soak your meat in the brine overnight or for at least 8 hours. Keep the meat in the refrigerator while it brines. Be sure to remove the meat from the refrigerator and bring it to room temperature before you begin the cooking process.

Marinating is often used to treat brisket and other beef cuts before smoking. Use the same technique to marinate the meat. You can score the meat in a few places to help the marinade soak in. Drain the meat and bring it to room temperature before you cook it.

Rubs are commonly used to treat ribs before smoking. Rubs are usually made with a combination of salt and spices. The rub is applied all over the meat and left to rest for a few minutes before cooking.

, This is an important step to take before you begin smoking any type of meat. It will ensure that the meat cooks evenly and reaches the right internal temperature by the end of the cooking process. Depending on how large your cut of meat is, set it out on the counter 1/2 hour to 2 hours before you begin smoking it.

, The length of time it will take to completely cook your meat is determined by the heat of the grill, the type of meat and the size of meat cut, but you should factor in at least 6 - 8 hours of cooking time - and sometimes many more. Check your recipe to determine about how long your meat will need to smoke.


Pork and beef ribs typically take up to 8 hours, while a big cut of brisket could take 22. It's very important to look at your recipe to figure out how long your meat might cook, so you can plan ahead.

, You can either place it directly on the grill or put it in a shallow aluminum tray. Don't wrap the meat in foil, though, because this won't allow the smoke to touch the meat. You want it to be able to surround the meat during the cooking process.


The positioning of the meat will change according to what you're cooking. If you're make smoked brisket, for example, you'll need to place the meat side down and keep the fat side up.
Be sure the meat isn't over direct heat. As mentioned, if you're using your grill as a smoker the hot coals should be scooted to the side of the grill so that the meat won't cook too quickly.

, Again, depending on what you're cooking, you might want to baste the meat to keep it moist throughout the cooking process. This technique is a popular choice for brisket and ribs. Read the recipe you're using to decide if basting is necessary. If you cook your meat low and slow, it should come out moist and tender whether you baste it or not.


Smoking meat can be basted, or ""mopped,"" with a thin solution such as water or a combination of water, vinegar and spices. It should be applied with a barbecue mop, which looks exactly like it sounds.

, Some smoking recipes follow a ""3-2-1"" process:the meat smokes for the first 3 hours, then you cover it with foil for the next 2 hours, and finish it uncovered in the last hour. The smoke flavor infuses the meat first, then the meat warms up internally during the second two hours, and finally develops a nice thick crust to finish. Check your recipe to determine whether covering your meat at some point during the process is recommended.

, You'll need to monitor the temperature of the meat with a meat thermometer to determine its doneness. Poultry should reach 165 degrees. Any pork and all ground meats should be 160 degrees. The internal temperature of steaks, roasts and chops should be 145 degrees.

, During the smoking process, a pink ring will form just underneath the delicious outer crust of the meat. This is a result of a chemical reaction that happens when the smoke infuses the meat; the pink color is caused by the formation of nitric acid.When you cut into your meat and see a pink smoke ring, you'll know that you smoked it right.

Understand how tenderizing meat with heat works.,
Choose your heat tenderizer.,
Tenderize your meat slowly.",How to Tenderize Meat2," Muscle fibers in meat are surrounded by layers of collagen, which is connective tissue. When the collagen gets heated up to a temperature of 140ºF (60ºC), the collagen will tighten and shrink, causing the meat’s juices to be squeezed out, making for a very dry cut of meat (which you don’t want unless you love really well-done steak). Instead, heat meat to 160ºF (71.1ºC) or more and the collagen will start to become gelatinous, actually giving the meat a ‘fork tender’ texture that will melt in your mouth.Tenderizing meat with heat is best used on brisket, ribs or other meats with a lot of collagen. It does not work well on pork chops or filet mignon.

, You can use either dry heat or wet heat. Grilling is a great example of dry heat, while braising is a good example of wet heat. During the grilling process, the grilled meat is cooked slowly, allowing the meat to become tender. Braising meat is when you submerge meat in a flavorful liquid and cook it.

, Regardless of what method you use, the key to getting your meat tender with heat is to cook it slowly. If you do not cook your meat slowly, the outer surface of the cut will start to burn before the collagen in the meat has a chance to turn into gelatin."
"
Know what enzymatic tenderizing is.,
Know which sort of fruits contain these enzymes.,
Add a tablespoon or two of the pureed fruit of your choice.,
Place your meat in a pan, bowl, or resealable bag.",How to Tenderize Meat3," Enzymes are molecules that help speed up the process of a reaction (in this case, the breaking down of meat). Various fruits contain enzymes that will help this tenderizing process along.Acidic fruits and substances like lemon or buttermilk will also increase the tenderness of your meat.

, The most commonly used fruits for this process are pineapples, kiwis, and papayas. Of all of these, the kiwifruit has the most neutral flavor (which means it will affect the flavor of your marinade the least). Be wary of pineapple--it contains the enzyme Bromelain, which will actually turn your meat to mush if you leave it sitting in the pineapple marinade for too long., Pureeing your fruit will help it mix into the marinade better. You could also make a simple marinade of oil and lemon if you would prefer that to a marinade with kiwi. All of these ingredients will help to break down the muscle fiber in your meat.







, Add your marinade of choice to the meat and cover or seal whatever you are keeping your meat in. Let the meat rest in your marinade for at least a day (though the longer the better).

Know what dry-aging is.,
Know what meats are ideal for dry-aging.,
Set up your aging station.,
Place your piece of meat on a rack.,
Give your meat time to tenderize.,
Trim your meat down.",How to Tenderize Meat4," Dry-aging your meat is the natural way to cause enzymatic tenderization. Enzymes in the meat will break muscle fiber down and make the cut more tender, and more flavorful, as the meat ages. Note, however, that this process can take 20 or more days., You want to look for large cuts of meats that are cooked using a quick cooking method. This means the porterhouse steak, New York strip steak, and rib steak the best cuts for dry-aging. It is important that you get a really large cut--you will not be able to dry-age individual steaks, as you will need to cut away the exterior before you cook your meat, and a small steak will wither down to next to nothing if you dry-age it.If you are dry-aging ribs, go for the 109A (which is a cut of rib--ask your butcher and he will know what you are talking about). It is a cut that has had chine bone almost entirely sawed off, but the fat cap is put back on.

, You will either need space in your refrigerator, or your own mini-fridge that you can use solely for aging meat. A mini-fridge is really the best way to go, as dry-aging meat can get a little smelly and may stink up your normal fridge.


You will also need to add a small fan to your fridge--a normal desk fan will work fine. Cut a hole in the fridge door’s seal so that you can run your fan’s cord through it. The fan is important because it helps to create an even dry-aging environment that will result in a piece of meat that is evenly dried on all sides.

, Your meat must be aged on a rack rather than on a plate or directly on the surface of your fridge. The plate does not allow your meat to dehydrate and could very easily result in your meat rotting away.

, Generally, you will want to shoot for a minimum of 20 days of aging. 14 to 28 days is generally the average time restaurants take to age their steaks. 28 to 45 days is when really intense flavor starts to emerge and the meat gets very tender. Anything after 45 and the flavor gets incredibly strong (some would even say too strong) but that really depends on your preferences in flavor., When you dry-age meat, you will need to trim it down before you eat it and cook it. You will want to cut your meat down into individual steaks.

Ask questions.,
Support your local farmers' market.Farmers’ markets are the standard go-to source for local organic produce, but many markets sell more than just fruits and vegetables.,
Go directly to the source.,
Talk to an organic meat processor.Meat processors are directly responsible for the slaughtering, processing, and distribution of meat.,
Join a co-op.Food cooperatives are businesses owned and stocked by the members who join them.,
Search an online database.As interest in organic lifestyles begins to grow, so do the number of resources available to those looking to source organic goods, including meat.,
Buy online.",How to Source Local Organic Meat," First and foremost, no matter who you buy from, you should always ask plenty of questions to make sure that your purchase is both 100% local and 100% organic.


To find out if a product is local, ask where the cattle, pig, or poultry was raised as well as where the animals were butchered and processed.
To find out if a product is organic, ask if the meat is certified organic. The USDA certifies organic products. A product can either be labeled “100% organic,” meaning that it is completely organic, or it can be labeled “organic,” meaning that it is no less than 95% organic.
If the meat is not certified by the USDA, ask how the animals were raised and what butchering practices were used. Some ranchers, for instance, may actually raise organic cattle, but if they own a small ranch, they may opt out of going through the whole certification process or may otherwise be exempt from certification. It is your choice whether to believe the answer you are given, but you can help confirm or refute their claims by asking around and discovering what sort of reputation each seller has.;
, You can often find organic milk and cheese from dairy farmers as well as organic meat from organic cattle or poultry farms. Since you are buying from a farmers’ market, your odds of finding local products are improved. Depending on how urban or suburban your hometown is, though, “local” may include products from any farm in your county or in the counties bordering your own.

, This is especially useful if you are buying large quantities and looking for a long-term supplier, like if you have an organic restaurant. A rancher may or may be willing to sell directly to an individual, but if he senses a long-term profit, he will likely be willing to consider making a deal with an organic businessperson. Locate a local farm or ranch by searching a phone book or other directory.

, In effect, a meat processor is a butcher. Locating a meat processor who specializes in organic meats will offer you the best in terms of selection and quality, but even an ordinary meat processor or butcher may have a selection of locally produced organic meats. If not, he may know of someone who does.

, A co-op is usually set up at a storefront, and the products on the shelves are almost always local because the members are almost always local. The stock, including the stock of meat, is supplied by these members. To join a co-op, you only need to sign up and pay membership dues. Some may also require you to make your own contributions or to do volunteer work at the storefront, however.

, You can use a database for local organic goods or you can find out specifically for local organic meat. Set the search parameters to specify your location as well as the distance away from your location that you are willing to travel.

, In some instances, you may not be able to purchase organic meat from a local source directly, but that source may have an online storefront that you can purchase from. Buying online is also good for those who want to buy from an organic meat distributor somewhere in their state but who do not mind if that distributor is on the other end of the state, too far to drive to on an average afternoon.

Once the sugar dissolves, pour everything into a resealable bag and add the chicken. Let it sit for a few hours to overnight in the fridge. Grill or bake the chicken once it is done marinating.

, Barbecue sauce is the perfect compliment to chicken, but when you add it can make a huge difference in how the chicken tastes. If you add the barbecue sauce too early, your chicken may end up over-flavored. If you add it too late, your chicken may not be flavored enough. Here are some guidelines:


If you are baking or grilling the chicken, apply the barbecue sauce at the very end, just as the chicken finishes cooking.
If you are cooking your chicken on a slow roaster or in a crock pot, add the barbecue sauce when the chicken is halfway done.
Consider adding a little bit of honey mustard to your barbecue sauce for an added kick.
Consider using barbecue sauce as a marinade if you are planning on grilling the chicken.

Let the meat rest after cooking.,

Continue cooking the shredded meat if desired.,
Serve the meat as desired.,
Finished.

",How to Shred Meat," Raw or partially cooked meats will not shred. The type of preparation you should use will vary based on the type of meat and the desired application.


Poultry is tender enough to be shredded well after nearly any cooking preparation. Poaching the meat in water will leave the flavor as neutral as possible, which is ideal for tossing it in a sauce. Low-temperature methods like braising and smoking will allow you to shred the meat most easily.
Tender cuts of beef or pork, like tenderloin, should be cooked using a high-temperature method like grilling or sautéing. Cook the meat all the way through for the best results.
Tough cuts of meat, such as skirt steak or brisket, require a slow, low-temperature cooking method like braising or smoking. These cuts have a high amount of connective tissue, and will not pull apart readily unless cooked for a long time.;
, Once the meat is fully cooked, allow it to rest before shredding it; if cut into immediately after cooking, the meat will dry out. For most applications, the meat should be removed from the heat source and placed under a loose tent of aluminum foil. Braised meats are better left to rest in the braising liquid.

, Use 2 forks to pull the meat apart; place the first fork into the meat and hold it steady, and then place the second fork into the meat and pull it away from the first fork. Repeat this process until all of the meat has been shredded into small pieces. It is easiest to shred when the fork tines are aligned with the grain of the meat, while pulling against the grain.

, Once shredded, the meat can be served as is, or you can continue to cook it. Shredded meat for tacos or sandwiches, for example, can be left to simmer in a highly seasoned sauce before serving.

, After cooking and shredding the meat, serve it as appropriate.

If you don’t want to soak paper towels, you can soak pinecones ahead of time, place in a large sealable plastic bag and bring camping.







, Combine 4 cups bacon grease with 2 cups of cool water, 4.2 ounces of lye and food coloring. Heat in a large pot and pour into a mold. Allow several hours for it to cool.

,, Pour cooled grease into a small glass cup or bowl with a wick in it..


Tie a cotton string to the middle of a stick or toothpick (depending upon the width of the cup or bowl). You want most of the string to hang into the bacon grease with a small amount sticking up on top.






Lay the toothpick or stick across the top of the jar or cup.






Light the top of the string and allow it to burn. After 15 to 30 minutes the bacon grease becomes a solid.

Work logically.",How to Pluck a Goose," To pluck a goose can be a bit of a bloody mess, so it would help to do this on a piece of old plywood, or even the tailgate of your truck. Have paper towels and a garbage bag handy. This will make the whole cleanup process much easier if you work to contain it ahead of time.Get your area ready before you start plucking the geese so that you know where everything is and are prepared for your work once you start plucking.
In order to minimize the potential mess, it’s probably a good idea to complete the goose plucking process in an easily cleanable outdoor space like a garage or a shed.;
, You’ll need some tools to finish plucking a goose. Gather all of the supplies ahead of time so you don’t have to search for something while you are in the middle of plucking.You’ll need branch cutters, a sharp knife, a lighter, a couple trash bags, and a roll or two of paper towels.

, You can hunt for the geese yourself or try to purchase some from a hunter in your area. Some local farmers may also have geese available for purchase.But before you start the plucking process, make sure the geese are dead.

, This is the longest part of the process. When you pick the feathers off, don't grab a handful of feathers and just yank them out because you might rip the skin on the goose. To pick the feathers off, grip them like you would a piece of paper that you are about to rip. Then pull the feathers toward the bottom of the goose.Pick the feathers all the way around the goose, up to the neck, and down past the legs.
Make sure you pluck all the feathers before you gut the bird.

, Take a knife and gently scrape the skin of the goose to remove the rest of the down feathers. These tiny down feathers are hard to remove, especially with your bare hands. They are too small to grip properly – and it would be too time consuming to try this method.Imagine that you are scraping the paint flakes off of an old piece of wood before sanding it.
After you’ve removed what you can with a knife, get the rest of the down feathers off by singing them with fire. You can use a long lighter or light some rolled up newspaper on fire to burn off the remaining feathers.

, You can either get a set of strong branch cutters and chomp the wings off, or you can use a knife. To use a knife to take the wings off, first cut from the top of the wing downward to the bone. Flip the knife over so its blunt side is facing the cut you made. Then smash the bone with the blunt side of the knife till the bones are broken completely. Then flip the knife so the sharp side is toward the cut and then cut through the rest of the wing.If you use the branch cutters, simply position them at the base of the wings (where they intersect with the body) and squeeze the handles until the bones break and the wings separate from the body.

, This part may be a bit bloody, and you’ll need to use the branch cutters again. First cut the neck off at the top of the breast then cut the feet off. Then cut the bottom off. Start just below the legs and cut all the way across to underneath the other leg – right through the bones and guts.If you don't have or don't want to use some branch cutters, use the knife the same way you used it on the wings cut to the bone flip the knife smash the bone in pieces, then cut through the rest of the way.
On the feet you can skip cutting first, just snap the leg then cut through.

, Reach in the hole at the bottom of the goose pull out all of the innards. You’ll need to make sure you get all of it – heart, gizzard, wind pipe, liver, stomach, and the rest of the lot until the goose is completely hollow.This part can be very messy, so you may want to consider wearing gloves to keep your hands clean and sanitary.

, Run some cold water through the middle and wash all of the blood off. While you're there, get some of the feathers that you may have missed. Make sure you rinse off any remaining blood or debris.You don’t want to leave any remnants of the innards because it can make the carcass smell much worse than it needs to.

, If you have more than one goose to pluck, do similar steps at the same time. First, pluck the feathers from all of the carcasses, then remove all the wings, then clean the body and remove the innards from all of the geese at one time.


This will make your work easier as you can complete all stages at the same time.

Choose plump, unblemished quail.,
Use the quail within two or three days.,
Marinate or brine the quail, if desired.,
Bring the quail to room temperature before cooking it.",How to Cook Quail1," When purchasing quail from the store, choose birds that appear relatively plump since they'll have a better ratio of meat to bone. Make sure that the skin appears unblemished, too.Additionally, the quail skin should look creamy or yellow with a slight pink tint.
Do not purchase quail that looks dry or smells peculiar.
Note that quails can be purchased bone-in, semi-boneless, or fully boneless. Any of these options can be used.

, Store fresh quail in the refrigerator and use it within two or three days.


Cover a tray or baking sheet with greaseproof wax paper or parchment paper, then put the quail on top. Keep it on the bottom shelf of the refrigerator so that no juices can drip off and contaminate other foods.

, You don't need to marinate or brine the quail, but since the meat is lean and fairly dry, doing so can reduce the risk of drying the meat out during the cooking process.


For a simple marinade:Combine the olive oil, garlic, thyme, sage, and parsley in a large glass bowl.
Add the quail to the bowl and toss to coat thoroughly.
Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate the quail for two hours.


For a simple brine:Combine the wine/water, salt, and bay leaves in a small saucepan. Bring the mixture to a boil on the stove over medium-high heat.
Allow the brine to cool.
Place the quail in a large bowl and cover with the brine. Cover with plastic wrap, then refrigerate for two hours.



, Remove the quail from the refrigerator roughly 30 minutes to one hour before you plan on cooking it. Keep it on the counter, away from cooked foods or foods that will be eaten raw.


Keep the quail on its tray or in its bowl as it drops to room temperature. Clean the counter both before and after setting the quail on top to minimize the risk of contamination.
During this time, you should also drain any brine or marinade, then pat the outside and inner cavity using clean, undecorated paper towels or parchment paper. The surface should appear moist but not soaking wet.

Enjoy.",How to Cook Quail2,"


Alternatively, line the pan with aluminum foil or parchment paper for an easier clean-up.;
, Pull the legs together over the back of the quail, then tie them in place using clean kitchen twine.


By tying the legs together, you can help the quail remain steady as it cooks. If you do not tie the legs together, you may need to use celery sticks or skewers to help stabilize them after placing the birds in your baking pan.

, Coat the surface of the quail with melted butter or olive oil, then rub the salt and pepper over all sides of each quail.


Use a pastry brush to evenly coat the birds with the butter or oil. Also note that the quail will brown best if you use melted butter.
While not necessary, you can also stuff the inner cavity of the quail when you choose to roast it. Fruit-based stuffing tends to work best, especially when it makes use of plum or prune flavors.

, Place the quails breast-side down in your prepared pan and transfer them to your preheated oven. Cook for 15 to 20 minutes, or until the meat feels slightly firm and the juices run clear.


If you choose to stuff the quail, you will need to increase the overall cooking time by 10 to 15 minutes.

, Remove the quail from the oven and allow it to rest for 5 to 10 minutes. Serve while still hot.


Consider placing a loose aluminum foil tent over the birds as they rest. Doing so traps more heat inside and may allow the juices to distribute more evenly.
If desired, you can serve the quail with lemon juice, wild game sauce, or other similar condiments.

Cook 10 to 12 more minutes over indirect heat.,
Enjoy.",How to Cook Quail3," Preheat a gas or charcoal grill, preparing separate areas for direct and indirect heat.


If using a gas grill, turn on two sets of burners (the front and rear or the left and right) to medium-high heat. Leave the middle burner off.
If using a charcoal grill, position piles of hot coals on each side of the grill but leave the middle section clear.

, Remove any ties and cut out the backbone of each quail using sharp kitchen scissors. Use your hand to push down along the length of body until it lies flat.


Keep the quail flat as it cooks by inserting two skewers along the width of the body. Both skewers should go through both legs.

, Coat the quails with olive oil or melted butter, then rub the surface of each with salt and black pepper.


When grilling the quail, the skin should brown easily regardless of whether you use butter or oil. Either way, however, you should distribute the fat evenly over all sides of the bird using a basting brush or spoon.

, Place each quail breast-side down on the hot side of the grill. Cook the quails for 3 to 4 minutes, or until the first side is thoroughly browned.


Avoid turning, flipping, or otherwise moving the birds as they brown. You'll need to keep them relatively still to adequately sear in the juices.

, Flip the quails to the back-side and cook for an additional 3 to 4 minutes, allowing this other side to brown, too.


Note that the quail should still be positioned over the hot side of the grill during this step.

, Once both sides are browned, move the birds to the middle or indirectly heated section of the grill. Continue cooking them for 10 to 12 minutes, or until the meat feels slightly firm and the juices run clear.


Keeping the grill lid closed during this time will hold in more heat.
You should be able to rotate and flip the quails over as they cook during this step without disrupting the cooking process.

, Remove the cooked quails from the grill and let them rest for 5 to 10 minutes before serving.


Transfer the birds to a serving dish and place a loose tent of aluminum foil over them. The foil should help the quails retain more heat as the juices settle and distribute themselves.
Quail can be served with wild game sauce or lemon juice, if desired.

Enjoy.",How to Cook Quail4," Place a medium to large skillet on the stove. Add the butter, then turn the heat to high.


Preheat the skillet until the butter melts. Turn the skillet periodically to evenly distribute the melted butter over the inner surface.
You can use olive oil instead of butter for a healthier option. Heat the oil for at least 30 to 60 seconds before continuing. The oil should be hot, but it should not be hot enough to produce smoke.

, Use kitchen scissors to cut out the backbone of each quail. Push down on the back of the bird, working along the length of the body, until it lies flat.


Insert two skewers along the width of each quail to help it remain flat during the cooking process. Each skewer should go through both legs of the quail.

, Evenly rub both sides of the birds with salt and pepper.


Note that you do not need to brush the quails with butter or oil when using this method. There should already be plenty of fat in the skillet.

, Place both quails, breast-side down, in the hot skillet. Cook them for 4 to 5 minutes or until the breast-side browns.Do not rotate, flip, or otherwise move the quails during this step. They should remain relatively undisturbed so that this side browns well.

, Use tongs to flip the quails over to their back-sides. Continue cooking for another 4 to 5 minutes or until the birds feel firm and tender. The juices should also run clear.


After flipping them, spoon some of the hot butter or oil over the newly exposed sides of each quail.
Do not turn or rotate the birds as they finish cooking. You can, however, spoon additional butter over them to minimize the risk of drying out the meat.

, Transfer the quails to a serving plate, then pour the pan drippings on top. Allow the meat to rest for 5 to 10 minutes before serving.


Form a loose tent with aluminum foil and place it over the resting quails. Doing so should allow them to retain more heat, so the juices can be redistributed without the meat cooling down too much.
Serve the quails with their pan drippings, or prepare a separate wild game sauce. Quails also taste great with lemon juice.

You can make this recipe with a pre-roasted chicken. Just read the ingredients and make sure the chicken doesn't contain additives.
You can make this recipe with a fresh, uncooked chicken; just be sure to remove the meat first, and save it for later.;
, Place it in a large dutch oven or stockpot. Fill the pot to within 2 inches (5.1 cm) of the brim with water, so that the water covers the chicken carcass entirely. Place the stockpot on the stove and turn the burner to high. Bring the water to a boil.

, Turn the burner down to medium or so, so the liquid comes to a consistent simmer. Add the celery, carrots, onions, parsley and bay leaves.

, Keeping the liquid at a low simmer, cook the stock for 4 hours, uncovered. Monitor the pot to make sure it doesn't overflow, and skim off the foam every once in a while., Once the liquid has reduced by at least a third and turned a golden color, remove the stock from heat.

, Place a large strainer over a bowl and pour the stock through the strainer to remove the bones and vegetables.

, Cover the bowl of stock and put it in the refrigerator for an hour or two. As it cools, the fat will rise to the top. Use a spoon to skim it off the top before using the stock or storing it.

Allow the meat to rest.",How to Cook Pheasant," In a large saucepot, bring eight cups (1.92 liters) of water to a boil. Add in a half-cup of kosher or sea salt, two tablespoons of sugar, and a few bay leaves.Once the solution comes to a boil, remove it from the heat, cover the pot, and allow it to cool to room temperature.
This much brine will be enough to soak two small pheasants, or one large one.
The pheasant will be soaked in this brine solution, which will make the meat juicier. At the same time, the salt will help dry out the skin, and this will make for a crispier and more delicious skin.;
, When the solution cools sufficiently, place the pheasant in the water. Cover the pot again and let the bird soak in the refrigerator for between four and eight hours.


Since pheasant doesn’t have as much fat as other meat, it can dry out quickly during the cooking process. Soaking it in liquid before cooking can add more moisture to the meat, and this will make for a more tender bird.
For younger birds, soak the meat for about four hours. While soaking will make the meat juicier, it will also add extra saltiness, so don’t soak it for longer than necessary. Since younger birds are more tender, they don’t need to soak for as long as older birds.

, When you are ready to cook the bird, take it out of the brine. Place it on a wire rack and allow the excess moisture to drain off.

, While you do want to roast your pheasant at a lower temperature, you want to start off with a hot oven to help sear and crisp the outside. Preheat your oven to 500 F (260 C).

, Like with a turkey, you can choose to stuff the cavity of the pheasant or leave it empty. However, stuffing will give it more flavor, and help keep the bird moist.


Popular stuffing items for pheasant include chopped onions and chopped apples. Use an entire apple, an entire onion, or half of each.
You can also use a chopped bell pepper and carrot as stuffing, or about one cup of other vegetables.
Don’t stuff the bird to the point that it’s bursting.

, Place the bird in a roasting pan with the breast facing up. Use about two tablespoons of butter or oil to coat the skin of the bird. This will make the skin nice and crispy.For added flavor, cover the oil in a light dusting of herbs and spices, such as rosemary, pepper, thyme, or sage. Don’t use more than a teaspoon (5 g) of seasoning, as too much can ruin the delicate wild flavor of the bird., This will give the outside time to get crispy without letting the meat inside dry out. The layer of oil will protect the skin from burning.After 15 minutes, reduce the temperature to 350 F (177 C) and continue cooking for 30 to 45 minutes.
If you have a meat thermometer, you want the bird to reach an internal temperature of between 155 and 165 F (68 and 74 C)., When the pheasant comes out of the oven, leave it for five to 10 minutes before cutting and serving it. This helps to seal the juices inside the meat, and will prevent it from drying out., To grill pheasant, you want to take a brined pheasant and cut it into eighths, so that you have two wings, two breasts, two thighs, and two legs. Along with the brined pheasant, you will also need a boning knife. Lay the pheasant breast up on a flat surface before you start cutting.Remove the legs and thighs from the bird: where the legs meet the body, use the knife to slice away at the meat. Use your hand to pull the leg and thigh away from the body. Then, lay the bird on its side, and use your knife to cut through the leg joint and remove the leg and thigh.
Separate the legs from the thighs: lay the pieces flat and cut through the joint that connects each leg to each thigh.
Remove the breasts and wings: with the bird sitting breast up, cut down the center bone to separate each breast from the rib cage. Follow the contour of the breasts around the wish bone to the wing bones. Loosen the meat from the body and filet the breasts off the ribcage.
Separate the breasts and wings: lay the breasts skin side down and cut through the joint that connects each breast with each wing.

, Whether you're using a charcoal grill or barbecue, preheat it to 275 F (135 C). To season the meat, you can:Cover each piece with two teaspoons (12 ml) maple syrup or barbecue sauce (optional).
Sprinkle each piece with salt and pepper, to taste. You can do this right onto the meat or on top of the sauce or syrup.

, Place the meat skin-side up on the grill to sear it, then flip it over so it’s skin side down. Let the meat cook for four to five minutes before flipping it again. Cook for another five minutes.For added flavor, add a dollop of apple sauce to each piece of meat for the final two minutes of cooking., Before serving your grilled pheasant, allow it to rest for a few minutes to seal in the juices and cool.

",How to Smoke Sausage,"


To achieve a lighter flavor, use fruit wood and smoke for 3.5 to 4 hours.
For a stronger flavor, use mesquite or hickory and smoke for 3 hours.;
, A modern smokehouse is typically a small structure you can place in your kitchen, pantry, or yard and in which sausages or other types of meat are placed for the duration of the smoking process. Smokehouses are available online or at specialty kitchenware or sporting goods stores (in the hunting or camping supplies area).

,, Make sure there's about 1 inch (2.5 cm) between the sausages to allow the smoke to touch all surfaces. This will result in an even distribution of taste and color.


The kind of sausage you smoke is a matter of personal taste. The most popular types of sausage to smoke are summer sausage, breakfast sausage, fatties and patties.
If you're using homemade sausage, always use a cure to prevent botulism, a harmful bacteria, from developing in the sausages. Mix 2 teaspoons of cure in with every 10 lbs. of meat. You can find cure in the spice section of most grocery stores, at specialized butcher's stores, or online.
When using store-bought sausage, remember to ask for certified meat, as it has already been cured and is safe to smoke.

, A higher temperature will cause the fat inside the sausage to melt and drip out, making the sausage dry and less tasty.

,,,, Rapid cooling will prevent the smoked sausage from shriveling and shrinking.


For one sausage or a small batch, simply place them in a bowl of cold water.
For a large batch of sausages, run cold water over them in the sink.

,, If you plan to keep it any longer, vacuum pack and freeze the smoked sausage. This will keep it good for up to 9 months.

Make a giblet gravy with the giblets and neck bones.",How to Debone Poultry (Turkey or Chicken)," Deboning a bird certainly isn’t a pretty process, and it’s not exactly clean either. Wear a shirt that you don't mind getting messy. It should be clean, since you're handling food. Make sure it has short sleeves or sleeves that can be rolled up and stay out of the way.


Tie up your hair, too. Unless you’re eating this entire bird by yourself, don’t risk your own hair being part of the stuffing.;
, This will be messy, and the de-boned bird will take up a large area (especially if it’s a 20-lb turkey). Make sure you have room to maneuver it and yourself. You can use a large trash bag to cover your countertop, with a cutting board on top.


Don't forgo the cutting board part. You'll want something under the bird to hoist and turn it around easily.

, In the kitchen sink, remove the plastic wrapper the bird comes in. Remove any fasteners holding the legs together, too. Then, reach inside the body cavity and remove anything that is in there. Many poultry processors put the giblets into a paper package inside the body cavity.


Get rid of anything that isn’t the bird, strings included. You'll want to use fresh ones when you tie it back up.

, You can tell the breast from the back because the breast has a ""valley"" running down it, separating the right and left breast halves. On the back, you can feel the backbone. When the bird is breast up, the legs (drumsticks) point upward slightly. When the bird is breast side down, it will look a little bit like it's kneeling on the cutting board.


You’ll probably be able to tell which is the front and which is the back just from the position of the wings and legs, too. But in case you can’t, the valley is the best thing to look for.

, You may cut the skin in several places, then flip the knife edge up and cut through the skin from underneath. You may also find it easier to cut just to the left or the right of the spine. Through the rest of the deboning process, be careful to not cut through the skin.


A clean, sharp knife is best. A dull knife will result in ragged cuts and be a lot harder to maneuver. That being said, be careful. You may find that you get stuck in an area and end up lurching for more force, putting yourself in danger. Be careful and take your time.

, Grasp the skin with one hand, and (carefully!) cut the meat away from the bone. Start by grasping the skin next to the spine cut furthest away from you. Cut as close to the bone as you can.


You will have to feel around to figure out where the bones are, and toward the beginning, you will encounter the wishbone. Simply work around this as best you can. If you wish, you can bend the bone until it breaks away from the rib cage, and cut it away. You might find this easier.

, Slowly move down from the back, around the side, toward the breast. It's okay if you cut off bits of bone, cartilage or tendon along with the meat; you can easily fix that later. You want to remove as much meat as possible off the bones. Work slowly at first, and make small cuts until you get the hang of it.


Take care to not accidentally cut through the skin from the inside. Keep separating the meat from the rib cage until you reach the leg and wing joints. With small cuts, clear the area around each joint so that you can see as much of the joint as you can.

, Put down the knife and grasp the wing in one hand and the area on the body around the wing joint with the other. Bend the wing back and twist it a bit until the joint pops. You need to do this to be able to cut through it and get the bones out.


Once the wing joint pops, you'll notice the wing go limp (as it's now unconnected from the body).

, With the tip of the knife, reach in and find the gap between the wing bone and the socket. You just created this gap when you popped the joint. If you can't find it, keep looking, and wiggle the wing around until you see it – it'll be white. Cut through the wing joint and any tendons, taking care not to cut through the skin.


If you do cut through skin, don’t worry. The bird can be tied up, and the meat will still be delicious – it just might not be as pretty. We’ll cover what to do if this happens towards the end of the guide (meaning you can worry about it later).

, Grasp the leg in one hand, and the area on the body around the leg joint with the other. Bend the leg back and twist it a bit until the joint pops. This is just like you did with the wing joint. Getting the hang of it?


Again, if you don’t do this, the entire half of the skeleton is still connected, rendering it very hard – if not impossible – to debone. You’re essentially separating the bones from each other so they come free much more easily.

, With the tip of the knife, reach in and find the gap between the leg bone and the socket. You just created this gap when you popped the joint. If you can't find it, keep looking, and wiggle the leg around until you see it. Cut through the leg joint and any tendons, taking care not to cut through the skin.


You'll see a white ball of hard material when you see the joint – it's pretty hard to miss.

, Continue cutting meat off the bones, and stop short of the keel (the cartilage breastbone). This is where the bone comes closest to the skin, so stop here for now.


We’ll come back to this in a bit. There’s more bird to debone in the meantime. It'll be easier once you get rid of everything.

, Rotate the bird around, and do the other side. You can either rotate the bird around or rotate the cutting board with the bird on it. Start at the spine, and follow the steps above, removing the meat from the bones on the other side of the bird.


Pop and cut through the wing and leg joints just as before, wiggling it around until you see the white joint and connective tendons.

, Lifting up the rib cage with one hand, carefully cut the meat away from the keel. Be very careful at this point not to cut through the skin. This is where the skin is very close to the keel bone.Separate the last point of attached bone from the meat, and lift it away.


But don’t throw it away! You should use it to make stock. Grandma would be proud.

, You should now have a very large flattish piece of meat resting in front of you. Run your hand along the surface of the meat, and feel for small pieces of bone, cartilage, etc. that you may have cut away along with the meat.


This is totally normal, and even happens to seasoned cooks. Cut these off and dispose of them.

, You can also debone the legs, if you like, but you don't have to. Some people prefer to leave the legs with the bones in for presentation. To remove the thigh bone, carve the meat away from the top of the thigh bone, and around the bone. Pop the joint between the the leg bones, cut through the cartilage, and remove the thigh bone.


Again, this is very similar to what you did for the wings. The only difference will be the structure of the bone and how you’re able to grasp it.

, You can do one of two things: sew up the bird and then stuff it, or pile the stuffing on it and then sew it up. Either way, fold the two edges of the bird back to the middle using heavy kitchen string to sew it up. You can make a needle out of a large paper clip, and use pliers to push and pull it through. Be sure to sew through both skin and some meat, because the skin will tear if you sew through that alone.


You will be ""sewing"" up the bird where you made the first cut through the skin along the spine. Begin at the neck (wing) end and draw the string through both skin and meat on both sides and tie a knot to hold the two sides together. Then ""sew"" down the cut, pulling the two sides together.
If you already piled the stuffing on top, continue sewing the bird shut. If you will be stuffing the bird now, stop before you get to the cavity, leaving the string and needle to one side. Stuff the bird (you may find it easier if you place it in the kitchen sink, but wash the sink first), sew the cavity shut, and tie off the string., After the bird is sewn up, flip it over so that it is breast side up. Because it has been deboned, the bird will look somewhat relaxed, and the legs will sag to the sides in a yoga-esque pose. You can use more kitchen string to tie up the legs into position.


Even if you left the leg bones in, you may still want to put a tie around the legs. They lack the support from the entire skeletal structure and may still sag a little if not tied.

, If you roll the bird over and find that you DID punch through the breast skin, don't worry. Simply take out your needle and kitchen string and sew it up as best you can. It will still roast up deliciously!


You can also tie the wings and legs together cross-ways to hold the bird together in the pan. There's no real wrong way to do it (as long as the ties are sturdily on, of course).

, Deboning the bird will removes the rib cage, obviously. But as a practical matter, this means two things: (1) the bones, which hold the cold after the bird is removed from the refrigerator, are gone, which means that the bird roasts faster, and (2) the deboning process itself brings the meat up to room temperature, and if done the day you intend to cook the bird, also means that the bird roasts faster. Plan this into your cooking schedule.


Julia Child claimed that a deboned 15-pound turkey was done in less than two hours, although you should plan to be flexible, as it could take longer than that., A deboned bird can take a LOT more stuffing than a bird with the bones in. Not only is there more room because the entire rib cage is removed, but the meat and skin can stretch as well. A deboned bird can take 2-3 times more stuffing For instance, a 20-pound turkey will use about 2 loaves of stuffing bread. Talk about a feast!


Want a few more ideas? wikiHow has some tasty articles on turkey stuffing, bread stuffing, and even chestnut stuffing.

, You didn't throw away the giblets and neck bones, right? Those can be made to add some serious flavor to your gravy. What's more, it eliminates waste, which is a total holiday win.


And it's cheap, too. All you literally need is flour, water, and the giblets. This just might be the tastiest, simplest gravy you've ever made.

Decide how many people you will be feeding.,
Look for duck meat that has a high quality grading, such as USDA Grade A.,
Select your preferred cut of duck meat.",How to Cook a Duck1," A standard adult serving is 1/3 lb of duck (.15 kg).

, This grade of duck meat will be a 6-8-week-old duckling raised indoors and fed with fortified corn and soybeans.

, A whole duck with skin on is the most popular and commonly found selection. However, you can have the meat divided, de-boned and the duck skin and fat layer removed by a butcher.

"
"
Place the duck on a cutting board.,
Rinse the inside and outside of the duck with cold water.,
Pierce the skin and thick fat layer of the duck.,
Put the prepared duck, breast side up, on a rack inside a roasting pan.,
Pour 2-to-3 cups of boiling water over the duck.,

",How to Cook a Duck2," Cut off the tips of the wings. Remove any excess fat from the neck and inside the body cavity.;
, Pat it dry with a paper towel.

, Use a knife or skewer, and make piercings at one-inch (2.5 cm) intervals. Be sure to pierce all the way through the fat layer just below the skin, but not into the meat. You will feel resistance when you get to the meat layer. You can skip this step if you purchased duck meat with the skin and fat layer removed.

, The duck will not cook properly if it is not on a rack where the fat layer can drain off the meat.

, Allow the water to collect in the bottom of the pan. The boiling water will begin to melt the fat layer and help the skin to crisp while cooking.

,, Do not cover the duck.

,,


Insert a cooking thermometer into the thickest portion of the duck meat, either the breast or thigh. Be sure the thermometer is not touching any bones. A fully cooked duck should have an internal temperature of 165 degrees Fahrenheit (74 degrees Celsius).
Check to see if the duck skin is crispy and the fat layer has fully melted and drained from the duck. If so, your duck has finished cooking. If not, switch your oven to broil and return the roasting pan and duck to the oven. Broil for about 10 minutes.

, Allow it to rest for 15 minutes before carving.

Remove the breasts from the pan.",How to Cook a Duck3," Rise them in cool water and pat dry with a paper towel. Use a knife to score the skin in a cross-hatch pattern on both sides.


The cross-hatching will help the skin get crispy. Avoid cutting into the meat.

, Set them on a plate and allow them to come to room temperature.

, Use the blunt side of a knife to scrape off the moisture that has emerged from the salted breasts. Excess moisture will prevent the skin from getting crispy.

, Lay the duck breasts in the pan with the skin sides down. Cook for 3 to 5 minutes, depending on the size of the breasts.

, Cook for an additional 3-5 minutes.


After you flip the breasts, salt the now-exposed skin. This will help the skin get even crispier and more flavorful.

, Lean the breasts against each other so the edges can cook for about a minute on each side.

, Place them on a cutting board and allow them to rest for 5 minutes before slicing to serve.

Consider wrapping the boudin with foil.,
Cook the boudin for 20 to 25 minutes.,
Remove the links from the oven.,
Squeeze or bite into whole links.,
Cut the links for use as appetizers.,
Prepare the links for breakfast.,
Serve the links in sandwiches.",How to Serve Boudin," Place a few links inside a medium saucepan. Add enough water to the pot to completely submerge the boudin.Make sure that there's room for the links to move around inside the water. Do not crowd the boudin, since doing so could result in uneven heating.;
, If desired, add 1 tsp (5 ml) Cajun seasoning blend or 1/2 tsp (2.5 ml) salt and 1/2 tsp (2.5 ml) ground black pepper to the water.


The boudin is already flavorful, so these additional seasonings are not necessary. Only add these seasonings if you prefer a stronger flavor than usual.

, Place the saucepan on the stove over high heat. Let the boudin cook at a full boil for 5 minutes.


Leave the saucepan uncovered.

, Reduce the heat down to low and let the boudin simmer gently for an additional 10 to 15 minutes.


As before, leave the saucepan uncovered.
After the water cools, do not re-boil it. Doing so could cause the link casings to burst.
The boudin is ready when it floats and takes on a spongy texture.

, Remove the links from the hot water using tongs and set them on a platter.


Ideally, you should let the boudin rest 2 or 3 minutes before serving.

, Preheat a gas, electric, or charcoal grill for a medium range of heat.


For a charcoal grill, assemble a small pile of coals over the bottom of the grill. Light the coals, then wait for the flames to die down and a layer of ash to begin forming.
For a gas or electric grill, set the burners to medium and give the grill a few minutes to heat up adequately.

, If you prefer soft boudin links, wrap each link loosely in aluminum foil before placing it on the grill.


Without the foil, this method will cause the casing to become crisp. Either option is acceptable. The choice is purely a matter of preference.

, If you want to enhance the flavor with your favorite barbecue sauce, baste the links before you begin cooking them.


Brush the sauce over the links evenly and immediately before you place them on the grill.
You can use a basting sauce regardless of whether or not you've wrapped the links in foil.

, Place the links on the preheated grill and cook until heated through.Use tongs to turn the links every 2 minutes.
If you did not use the foil, you will be able to test for doneness simply by looking at the outer casing. When one side of the casing becomes crispy, that side is done.

, Use tongs to remove the heated links from the grill. Wait several minutes before serving.


Wait several minutes before removing the foil, as well.

, Fill the steamer pan with just enough water to cover the bottom.


Ideally, the amount of water should be 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) high or less.
Note that a rice cooker could also be used for this process.

, Arrange the boudin links in a single layer on the bottom of the steamer.


The links should not overlap or touch one another. If you crowd them too much, they will not heat evenly.

, Cover the steamer and set it on the stove over medium-high heat for 3 to 5 minutes.


If you have an electronic steamer instead of a stovetop steamer, you should use the ""Cook"" setting for this step.

, Remove the steamer from the heat. Keep the lid on and let the links sit in the steamer for another 10 to 15 minutes.


When using an electronic steamer, switch it from the ""Cook"" setting to the ""Warm"" setting during this step.
Do not remove the lid at any time during the heating process. Doing so will release the steam responsible for heating the boudin.

, Remove the fully heated boudin links from the steamer when ready to serve.


Also note that the boudin links can stay warm and fresh for several hours when kept in this manner.

, Wrap one boudin link in a layer of clean, wet paper towel.


You could also use microwave-safe plastic wrap instead of the wet paper towel, if desired.
This wrapping prevents the boudin from drying out in the microwave. It also prevents grease from splattering inside the microwave.
Do not use a dry paper towel. The dry towel could act as a potential fire hazard.

, Place the boudin in the microwave and cook it on high for 1 to 3 minutes.


If the boudin has been previously thawed, 1 minute should be enough.
If the boudin is fully or partially frozen, microwave it for 2 or 3 minutes.

, Check the boudin. If the link is not yet done, turn it over and heat for another 1 or 2 minutes.


When ready, the boudin will feel warm and spongy when squeezed.

, Repeat the same process for each boudin link. Once each one has been heated through, the boudin is ready to serve.

,


If using nonstick foil, the foil should be enough.
If using standard aluminum foil, you should also spray the foil and the bottom of each link with nonstick cooking spray.

, If you do not want the casings to become crispy, wrap each link individually in its own sheet of aluminum foil.


Note that this foil will also need to be coated in nonstick cooking spray.
Many consider the crispy casing to be one of the benefits of the baking method. If you prefer a crispier casing to a soft one, skip this step.

, Place the boudin on your baking sheet and place the baking sheet in your oven. Cook until the boudin links are heated through.


Keep the links in an even, single layer to promote even heating.
Use tongs to rotate the links every 5 minutes during the baking process.
When ready, the links should be heated all the way through. If you did not cover the links with individual sheets of foil, they should also have crispy casings on all sides.

, Carefully remove the baking sheet from the oven. Let the boudin rest for a few minutes before serving it.

, The most common way to serve boudin is whole and as quick, tasty snacks.


Many people describe boudin as a spicy pork and rice casserole stuffed into a casing. As such, it can be a very filling snack on its own.
Typically, the casing is so tough that you would simply split it open and squeeze the stuffing out, directly into your mouth. You could use either your fingers or teeth for this.
If the casing is thin enough, however, you may prefer to bite into the link little by little in the same way you would eat a sausage.

, Boudin links can also be served as appetizers or Hors d'oeuvres. When presenting the links in this manner, use a sharp knife to cut each link diagonally into 1-inch or 2-inch (2.5-cm or 5-cm) slices.


Slices of boudin can be served as a separate appetizer, but if you want to prepare something with more variety, you can place the slices on a larger platter with cubes of cheese and crackers.

, Boudin can be served at breakfast, just as other sausages are. Serve them alongside eggs and hashbrowns for a popular combination.


For a slightly different twist, break open the end of the casing and squeeze the filling out using your fingers. Spoon this filling in between the two halves of a sliced bagel, biscuit, or croissant. Add scrambled eggs and cheese, if desired, and enjoy as a zesty breakfast sandwich.

, If you want to enjoy boudin as part of the main course at lunch or dinner, you can serve it with sandwich bread or buns.


You can place a single link inside of a large hot dog bun and serve the boudin like a bratwurst. Garnishes may not be necessary since boudin is so flavorful on its own, but if you want to try something, consider barbecue sauce, hot sauce, onions, and banana peppers.
Alternatively, you could arrange pieces of boudin on sandwich bread. Cut the boudin links into 1-inch (2.5-cm) diagonal slices using a sharp knife. Arrange these slices on one piece of bread, then top with onions, coleslaw, hot sauce, or any other desired toppings. Place the second piece on top and enjoy.

, This is a typical amount for most turkey sausage recipes.

, This will include: 2 tbsp. (30 mL) chili powder, 1 clove of garlic (minced, either with garlic mincer or by hand), 2 tsp. (10 mL) cayenne pepper, 2 tsp. (10 mL) onion powder, 1 tsp. (5 mL) crushed red pepper, 1 tsp. (5 mL) dried oregano, 1 tsp. (5 mL) paprika, 1/2 tsp. (2.5 mL) sea salt, 1/4 tsp. (1.25 mL) marjoram, 1/4 tsp. (1.25 mL) thyme, 1/4 tsp. (1.25 mL) black pepper, and 1/8 tsp. (.625 mL) fennel seeds. To ensure an accurate and evenly combined seasoning mix, use a wire whisk until the seasoning colors look even throughout the bowl. The garlic clove will stick because of the moisture, so be sure to mix thoroughly.


An easy way to mince garlic without a garlic mincer is to place the clove under a butcher knife and slam a closed fist (side of pinky finger down) onto the knife. Be very cautious when using this method that the butcher knife does not slip from your grip or that you slam your hand onto a sharp edge.
Season to your desired taste. If you prefer your turkey sausage not as spicy, try less cayenne, paprika, and crushed red peppers. Also, experiment with other flavors such as minced onion, cumin, nutmeg, ginger, basil, and sage to create your perfect seasoning combination.

, Sprinkle the seasoning mix over the ground turkey sections.

, Be sure to meticulously combine the seasonings within the ground turkey. Add the egg to create a goopy texture. The egg will add volume when you are cooking the meat.


Your hands will be covered with this mixture, so don't be shy about digging in. Kneading the ingredients completely throughout the turkey will ensure the best taste all around and avoid someone getting suckered into a big bite of intense seasoning.

, Refrigerate approximately 24 hours.

, Flatten each to create turkey sausage patties.

, Add plenty of butter and allow it to melt before placing the meat on the pan. This will prevent the patties from sticking to the pan. Make sure the turkey sausage patties are fully cooked before serving (i.e. there is no longer pink meat on the inner, and especially outer, part of the patty). The minimum temperature in the middle of the patty should be at least 165 degrees Fahrenheit (74 degrees Celsius).

Remove the chicken from the oven and cool.",How to Reheat Fried Chicken1," Take your chicken out of the refrigerator and remove it from any container that it's in. Let the pieces sit evenly-spaced on a plate or platter until they come to room temperature — about half an hour.


Use this time efficiently by doing any other prep work you need to do. Preheating the oven is a must, but you can also prepare side dishes, set the table, and so on.;
, Set the chicken pieces on an oven-safe baking sheet. You may want to line the sheet with aluminum foil first for an easier clean-up. It shouldn't be necessary to grease the sheet but this won't hurt your final product.


Try to avoid prepping the chicken pieces for the oven before they're room temperature. Cold meat on the inside can interfere with the ""crisping"" process going on at the outside of the meat that's needed to make fried chicken so delicious.

, Place the pan with the chicken pieces in the oven on the center rack. Set a timer for 10 minutes.


Some online sources will recommend spritzing the pieces of chicken with a small amount of water to prevent them from drying out, while others omit this step.
Plan for at least 10 minutes of cooking time and as much as half an hour. As you'll see in the next step, cooking times can vary.

, The only difficult part of this reheating method is that different pieces of chicken can heat at different speeds. As a general rule, bigger, thicker pieces (like breasts and thighs) will heat more slowly than smaller pieces (like wings and drumsticks). Since you don't want your smaller pieces to dry out, check them every few minutes after about ten minutes have passed. If they are crispy on the outside and warm all the way through, they're done.


One online source lists legs and wings as taking about 15-20 minutes to reheat to perfection and breasts and thighs as taking about 20-25 minutes., When your chicken pieces have regained a somewhat crispy exterior and are warm all the way to the bone, they're ready to eat. Take them out of the oven and carefully move them to a wire rack to cool for about five to ten minutes before eating. Enjoy!

Let the chicken come to room temperature.,
Heat frying oil in a heavy pan.,
Fry the chicken pieces for several minutes.,
Remove and allow to drain.,
Serve and enjoy.",How to Reheat Fried Chicken2," Another great way to get fried chicken back to a delicious crispy, golden-brown consistency is to simply fry it again. As with the oven method above, you'll want to take your chicken out of the refrigerator and let it sit in a safe spot for about half an hour before you start to cook it. Do any required prep work (like setting the table, making side dishes, etc.) while you wait.


If you don't let the chicken warm back up, it can affect the frying process. Dropping cold chicken into hot oil will significantly reduce the temperature of the oil for a minute or two, preventing you from giving it a crispy exterior., When your chicken is nearly at room temperature, set a pan on the stove and turn the burner to high. Heavier pans like cast iron skillets and dutch ovens are best as they tend to retain heat well. Add plenty of frying oil to the pan and allow it to heat — you want at least enough that the bottoms of your chicken pieces will be submerged.


Don't use olive oil or another oil with a similarly low smoke point, as the smoke can give your chicken a bitter, burnt flavor. Instead, use a high-smoke point oil with a neutral flavor like canola, peanut, or vegetable oil.If you have a deep fryer, you may use it for this method, though this equipment is not required.

, Carefully add the chicken pieces to the hot oil (a set of tongs can help protect from splashes). Fry the pieces in the oil for about two to three minutes, turning regularly.


Feel free to adjust the precise cooking time as you wish. Longer cooking times will give you a drier, crispier skin, but cooking for too long will eventually dry out the meat itself.Don't be afraid to check your chicken's texture as it cooks.

, When its skin is dry and crispy, the chicken is done. Transfer the pieces one by one to a wire rack set over a pan and allow them to drain. This step is crucial — letting the oil drain out will help get the skin even crispier. It should take about three to five minutes for the chicken to drain completely., Carefully dispose of the excess oil (or reuse it) after allowing it to cool. Enjoy your chicken as soon as it is cool enough to eat.

Don't use the microwave.,
Avoid toaster ovens when possible.,
Don't sear the chicken in a skillet.,

",How to Reheat Fried Chicken3," Microwaves are a quick and convenient way of reheating many foods, but they're terrible for fried chicken. Microwaves do nothing to dry out the soggy skin of cold fried chicken as they cook it. This means that while your final product will be warm, it will generally have a soft, unappealing exterior that simply doesn't compare to the crisp skin of chicken that's been reheated properly.

, In a pinch, when you don't have any other options, you can try using a toaster oven to reheat fried chicken. However, these can often heat chicken unevenly, leaving you with a piece of meat that's hot on the outside and cold on the inside.In addition, many toaster ovens lack the heating power necessary to get that crucial, crispy texture on the outside of the meat.

, Cooking fried chicken in a skillet that isn't full of frying oil is a bad idea. It's more difficult to evenly heat the irregularly-shaped pieces of fried chicken this way, but even if you do, you risk drying out the meat as its fat leaches into the dry pan.

, A stack of paper towels can seem like a good place to cool reheated fried chicken since they can soak up some of the excess grease. However, doing this will also keep some of the pieces of chicken in direct contact with the hot, steamy mixture of the oil and liquid that's draining out of it. This moisture will rehydrate the delicious skin that you worked to get dry and crispy, undoing your hard work.

Add 1 cup (236 ml) of warm water and stir it until the water dissolves. You should also cut off any fat off of 8 bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs.Try to make your brine early in the day or the night before, so the chicken can soak for a long time.;
, Place the chicken thighs in the bowl and add enough cold water to the bowl to cover the chicken. Add one tray of ice cubes to make the water very cold. Stir the water around and put the bowl in the refrigerator. Chill the chicken for several hours or overnight.Using bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs will give the dish more flavor and keep it moister than boneless, skinless chicken.

, Turn the oven on to 400°F (200°C). Take the chicken out of the refrigerator and drain the brine. Blot the chicken with paper towels until it's completely dry.Removing the water will help the chicken crisp up in the oven.

, Get out a large roasting pan that's big enough to hold all of the pieces of chicken in a single layer. Place 2 tablespoons of unsalted butter into the pan and put the pan in the preheating oven. The butter will melt and the pan should become hot while you prepare the chicken.Heating the pan will also help the chicken develop a crispy crust.

, Pour 1/2 cup (62 g) of all-purpose flour into a large plastic freezer bag. Add the last tablespoon of salt and 1 teaspoon of coarsely ground black pepper. Shake the bag a little, so the salt and pepper mix. Put 2 of the chicken thighs in at a time and shake them until they're coated.If you put all of the chicken thighs in at once, they may not be evenly covered in the flour mixture.

, Remove the 2 chicken thighs from the bag and shake off any extra flour. Set them on a plate while you coat the rest of the thighs. Use hot pads to take the hot baking dish out of the oven. Lay the coated chicken thighs skin-side down in the roasting pan.If you don't shake the extra flour off of the chicken, the chicken will have a thick coating that doesn't become crunchy.

, Put the baking dish in the oven and cook the chicken for 40 minutes. You'll hear the chicken sizzle as it oven fries. It should become dark brown and crispy on the bottom.Avoid flipping the chicken as it cooks.
Depending on your oven, you may need to cook the chicken longer until it becomes golden brown.

, Carefully remove the hot pan from the oven and use a thin spatula to scoop up the thighs and flip them over. Return the pan to the oven and finish cooking the chicken for 20 more minutes. This will make the other side of the chicken crisp up.You could also use tongs to turn the chicken thighs, if they aren't clinging to the pan.

, Lay paper towels on a serving plate. Remove the baking dish from the oven and use tongs to carefully transfer the chicken thighs to the serving plate. Sprinkle the chicken with a little extra salt and ground pepper before serving.The paper towels will help to absorb any excess grease or oil.

Get out a baking dish or roasting pan that's large enough to hold all of the chicken in a single layer. Put the dish in the oven to heat up as the oven heats.Putting the chicken into a hot pan will create a crispy crust.

, Crack 1 egg into a shallow prep bowl. Pour in 1/3 cup (80 ml) of milk and whisk the egg and milk together until the egg is completely incorporated. Set this mixture aside., In another prep bowl, place 1 cup (125 g) of all-purpose flour and 4 tablespoons breadcrumbs. Measure the baking powder and seasonings into the bowl and combine them. You'll need to whisk in:1 teaspoon baking powder
1 tablespoon salt
2 teaspoons ground paprika
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon onion powder
1/2 teaspoon ground pepper

, Take 2 pounds (900 g) of boneless skinless chicken breast and use a sharp knife to cut each breast into three or four pieces. Place the chicken strips into the dry mixture and toss them until they're coated. Shake off any excess from the pieces.You'll need to coat them in batches, since all of the chicken won't fit in the bowl at the same time.

, Transfer the chicken to the bowl with the egg mixture and cover each strip in the egg mixture. You'll need to do this in batches, so you don't crowd the chicken., Put the coated chicken strips back into the bowl with the dry coating. Toss the chicken strips again, so they're completely covered with the dry mixture., Use hot pads to take the baking dish out of the oven. Put 1/4 cup (60 g) of butter into it. It should melt quickly in the hot pan. Once the butter melts, lay the coated chicken strips in the pan., Put the hot pan back into the preheated oven and bake the oven-fried chicken for 10 to 12 minutes. You should see the chicken crisp up and become golden brown.Using boneless, skinless chicken and cutting it into strips helps the chicken cook quickly.

, Remove the pan from the oven and use a thin spatula or tongs to carefully flip the chicken over. Return the pan to the oven and bake the chicken for another 5 to 10 minutes. This will help the other side become crispy. Remove the pan from the oven and serve the oven-fried chicken.If you want an even crispier crust, consider broiling the chicken for a few minutes until it's as crunchy as you like it.

1/2 teaspoon poultry seasoning
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
1/8 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper

, Measure out 1 cup (240 ml) of buttermilk and pour it over the drumsticks. Squeeze half of a lemon and strain it into the bowl with the chicken. Put the bowl in the refrigerator and chill the chicken for 6 to 8 hours.You can refrigerate the chicken overnight, if you'd like to prepare it the night before you want to serve it.

, When you're ready to oven fry your chicken, turn the oven on to 400 degrees F (200 C). Get out a baking sheet and set a wire rack on it. Spray the rack and baking sheet with cooking spray., Get out a shallow prep bowl and measure 2/3 cup (60 g) of panko bread crumbs and 1/2 cup (15 g) of crushed cornflakes into it. Stir in the remaining coating ingredients until they're combined. You'll need to add:2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese
1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt
1 teaspoon dried parsley flakes
1 1/2 teaspoons sweet paprika
1/2 teaspoon onion powder
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon chili powder

, Lift the drumsticks out of the buttermilk and lay each piece in the dry coating. Roll the drumsticks, so they're completely coated in the mixture.You may need to coat them in batches, if they don't all fit in the mixture at once.

, Set the coated drumsticks on the wire rack that's on the baking sheet. Take your cooking spray and spray each of the drumsticks with more cooking spray.This will make the drumsticks even crispier.

, Put the baking sheet in the oven and cook the drumsticks for 40 to 45 minutes. They should become crispy and turn golden brown. Remove the drumsticks from the oven and serve them immediately.You don't need to turn the drumsticks, since they're on the wire rack.

Stir the ingredients to combine them. Next, place all of the chicken pieces into the marinade, pressing them into the liquid to completely coat them.Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and place it in the refrigerator for 4-24 hours.
Wash any surfaces that touched raw chicken, including your hands.;
, If you try to fry cold chicken, your chicken pieces will cook unevenly. To reheat the chicken, place the bowl of chicken and marinade on your kitchen counter for thirty minutes.Don’t leave your chicken out for more than thirty minutes. If you do, the chicken may go bad.

, Place an extra-large re-sealable plastic bag on your counter. Combine 2 cups (240 grams) of all-purpose flour, 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) of baking powder, 1 tablespoon of garlic powder, and one tablespoon of onion powder in the re-sealable bag. Close the bag and shake it thoroughly to incorporate the ingredients. If desired, add additional seasoning. For example:


Add a teaspoon of paprika or cayenne for a spicy kick.For Cajun fried chicken, add 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper, 1/4 teaspoon ground white pepper, and 5 dashes of Louisiana hot sauce.Add 2 teaspoons crumbled dried oregano, 2 teaspoons crumbled dried sage, and 2 teaspoons crumbled dried thyme to add an herbal fragrance to the fried chicken.

, Use tongs or clean fingers to move a piece of chicken from the marinade into the re-sealable bag of flour. Seal the bag and shake it well to coat the chicken in flour. Open the bag and transfer the floury chicken to a plate. Repeat this step for each piece of chicken.


Coat one piece of chicken at a time to avoid incorporating any liquid into the flour.

, Once all of the pieces have gotten their first coat of flour, repeat the coating process. First, gently dip a floury piece of chicken in the marinade to moisten the surface. Next, place the piece of chicken back in the flour bag. Shake the bag to completely coat the chicken with a second layer of flour. Repeat this step for the rest of the chicken pieces.Place the freshly coated chicken pieces on a new plate. This will help you know which pieces you’ve already coated twice.
Coat one piece of chicken at a time. If you don’t, the flour bag will absorb too much moisture and will become a thick batter.

, You can either fry your chicken on the stove or use a deep-frying appliance. If you decide to use a pot, choose a deep pot with thick sides. If you use a deep fryer, follow the manufacturer instructions when frying chicken.


Cast iron pots such as Dutch Ovens are great for deep frying.Deep fryers can be purchased online or at cooking supply stores.

, Leave about 4 inches (10 centimeters) of space at the top to allow for splattering. Choose a frying oil that has a HIGH smoke point. (This recipe originally said LOW smoke point which is incorrect) These oils will fry your food at the right temperature without giving them a sour, burned flavor. HIGH smoke point oils include:


Peanut oil (avoid if you have nut allergies)
Sunflower oil
Safflower oil
Soybean oil
Vegetable shortening
Lard, If you’re using a fryer, follow the manufacturer instructions when heating the oil. If you’re using a pot, place the oil on your stove over medium-high heat. After a few minutes, test the temperature of the oil. For an exact measurement, use a candy thermometer to find the oil temperature. Follow the manufacturer instructions when using a thermometer.


If you don’t have a candy thermometer, place a wooden spoon into the hot oil. If the oil bubbles around the spoon, the oil is hot enough.
Alternatively, throw a pinch of flour into the oil. If the oil bubbles around the flour, the oil is hot enough. If it turns black within a few minutes, the oil is too hot. Reduce the heat slightly., Use tongs or a slotted metal spoon to place a few pieces of chicken in the hot oil. Each piece of chicken should be able to rest without touching any other pieces of chicken. If you add too much chicken, you will overcrowd the pan.


If you overcrowd the pan, the oil will cool quickly and the chicken won’t fry properly.
If you’re using a deep fryer, lift the metal basket, place the chicken inside, and lower it into the hot oil.

, Cook the chicken in the hot oil for 15-20 minutes, turning the pieces if necessary.If the batter turns dark brown after just a few minutes, your oil is too hot. Reduce the temperature. After about fifteen minutes of frying, look for signs that the chicken is ready. For example:


Properly fried chicken has a golden-brown crust.
Clear juices will leak out of the chicken, even when it’s frying in the oil. If the chicken isn’t done, pink juices will leak out of it.
Dark meat takes more time to cook than light meat. Keep an eye on any chicken breasts or wings., Use tongs to move a large piece of chicken from the oil to a plate. Next, use a meat thermometer to check the internal temperature of the chicken. To do so, stick the metal end of the thermometer into the thickest part of the biggest piece of chicken. The temperature should be at least 165 degrees Fahrenheit (74 degrees Celsius.)If you don’t have a meat thermometer, check the chicken by cutting into the largest part with a knife. If the meat appears raw, cook the chicken for a few more minutes.

, Some people like to place the chicken on a plate lined with a paper towel to soak up excess oil. However, this method will steam the surface of the chicken, creating soggy fried pieces. Instead, place the fried chicken on a wire rack set on a baking sheet. This will allow the chicken to become crispy and delicious.


Let the chicken cool for ten minutes before serving., In many Southern states, such as Texas, Louisiana, and Kentucky, fried chicken is eaten as a main dish with a variety of succulent side dishes. There are many different side dishes to choose from, but some common dishes include:


Fluffy, buttery mashed potatoes

Buttermilk biscuits
Savory collard greens

Crispy baked macaroni and cheese


, This combination may sound strange if you’ve never tried it before. However, this dish is very popular in many Southern states. The meaty crunch of fried chicken pairs deliciously with a plate of buttery, sweet waffles.


Some people like to cover their chicken and waffles in maple syrup, while others prefer to make a Dijon cream sauce from Dijon mustard, cream, and thyme.

, This method works best with boneless fried chicken. First, choose a bun. Many people prefer a toasted wheat sandwich roll, but you can use any kind of bread you like. Next, place your fried chicken on the bun and add any desired toppings.Popular toppings include:


Tangy cole slaw

Tomatoes, lettuce, and mustard
Guacamole, cheese, and corn salsa

",How to Fry Chicken Wings," Long considered an enemy of good health, chicken skin just got a retrial and experts agree that, now and again, chicken skin is a-okay to enjoy.


If you keep the chicken skin, it will give your wings a crispy, buttery outside.
Removing the skin will allow the meat to soak up more of your marinade.;
, You can soak it in a marinade, coat it with a batter or create a crust.

, Teriyaki, ginger-garlic, tandoori and honey-orange are great marinade choices.









Soak your chicken for two hours at least, so that the meat absorbs the flavors.

,









Options for batter recipes include milk and flour batter, egg batter, and buttermilk batter.
Roll the chicken in the batter.
Some recipes suggest soaking the chicken in the batter for two hours. This is a good suggestion for flavorful buttermilk batters.

,









You can create a crust with flour, bread crumbs or crushed crackers.
Roll the chicken in your crust mix.
For an extra crispy crust, coat the chicken with milk or beaten eggs before you roll it in your crust mix.

You can choose the spices that you like and eliminate the ones that you don't care for as much. Get creative and blend your own spice mix.;
, If you want to make your sausage from scratch, especially if you plan on doing it more than once, it's worth getting a meat grinder. It makes sure that the meat is ground up properly, and it also enables you to grind the sausage to the exact specifications dictated by your recipe. More importantly, it saves time.


Some standard mixers come with a meat grinder attachment, which works very well for making sausage.
Get a grinder with both coarse and fine settings since different recipes call for different meat textures.
If you would prefer not to grind your own meat, you can ask the butcher to grind it for you.

, This is another vital piece of equipment if you plan on making sausage more than once. Stuffing sausage into pork casings greatly improves the taste of your sausage because it allows the flavors to mix and marinate with each other. This doesn't happen as much when the meat isn’t in a casing. You can stuff sausages by hand if you’re an expert stuffer -- which you’re probably not. So, most likely, the results won't be as good.


Some meat grinders come with a sausage stuffing apparatus.
If you prefer not to buy a sausage stuffer, you can make loose sausage meat by forming it into patties instead.

, The most common casings are made from salted pork intestines. They are available at many butcher shops as well as online, and they are most commonly sold by the foot. Fifteen feet (4.6 m) of pork casings, for instance, is roughly equivalent to 1 pound.


If you prefer not to use the traditional casings made of pork, synthetic casings made from collagen are available as well.
You also can use blanched savoy cabbage leaves as casings if you want to avoid using pork.

, Before you get started, clear out your freezer to make room for the meat, fat, and all of the equipment you'll be using, including the bowls. It's very important to keep everything cold while you're making sausage. If the fat starts to get soft, it won't properly emulsify with the meat. That means when it comes time to cook the sausage, the fat will separate from the meat instead of cooking with it. In other words, the sausage will be ruined. Keeping everything cold prevents this from happening.


Freeze the meat and fat solid before you get to work. This way when you’re working, it will still remain cool even as it thaws.
Place the equipment in the freezer for a couple of hours before you start making sausage.
When you're ready to start, check to make sure everything is cold enough. The ingredients and equipment should be so cold that it's uncomfortable to work with them. If your meat and materials start to warm up during the sausage-making process, periodically put them back in the freezer to cool down. Then, take them out when they’re cool enough to work with again.

, Fill a large bowl with ice, and place a smaller bowl inside it. Then, place your meat in the smaller bowl. This is how you’ll keep your meat cool while you’re working. But as mentioned above, if the meat starts to get too warm, put it back in the freezer to cool again.

, Quickly cut the frozen meat and fat into small chunks about one inch (2.54 cm) across. Then, place the meat and fat back into the small iced bowl as you finish chopping it. Again, this is to make sure the meat remains cool during the process.

, Use a clean spoon to mix the meat and fat while it remains on the ice bath. Then, add the salt, pepper, herbs and spices. Work quickly so that the meat doesn't begin to warm up. When the ingredients are completely mixed, remove the bowl from the ice bath and cover it with plastic wrap. , Don't freeze the meat for more than an hour before you grind it. If you freeze it for too long, it will be difficult to grind. It should be slightly soft in the middle and frozen on the outside to grind correctly.


If you're making a recipe with wet ingredients like vinegar, sherry, or honey, mix the wet ingredients and place them in the refrigerator for later.
If you're using sausage casings, remove them from the freezer and place them in a bowl of water to soak and soften.

, Remove your grinder from the freezer, and set it up according to the manufacturer's instructions. Place a cold bowl under the grinder's spout to catch the ground meat. Take the meat out of the freezer and run it through the grinder using either a coarse or fine setting, depending on your preference.


Some recipes recommend using a specific grinding setting, but many leave it up to individual preference.
The coarse setting is similar to a rough chop. It grinds the meat into thick chunks, while the fine setting grinds up the meat finely.
If the meat seems to be getting warm during the grinding process, put it back in the freezer for a few minutes before continuing. Then, only continue when it’s cool enough.

, When you're finished grinding, cover the bowl and put the meat back in the freezer. Don’t let it freeze solid, but only on the outside. While you wait for the meat to freeze, clean up the grinder and put it away.

, Remove the bowl from the freezer and add the remaining wet ingredients, such as vinegar, sherry or honey. Use either a standard mixer, a spoon or your hands to mix the ingredients until the sausage meat becomes sticky and holds together.


If you aren't planning on stuffing the sausage into casings, your sausage is now ready to cook or store. You can form it into patties and freeze it for later, or go ahead and cook it in a skillet for five minutes on each side.If you're making sausage links, place the mixed sausage back in the freezer and prepare the sausage stuffer.

, Take the sausage stuffer out of the freezer, and set it up according to the manufacturer instructions. Run warm water through the sausage casings, and get them ready to stuff by draping one end over the rim of the bowl while the tail continues to soak in warm water. Prepare a cold platter on which to place the stuffed sausages. Lastly, remove the sausage meat from the freezer.


When you run water through the casings, check to see if there's a leak. If you find one, discard that casing.Try to keep the casings from getting twisted since you might accidentally rip one if you have to untangle them.

, Each casing is several feet long. The entire casing should be slipped onto the tube with a tail of 8 inches (20.3 cm) or so hanging off the end. When you stuff the sausage, the meat will fill the casing. In some cases you only need one casing for an entire batch of sausage.

, Place the meat into the sausage stuffer all it once. Crank down the stuffer so that the meat begins emerging from the stuffing tube and fills the casing. Use one hand to help the casing slowly slip off the tube as the sausage meat fills it, and use the other hand to guide the sausage into a coil shape.


It takes some practice to get the hang of how fast to crank the stuffer and fill the casing. So, go slowly at first since you don't want the casing to rip.
If you have sausage meat that won't fit in the stuffer, keep it in an ice cold bowl until you run out of sausage. Then, quickly fill the stuffer again.
If you run out of casing, remove it from the stuffer, tie off the end, and resume with a new casing. Keep stuffing casings until you run out of meat.

, You should now have one or more coils of sausage knotted at one end of the casing and open at the other. Form the links by measuring six inches from the knot, pinching the sausage with your thumb and forefinger, and using your hands to twist the two pieces toward yourself three times.


Measure another six inches down the coil, make a pinch, and this time twist away from yourself three times. Continue in this fashion down the coil until you've run out of room to make more links. Knot the end of the coil tightly against the meat.Make sure you twist one link toward yourself and the next link away from yourself. This makes sure the links don’t unravel.

, Use a wooden drying rack or another type of rack to hang the sausages up to dry. Drape them over the rack at every other twist so that the links hang down but don't touch. Let them dry for an hour and a half.

, Sterilize a needle by heating it over a flame, and use it to prick each sausage where you see an air bubble. This lets out any air that is trapped inside and flattens the casing against the meat.

, Place the sausages in a container in the refrigerator overnight so that the flavors continue to meld. After eight or so hours, the sausages are ready to eat. Cook them within one week, or freeze them for up to several months before eating.

, Once you get the pork belly home from the butcher, rinse it thoroughly to remove any blood or anything else on the meant. Pat the pork belly dry and then transfer it to a resealable two-gallon plastic bag.After you’ve cleaned and patted the pork belly dry, the surface will feel slightly tacky.You may also want to trim any thin edges off the pork belly if it has any. You want to place roughly a long rectangular piece into the plastic bag., To make the spice rub, mix the kosher salt, pink salt, brown sugar, honey, red pepper flakes, paprika, and cumin in a bowl.Mix until everything is spread evenly throughout the honey. This recipe is just one of a near endless variety you can use to create unique flavor profiles for your bacon. Other spice rub examples include:


2.5-3 pounds skinless pork belly, 1/4 cup kosher salt, 2 teaspoons pink curing salt, 1/2 cup sugar, 1 teaspoon maple syrup, 1 tablespoon Bourbon, 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, and hickory smoke during the smoking process (whether actual hickory wood in your smoker or hickory liquid smoke roasted in your oven).2 1/2 pounds skin-on pork belly, 2 1/2 tablespoons kosher salt, 1 1/2 tablespoons sugar, a tablespoon black peppercorns, 1 teaspoon fennel seed, 1 teaspoon caraway seed, 1 teaspoon dried rosemary, 1 teaspoon dried thyme, 2 bay leaves, 1 clove garlic, finely chopped.1 pound of pork belly, 1 1/2 teaspoons Morton's kosher salt, 1/2 teaspoon pink curing salt, 2 tablespoons hoisin sauce, 2 tablespoons honey, 1 tablespoon soy sauce, 1 tablespoon powdered ginger, 1 teaspoon powdered garlic, 1 teaspoon Sriracha or other hot sauce, 1/4 teaspoon 5 spice powder, and 2 tablespoons water., You’ll have enough of the spice rub to evenly coat the until piece of pork belly.Roll the mix around with the pork belly in the plastic bag until everything is coated.

, Seal the plastic bag and place it in the refrigerator. You’ll flip the bag once a day to keep the even coating, and the process will take approximately 7-10 days.The duration ultimately depends on the thickness of the pork belly. A thin belly (around 1.5 inches thick) will take seven days while a thicker belly (2-3 inches) will take the entire ten days.You can test how cured the pork belly is by touching it when you think it’s close to ready. The cured meat will be firm to the touch all over like a cooked steak. If it still feels spongy and soft, then it needs more time., Once the meat has cured, you can remove it from the bag and rinse it thoroughly. Discard any solids from the rub on the meat as well. Pat the meat dry once you have rinsed it well., After thoroughly rinsing the meat, you will need to refrigerate it again. Refrigerate it uncovered for a full forty-eight hours., This part requires you to have access to a smoker. Most people agree that a smoker yields the best results for bacon. However, if you cannot get access to a smoker, skip down to Part 3 for steps on how to use an oven instead.

, Applewood is one of the most common to use while smoking bacon because it’s light character isn’t too rich against the already rich cured pork.Follow any specific manufacturer’s instructions for using applewood in your smoker, and set the smoker to 200 °F (93.3 °C).Hickory and maple are also popular options when smoking cured pork belly.However, the light character of applewood works best for those just getting started with making homemade bacon.
If you’re also new to using a smoker, you can find more information at: How to Use a Charcoal Smoker and How to Use an Electric Smoker.

, Because of its light flavor, apple smoke takes several hours to permeate the meat.You should smoke the pork belly for around three hours.For thicker pieces (2-3 inches thick), you may need more time. Use a meat thermometer and ensure that the internal temperature of the pork belly reaches 150°F., Some people choose to remove the rind created by the curing process. However, it’s completely optional.From there, you can slice and prepare the bacon to suit your favorite recipes.

, Wrap any of the bacon that you don’t use immediately in plastic. You can refrigerate the bacon for up to a week, or you can also freeze it for up to two months if you plan on saving it., Though many believe using a smoker yields the best results, you can also use your oven at home as an alternative to a smoker. Start by setting your oven to 200°F.

, As the oven preheats, gently brush the entirety of both sides of the pork belly with liquid smoke., You want to place it with the fat side up on a rack over a roasting pan, and then roast the pork belly for 2-2.5 hours.You can find liquid smoke online or even some varieties at your local grocery store.
As with a smoker, check the pork belly with a meat thermometer to ensure that it reaches an internal temperature of 150°F., Some people choose to remove the rind created by the curing process.

, For the Makin' Bacon 9 slices cooks most evenly. When using a dish and bowl, carefully drape bacon around the bowl, like flower petals, keep touching and overlapping to a minimum or it will stick together.

, Spattering is not as bad as other methods because the hot fat drips down off the cooking meat.

, A rule of thumb is one minute for each piece of bacon you cook, 5 minutes for 5 pieces. Fattier bacon takes longer. Center cut bacon takes about 7 minutes for 9 pieces.

Use all natural ingredients.,
Substitute a leaner variety of meat.,
Add fruits and vegetables.,
Leave out unwanted additives.",How to Make Healthy Sausage1," Most store bought varieties of sausage are loaded with excess fat, nitrates, bread derivatives and other filler ingredients. When making sausage yourself, shop around for organic meats free of hormones or preservatives. Anything else you choose to include, such as fruits, veggies and grains, should also be checked for quality. This way, you’ll know exactly what you’re putting in your body.Look for a seal or label on the packaging that signifies that the meat you’re buying is certified organic.
Processed meats are responsible for a wide range of health problems, including heart disease and even cancer.;
, Pork and other red meats tend to be high in saturated fat. For your sausage, you might instead opt for chicken, lamb, venison or another low-calorie alternative. You’ll cut down drastically on the calorie count when it’s all said and done, and chances are you won’t even be able to detect a difference in flavor.Vegans and vegetarians can experiment with making homemade sausage using plant-based food items like tofu, tempeh, or quinoa., Don’t stop at just meat—feel free to bulk up your sausage with things like carrots, apples, celery, or even dried dates or figs. Mince the fruits and veggies up extra small so they won’t interfere with the texture or structural integrity of the sausage. These types of extras can make your sausage less one-dimensional by creating more depth to the flavor.Fresh and dried fruits will fill the role that processed sugar usually plays in packaged sausage.Incorporating fruits and vegetables is a good way to fortify your breakfast with additional vitamins, nutrients and dietary fiber.

, One of the biggest drawbacks of processed sausage is the excessive salt and carbohydrates used to enhance flavor and make it more filling. The fats in meat already contain a fair amount of sodium naturally, so go easy on the salt and let them speak for themselves. Cheeses are best avoided or used in moderation for the same reason.Use only a pinch of kosher or raw sea salt, then supplement with dried herbs that will play up the savory notes without contributing to the sodium level.Eating lots of fat and salt leads to bloating, which can make you feel sluggish. An all-natural sausage will provide you with beneficial protein and clean energy.

Start with lean ground meat.,
Add your spices of choice directly to the meat.,
Form the sausage into patties.,
Store or cook it right away.",How to Make Healthy Sausage2," The meat you use to make sausage should be cold so that it will hold its shape better. Pork sausage is most common, but you could also choose from chicken, turkey, bison or a combination of different meats. Place the meat in a large mixing bowl with your other ingredients close at hand.If you’re using frozen meat, be sure to defrost it ahead of time.Since you’ll be handling raw meat, you’ll want to wear gloves or wash your hands thoroughly before and after the process.Try a basic lean turkey sausage, or get more elaborate with flavor pairings like chicken and apple., To cut down on the amount of salt in the sausage, stick with pungent, flavorful spices like garlic, parsley, cloves and paprika. There’s no exact proportion of each spice that’s best—just season to taste. It will help to portion out your dry ingredients in advance so you’ll be able to dump them into the meat all at once.Make the flavor of your sausage pop by including more intense spices like mustard, sage or cayenne pepper.A traditional breakfast sausage seasoning can be made by blending salt, black pepper, sage, cloves, marjoram and a hint of brown sugar.For spicy Italian-style sausage, season with a dash of salt, black pepper, garlic powder, dried onion, parsley and dried red pepper flakes., Grab the meat with both hands and begin mixing it by folding it in on itself repeatedly. Once the spices have been evenly incorporated, separate the meat into golf-ball sized chunks, then smooth them flat into patties. You can also press the sausage into casings, if you have a grinder at home.Don’t pat the meat out too thick, or it will be difficult to cook it through without burning it.
Use a round cookie cutter to cut out patties of a uniform size., Now that you’ve made your sausage, you can either slap it on the griddle or stick it in the refrigerator until you’re ready to eat it. Fresh sausage should be consumed within a couple of days. If you don’t plan on using it right away, wrap it tightly in plastic wrap or a Ziploc gallon bag (vacuum-seal bags are ideal) and freeze.Another option is to cook all the sausage at once, then place it in the refrigerator and reheat as needed. Try to use up precooked sausage within 2-3 days.
When properly frozen, sausage will typically stay good for up to three months."
"
Grill or boil your sausage.,
Drain off the excess fat.,
Limit your portion size.",How to Make Healthy Sausage3," When it comes time to prepare your sausage, do it on a ribbed grill pan or in the oven on a separate meat rack. The temperature will heat the meat more consistently throughout, allowing more fat to escape. Frying the sausage in a skillet causes it to reabsorb much of the fat that cooks out of it.
Don’t use any extra butter or oil to cook your sausage. This just adds unnecessary fat.

, Rather than serving sausage patties that are swimming in their own juices, funnel all that unwanted fat into a separate receptacle and dispose of it. Blotting the cooked sausage with a layer of paper towels will help soak up grease, as well. Afterwards, you’ll be left with sausage that’s almost entirely lean meat.Always get rid of fats and oils by throwing them in the trash, not pouring them down the sink., Too much of anything can be unhealthy. Make sausage a part of the meal, not the meal itself. Along with homemade sausage, you might serve poached eggs, steel cut oats, fresh fruit or whole wheat toast. For entree sausages, select sides of sautéd vegetables, beans or salad.Fix a single serving of sausage at a time so you won’t be as tempted to overeat.Add a handful of crumbled sausage to other dishes, such as pastas, casseroles or frittatas, to boost your protein intake.

You can also make Italian sausage that is part beef and part pork. Replace 2 lbs. (0.9kg) of pork shoulder with ground beef to adjust the recipe.;
, Ask whether the casings should be soaked beforehand or not.


If the sausage casings require soaking, place them in a bowl of orange juice and salt for 1 hour. Keep them moistened before using them.

, Grind the pork (and beef) together using a meat grinder or a meat grinder attachment on your stand mixer.

, Add the beef, if you are doing a mixed meat sausage.

, You will need to decide if you want a sweet or hot Italian sausage.


If you want to make a traditional hot Italian sausage then add 2 tsp. (4g) of crushed fennel seed, 1 tbsp. (18g) salt, 1 tbsp. (6.9g) of black pepper, 2 tbsp. (10.8g) of hot pepper flakes and/or cayenne pepper, 1 tbsp. (1.9g) of parsley leaves and 2 to 3 tbsp. (13.8 to 20.7g) of paprika.
If you want to make a sweet Italian sausage, then do not add hot pepper flakes, cayenne pepper or the whole measure of black pepper. Add the full 3 tbsp. (20.7g) of paprika.

, Knead the spices into the meat until it is well combined.

, Refrigerate for at least 1 hour.

Heat a pan on the stove.,
Add a little oil.,
Lay the sausages on the hot surface.,
Cook until brown on both sides.,
Flatten or butterfly the sausages to reduce cooking time.,
If needed, finish off by steaming.",How to Cook Sausages1," Light a burner on the stove and set it to medium or medium-high heat. Set a sturdy pan or skillet over the heat. Let it sit for a minute or two to get hot.


When the pan is ever-so-lightly smoking or a drop of water immediately starts sizzling when it touches it, you're ready to cook.;
, Sausages are fairly fatty, so you don't need to add a lot of extra fat to the pan. However, this fat will be trapped inside the casing at first, meaning there is a window of several minutes where the sausages can stick to the pan and burn. A tablespoon of cooking oil (canola, etc.) spread around the pan can keep it slick until the fats inside the sausages make their way into the pan.









Use caution with olive oil. It has a lower smoke point than many cooking, which means that it will start to smoke at lower temperatures. This isn't dangerous, but it can set off your smoke alarm and may have a minor effect on the taste of the sausages., Carefully put the sausages in the pan one-by-one. Leave enough space so that none of the sausages are touching. This helps them cook evenly on all sides. If you're cooking many sausages, this may mean that you need to cook them in batches.








If the sausage casings are connected, cut them apart before putting them on the pan.

, Let the sausages cook without disturbing them at first. After about two minutes, flip them over. Continue turning the sausages every few minutes until they are brown on all sides. Depending on the size of the sausages, this should take between about 10 and 15 minutes.








When the sausages are well-browned, cut into one at its mid point. The meat should by firm and cooked all the way through. There should be no pink remaining and any juices should run clear. If not, continue cooking.A long set of tongs can help protect your hands from sputtering grease.

, Waiting for sausages to cook all the way through can be frustrating. Luckily, there are a few ways to cut down on the time you need to spend in front of the stove:


One way is to butterfly the sausages. Take a sharp knife and slit the sausage down one side from end to end. Open the sausage up (like a ""butterfly"") and lay the exposed filling face down on the pan. Cook this way until well-browned.
You can also flatten the sausages to spread them thinner so that they cook faster. To do this, press down on them with the bottom of a heavy pan or skillet before you start cooking them.

, Some sausages (especially large ones) take forever to cook all the way through. If you'd like to keep cooking your sausages but are worried about burning them, try using this technique. You'll need a lid that fits snugly over your pan.


Cook the sausages as normal until well-browned but still raw on the inside.
Pour a half cup of water into the hot pan. Cover the pan with a lid. The steam from the water will get trapped underneath and start heating the sausage from all sides.
Reduce heat to medium-low. Cook for five to ten minutes, then carefully remove the lid so as to avoid steam burns. Cook the sausage for another few minutes to restore some of the ""crispness"" to the casings.

Turn on the broiler and prepare your baking sheet.,
Finely chop the vegetables, bacon, and seasonings.,
Combine the bacon meatball mixture.,
Form the bacon meatballs.,
Broil the bacon meatballs.,
Consider frying the bacon meatballs.",How to Make Bacon Meatballs1," If you plan on baking the meatballs under the broiler, turn it on to high so that it preheats while you make the meatballs. You'll also need to line a rimmed baking sheet with foil. Ensure that the sheet can be used under the broiler.If you'd rather fry the meatballs, you'll need a large nonstick skillet and 2 tablespoons of oil.;
, Place all of the flavorful vegetables, seasonings, and bacon into a food processor. Blitz the ingredients until they're finely chopped. You'll want to pulse the ingredients about 10 to 15 times. You'll need these ingredients:1 small onion, very coarsely chopped
3 slices of bacon, very coarsely chopped
2 cloves of garlic, peeled
1/4 cup (5 g) of fresh flat-leaf parsley leaves

, Crack one large egg into a medium mixing bowl and whisk it. Add the finely chopped vegetables, bacon, and seasoning mixture to the bowl. Combine the meatball mixture along with 1 pound (.45 kg) of ground beef chuck, 1/2 cup of grated Parmesan (2 ounces), 1/2 teaspoon of salt, 1/4 teaspoon of pepper and 3 tablespoons of bread crumbs.Avoid overworking the bacon meatball mixture which would make the meatballs tough. Instead, just stir the mixture enough to distribute the ingredients throughout the meat.

, Run your hands under warm water so they're damp. Gather about 2 tablespoons of the bacon meatball mixture and roll it slightly between your palms to make a ball. Place it on the foil-lined baking sheet. You should be able to make about 16 meatballs.Avoid overworking the meatballs or they'll become dense and tough.

, Place the sheet of bacon meatballs on the oven rack closest to the broiler. Broil the meatballs for 6 minutes. Remove the sheet from the oven and use tongs to turn the meatballs over. Return the pan to the broiler and broil the meatballs for another 5 or 6 minutes.The meatballs should be cooked through. Use a thermometer to ensure that the meatballs are at least at 165 degrees F (74 C).

, If you'd rather fry the meatballs on the stove instead of broil them, heat 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil in a large nonstick skillet. Turn the heat on to medium and add enough meatballs to the skillet to cover the bottom in a single layer. Fry the meatballs and turn them occasionally for 5 to 7 minutes. They should be golden brown and cooked through.Avoid crowding the pan which will make it hard to turn the meatballs. If you need to, fry the meatballs in batches.

Cook the meat until it reaches a golden brown color.",How to Cook Italian Sausage1," Add about a quarter inch of water to the pan, and a tablespoon of olive oil. Let the pan heat for about two minutes.;
, Then, wait for the water to come to a boil. Place a lid on the skillet, and cook the sausage over medium-low heat for about fifteen minutes.

, After the fifteen minutes of cooking time, remove the lid and continue to cook the sausage over medium heat. Remember to turn the meat every two to three minutes.

, If you have a temperature gage, the meat should reach an internal temperature of 150 to 156 degrees F.


If you prefer, you can also bake your sausages as described in the following method below.

"
"
Start your grill.,
Make a ""hot"" and ""cold"" side of your grill.,
Sear the sausages on the hot side.,
Transfer to the cold side to cook through.",How to Cook Sausages2," Cooking sausages on a grill is similar to cooking them in a pan, but not exactly the same. To get started, light your grill and let it build up heat. If you're using a gas grill, set the burners to medium-high. If you're using charcoal, light a generous pile of briquettes and let them burn to the point that they are ashed-over and glowing orange.


If you're using charcoal and are unsure how to get started, see our guide to lighting charcoal grills for detailed instructions.

, Once your grill is hot, it's time to make a minor adjustment. You want to leave one side of the grill hot but reduce the heat on the other side. This isn't hard — see below:


If you're using a gas grill, just turn down the burner(s) on one side to low.
If you're using a charcoal grill, carefully use a metal grill tool to pull most of the hot coals to one side, leaving just a thin layer on the other side. Put the grill over the hot briquettes carefully.

, Now, lay the sausages on the hot side of the grill one-by-one. Take care that there is a little space on either side of each sausage so that they can cook evenly. As when pan-frying, if the sausage casings are connected, cut them apart before cooking them.


Turn the sausages after two minutes. The underside should have a healthy dark-brown sear. Let the second side sear for about a minute before proceeding.

, Once the sausages are well-browned, use a long fork or a set of tongs to move them to the other side of the grill. Here, they'll continue to cook, but you won't risk burning them like you would on the hot side. Let them cook for about 10 more minutes, turning occasionally.


As noted above, the sausages are done when they are well-browned on the outside and have meat that is firm all the way through with no pink. Juices should run clear.

You may instead want to try making a mixture of water and your favorite liquid cooking ingredients. For instance, broth, stock, wine, beer, and tomato sauce can all transfer their flavor to sausage as it cooks.Boiling sausages won't give them a crisp exterior, but it will preserver the moisture and fat content within them. This makes boiling a good choice for emulsified sausages — those filled with a smooth mixture of finely-ground meat, fat and water. Examples include Bratwursts, Hot dogs, Frankfurters, Weisswurst, Knockwurst, and Serdelki., Use the highest possible setting on your burner — you're dealing with a lot of water, so you'll need a lot of heat to boil it. This may still take some time.

, To prevent hot splashes, lower the sausages in one-by-one with a set of tongs or another long utensil. Don't drop them in. When all the sausages are in the water, turn the heat down so that the boiling reduces to a gentle simmer.








, Cover the simmering water with a lid. If the sausages were previously cooked (as is the case with most hot dogs), you'll only need to cook them until they're hot all the way through (about 10 minutes). If they weren't pre-cooked, you may need to cook them for up to 30 minutes before taking them out. In either case, stir occasionally so the sausages cook all over.









Boiled sausages look a little different than grilled or fried sausages when they're done. They won't have a brown exterior — instead, they'll simply be firm and uniform all the way through, with no remaining pink. Depending on the type of sausage, they may be an unappealing grey waxy color. This is OK as long as they are cooked all the way through.

, The boiled sausages are now ready to eat. However, if you miss the crisp brown exterior from the other methods, you can still get this by applying a little dry heat. Get a frying pan or skillet hot, add a spoonful of oil, and fry the sausages on either side for a few minutes until browning occurs.


Many sausages from Central or Eastern Europe are traditionally eaten boiled. However, they still taste good browned, so don't be afraid to cook them this way.

Preheat the oven to 350 F (180 C).,
Prepare a baking pan.,
Place the sausages on the pan.,
Bake for 20 minutes.,
Check for done-ness before serving.",How to Cook Sausages4," While you wait for the oven to heat up, proceed to the next few steps.

, There are a lot of ways to cook sausages in the oven — the simplest is just to lay them directly on a metal baking pan. However, for even better results, try this method, which allows excess grease to drip away from the sausage like on a grill:


Line the pan with aluminum foil. This will make cleanup much easier.
Set metal baking racks over the foil-lined pan. The bars should be close enough to each other that sausages won't fall through.

, As with the methods above, the sausages should have an inch or so of space on either side so that they can cook evenly. If the sausage links are connected by their casing, cut them apart so that you can spread them out.

, Set the sausages into the center of the oven. Let them cook for 10 minutes before turning once, then let them cook the remaining 10 minutes undisturbed.Use a set of tongs to handle the hot sausages — they can sometimes grease unpredictably.

, When cooked in the oven, a ""done"" sausage looks roughly like one that's been cooked on the grill. The exterior should be brown and crisp all over. The inside should be moist and firm, with no pink remaining. Juices should run clear.


If the sausages don't appear done, continue to cook them in five-minute increments until they cook all the way through. Big, thick sausages can take lots of time to finish cooking.

Turn on the oven and prepare your baking sheet.,
Combine the meatball mixture.,
Form the meatballs.,
Wrap the meatballs with bacon.,
Cook the bacon wrapped meatballs.,
Finished.

",How to Make Bacon Meatballs2," Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (204 C). Line a rimmed baking sheet with foil. You'll also need to have a large nonstick skillet to briefly fry the bacon wrapped meatballs before you finish baking them in the oven.Ensure that you have a package of toothpicks. These will secure the bacon to the meatballs.

, Place all of your meatball ingredients (except for the bacon and vegetable oil) into a large mixing bowl. Use your hands or a spoon to completely combine the meat with the seasonings. You'll need:1 1/4 pound (.56 kg) of ground beef
2 eggs
2 tablespoons of olive oil
⅓ cup (20 g) of bread crumbs
⅓ cup (10 g) of minced Italian parsley
3 cloves of minced garlic
2 teaspoons of salt
2 teaspoons of pepper

, Scoop out about 1/4 of a cup of the meatball mixture. Roll it between the palms of your hands to make a round meatball. The ball should be the size of a golf ball. If it's too small, add more meat and re-roll the ball. If it's too big, just pinch off a little and smooth the meatball. Do this for all of the meatball mixture.You can also use a cookie scoop to portion out the meatballs.

, Get out one or two packages of bacon. Take one piece of bacon and wrap it around the entire meatball. You'll need to wrap it around a few times to use the whole piece of bacon. Stick a toothpick through the bacon and into the meatball to keep it in place as it cooks.If you're using thick-sliced bacon, you'll probably need two packages of bacon.

, Heat a large nonstick skillet with a few tablespoons of vegetable oil over medium-high heat. Add the bacon wrapped meatballs and cook them for several minutes. Carefully turn the bacon wrapped meatballs so all sides fry up and brown. Remove the fried bacon wrapped meatballs to your foil-lined baking sheet and bake them for 20 minutes.Use tongs and wear oven mitts when turning the bacon wrapped meatballs. Frying the meatballs before baking them ensures that the bacon is crisp and fully cooked.

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit (200 degrees Celsius).,
Place the sausage links on the baking sheet.,
Cook the sausages in the preheated oven.,
Remove the links from the oven once they start to brown.",How to Cook Italian Sausage2," Line a shallow baking sheet with nonstick aluminum foil.

, Line them up side by side, leaving space in between each link. Space the links apart as evenly as possible.

, Place the baking sheet on the middle rack of the oven to ensure even cooking. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes.


Note that thicker sausages may need to bake longer. Extremely large or thick links may need to be baked anywhere from 40 to 60 minutes. If cooking them this long, however, you should turn the sausages at least once.

, The tops of the Italian sausage links should be lightly browned, but not charred.

Cut the pork butt.,
Wash your hands and change utensils.,
Add six tablespoons of red wine to the meat.,
Spice the meat.,
Chop up the garlic cloves.,
Mix the meat with the seasonings.,
Place the seasoned meat in the meat grinder.",How to Cook Italian Sausage3," Make sure to cut the meat into smaller, square pieces so that it'll easily fit into your meat grinder. Don't cut out the fat, as you'll want your meat to be well-marbled to attain the right flavor.


Place the pork chunks into a separate bowl.

, It's important to keep everything absolutely clean when handling raw meat as you don't want anything to get cross-contaminated. So wash your hands, change knives and your cutting board to proceed to the next steps.

, This is the first seasoning ingredient, but you can also omit the wine if you prefer.


If you didn't have a bowl big enough to contain all of the meat, divide the wine servings evenly: three table spoons in one bowl, three in the other.

, Add salt, Cayenne Pepper, fennel seeds, paprika, red pepper, chopped parsley, and cracked black pepper to the pork and set the bowl(s) aside.

, Garlic is an important ingredient for Italian Sausage, and cannot be left out. Chop it up into very small pieces, then add it to the spiced meat.

, Your seasoning ingredients should be resting on top of the meat that has not been folded or mixed. With a spoon, or your clean hands, mix the spices and meat together.

, Leave the stuffer attachment out the first time you grind the pork. Wringing the meat through a second time will give your sausage a more even texture.

Slide the hog casings onto the stuffing part of your meat grinder.,
Push down the pork into the feeding tunnel with one hand.,
Push back the air bubbles.,
Twist your sausage into separate links.,
Tie the end of the casing.,
Put your sausage links in the fridge.,
Finished.

",How to Cook Italian Sausage4," Make sure that about six to seven inches of casing are hanging from the end of the stuffing tube. Keep in mind that each sausage link requires roughly six inches of casing.


Don't tie the end of the casing until all of the meat is in it.

, Hold the hog casing loosely with the other as the meat feeds into the casing.


You might consider enlisting the help of a a friend. That way, your partner can push the meat into the grinder while you shape the sausage in the casing.

, As the meat makes its way into the casing, you might notice some air bubbles pop up. Simply push them back and out to get rid of them.


The meat grinder will take care of pushing the casing off the stuffing tube, so you don't need to worry about that.

, It's very helpful to twist the sausage in opposite directions to keep them intact as you go on to twist the next link.


You might consider making the first twist right in the middle of the giant sausage. Then twist again in the middle of the smaller sections.

, Once you've divided your giant sausage link into smaller links, tie a knot at both ends of the sausage link. Twist and tie the end of the casing.

, Let them dry overnight, uncovered. The next day, cut them into individual links where the twists intersect.

Pick a fairly expensive brand of sausage.,
Take the maximum of four sausages from the packet, and gently press them between your clean fingers separately.,
Take a large microwave safe plate and put a piece of kitchen paper on it.,
Take the maximum of four sausages that you withdrew from the packet and prick them thoroughly with a fork.,
Place the four pricked sausages onto the plate with the tissue, allowing a bit of space between each one as they will expand slightly with compressed fat no matter what you do.

,
Place another sheet of kitchen towel on top of the sausages to absorb any fat the sausages might spit.

,
Set your microwave to full power for 30 seconds, and heat the sausages.

,
Remove with a dishcloth or oven gloves in hand as the sausages will be very hot and the plate will likely be very hot as well.

,
Allow the sausages to sit for a couple of minutes to cool a little bit and to let all the fat that intends to come out come out.

,
Repeat as necessary.",How to Heat Pre Cooked Cocktail Sausages in the Microwave," More expensive sausages are likely to have less fat in them and more meat, which lessens the chance of spitting fat.;
, Believe it or not, some brands are so chock full of fat some will actually drip away if you squeeze it.

, This will absorb any heated up fat.

, Make sure there are small holes on all four sides. This will allow the fat to seep out rather than expand and explode the sausage.

,,,,,, The sausages stay hot for a long time, so you will be safe to do three or four lots without worrying about the first.

Do not fry cold bacon.If you wish, you can marinate or season your bacon at this point. To get ideas for marinades and seasoning, refer to the section in this article on adding flavor to bacon.


If the bacon is frozen, you will need to thaw it first. Don't fry frozen bacon. Instead, allow the bacon to thaw on its own while it's still in the package, or in a bowl of room-temperature water. Do not microwave the bacon to thaw it.;
, You can use a 12-inch cast-iron skillet or a 12-inch standard frying pan, so long as it is cold. Place several slices of bacon on the skillet or pan. The bacon slices should be almost touching, but not overlapping. If you overlap the bacon, it may not cook evenly.A regular frying pan will work just as well as a cast iron-skillet will, but a cast-iron skill will cook the bacon faster.

, Set the temperature to ""low,"" and let the bacon start cooking. As the bacon begins to heat up, you will notice bacon fat pooling in the bottom of the pan. This helps cook the bacon evenly. If there is too much bacon fat, then you can consider pouring some out into a heat-safe bowl or jar. Do not pour bacon fat down the drain, or you may risk clogging the drain.If you want crispy bacon, consider filling the skillet or frying pan with just enough water to cover the bacon. Set the temperature to ""high"" instead of ""low."" When the water begins to boil, lower the heat to ""medium,"" and when the water has simmered away, lower the heat again to ""medium low."" Continue cooking the bacon in its fat until it is golden-brown in color., After a few minutes, you will notice that the bacon is starting to bubble and curl. Flip the bacon using a form. You can either use the fork as a mini spatula and slide it beneath the bacon slice before flipping it over. You can also wedge the bacon slice between the fork prongs and flip it over that way; this gives you more support and control.

, The amount of time you cook your bacon depends on how well-done you like your bacon. The crispier you like your bacon, the longer you will have to cook it.

, Once the bacon has cooked to your liking, transfer each piece to a paper towel-covered plate. Allow the paper towel to soak up any excess fat before serving the bacon.


You can also drain the bacon on sheets of newspaper, cut up paper bags, or a wire baking rack places over a cookie sheet.

Cut the pudding into thick slices.,
Remove the skin.,
Place the pudding slices in a hot frying pan.,
Fry for 3-4 minutes on each side.",How to Cook Black Pudding1," If you've bought a packaged black pudding, start by removing the plastic wrapping from the outside of the sausage. Lay the sausage on a cutting board and cut it into slices roughly half an inch thick using a sharp knife. The thicker slices will need to cook longer, but there will be less chance that the sausage filling will crumble as it heats.You can also begin slicing the sausage while it’s still in the plastic wrapper and remove the plastic and the skin together.Blood sausages like black pudding have a more delicate consistency because they contain very little actual meat. The oats and grains inside will not hold up as well to cooking as meatier sausages.;
, Make a small incision at the edge of each slice with your knife and then peel away the skin. Be careful not to damage the sausage as you are cutting and peeling. Removing the skin the black pudding prior to cooking will allow it to get more evenly done, and will also make it easier to eat.Use a sharpened knife to keep from mashing the sausage as you slice it.

, Turn the stove on to a medium heat and begin heating a pan large enough to hold 2-3 pudding slices. If you prefer, you can use an ounce of butter or a tablespoon of oil to fry the black pudding, though this is not necessary due to the high fat content of the sausage. Place the slices flat in the pan and let them start cooking.Black pudding will cook just fine in its own fat, much like bacon or other varieties of sausage. Butter and oil can be used for flavor and to give the outer layer an extra crispy finish.
For a traditional English breakfast, add other ingredients to the pan that can be fried at the same time—eggs, bacon, potatoes, and other sausages are all fair game., Fry the black pudding slices for 3-4 minutes before turning them. Keep a close eye on them as they cook—because of their dark color, it can be hard to tell when they are done. A properly fried pudding should be black and crisp on the outside, with a soft center slightly lighter in color.Black pudding that has been overcooked will become shriveled and hard as it loses moisture.

Finished.

",How to Make Sausage Gumbo," Add 3 tablespoons (43 g) of unsalted butter to a large Dutch oven or pot. Turn the heat to medium, and allow the butter to melt completely, which should take approximately 3 to 5 minutes.If you prefer, you can substitute olive oil or vegetable oil for the butter.;
, Once the butter has fully melted, add 4 large andouille sausage links that have been sliced into ¾-inch (1.9-cm) ovals to the pot. Allow the sausage to cook until color and a light crust develops on all sides of the meat, which should take approximately 5 minutes.Be sure to stir the sausage constantly as it heats it to ensure that it cooks evenly.

, When you’ve finished cooking the sausage, use a slotted spoon to remove it from the pot. Place it on paper towel-lined plate to absorb the excess grease, and set it aside.There is no need to wash or clean the pot after removing the sausage. You want the remaining butter and grease in it to flavor the gumbo as you move onto the other steps.

, To the same pot that you cooked the sausage, add 1 cup (175 g) of chopped green bell pepper, 1 cup (225 g) of chopped celery, and 1 cup (150 g) of chopped onion. With the heat on medium, allow the vegetables to cook until they are tender, which should take approximately 4 to 5 minutes.If you find that the butter has cooked off after you’ve finished with the sausage, you can add 1 to 2 tablespoons (14 to 28 g) more before adding the vegetables.
Stir the vegetables periodically to ensure that they cook evenly.

, Once the vegetables are tender, add 4 cloves of minced garlic to the pot. Allow the mixture to cook for approximately 1 minute, or until the garlic becomes fragrant.If you prefer, you can substitute 1 teaspoon (3 g) of garlic powder for the minced garlic. Add it in the following step with the other dried spices.

, After you’ve cooked the garlic with the vegetables, add 1 teaspoon (1 g) of dried thyme, 1 teaspoon (6 g) of salt, and ¼ teaspoon (½ g) of cayenne pepper to the pot. Mix the spices in well, and allow the mixture to cook for 30 seconds.If you want your sausage gumbo to be spicier, you can add more of the cayenne pepper.
You can substitute 1 to 2 teaspoons (3 to 6 g) of Cajun seasoning for the the thyme, salt, and cayenne pepper. It is spice blend that contains all of those ingredients.

, After you’ve cooked the spices into the vegetable mixture, sprinkle ½ cup (63 g) of all-purpose flour into the pot. Stir well so all of the ingredients are coated with the flour, and turn the heat up to medium-high. Cook the mixture for approximately 1 minute, or until the flour browns., Once the flour has browned, add a 14.5 ounce (411 g) can of diced tomatoes to the pot. Allow the tomatoes to cook until they begin to release their juices, which should take approximately 2 minutes.Make sure to stir the mixture occasionally to ensure that it heats evenly.

, After the tomatoes have released their juices, add 4 cups (946 ml) of chicken broth to the pot. Stir it in well, and cover the pot. Turn the heat to high and allow the mixture to come to a boil, which should take approximately 5 minutes.It’s best to use low-sodium chicken broth because salt has already been added to the dish.

, After the pot has come to a boil, add the cooked sausage to the mixture. Leave the lid off, and turn the heat down to medium.If the mixture is still boiling after you reduce the heat, you may need to lower the heat to medium-low or low.

, When all of the ingredients are combined, let the gumbo simmer for 25 to 30 minutes. Stir the mixture occasionally to ensure that none of the ingredients stick to the pot.Simmering the gumbo helps thicken it up so it has more of a stew-like consistency. You can simmer it until it reaches the consistency that you like.

, Once the gumbo has simmered for about half an hour, remove the pot from the heat. Pour the gumbo over individual bowls of prepared white or brown rice, and serve.You can add a dash or two of hot sauce to the bowls of gumbo and rice before you serve them if you like.
Store any leftovers in an airtight container in the refrigerator. It should keep for up to 3 days.
You can also freeze leftovers in an airtight container for up to 3 months.

Take your bacon out of the fridge to warm up.,
Lay the bacon on a cool frying pan or griddle.,
Turn the heat on medium and let the bacon and pan heat up together.,
Turn the bacon when it starts to curl and wave.,
Flip the bacon every 7-8 minutes until cooked to your desired crispiness.,
Lay the cooked bacon on a paper towel to drain.,
Drain the grease into a glass jar.",How to Cook Bacon1," When cold bacon hits a hot pan it doesn't have time to naturally heat up, allowing the grease to leave the meat and cook the bacon. Take your strips out of the fridge for 5-6 minutes before you start cooking.;
, Lay the bacon out on the pan so it is flat and none of the edges overlap. Heavy bottom pans, like cast iron, are best, but any pan will work.


Don't try and cook only 1-2 pieces at a time. They will often lack enough grease to coat the pan, leading you to burn the bacon. Fill the pan up with strips., Bacon cooks best when started in a cold pan, so don't preheat anything. Turn the heat on medium-low and let the bacon start to crackle slowly.

, The familiar, wavy bacon shape is a good sign your meat could use a flip. Turn it over and let it keep cooking, undisturbed. This usually occurs after 7-8 minutes.


If you are having trouble with splattering, place a mesh or wire pan covering over the top. You need to let the steam and air escape, but this will trap a lot of grease., Bacon cooking is less of a science as an art, so make the meat you want to eat. As the meat heats up, it will brown and harden. Do not, however, let it get past a dark, bark-like brown, as the next step is usually burning.


Bacon continues to cook in the hot oil after removing it from the pan, so be careful handling it.

, Remove any excess grease by placing the bacon on a plate with paper towels, then gently pat the grease off of the top with another paper towel.


The hotter the bacon is, the thinner the grease will be and the easier it is to remove, but you should still be careful. Cooking tongs are often the best way to remove the bacon.

, You should not pour grease down your drain, as it will solidify when it cools and can cause a clog. Luckily, bacon grease is an incredibly cooking oil that lends a rich, smoky taste to any meal. Let the grease cool in the pan for 2-3 minutes, then pour it into a glass jar to save. It will harden and can be used in place of butter, lard, or cooking oil.Drain the grease if you plan on cooking more bacon, as the new strips will add more grease to the pan. You don't have to let the grease cool, but you should prepare your glass jar by warming it up with hot water and draining it right before pouring in the grease to prevent shattering.
A bulb baster is a safe, easy way to remove hot grease while keeping the pan hot.

Consider adding some variation to your bacon.,
Add some spices to the bacon.,
Marinate the bacon with sauce, salad dressing, or syrup.,
Make some bacon pancakes.",How to Fry Bacon2," You can make your bacon more flavorful by marinating it or rubbing spices onto it before frying it. You can also combine it with other food items. This section will give you some ideas on how to add extra flavor to your bacon. To learn how to fry bacon, refer to the section in this article on frying bacon.

, You can give your bacon an extra burst of flavor by rubbing a combination of spices onto it. Make sure that the bacon is room temperature before adding the spices. Let the spices sit on the bacon for a few minutes before frying it.Here are some combinations:


1 tablespoon brown sugar, 1 teaspoon cinnamon, and 1 teaspoon apple or pumpkin pie spice.1 teaspoon brown sugar, ¼ teaspoon of cracked pepper.1 tablespoon of granulated garlic and 1 tablespoon of paprika.1 ½ tablespoons of dark brown sugar., Put some bacon in a dish and cover it with a sauce, salad dressing, or syrup of your choosing. Make sure that both sides of the bacon are coated. Let the bowl sit in the fridge for thirty minutes, then fry as usual. Consider marinating the bacon with any of the following:1 cup pineapple juice plus 1 teaspoon soy sauce
Italian salad dressing
Molasses
Teriyaki sauce
Maple syrup. Thinner, Vermont-style maple syrup works best.Note that sweet sauces and dressings will caramelize when you fry the bacon. This will result in some stickiness and messiness.

, While not quite seasoning or marinating, it is possible to combine the two best breakfast foods: bacon and pancakes. Prepare some pancake batter and fry some bacon. Take the bacon out of the skillet or frying pan, set it on some paper towels, and pour out the grease.Place the bacon back onto the skillet or pan, leaving two inches of space between each slice. Pour the batter along each slice of bacon and let it cook until the batter starts to turn bubbly (about one to two minutes). Flip the bacon pancake over, and let it cook until the bottom turns golden (about two minutes)."

Consider other cooking methods.,
Cook the bacon in a microwave.,
Bake bacon in the oven.,
Cook the bacon over a grill.",How to Fry Bacon3," While bacon is traditionally fried, sometimes frying just isn't an option either due to time constraints or lack of equipment. Fortunately, there are different methods of cooking bacon. This section will show you how to cook bacon using a microwave, an oven, and a grill.

, Place a few strips of bacon on a paper towel-covered plate, then cover the bacon with another sheet of paper towel. Place the plate in the microwave and cook it for one minute. Be sure to watch your bacon, as every microwave is different and your bacon may be finished sooner.The more paper towers you cover the plate with, the more fat the paper will soak up. This will give you crispier bacon.

, Cover a baking sheet with foil and place a wire rack over it. Arrange the bacon on the wire rack and place everything into a cold oven. Turn the oven on and set the temperature to 400°F (205°C). Let the bacon cook for about 20 minutes. For crisper bacon, increase the baking time by a few more minutes.Consider flipping your bacon. Bake the bacon for 12 to 15 minutes, then flip it over. Let it cook for 10 more minutes.Placing the bacon on a wire rack will allow the excess fat to drip down and not puddle around the bacon. It will allow the hot air in the oven to circulate around the bacon and cook it evening.
Placing the bacon in a cold, oven, without preheating it first, gives you flatter bacon and prevents shrinking.

, Start up your grill and set it to medium heat. When the grill is hot, arrange the bacon on the rack. Wait until the bacon starts to turn crispy and golden, then flip it over and let it cook some more. This will take five to seven minutes."

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.,
Slice the black pudding and remove the skin.,
Arrange the pudding slices on a baking sheet.,
Bake for 10-20 minutes.",How to Cook Black Pudding2," Set the oven to bake and begin preheating it to 375 degrees. It is recommended that you use a lower temperature when preparing black pudding in the oven to keep it from burning.Black pudding is prone to cooking at inconsistent rate because of the heating differences in its components.

, Cut the pudding into half-inch-thick slices. Nick the casing along the outer edge of each slice and peel back the skin.

Slice the pudding thick if it is to serve as a main course. Thinner slices can be chopped or crumbled after they’re cooked and added to other dishes., Spray a large pan or baking sheet with oil. Lay out the slices on the baking sheet an even distance apart. Place the baking sheet in the oven on the center rack., The pudding should remain in the oven for around 10-20 minutes, depending on thickness, or until the outside has begun to crisp. Take a peek at the pudding’s progress after it has been baking for several minutes to make sure is isn’t getting too done. The circulating heat of the oven will cook the pudding more evenly than frying.Turn the pudding slices at the halfway mark to get them crisp and caramelized on both sides.
Preparing black pudding in the oven can be a time-saving tactic if you’re also making other dishes and don’t have time to watch a frying pan.

Remove the plastic wrapping from the black pudding.,
Bring a large pot of water to a boil.,
Put in the pudding whole.,
Heat for 6-8 minutes.",How to Cook Black Pudding3," Peel away the plastic wrap covering the black pudding. Do not slice it or remove the skin. With the casing damaged or removed the sausage would absorb water and become soggy.Take care not to break the skin casing when removing the outer plastic.

, Fill a stock pot with water and heat it until it comes to a boil. You can also use a deep pan to simmer the black pudding, though this will take longer and require regular turning. The pot or pan you use should be big enough to hold the entire pudding.Simmering will work best with thinner sausages. The bulky girth of thick sausages makes heating them in a pan impractical.

, Carefully place the black pudding into the boiling water. It will submerge when placed in a stock pot. If you’ve chosen to simmer the pudding in a pan, you will need to turn it every few minutes to make sure it gets cooked through.

Turn simmering sausages using long-handled tongs to keep from burning yourself.
Boiling sausages will need to be checked periodically to ensure that the skin hasn’t ruptured. If it has, remove the black pudding from the water immediately, slice and finish cooking on a skillet or in the oven to salvage the flavor and texture of the sausage.

, Allow the pudding to boil or simmer for 6-8 minutes. You can test the consistency of the sausage as it cooks by squeezing it lightly with a pair of tongs. Once most of its firmness has given way and it has taken on a soft texture, it is ready to serve.Thicker sausages may need to be cooked longer in order to be a consistent temperature throughout.

Lay your strips on the rack or pan.,
Put the sheet in the oven as soon as you're ready.,
Check the bacon after 15 minutes.,
Lay the bacon out on a 2-3 layers of paper towels after removing from the oven.",How to Cook Bacon2," Most restaurants cook bacon in an oven, as it is easier to clean up, leaves the stove top open, and, most importantly, allows you to cook a lot of bacon very quickly. It only takes 10-12 minutes, and you can easily make a whole pound at once.


Take your bacon out of the fridge to start warming up as you work.
Make sure you have an oven rack in the middle with plenty of space above the rack.

, This ensures that no grease escapes the pan, potentially starting a grease fire. There will not be huge pools, so simply curling the edges up a bit should be fine. You can use a baking dish or a rimmed sheet instead, which will naturally trap the grease, and skip the foil.

, If you have a wire rack, put this on top of the baking sheet. You can then cook your bacon on the wires, allowing the grease to drip down into the pan below instead of pooling around your bacon. If you do not have a wire rack, your bacon will cook fine on the foiled pan., They should be close but not touching. Fit as many pieces on your pan/rack/dish as possible. They will shrink as they cook, so they can be close.

, Don't wait for the oven to preheat all the way. Bacon actually cooks best when brought slowly up from room temperature, so get it in the oven whenever you can and let it start cooking., After 15 minutes at 400℉ the meat should be just about ready to go. Any additional or minimal cooking is for your preference. If you like chewy bacon, remove it now. If you want it crispy, leave it in for 20-22 minutes total.


Bacon will continue to crisp up for 1-2 minutes after you remove it from the heat, so plan accordingly., Take out the strips and lay them on the paper towels, which will soak up the excess grease and keep them crispy.

"
"
Cover a microwave-safe plate with 3-4 layers of paper towels.,
Lay the strips out on the plate and cover with one more paper towel.,
Cook the bacon for 1 minute per strip on HIGH.,
Keep cooking in 30-second bursts until at your desired doneness.,
Try bacon cooking trays for your microwave.",How to Cook Bacon3," The paper towels will help soak up the grease as the bacon cooks. The more the better, though you shouldn't need more than 4 layers of paper underneath the meat.

, They shouldn't be overlapping, but you can get them pretty close together. They will shrink as they cook. Lay another paper towel lightly over the bacon without pressing it in -- it is mostly there to prevent grease from splattering up.

, If you have 4 slices of bacon, cook for 4 minutes. When done, check them to see if they are at your desired crispiness.

, Know, however, that the hot grease will continue cooking your bacon after you remove it, so take the pieces out right before it is perfect., These special trays have ridges, allowing the grease to drain and out of the bacon naturally and cook to a crispier texture. You should know, however, that it is a challenge to get perfect, restaurant quality bacon in the microwave. Here's how you do it. Once the bacon is cooked to your preference, remove from the microwave and then wait 1 - 2 minutes for the bacon to crisp up. Like a meat roast that tastes better after sitting out of the oven for a bit, the bacon needs some time to crisp up.


If you use a bacon tray, you should still lay a paper towel over the top of the bacon to prevent spattering."

Cure your own bacon.,
Marinade your bacon in maple syrup for ""Vermont Style."",
Cure your bacon in brown sugar.,
Add 1-2 tablespoons of water to your pan for easily crumbled bacon.",How to Cook Bacon4," The way to get the ultimate bacon is to simply make it yourself. The following recipe can be customized to your liking, but contains all the basics of a good curing:


Place 2 1/2 lbs of pork belly, rind removed, in a zip lock bag with 2 1/2 tablespoons kosher salt, 1/2 cups of a sugar (white, brown, maple syrup, molasses etc.), 1 teaspoon black pepper, and a dash seasonings you desire (liquid smoke, garlic, paprika, fennel, mustard seeds, etc.) Coat the meat in the mixture.
Let the bag soak in the fridge for 7 days, flipping over once a day. You should notice liquid building up in the bag.Rinse the meat off and cook it at 225℉ for 90 minutes, or until the internal temperature is 150℉. You can also smoke the meat on the grill to this temperature, usually 3-5 hours.Cool the meat and cut it into thin bacon strips. You now have bacon that is ready to be cooked in the oven, microwave, or pan until your desired crispiness.

, This New England breakfast meat may sound like a joke, but the combination of sweet and salty is heavenly. To do so, put your strips of bacon in a bowl and cover with maple syrup, preferably the thin, traditional kind. Let the it sit covered in the fridge for 30 minutes, then take the strips out and cook like normal.The caramelized sugars will make a mess as they cook, but the resulting bacon will be worth it.
While you can use ""fake"" syrups, like Aunt Jemima, the high-quantity of corn starch in imitation maple syrup will be tough to clean and leave a thick, sticky coating on the meat.

, Let the bacon sit out at room temperature until it is warm. Rub both sides of the strips with brown sugar (dark or light) and wait 4-5 minutes before cooking like normal., Do not try and cut the bacon ahead of time and then cook the pieces -- they will heat up too fast and release all of the delicious juices. Instead, cook the bacon on a stovetop as normal. However, before you start heating up the pan, add 1-2 tablespoons of water to the pan with the meat. The water will evaporate, leading to crispier, easily crumbled bacon perfect for salads or recipes like Bacon Mac and Cheese."

",How to Cure Bacon," For the best texture and taste, insist on meat that is organic and/or free of artificial hormones.Specify that you want a raw pork belly that hasn’t already been cured or sliced. For a fattier bacon, ask for meat that came from the hog’s belly and/or chest. For a meatier bacon, ask for meat that covered the hog’s spare ribs.Whole pork bellies typically weigh between 10 and 12 pounds, but if you are experimenting with cure recipes, ask for a smaller cut in case you end up not liking your concoction.;
, If you purchased your pork belly from a commercial vendor other than a farm and plan on curing it as soon as you get home, skip this step, since the meat has already been chilled. But if you buy direct from a farm, ask the farmer how long ago the hog was slaughtered, because you need to chill your meat within 24 hours of that time.In either case, bring along a cooler stocked with ice to keep the pork belly relatively cool on the ride home if it takes you more than half an hour.Once home, place the pork belly in a sealable container to keep your fridge clean and prevent cross-contamination with other items.
For a quicker chill, set the container inside the fridge wherever it is coldest. To further reduce the chance of cross-contamination, set it in the meat compartment, away from other products.
Keep the refrigerator’s temperature at 40 degrees Fahrenheit and let the pork belly sit until its core temperature drops to 42 degrees, which will help kill bacteria.
If you are chilling multiple bellies, set each one in its own container rather than stacking the meat directly on top of each other.

, Either ask your butcher to do it for you when you purchase the meat, or do it at home yourself. In the latter case, use a sharpened knife since the skin is tough. Begin your cut at any corner of the belly. As you slice the skin off, angle the blade toward the skin, rather than away from it, so you don’t end up trimming off any more precious meat than necessary. Once your skin is removed, the meat will absorb more of the cure.The discarded skin can be cooked on its own, either by grilling or deep-frying. If you wish to do this, be sure to tell your butcher to save the skin if you have them slice the skin off for you.

, Buy curing salts online if they aren't available at your local supermarket or butcher's. Or, mix your own using kosher salt and sodium nitrite, which is also available online. However, be aware that there has been debate about sodium nitrite (the principal preservative in curing salt) and its possible link to cancer and other diseases,due to its possible conversion into carcinogenic nitrosamines. Use celery powder or ground celery seeds as an alternative if this is a concern.Be aware, though, that such alternatives do contain sodium nitrate. There is also some debate about whether sodium nitrate is any healthier than sodium nitrite. The argument for using celery products is that the presence of certain vitamins and minerals is believed to prevent the conversion of nitrates into harmful nitrosamines.

, Exact recipes vary by personal taste and ingenuity. To cure 5 pounds of meat with a minimum of ingredients, first combine 1 cup of sugar with 2 tablespoons of blackstrap molasses in a bowl. Stir thoroughly. Then add 4 tablespoons of kosher salt, 2 teaspoons of curing salt, and 2 teaspoons of ground black pepper. Mix thoroughly, taste, and add more salt if desired.Even this basic recipe can be altered to suit your tastes by exploring the effects of different types of sugar, salt, and pepper., For roughly 5 pounds of meat, combine a ½ cup of kosher salt with 2 teaspoons of sodium nitrite. Mix in a ¼ cup of brown sugar (either dark or light is fine). Then add ⅛ cup of each of the following: ground black pepper, ground juniper berries, and crumbled sage. Finally, add 1 tablespoon of dried thyme. Stir all ingredients thoroughly for an even mix.


Both the sodium nitrite and juniper berries can be omitted if desired.

, For every 5 pounds of meat, combine a ¼ cup of kosher salt with 2 teaspoons of pink curing salt. Then add a ¼ cup of dark brown sugar. Next, add spices: 2 tablespoons of red pepper flakes, 2 tablespoons of smoked sweet paprika, and 1 teaspoon of cumin seeds. Lastly, pour a ¼ cup of honey into the dry ingredients and stir them together until both wet and dry ingredients have been evenly mixed.Any honey will do, but chestnut honey works particularly well here.

, Remove your chilled pork belly from the fridge. To keep your kitchen surfaces clean, place it on a rimmed baking sheet. Coat the meat with your cure recipe. Then massage the cure into the meat all over,doing your best to spread the cure over and into the pork belly as evenly as you can for consistent flavor.

, Once it has been coated with cure, place the meat into a sealable container. If you use a plastic bag for this, set the bag in a rimmed baking sheet or a pan to keep any possible leaks from spreading in your fridge. Refrigerate the pork belly for at least 5 days. As juices begin to pool at the bottom of the container, be sure to flip the pork belly daily so each side is more or less evenly soaked in brine.If your meat is particularly thick, or you wish to have as much cured flavor as possible, leave the pork belly to cure for 7 days to ensure that the cure makes its way to the middle of the meat, thus extending its shelf life.

, Remove the pork belly from the fridge and its container. Place it in a colander. Run cold water over both sides to wash away all excess salt. Then use paper towels or a clean towel to gently pat the meat dry.Your bacon is now cured!

, If you do not cook and consume your bacon right away, wrap it with plastic wrap. Seal it tightly to keep out air.Store in your refrigerator or freezer.


Bacon slabs cured with nitrites will last 4 to 6 weeks in the refrigerator and 3 months in the freezer.Bacon slabs cured without nitrites will last 3 weeks in the refrigerator and 6 months in the freezer.

Heat a nonstick skillet.,
Add the sausage.,
Pan-fry until cooked through.,
Drain and serve.",How to Cook Breakfast Sausage1," Place a medium nonstick skillet on the stove over medium-low heat. Let it warm up for 1 or 2 minutes.


Note that you should not add any extra oil or fat to the pan. The fat inside the sausage should render as it cooks, providing all the grease needed for the frying process.
If you can check the temperature of the skillet, note that the temperature should reach 350 degrees Fahrenheit (180 degrees Celsius) before you continue.;
, Arrange the sausage links or patties in the hot skillet. Keep the sausage in a single layer.


You can cook both links and patties using this method. The cooking times vary slightly, but otherwise, the process remains the same.
You can also cook breakfast roll sausage using this method if you slice the sausage roll into 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) patties beforehand.Treat these patties as you would treat pre-formed breakfast patties.

, Cook sausage links for 12 to 16 minutes;cook sausage patties for 10 to 12 minutes.Regardless of which form you choose, you'll need to turn the sausage frequently as it cooks to promote even browning on all sides.
Add an additional 2 minutes if you use frozen breakfast sausage instead of thawed sausage.
The sausages should be browned all the way through, and the internal temperature should read a minimum of 160 degrees Fahrenheit (70 degrees Celsius).

, Remove the sausage from the hot skillet and transfer it to a plate lined with paper towels. Drain off the excess grease for 1 or 2 minutes, then serve the sausage while it's still hot.


Store leftover sausages in the refrigerator for 1 or 2 days. You can also freeze the leftovers for up to 30 days.

Combine the sausage and water.,
Cook off the water.,
Fry the sausage for 6 to 7 minutes.,
Drain and serve.",How to Cook Breakfast Sausage2," Place the sausage links in a deep, medium skillet. Pour 1/4 cup (60 ml) of water into the skillet, as well.The water level should not be high enough to completely cover the sausages.
While you can technically cook any type of breakfast sausage using this method, it's best to use it for skinless or ""fresh"" links. This method may not be as effective for links with skin or sausage patties.

, Place the skillet on the stove over medium-high heat. Simmer the sausage for 6 to 7 minutes, or until the water evaporates.


Continue cooking as long as it takes for the water to naturally evaporate. Do not drain off any of the water. Similarly, do not add more water if it evaporates faster than anticipated.
Do not cover the pan since doing so may slow or prevent the steam from escaping, slowing the overall cooking process as a result.

, Reduce the heat to medium-low and continue cooking the sausages uncovered for another 6 to 7 minutes, or until they're cooked through.


Use tongs to periodically turn the sausage links as they cook. Doing so should promote even browning on all sides.
Note that you should not add any extra oil or fat during the frying part of this process. The fat rendered from the sausages should be enough to cook them.
When ready, the sausages should be brown throughout and the juices should run clear. If you check the internal temperature, the center of the thickest sausage should be a minimum of 160 degrees Fahrenheit (70 degrees Celsius).

, Remove the sausages from the skillet and set them onto several layers of paper towel to drain. After 1 or 2 minutes, transfer the sausages to individual serving plates and enjoy.


Any cooked sausages you don't use immediately should be refrigerated for 1 or 2 days, or frozen for up to 30 days.

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit (200 degrees Celsius).,
Arrange the sausages on the pan.,
Bake until cooked through.,
Serve warm.",How to Cook Breakfast Sausage3," Meanwhile, prepare a shallow baking pan or baking sheet by lining it with parchment paper.The parchment paper prevents the sausages from sticking while also absorbing some of the excess fat that renders off during the cooking process.
If you cannot use parchment paper, place a metal cooling or baking rack on top of the baking sheet instead. The rack will allow the excess fat to drip off during the cooking process, preventing the sausages from baking in that fat.

, Line up the sausages on the baking sheet, arranging them in a single layer and leaving at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) of space between them.


You can cook breakfast sausage links and breakfast sausage patties using this method. The exact baking times may vary, but the overall process should remain the same for both types.
Roll breakfast sausage can be cooked using this method, as well. Slice the roll into 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) patties and treat those patties as you would treat the pre-formed version.

, Place the sausages in the preheated oven. Cook sausage patties for 15 to 16 minutes; cook sausage links for 20 to 25 minutes.


Both links and patties should be turned once halfway through the cooking process to promote even browning on both sides.
When ready, the sausages should be browned throughout and the juices should run clear. The internal temperature at the center of each portion should be a minimum of 160 degrees Fahrenheit (70 degrees Celsius).

, Remove the sausages from the oven and transfer them to individual serving plates. Enjoy them while they're still hot.


If the sausages are still too greasy for your liking after removing them from the oven, you can blot away any excess grease using clean paper towels.
Any unused sausage can be refrigerated for 1 or 2 days, or frozen for up to 1 month.

Preheat the broiler.,
Place the sausage near the heat.,
Broil for 6 minutes.,
Serve warm.",How to Cook Breakfast Sausage4," Turn the broiler on and allow it to warm up for about 3 to 5 minutes.


Most broilers only have an “ON” and “OFF” setting, but some also have “LOW” and “HIGH” settings. For the latter, preheat the broiler on “LOW.”

, Arrange the sausages in a single layer on a broiler pan. Place the pan in the preheated broiler, 4 to 6 inches (10 to 15 cm) away from the top heating element.If you do not have a broiler pan, place a metal cooling/cooking rack on top of a rimmed baking sheet and use that instead. You need to use something that allows the fat to drain as the sausages cook, so you should avoid using a flat baking sheet on its own.
Both sausage links and sausage patties can be cooked using this method. For sausage links, place the rack 4 to 5 inches (10 to 12.5 cm) away from the heating element. For sausage patties, keep the rack 6 inches (15 cm) away from the same element.
For roll breakfast sausage, slice the roll into 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) thick portions and treat each portion as though it were a pre-formed patty.

, Broil the sausages for 3 minutes, then turn them over to the other side. Continue cooking for another 3 minutes, or until the juices run clear and the centers are no longer pink.


This amount of time should work for both breakfast patties and breakfast links, but links may benefit from more frequent cooking and, in some instances, may cook a little faster than patties.
The internal temperature of both links and patties should reach at least 160 degrees Fahrenheit (70 degrees Celsius) before you remove the sausages from the broiler.

, Remove the sausages from the broiler and transfer them to individual serving plates. Enjoy them while they're still hot.


If you do not eat the sausages immediately, refrigerate them for 1 or 2 days, or freeze them for as long as 1 month.

",How to Cook Breakfast Sausage5," To reheat pre-cooked sausages, microwave them on full power for 10 to 15 seconds per portion.


This method can be used for both sausages cooked at home or pre-cooked packaged sausages. It also works with both links and patties.
Arrange the sausages in a single layer over a microwave-safe plate lined with paper towels. Cover them with an additional paper towel to reduce splatter.
Microwave thawed sausages for about 10 seconds per link or patty. For frozen sausages, reheat them for 15 seconds per link or patty. Note that exact cooking times may vary depending on the power output of your microwave.

, Warm the sausages through for 8 to 10 minutes using medium heat.


As with the microwave method, you can use this method for nearly any type of pre-cooked breakfast sausage: links or patties, home-cooked or packaged-cooked, thawed or frozen.
Place the links or patties in single layer in a cool nonstick pan. Cover the pan and set it on the stove over medium heat.
Reheat the sausages for 8 minutes if previously thawed or 10 minutes from frozen. You should not need to turn the sausages while they reheat. When ready, the sausages should be warmed throughout.

Place an oven rack in the lower third of the oven.If you’re baking two sheets of bacon, place the oven racks in the bottom half of the oven. This will help the bacon cook evenly.;
, Line the entire sheet, including the sides. This will prevent bacon grease from sticking to the surface and it will be easier to clean up. Choose a baking sheet with a lip that’s at least half an inch tall (1.27 cm) to keep bacon grease from dripping off the pan. Bacon is a greasy food, so there’s no need to spray the foil with cooking spray.


If you like crispier bacon, place a foil-wrapped cooling rack on the baking sheet. In this case, glass and ceramic pans can also be used.
You can use parchment paper instead of foil. Use a large sheet that covers the bottom and sides of the pan., Leave some space between each strip as crowded bacon will not get crispy.If you have too much bacon for one baking sheet, use two baking sheets or cook the bacon in batches. Otherwise, you risk cooking unappetizing, grease-saturated bacon.


A standard 21”x15” baking sheet will fit about a pound of bacon. If you have smaller sheets, you may need more than one to cook a pound of bacon.

, Check the bacon periodically to monitor the cooking process and adjust the cooking time based on your own tastes.Your cooking time may also change depending on your oven as some ovens run slightly hotter or cooler than normal. Remove the bacon from the oven when it’s almost perfect. The bacon will continue to cook and get firm even as it cools.


If the pieces become submerged in grease, pour the excess grease off into a ceramic bowl.Don’t pour off hot grease into plastic or glass bowls. Plastic bowls may melt and glass bowls may crack.

, Take the bacon off the baking sheet. Use cooking tongs or a fork to protect yourself from the hot bacon. Place it on a plate lined with two paper towels to soak up excess oil.Clean the baking sheet once it’s cooled completely. Remove and discard any foil or parchment paper and inspect the pan for grease stains.


If you see grease, wash the pan with soap and water. If you used a cooling rack to cook the bacon, soak the cooling rack in warm water to loosen up stubborn debris.
Dispose of excess baking grease properly. Once the grease cools, save it in your refrigerator or throw it away in the trash. If you pour it down the sink you will clog your drain., The meat in this section is generally more expensive than the packaged meats. However, the meat behind the deli counter is usually fresher and of higher quality than the packaged meats.


When you buy bacon at the deli counter, you can ask the butcher to cut it as thick as you like it.

, This cut comes from the pork belly meat that’s closest to the bone. This bacon is lean and meaty with almost thirty percent less fat than regular bacon.However, this cut of bacon is generally the most expensive.


If you buy prepackaged bacon, look for the center-cut options. Many brands of prepackaged bacon also carry center-cut bacon.

, The staff behind your meat counter will be able to tell you about the best bacon they have. Always be polite and try to remember their names whenever you visit the grocery store. If you build a good relationship with them they may even set aside the best cuts of bacon for you.

, Mix together 1/3 cup maple syrup and ½ cup brown sugar. After placing the bacon on your pan, use a pastry brush to coat each slice with the sugar mixture. Continue baking the bacon normally until it reaches the desired level of crispiness.Cook the candied bacon on a rack for maximum crispiness. Make sure to protect the rack from the sugar mixture with foil or parchment paper.
Candied bacon is delicious by itself but is also an excellent addition to sandwiches and breakfast platters.

, Many delicious dishes can be wrapped in bacon and baked in the oven. For example, make bacon-wrapped cookies by wrapping balls of cookie dough in a piece of bacon before cooking.Cheese stuffed jalapenos, meatballs, and chicken breasts can also be wrapped in bacon. Keep in mind that the bacon will need fifteen to twenty minutes to cook.


Experiment by wrapping both sweet foods and salty foods in bacon. Bacon is good with almost anything!

, Bake a tray or two of bacon in advance. Then, store the cooked bacon in your refrigerator for seven to ten days.Add bacon to your sandwiches throughout the week or crumble up a few pieces to add to a salad for a flavor boost.

For most models, simply set the air fryer to the desired temperature and wait at least two minutes before adding your bacon to the air fryer’s cooking basket.Operate your air fryer only on level, heat-resistant surfaces. Further, ensure that there is at least a hand’s length worth of open space behind the air fryer’s exhaust.;
, You’ll need to apply a thin coat of oil directly to the bacon you place in the air fryer’s cooking basket. The best way to do so is by using a spray bottle filled with your favored cooking oil. Spray the bottom of the cooking basket as well, to reduce sticking, and spray. For crispy bacon, spray on only a single thin layer of oil.Opt for a hand-pumped plastic spray bottle and fill it with liquid oil, such as olive oil.
While you can buy spray-able oil, the aerosol can break down some of the non-stick surfaces you use in your kitchen (including the one on your air fryer basket).

, Avoid overcrowding the air fryer’s cooking basket by limiting the amount you put in. Since basket sizes differ, there is no standard amount that is ideal. The important thing is that air is allowed to circulate around the bacon and come into contact with almost all of the bacon’s surface. As such, avoid piles of bacon that cause some pieces to be covered up.Proper air circulation shortens cooking time and ensures optimal cooking results, particularly in terms of crispiness.

, While the air fryer is cooking your bacon, pause it once to twice to remove the basket and shake it. This will adjust the bacon’s position in the basket, and help ensure that it is evenly cooked. To ensure that each piece if adequately adjusted during cooking, you can also use tongs to simply flip individual slices of bacon., Length of cook time and recommend cooking temperature will vary from model to model. As such, use the chart of other information source that came with your air fryer to determine the proper cook time and temperature.One of the benefits of an air fryer is that you can remove the cooking basket whenever you like to check on your food.

Mix the glaze ingredients.,
Place the bacon on the wire rack and put the tray in the oven.,
Bake the bacon for ten minutes.,
Turn the bacon slices.,
Bake for another five minutes.,
Keep basting the bacon.,
Allow to cool for 5 minutes.",How to Make Candied Bacon," Wait for the oven to preheat, about 15 minutes., Cover the bottom of a large baking sheet with aluminum foil or parchment paper, and place a wire cooling rack on top. The foil or parchment paper will catch any mess, which will make cleaning up much easier.If you don't have a wire rack, just cover the baking sheet in parchment paper. A rack will make your bacon crispier, but you can still make candied bacon without one.

, Add the sugar, rice vinegar, and maple syrup in a large bowl. Stir until all ingredients are fully mixed., Take the bacon and place it on top of the wire rack. Space each slice out evenly, making sure that none of them are overlapping.If you don't have a wire rack, just place the bacon on the baking sheet.
Don't add the glaze just yet: first you will partially cook the bacon.

, Place the baking tray with the bacon in the center of the oven. Allow it to cook for ten minutes., After ten minutes, take the tray out of the oven carefully with an oven mitt. Brush the top of the bacon with the sugar glaze. Use a pair of tongs or a small spatula to flip over each slice of bacon. Then brush glaze onto the other side of the bacon., Put the tray back in the oven and let the bacon bake for five more minutes. After five minutes, take the tray out of the oven and use a basting brush to brush the glaze on both sides of the bacon. Then put the bacon back in the oven.Basting the bacon builds up the sugar glaze on the outside.

, Remove the bacon from the oven after another five minutes. Baste each side of the bacon with the sugar-maple syrup glaze. Repeat basting every five minutes or so until the bacon looks done. The total baking time should be around 35 minutes.If you aren’t sure whether the bacon is done, break off a small piece and see if it’s crispy enough for you.

, After the bacon is cooked, take the tray out of the oven. Carefully lift up the wire rack with the bacon on it and set it on the counter. This will stop the heat radiating from the tray and cooking the bacon further. Let the bacon sit for five minutes, then use a small spatula to remove the bacon from the wire rack. Put the bacon slices on a tray. Sugared bacon can be served warm or at room temperature."

Light the grill.,
Oil the grill grate.,
Place the bacon onto the cool side.,
Turn the bacon during cooking.,
Remove the bacon to a paper towel-lined plate.",How to Grill Bacon1," As with any sort of charcoal grilling, before you get started grilling your bacon, you'll need to get your charcoal to just the right heat for grilling. Before lighting them, however, make sure to offset the coals by piling them in one side of the grill, leaving the other coal-free. This will create a hot side of the grill and a cool side when the coals are lit. When you're ready, light the grill.


Note that if you aren't using match-light charcoal, this may require lighter fluid.
After lighting, leave the lid off and wait for the coals to burn to perfection. Coals are typically ready for grilling after they develop a grey, ashy exterior and emit a warm orange glow. This can take 20 minutes or longer.;
, When you're ready to cook your bacon, quickly paint the grill with a small amount of neutral vegetable oil. There are several ways to do this, but the easiest way is usually either by using a grill brush or by grabbing a bunched-up paper towel in a pair of tongs, dipping it in the oil, and quickly rubbing it across the grate. Because bacon is naturally quite fatty, you don't need much oil to prevent it from sticking to the grill during cooking.


If you don't have oil, you can probably get away with either quickly rubbing one fatty piece of bacon across the grate or else just ignoring this step entirely. Note, however, that some sticking may occur in this case.

, Using a pair of tongs to protect your hands, place the strips of bacon on the cool side of the grill (the side with no coals underneath). As the bacon cooks, the fat will naturally render and drip down into the grill. If you cook the bacon over the coals, this can lead to massive flare-ups as the bacon fat ignites.To avoid the danger of burns, fire, or burnt bacon, cook using only indirect heat. The bacon fat will still drip down into the grill, but since there are no coals underneath, flare-ups will be minimal.


Try to lay most or all of your bacon strips across the bars of the grate, rather than parallel to the bars. This makes it less likely for the thin bacon to slip through the cracks of the grill into the ashy area underneath.

, As the bacon cooks, it will naturally begin to shrink, darken, and toughen up. To ensure booth sides get thoroughly cooked, be sure to turn the bacon as it cooks, beginning about when these effects of cooking become visible on the bottom side of the bacon. Aim to turn the bacon at least every 5 minutes or so, replacing the lid of the grill between each turn.


Cooking times will vary widely depending on the temperature of the grill, the thickness of the bacon strips, and your preference for crispiness, so be sure to check the bacon often. The total cooking time should be no more than 20 minutes or so. If you prefer ""softer"" bacon, yours may be ready in as little as 7-10 minutes.
For other cuts of meat, there is a long-raging debate in the culinary community about whether excessive turning ruins the meat. This is a non-issue for bacon, which most agree benefits from a fair amount of turning., When the bacon is done, it should have an appearance ranging from red to dark brown (depending on how crispy you like it) and a delicious aroma. Remove the bacon from the grill strip-by-strip and place it onto a plate lined with several layers of paper towels. Allow the paper towels to absorb some of the excess fat, then serve the bacon as desired!


As with turning during cooking, bacon proves the exception to other meats in terms of allowing it to rest before serving. While many other cuts of meat are noticeably moister and more flavorful after resting for 10-15 minutes following cooking, bacon is ready to eat as soon as it's cool enough not to burn your mouth!

Add water to the drip tray.,
Allow the air fryer to cool.,
Wash the components of the fryer with hot, soapy water.,
Turn the air fryer back on to dry it.",How to Air Fry Bacon2," Since bacon is naturally fatty, grease will likely drip off of the bacon and onto the tray beneath the cooking basket. To prevent the grease from burning and making smoke, add a bit of water to the tray. This will help the grease cool.To minimize the amount of fat that drips from your bacon during cooking, dab individual pieces with paper towel before placing them in the cooking basket.
Smoke from fat and grease is white. If there is ever black smoke coming from your air fryer, turn it off. Once the machine has cooled, look inside the heating element compartment and clear any food that has gotten into it.

, Once you’re finished with the air fryer, turn it off. The machine may have a shut down process that allows the fan to continue running as it cools down. As such, don’t be alarmed if it’s still making noise, just check to ensure it is turned off. The fan will likely turn off after 20 to 30 seconds.Do not handle the air fryer until it has cooled down. Unplug the machine and remove the cooking basket and drawer.

, Be sure to wash the basket, the drawer that holds the basket, and the drip tray beneath the basket. Use a sponge or soft brush to avoid damaging the non-stick coating of the basket. Soaking these pieces in soapy water may make cleaning easier. These items are also likely top-rack dishwasher safe.Wipe down the surface of the machine with a damp clean cloth and spot clean any particular locations that need it.

, After cleaning and rinsing, plug the machine back in. Turn it on for two or three minutes. This will dry all of the components of the machine better than you could by hand. Don't forget to turn it off and unplug it after it has dried.Always store your air fryer in a clean, dry area.

Make bacon-topped meatloaf.,
Cook bacon-wrapped shrimp.,
Bake cheesy bacon croquettes.",How to Air Fry Bacon3," To make a meal that will yield several servings, first gather one pound of ground beef, ⅔ of a cup of bread crumbs, ¼ of a cup of ketchup, one teaspoon each of salt and pepper, one tablespoon of dried onion, one beaten egg, two strips of thin bacon, and barbecue sauce. Combine everything but the bacon and sauce in a mixing bowl and fashion into a loaf about as long as a dollar bill.After pre-heating, cooking the loaf for 20 minutes at 350ºF (177ºC). Remove the basket with the meatloaf still in it.
Cut the bacon into shorter strips and position them on top of the meatloaf. Brush barbecue sauce onto each and place everything back in the air fryer for 15 more minutes.
Ensure the meatloaf is finished before turning off the air fryer. If not, cook for five more minutes at a time until the meatloaf is fully cooked.

, For four servings, gather 16 pieces of peeled and deveined tiger shrimp and 16 slices of thinly sliced bacon. With the bacon at air temp, wrap each slice around its own piece of shrimp. Start at the head of the shrimp and wrap towards the tail. Refrigerate your beautiful meat sculptures for 20 minutes. Preheat your air fryer to 390°F (199°C) and cook your bacon-wrapped shrimp for 5-7 minutes.Allow your creations to cool and drain excess fluid on a paper towel before serving.

, For six servings, gather a pound of sharp cheddar, a pound of thinly sliced bacon, 4 tablespoons olive oil, 1 cup all-purpose flour, 2 beaten eggs, and 1 cup breadcrumbs. Cut the cheese into six portions and wrap each in two slices of bacon. The bacon should fully enclose the cheese.Place your creations in the freezer for five minutes to firm them up, but take care not to forget about them.
Preheat the air fryer to 390°F (199°C). Meanwhile, mix the breadcrumbs with the oil until even blended. Dip each cheesy bacon block into flour, then eggs, then the breadcrumb mixture, pressing to ensure adhesion.
Double dip, if you so desire, into the eggs and then the breadcrumbs. This will help prevent the cheese from escaping.
Cook the croquettes in the air fryer for 7-8 minutes or until they begin to brown.

Set the burners to ""low"".,
Place the bacon in a roasting pan.,
Cook the bacon with the lid closed.,
Serve as normal.",How to Grill Bacon2," Your goal when cooking bacon on a gas grill isn't to cook the bacon directly on the grill grate — if you do this, the fat, which renders and liquefies as the bacon cooks, can drip down onto the burners. This is even more of a problem here than it is for a charcoal grill because, in addition to causing flare-ups, dripping grease can get the burners or bottom of a gas grill dirty. To avoid this, we'll use a modified indirect cooking method that uses all of the burners (as opposed to the offset coal method above).


Begin by lighting most or all of the grill's burner's and closing the lid. Let the grill heat up for several minutes before beginning cooking.

, While you're waiting for the grill to warm up, lay your bacon strips over the grate in a roasting pan. This pan should consist of a metal grate that fits into a lower ""grease catcher"" with no holes in it. This allows the bacon to safely cook from the heat of the grill without dripping grease onto the bottom of the grill or burners.


As an added bonus, roasting pans make for easy cleanup — just pour the grease out of the lower pan, wash the pan and the grate, and you're done!

, Add your roasting pan full of bacon to the grill and shut the lid. This keeps the heat from the burners inside the grill, cooking the bacon from both above and below in a fashion similar to baking it. To keep your cooking time low, keep the lid shut during cooking except for when you check on the bacon's progress.


Don't forget to turn doing the cooking process — though it's not as essential here because the heat is coming from all sides, rather than just from below, it's still necessary for even cooking. You'll want to turn at least as it cooks — more is fine, but may lengthen the cooking time by allowing the grill's heat to escape. Keep a close eye on your bacon as it cooks — if it's cooking too quickly, flip it immediately and reduce the heat.

, Once the bacon is cooked on both sides to your liking, use a pair of tongs to remove it from the grill to a paper towel-lined plate. At this point, you're more or less done! Shut off your grill and, once it's cool enough to handle, carefully remove your roasting pan.

"
"
Use a sheet of aluminum foil for safety and ease of cleanup.,
Purchase thick-cut bacon.,
Season the bacon during cooking.,
Consider other barbecue recipes that use bacon.",How to Grill Bacon3," No matter whether you're using a gas or charcoal grill, aluminum foil is your friend in a pinch. It's easy to improvise a grilling pan from a single large sheet of aluminum foil — simply fold the sheet in half over itself (to give it added thickness), then fold the edges up an inch or so so that they'll hold in grease from the bacon's fat. Lay the bacon strips directly into this ""pan"" and turn as normal during the cooking process. When the bacon is done, remove it from the pan and into a paper towel-lined plate. Carefully remove and dispose of the foil once the grill has cooled.


Note that using an aluminum foil ""dish"" makes it less necessary to offset your coal pile in a charcoal grill. Since the rendered fat isn't falling directly into the grill unless the aluminum tears, you have the option to cook directly over the coals. Note, though, that this can give faster cooking times.

, When buying bacon specifically for grilling, look for the thickest cut you can find. Thick slices of bacon are easier to handle on the grill, as thinner slices pose a risk of breaking in half, falling through the grates, or burning onto them. This quality is especially important because grill cooking usually requires using a pair of tongs for handling the meat, which can make it difficult to keep a hold on to slippery pieces of uncooked bacon.

, Bacon is unique among meats in that it tastes perfectly delicious without any seasoning at all (beyond the ingredients used to cure it, of course). However, this doesn't mean you can't spice it up! By seasoning your bacon before cooking with your favorite ingredients or spices, you can give it delicious new flavor and increase its versatility in a huge variety of dishes. Here are just a few examples of seasonings that work well with bacon — simply sprinkle these directly on the bacon right before cooking:


RosemaryRed pepper flakes
Minced garlic
Cajun seasoning
Black pepper
Steak seasoning
Brown sugar

, Grilling bacon on its own is fine and dandy, but why stop there? Below are just a few basic barbecue dishes that use bacon or can easily be made to accommodate it — feel free to add bacon to any other dishes you know as well:Bacon-wrapped asparagus stalks

",How to Grill Halibut,"


Look for steaks that appear solid without a fishy smell, and keep in mind that thicker steaks take longer to grill.;
,


Halibut steaks go well with just about any herbs or spices, so you can season them as preferred. A tasty marinade can be easily made with lemon or lime juice, parsley, pepper, oil and other desired seasonings.

,


Grilled halibut turns out moist and tender when allowed to soak in marinade in the refrigerator for an hour prior to grilling. If you prefer not to use a marinade, baste each side of your halibut steaks with oil before you put them on the grill.

,


Vegetable, canola or olive oil are good choices for grilling halibut. Be sure to add more oil if the grill dries out before your halibut steaks are ready, especially if you choose not to use a marinade.

,


If your halibut steaks are thicker than 1 inch (2.5 cm), grill them up to 15 minutes on each side.

Turn on your grill and blast the heat.,
Clean the grill grate.",How to Grill Fish1," As you're heating up the grill, cover the grate loosely with aluminum foil. The intense heat will cause any debris to break down and dissolve, starting the cleaning process for you. This also minimizes sticking. At its highest heat, this should only take about 10-15 minutes.""Blasting the heat"" is another way of saying very, very hot. We're talking around 550°F (288°C) here.So, obviously, cover your grill while this process is going on. The heat will sear the fish initially, sealing it. If you throw it on a warm grill, it'll stick.
If you're using a charcoal grill, those babies need to be gray, not black.;
, If you used aluminum foil for the previous step, remove it now. Using a stiff-wired grill brush, scrape the grate clean. Fold a couple of sheets of paper towels into a small square or pad. Grasping the paper towels with tongs, dip the paper towels in oil (vegetable or olive) and rub over the bars of the grate.


Continue to wipe the grate with the oiled paper towels until the grate is somewhat glossy. Plan on doing this about 5 times. It's a good idea to re-dip the paper towels in oil for each application."

Make the bacon cups.,
Bake the bacon for 10-15 minutes.,
Carefully remove each cup from the foil.,
Fill each bacon cup with your choice of food.",How to Make Bacon Cups1,";
, To create the cups, you'll need to use the convex mounds of the base for molding. You need a muffin pan for large muffins.

, Cover and crimp the foil as you're laying it, so that it molds around the mound of each muffin space.

, The secret to making sure that this works effectively is to weave the bacon slices into place––don't simply slap the bacon slices on. To weave into place:


Make a plus sign, ""+"", or cross over the top of the first mound.
Wrap the sides once, and at the same time, weave the top portion in and out.
Lay the next slice on one side of the top slice.
Repeat the side weaving with another bacon slice with the new top piece.
Lay another slice on the other side on the top. This will then give you a fully-covered bottom cup.
Repeat the side weaving with another bacon slice, using the third top piece.

, You will need to monitor the bacon since the timings will differ on how crispy you want the cups to be.

, If the bacon sticks to the foil, carefully set the bottom of the bacon pieces in a large pan and move them around so that they loosen up. Wait until they are cooled down before removing them from the foil.Using the grease from the bacon during the pan cooking process makes it easier to separate it from the foil, rather than pre-greasing the pans prior to cooking. If you spray the pans beforehand, the cups may not hold their shape during the cooking process, thus risking more of a chance of the bacon moving around and shrinking.

, One idea is to make easy BLT filling for the cups.

Cook the fillets for three to four minutes.,
Flip the fillets and cook them for another three to four minutes.",How to Grill Catfish1," Look for four to six-ounce fillets that are light in color and firm to the touch. Avoid fillets with dark spots or discolorations. Fresh fillets should not have an overly fishy smell.


You can also buy a whole catfish, in which case you'll want to either ask the fishmonger to fillet it for you or filet it yourself at home before grilling.
If you want to grill frozen fillets, thaw them completely by storing them in the refrigerator overnight before the day you plan to cook them.;
, Melt a tablespoon or so of butter and use a pastry brush to coat the fillets on all sides. The melted butter will help the seasonings stick to the fish while it cooks.


If you'd prefer a lighter flavor, it's fine to use olive oil or another oil to coat the fish.
Skipping this step is also fine if you prefer the taste of plain grilled fillets with no extra fat.

, At minimum, sprinkle the fillets with salt and pepper on all sides. For extra flavor, you may want to add additional spices like cayenne, paprika or garlic powder. Catfish fillets have a light flavor that pairs well with most seasonings, so feel free to get creative.


Look for a seafood spice mix at your grocery store if you don't want to create your own mixture.
Or check out the third method for ideas for seasoning mixes that pair perfectly with catfish.

, Heat your outdoor grill to medium high (about 375°F to 425°F). Use a paper towel soaked in cooking oil to coat the metal grill rack with oil, so the delicate flesh of the fish won't stick. Let the grill heat completely before you start cooking the fish.


If you don't have a grill or grill pan, you can easily grill fish in a skillet on your stove. Heat a cast iron skillet or a frying pan to medium high, and coat the bottom of the pan lightly with oil.

, Arrange the fillets in an even layer so that they don't overlap.

, Leave them undisturbed while they cook, but monitor the flesh to see how things are progressing. The fillets are ready to flip when the fish no longer looks translucent., The fillets are ready when the flesh is white and flaky. Use a wide spatula to transfer the fish to a serving plate.

Select fresh fish.,
Clean the fish.,
Cut the fish into pieces.",How to Fry Fish1," Salt and pepper fish is only lightly battered, so the freshness of the fish really impacts the dish. Select fish filets that are firm, bright in color, free of bruises and spots, and not leaking liquid.









The fish should have a fresh saltwater smell that isn't too ""fishy."" If the smell makes you wrinkle your nose, the fish aren't fresh.
Make sure the fish you buy are boneless. You can test them by pressing your fingers on the flesh and feeling for small pin bones.;
, Run cool water over the fish fillets to rinse them clean. Remove any skin or scales that may still be clinging to the fish. Use a small pair of pliers to remove any stray pin bones.








, Salt and pepper fish is served in bite-sized pieces, rather than whole filets. Lay the filets on a cutting board and use a sharp butcher knife to cut them into bite-sized squares about 2 inches (5.1 cm) across.









Cutting the pieces too small will result in overcooked fish.

, Place as many slices of bacon as you want around the rim of the bowl. If you don't want the bacon sticking together, keep gaps between the pieces; otherwise, don't worry about it.








, Place the bacon-draped bowl into the microwave. Cook the bacon on the highest setting for about 90 seconds per slice. If you're cooking a full pound of bacon, it may take up to 15 minutes.









To avoid splattering the microwave with grease, you can lightly cover the bacon with a few paper towels.
Rotate the microwave plate at 10 minutes. This will ensure even cooking of the bacon. Or, if you don't like your bacon crisp, take it out at this point. Be careful! The plate is hot and the hot grease has dripped onto it.
Keep checking the crispness to see if it's to your liking.

, You may need to use an oven mitt, as the bowl and plate will be hot. Carefully take it from the microwave and put it down on a heat-safe surface. Use tongs to take the bacon slices off the bowl and lay them out flat on a paper towel.









If you let the bacon slices cool on the bowl, they will form a ""U"" shape for serving.
Be very careful not to spill the bacon grease as you remove the plate from the microwave.

, If you want, the grease can be saved for cooking. Either pour the grease into a storage container straight from the plate, or place it in the fridge (as shown here) and allow it to harden with cooling and scrape off. It makes fried eggs very tasty!

If you do opt for a delicate fish, you'll be better of with putting it in aluminum foil or using a grilling basket -- or else you risk your meat falling through the grill to the flames.

Of course, there's always the option of taking a whole fish and filleting it yourself.




, Not only will it be easier to manage on the grill but you can ensure the fish cooks up evenly -- the skinnier tail end doesn't need to cook as long as the thicker part of the fillet. Cut your fish into portions that have an even thickness to ensure you don't have dry parts and/or undercooked parts all on one portion.

, If you have a marinade you've been dying to try, go for it. Just make sure to keep the fish in the marinade for no longer than 30 minutes -- both salty or sugary marinades have a negative effect on taste if left on too long.


However, all fish really needs is a coating of olive or coconut oil and some salt and pepper. The art is in the grilling -- just make sure you lather up both sides evenly.

, This not only creates those masterful grill marks you see in restaurants, it actually makes it easier to flip the fish because it's on an angle.The general rule is a fish will take 8 minutes to cook through per inch of thickness, which means about 3 to 5 minutes per side.Reduce the heat to medium, cover the grill, and let cook! Don't try to move the fish until you see that the skin side has a nice sear and looks crisp -- if you do, you risk it falling apart. If you're not sure when to check the fish to see this, try gently lifting with a fine-edged spatula after a few minutes. If it doesn't lift off the grate easily, let it cook a bit longer and check at 20-second intervals until it does., Okay, so the fish is lifting off the grate and has the right color on the bottom. Time to flip. First, you need the right tool. A wide spatula with a thin, tapered edge does the job nicely by being able to slide easily under the fish and also large enough to support the whole fillet while you flip it. To make your life even easier, pair it with a flexible turner which can help hold the fish in place while the larger spatula slides underneath.


While attempting the turn, if you feel too much resistance, just stop and walk away. If you've properly cleaned and oiled the grate, the fish will let you know when it's ready to turn by releasing itself from the grate., When cooked properly, the meat will be firm to the touch, flake easily with a fork, and appear opaque all the way through.


Take a fork and gently pull back a flaky section in the center. If the fish is opaque with just a bit of translucent center, it's ready to come off. If using an instant read thermometer, the fish should be pulled when it registers between 130-135°F (54-57°C), letting it carry over to 140°F (60°C) while it rests."

Get a whole, fresh fish from your local market or grocery store.,
Make slashes into the meat (otherwise known as scoring).,
Season the inside cavity.,
Coat the fish with oil.,
Heat the grill to medium-high heat.,
Place on and wait.,
Flip the fish.,
Test for doneness.",How to Grill Fish3," Look for shiny scales, clear eyes and bright red gills. The fisherman among us, or those who don’t mind a little extra work, might enjoy cleaning, gutting and scaling the fish themselves. The rest of us should ask to have it done at the fish counter so when we get home, the fish is ready to go.


A whole fish is much harder to overcook than a small fillet; the skin protects the delicate flesh from heat and keeps the moisture in. The bones add a little extra flavor, too. Throwing the fish over direct heat on a grill is a fast and easy cooking method that gives you moist, tender flesh, and crispy, salty skin every time., Cut deep slits spaced 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm) apart along each side of the fish. Make at least 3-5 slashes in the meat perpendicular to the backbone on each side of the fish. You are doing this to open the interior of the fish to the heat, so it will cook evenly.


Make more slashes closer to the head, where the fish is thicker, than toward the tail, which cooks first. Snip off any sharp fins with kitchen shears or scissors., Sprinkle on a light coating of salt and pepper. There isn’t a whole lot of room to stuff smaller fish, but at the very least you can add few slices of lemon and sprigs of your favorite herb. Other seasoning combinations to try:Minced garlic with rosemary
Orange slices and paprika
Lime slices and cumin
Sliced green onion and tamari
Sliced red onion and basil
Minced garlic mashed with butter

, Olive or coconut work nicely. The grates of your grill should already be oiled down, but your fish will need it too, especially to prevent sticking.

, Wait until the grates are nice and hot before setting the fish down. If you don't, it'll stick. Steady, medium heat is best, otherwise the skin will burn before the fish is done. If possible, set the tail farthest away from the flames, as the skinnier, tail-end of the fish cooks faster than the rest., The crucial step is what you do after you place the fish on the hot grill: You wait. Fight the impulse to mess with the fish and move it around -- you'll rip the skin, lose some flesh, and throw off the cooking. Instead, stand there for 3-4 minutes. The fish is ready to be flipped when the skin no longer sticks to the grill.Generally, a fish that weighs 1/2 to 1 pound (.22 to .45 kg) will take about 5 to 7 minutes per side. Larger fish, 1 1/2 to 2 pounds (.7 to .9 kg), can take around twice that amount of time. Another general guideline for whole fish is 10 minutes of cooking per side, per inch of thickness., To turn the fish, have your tongs in your “off” hand and a big spatula (oiled on both sides) in your good hand. Gently turn the fish over. It should come off the grates cleanly. If not, don’t force it. Let the fish back down and come back at it with the spatula, using pressure to pry it off the grates. You don’t want to pull the fish away from the grates and have half the skin and meat stick to the grill. Once the fish is flipped, let it cook for another 5-6 minutes.If the skin does stick to the grill, which is hard to avoid entirely, don’t sweat it. The presentation might not be quite as pretty, but the fish will still taste just as good.

, Insert a thin skewer or toothpick into the thickest part of the fish. It should slide all the way in easily. When fish is cooked the meat will flake easily with a fork and will appear opaque all the way through. The flesh should also pull easily away from the bones.Place on a platter with a few garnishes and enjoy!

Lay the fish on the grill.,
Cook it for seven to ten minutes on the first side.,
Flip the fish and cook for another seven to ten minutes.",How to Grill Catfish2," Whether you caught them yourself or you're buying them from a fish market, make sure the fish you want to grill have clear eyes and undamaged skin. Grilled whole fish should be fresh, not frozen, for best results.


If you're buying the catfish from a fish market, have the fishmonger clean and skin the fish for you.
If you caught your own fish, you'll need to clean and skin it on your own.

, For whole grilled catfish, seasoning plays more than one role. Seasoning the inside and the outside of the catfish is meant to both flavor the meat and keep it moist while it grills. Mix up the following ingredients (double if you're grilling two catfish):


1 tablespoon melted butter
1 tablespoon lemon juice
Salt and pepper

, Coat the inside cavity of the fish with the mixture, and rub it into the outside as well. Make sure every part of the fish is coated so it won't dry out as it cooks.

, Heat your outdoor grill to medium high (about 375°F to 425°F). Use a paper towel soaked in cooking oil to coat the metal grill rack with oil, so the delicate flesh of the fish won't stick. Let the grill heat completely before you start cooking the fish.


When you're cooking a whole fish, it's important to cook it low and slow. Otherwise, you'll end up with a fish that's burned on the outside and raw on the inside. Make sure the grill never gets too hot while you cook.

, Instead of placing it directly over the hottest coals, place it on a part of the grill that doesn't get direct heat. This will prevent the fish from burning.

, The larger the fish, the longer it will need to cook. It's ready to flip when the underside of the flesh is firm with a set of dark grill marks.

, The fish is ready to eat when the flesh easily flakes apart when poked with a fork. It should be completely opaque and hot through to the middle."

Prepare the fish for filleting.",How to Fillet a Fish1," You can buy a filleting knife that is designed for the specific purpose of filleting fish; these work quite well. However, if you aren't in the market for a brand new knife, find one with a long, thin, and quite sharp blade. This will enable you to cleanly cut the fish's meat away from the bones.









Don't use a serrated knife to fillet a fish; it will shred the delicate meat.
Sharpen your knife's blade before getting to work.;
, Filleting a fish can be rather messy, so it's good to set up a workspace ahead of time. You'll need a large cutting board. You can line it with newspaper or butcher paper for easy clean up. Set out a clean plate for the fillets.

, Continue the cut all the way to the throat.

,, The cut will be toward the head. Continue the cut so the head can be removed.

,,,,, Take your knife and insert it behind the ribs along the base of the backbone. Gently work the knife toward the other end of the ribs (toward the outside). Make sure you cut as close to the ribs as possible so you salvage as much meat as you can. You should be able to see the blade of your knife at all times as you go through this process. Work your way all the way down as far as the ribs go.

, Continue this careful nature as you cut all the way back to the tail.

, Again, when you get to the tail at the bottom, keep your knife as tight to it as you can.

, You need to do this the entire length of both sides of the fish. You will know you are doing it right if you the sound of the small pin bones being cut can be heard. If you hear this, you are on the right track!

, Right now you should have 2 fillets lying on the table on either side of the middle column. If you have cutters available to remove the center from the rest of the fish, that works great. Often you can break the center piece off with your hands.

, Gently run the tip of your knife along the fillet to locate them. You can get rid of these bones by cutting out the part of the fillet where they are present. Another trick is to use some pliers to grab and pull them out. The good news is, there is not an abundance of them. You can still cook and enjoy trout even with these small pin bones present. In fact, on small trout, these small bones can be eaten as they become soft and barely noticeable.

Marinate the catfish in buttermilk.,
Dredge the fillets in breading mixture.,
Heat oil in a large skillet.,
Fry fillets for 3-5 minutes per side.,
Allow to drain and cool.",How to Fry Catfish1," Catfish can sometimes have an unappealing ""muddy"" taste if it's not prepared correctly. Luckily, marinating the catfish helps solve this problem. Remove the catfish fillets from their packaging. Rinse each fillet in water, then pat them dry with paper towels. Put the catfish in a cooking dish, an airtight plastic container, or zip-lock bag. Cover them with buttermilk and hot sauce, plus a few generous pinches of salt and pepper. Mix well and let the catfish marinate in the fridge.


The exact amount of marinating time varies from recipe to recipe. Most recommend at least 1-2 hours.Some even recommend 24 hours or more.;
, Mix the cornmeal, flour, onion powder, and garlic powder in a large bowl. Remove the catfish fillets from the fridge and allow them to sit at room temperature for about 10 minutes. Shake off the excess moisture, then sprinkle each fillet with a pinch of salt. Coat the fillets with the cornmeal mixture on all sides. Place each breaded fillet on a clean platter.

, Set a thick, steep-sided frying pan on the stove over medium-high heat. Cast iron pans are best but any sturdy frying pan will do. Add oil to the skillet to a depth of 1 1/2 inches.When the oil reaches a temperature of 350o (176.6o C), or just barely starts smoking, you're ready to cook.


For best results, use an oil with a high smoke point, like peanut oil, vegetable oil, or canola oil. Oils with low smoke points, like olive oil, will start smoking at lower temperatures and will produce more smoke overall., Add the fillets to the hot oil carefully with a pair of tongs. You may want to use an oven mitt for this — the oil may pop and sizzle unpredictably. Lay the fillets away from you (never towards you) to minimize the oil that can splash back at you.


Flip the fillets when they reach a pleasant golden-brown color on the lower side. This will usually take about 3-5 minutes.
Cook the fillets in batches, making sure there is at least a little space between each fillet. Crowding the pan will cause uneven cooking.

, When catfish is cooked all the way through, it will be completely opaque on the inside. There shouldn't be a translucent or gel-like uncooked spot in the middle.As each fillet finishes cooking, transfer it to a wire rack over a layer of paper towels. This allows the hot oil to drain and the fish to cool. Add new fillets to the pan as the first batch finish cooking.


If you can avoid it, try not to pile catfish fillets in a stack over a paper towel-lined plate like you'd do with bacon. The moisture and steam from the stacked fillets can ruin their deliciously crisp texture, giving you a soggy product.

Mix your dry ingredients to make a spice rub.,
Dip fillets in melted butter.,
Coat the fillets with the dry rub.,
Heat skillet over high heat.,
Sear quickly over high heat, turning after a few minutes.,
Serve straight out of the pan when finished.",How to Fry Catfish2," In a small bowl, mix together paprika, lemon pepper, garlic powder, dried basil, onion powder, and thyme. To this, add salt and pepper as desired to give a good taste — a teaspoon or two of each should be plenty.

, In a microwave or a small saucepan, melt the butter until completely liquid. Let the butter sit until it is still liquid but cool enough to handle safely. Carefully dip each fillet in the melted butter, letting the excess moisture drip off. Transfer the buttered fillets to a clean platter.

, Using about a tablespoon of dry rub per fillet, coat the buttered catfish with the rub all over. Apply the rub generously — if you have any extra, feel free to sprinkle it over the rest of the fish.

, This frying method doesn't use any cooking fat beyond the little butter you have handy. This gives the fish a distinctly different texture than you'd get if you breaded and fried it in a fe,w inches of oil — it will have a thin, flavorful, almost ""burnt"" exterior. For this reason, you'll want to heat the skillet on the stove without oil for about 10 minutes.


The pan will be very hot at this point, so use all necessary caution. If the pan has a metal handle, use a towel or oven mitt to handle it.
Again, cast iron pans are best for their ability to retain heat, but any thick frying pan will work.

, As soon as you add the fish to the pan, it should start sizzling immediately. The heat may cause it to stick to the pan. This is OK. The meat should cook very quickly in the hot pan. After about two or three minutes, the fish should be flaking easily. Flip it over, scraping the blackened material off of the bottom of the pan and cook the other side until it is similarly cooked.


Drizzle a little butter on the upper side of each fillet as it cooks. This will provide a little extra lubrication when you flip the meat, helping to prevent sticking.
Again, it's alright if the fish sticks to the pan a little. Scrape it off of the pan and keep going. The blackened texture that will result from this is exactly what you're going for with this recipe.

, Once the meat is opaque all the way through and flakes easily, it's ready to eat. Transfer the fillets from the pan directly to each plate and serve immediately.


The key here is to cook the meat very quickly at this high heat. You want to cook the meat long enough to turn the dry rub into a delicious blackened crust, but cooking for too long can give you a dry, flavorless piece of meat. Mastering this can take practice.

",How to Make Flower Garnishes for Desserts," There are many books and websites that provide lists of flowers and plants that are safe to eat. Be sure to get information from more than one source. Some flowers are poisonous to humans and can cause serious illness.;
, Usually only part of the flower, like the petals or stamen, is edible.

, Flowers treated with pesticides or herbicides should never be eaten. Flowers from garden centers, nurseries, and florists could be treated with chemicals. Flowers from public gardens or picked from the side of the road could also be contaminated. Use only flowers that you grow yourself, or that are grown by natural, organic farms.

, Flowers that have a sweet flavor include carnations, dandelions and cornflowers. Angelica, clover and anise have a licorice flavor. Other popular dessert garnishes are violets, mint and lavender.

, Delicate and attractive edible flowers can be used for this. Geraniums, roses, marigolds, pansies and violets are popular choices. To make, whisk eggs whites and brush them onto the flowers. Cover the flowers with sugar. Let them flowers stand overnight. They can be used immediately or stored in containers at room temperature for 2 to 3 months.

, Cherries, grapes, strawberries and other fruits can be used. Cut slits almost all the way through the fruit to make petal shapes. Pull them apart, and press onto baked goods or puddings.

, Melt chocolate or candy melts over a low flame. Pour into flower shaped candy molds. Allow to cool. Remove from the mold and place on top of the dessert.

, Melt 16 ounces of semi-sweet chocolate chips. Stir in 2/3 cup light corn syrup. Dust a work surface with cocoa powder. Knead the chocolate clay. Separate and roll into small cylinders. Cut small circles to use as petals, and cut leaves with a knife. Assemble the flowers, and then fan out and shape the petals.

, Fondant, sugar paste, and edible rice paper are all popular and easy to work with. They can be cut with cookie cutters or shaped with molds.

, These include tubes, tips and other supplies that can make a variety of shapes and decorations from royal or butter cream icing. Most come with instruction manuals to learn how to make flower garnishes for desserts. Roses are a popular icing creation, but other flowers can be created too.

, Add your water and sugar to a saucepan. Do not stir your mixture. You do not want crystals to form in the mixture from the sugar. Take the handle of the saucepan and gently swirl the mixture to stir it. Place it over medium heat. Let it start to boil. Continue to swirl the mixture as the mixture turns into syrup.


Not stirring the mixture helps give you a thinner, less granulated syrup. Crystals can form in the mixture if you stir it instead of swirling the pan.

, Once it starts to thicken, add the salt and cardamon. Grab the handle and swirl the mixture to combine those into the syrup. Once those are combined, add your food coloring. Put the food coloring gel on the end of a teaspoon and lightly swirl it around the top of the syrup mixture. Make sure you get it all off the spoon. Swirl the syrup again the mix in the coloring.


You can add more coloring if you want a darker color sweet as your final product.
The food coloring is not necessary, but it adds a nice, playful color to your sweets.
Traditional colors for these treats are blue and pink, but you can use any color you like.

, As you are waiting for the syrup to cook, grab a baking dish. Lightly grease the bottom of the pan. Set it on the counter beside you.


You can use a long baking pan to make your sweets thinner. You can also use a shorter loaf pan if you want thicker pieces.

, Once you notice your mixture thickening, you need to check the consistency. Take a teaspoon and dip it in the mixture. Dab your pointer finger in the syrup on the end of the spoon. Press your thumb and pointer finger together. If the syrup is sticky but doesn't make strings between your fingers, it needs to cook more. If your the syrup strings between your fingers, it is ready.


Make sure you don't stick your finger directly into the pan. The syrup will be very hot.

, Once your syrup is the right consistency, pour the coconut into the pan. Take a wooden spoon and stir the mixture together immediately. The coconut will soak in the syrup as you continue to stir the mixture over the heat. Continue to stir until the moisture has disappeared and the coconut pulls away from the sides of the pan. This may take a few minutes.


If the mixture is a little wet, turn the pan up to medium high heat to help dry out the extra syrup.
If you see the mixture turning slightly brown, you need to remove it from heat. The syrup is starting to caramelize.

, Once the mixture is dry enough, pour it into the prepared baking pan. Spread it out with the wooden spoon to make an even layer. Make sure your spread it all the way to the corners of the pan. Let it sit for at least 5-8 minutes to cool.

, Once the sweets are cooled, you can cut them into any shape you want. Instead of using a sharp knife, use the flat, non-serrated side of a butter knife. The serrations will rip apart the sweets. Once they are cut, serve and enjoy.


Try not to make too many back and forth motions when you cut the sweets. This will cause them to fall apart.
If the edges start to merge back together, the sweets are not cooled enough. Let them set for a while longer before you cut."

Know which types of cabbage to use this method with.,
Cut off the stem of the cabbage head.,
Slice the cabbage in half lengthwise.,
Make another lengthwise cut in each half.,
Cut a triangular piece out of the bottom of each wedge.,
Prepare the remaining cabbage as desired.",How to Core a Cabbage1," This method should be used with round heads of cabbage, the most common being green cabbage, red (or purple) cabbage, and savoy cabbage.









Note that there are some similarities between this method and the standard method used for cutting long cabbages, but there are a few small difference, as well.;
, Use a sharp kitchen knife to trim off any portion of the stem that extends below the bottom of the cabbage head.









If you are using a wooden or plastic cutting board, stabilize it by placing a dry dish towel underneath.This prevents the board from slipping around as you cut the cabbage. It is not usually necessary if you have a non-slip cutting mat, though.

, Cut the cabbage in half from top to bottom, slicing it straight through the stem or core end.









Hold the cabbage steady with your non-dominant hand and cut with your dominant hand.
Cut carefully so that you do not accidentally slip and cut yourself while working with the cabbage.

, Turn each half so that it sits cut-side down. Cut each half in half again, cutting through the core once more, essentially dividing the head into quarters.









Since the cut-side is flat, it will be easier to hold the cabbage still with that side facing the surface.
Once you cut the cabbage into quarters, though, the quarters will need to be flipped over so that the cut-sides face up, thereby exposing the core.

, With the cut sides facing up, you should be able to see the core at this time. Make an angled cut on either side of the core to remove it from each quarter.









At this point, you should also peel off any tough or wilted outer leaves.
This is also the point in time at which you should rinse the cabbage under cool, running water.

, From this point on, the cabbage can be shredded, cut into smaller wedges, separated into layers, or used in a variety of other ways for a wide range of hot and cold recipes.

Cut the cabbage in half lengthwise.,
Slice out the core.,
Use the remaining cabbage as desired.",How to Core a Cabbage2," This method should be used with long, narrow heads of cabbage. The most common type would be napa cabbage.









Note that there are some similarities between this method and the standard method used for cutting round cabbages, but there are a few small difference, as well.

, Use a sharp knife to cut the cabbage head from top to bottom, cutting straight through the core end.









You will end up cutting the core and stem in half during this step.
Note that you do not need to trim the stem before cutting the cabbage in half.
Hold the cabbage steady with your non-dominant hand and cut with your dominant hand.
Cut carefully so that you do not accidentally slip and cut yourself while working with the cabbage.
Stabilize the cutting board by placing a dry dish towel underneath. This may not be necessary if you have a non-slip cutting mat, however.

, Keep the cut sides facing up. The core should be fairly easy to spot. Make an angled slice around each side of the core. Cut straight through to the bottom so that you can lift the core out afterward.









At this point, you should also peel off any wilted outer leaves.
Rinse the cabbage under cool, running water to clean it, as well.

, From this point on, the cabbage can be shredded, cut into smaller wedges, separated into layers, or used in a variety of other ways for a wide range of hot and cold recipes.

Know what types of cabbage to use this method with.,
Boil a large stockpot of water.,
Remove any damaged leaves.,
Trim the stem.,
Stick a fork into the core.,
Cut around the core.,
Dunk the cabbage into the boiling water.,
Cut into the core at an angle.,
Use the remaining cabbage as desired.",How to Core a Cabbage3," This method should be used with round cabbage varieties, including savoy cabbage, green cabbage, and red (purple) cabbage.









You could try this method with a long cabbage variety, like napa cabbage, but you may not have much success. Long varieties of cabbage tend to have looser leaves, and you may lose too many of the inner leaves while trying to remove the core via boiling, as called for in this method.

, Fill a stockpot 2/3 full with water. Bring it to a boil over medium-high heat on the stove.









If you want to help add flavor to the cabbage, you can add up to 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of salt to the water after it reaches a boil.

, Peel off any torn, damaged, or wilting leaves before proceeding to core the head of cabbage.









Most of the outer leaves will drop off once you dunk the cabbage in the boiling water. Since the good leaves can be preserved, however, it is still advisable that you separate the bad leaves ahead of time.

, Use a sharp kitchen knife to trim off any portion of the stem that extends below the bottom of the cabbage head.









Hold the cabbage steady with your non-dominant hand and cut with your dominant hand.

, Apply firm pressure so that you can shove the prongs of a metal fork as deep into the center of the core as possible.


Ideally, the fork will be inserted so far that the individual prongs will be just barely visible from the outside of the cabbage. A good portion of the fork needs to be stuck inside. To test whether or not enough has been inserted, try lifting the cabbage with nothing but the fork. If it does not drop off or show signs of doing so, you have inserted enough of the fork into the core.

, Use a smooth knife to cut a circular incision around the core of the cabbage head.









Hold the fork with your non-dominant hand and cut with your dominant hand.
Cut carefully, especially as you turn the knife toward the hand holding the fork. Being careful can help prevent you from accidentally cutting yourself while working with the cabbage.
If you want to skip the boiling part altogether, try cutting into the core at an angled circle, with the knife tip facing inward toward the center of the cabbage.
If you plan to follow through with the boiling steps, however, cut a vertically straight circle all the way around the core.

, If you were unable to remove the core, dip the head of cabbage into the boiling water and let it cook for a few minutes, just until it begins to soften.


Work carefully to avoid burning yourself with the boiling water or the hot steam.
After about 5 minutes, the outer leaves should start falling off. This is when you can remove the cabbage from the boiling water.

, Use a narrow, smooth knife to cut into the circular incision, this time going in at an angle. The core should be easier to remove at this point now that it has been softened.









The tip of the knife should point toward the center of the cabbage as you work around the core.

, Since this method is a little more involved and more difficult than the standard method, it is generally only used for recipes that require a whole head of cabbage, such as stuffed whole cabbage.


This method is also ideal when you want to cook the core whole, since the other methods require you to cut the core into sections before removing it.

Cook the turnip greens with other greens for a more varied flavor.Try a combination of turnip greens, collard greens, and mustard greens.",How to Cook Turnip Greens," Rinse the turnip greens under cold, running water, scrubbing them gently with your fingers.


Drain the leaves by drying them in a salad spinner, patting them dry with clean paper towels, or spreading them out on clean paper towels and allowing them to air dry.
You could also clean the greens by allowing them to soak in a clean bowl or sink of cold water for several minutes to loosen the dirt. Quickly rinse with running water before draining.;
, Cut the stems off at the base of each leaf using a sharp knife.


Examine the leaves as you work. If there are any bruised or wilted leaves, toss them out.

, Use your fingers to tear the leaves into small pieces.


Each piece should be about 1/2 inch (1.27 cm).
You should have roughly 12 cups (3 liters) of torn turnip greens.
If desired, you can also give the turnip greens a rough chop with a sharp knife instead of tearing them apart by hand.

,


Let the turnip greens sit for at least 5 minutes. The lemon juice helps to activate the myrosinase enzymes in the greens and increase the formation of isothiocyanates. In short, the lemon juice prevents the greens from wilting while increasing their nutritional benefits.

, Fill the Dutch oven halfway with water and add a pinch of salt. Bring the water to a boil over medium-high to high heat.


A 5-quart to 6-quart (5-liter to 6-liter) Dutch oven is recommended. Anything less might be too small, but anything much larger may lead to an unnecessarily long cooking time.
If you do not have a Dutch oven, you can use a heavy metal stock pot, instead.

, Add the greens to the boiling water and cover the Dutch oven. Cook the turnip greens for 20 to 25 minutes, or until the greens are tender.Many cooks prefer to extend the cooking time by reducing the heat to medium or medium-low. Once the water slows to a simmer, cook the turnip greens for 45 to 60 minutes.

, Pour the contents of the Dutch oven through a colander to drain the water.


Lightly press the remaining turnip leaves with your hands or the back of a wooden spoon while still inside the colander. Doing so squeezes excess liquid out of the leaves.

, Transfer the turnip greens to a large bowl and add the butter, salt, and pepper. Toss the greens with the new ingredients to flavor them.


If desired, you can use olive oil instead of butter for a healthier alternative.
The salt and pepper should be added according to your personal tastes. If you are uncertain about how much to use, start with roughly 1 tsp (5 ml) salt and 1 tsp (5 ml) black pepper. Toss, taste, and add more as desired.

, Transfer the turnip greens to individual plates and serve.

, The greens will absorb the broth, and the broth will add more flavor to the greens.

,


Use roughly 1 cup (250 ml) of salt pork, ham, or bacon to the cooking liquid. Brown the meat and add it, along with any pan drippings, to the greens as they begin to cook.
You can also add 1 medium chopped onion and up to 1/2 tsp (2.5 ml) granulated sugar.

, Instead of cooking the greens in boiling water, sauté them in 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of olive oil until tender.This could take 5 to 15 minutes, depending on how wilted you prefer the greens to be.
Instead of using olive oil, you could use bacon grease to add more flavor.
Turnip greens will be crisper if prepared this way and will retain more of their bright green color.

, Flavored vinegars and vinaigrette dressings are especially common choices.


Balsamic vinegar and cider vinegar both have sweet undertones but add a complimentary tart taste to the greens. Vinaigrette dressings, like raspberry vinaigrette or balsamic vinaigrette, are a little less tart and a little more sweet, but compliment the taste of the greens in a similar manner.
Drizzle soy sauce or Teriyaki over the greens for an Asian-inspired flavor. Top with slivered almonds or crunchy chow mein noodles.

, This works especially well if you sauté the greens.

Purchase any kind of fruit you and your family like.,
Find a ""holder"" for the fruit.,
Consider the size, shape, and color of the fruits you'll be using.,
Arrange the fruit display accordingly.,
Add finishing touches.,
Find the perfect spot!",How to Display Fruit," Consider both appearance and function. Use fruits that are both attractive to you and appealing to your taste or diet. Look for multipurpose fruits, meaning fruits you can use in various recipes or just on their own. Though it may be tempting, avoid purchasing fruit only for its looks––while some fruit is beautiful, it loses value in your ""functional"" display if you'll never touch it.;
, It is best to display fruit on or in some sort of ""holder."" You can use a plate, a bowl, a basket, or anything else that will hold your fruit arrangement in place. Get creative––there are countless holder possibilities for fruit. Keep in mind the size when selecting a container––the holder needs to be able to contain all of the fruit in your display and keep the fruit in place without squashing or bruising it. Holder possibilities include:


Bowls suitable for food
Glassware created for holding food, such as a glass cake stand or a sweets dish
Basket-ware
Metallic bowls, containers or dishes; just be sure that any finishes/glazes/metallic types are food-safe
Purpose-made fruit hangers, etc.

, When displaying fruit, keep in mind the minute details of all of the fruits. Do they fit together properly? Do the colors complement each other? Do their sizes balance out? You can answer all of these questions visually, as you put the display in place. Pair the fruits together and determine which complement each other best. Once you decide where each fruit looks most attractive, put the whole arrangement together.


Making a digital chart (perhaps using digital photos) can help you to remember which combinations look best together, making it easier to quickly put together future displays.

, Put the complementary fruits next to each other. Think of the whole display as a puzzle, with each fruit an important piece to fit in place. Make adjustments as you go––the finished product should look appealing and attractive to you.

, Small details can spice up your display. Adding a small garnish or ornament such as a fig leaf, a bundle of cinnamon sticks or a large bow tied around the container might work well, just as long as whatever you add won't be mistaken as something edible. (This step is optional; you may find that adding more items is unnecessary and makes it harder to remove the fruit for eating.)

, Place the completed fruit display in an appropriate place in the kitchen or other eating space. Find a spot in your kitchen, dining room or other place where the display would look most appealing. It is best if it is a place that makes your fruit easily accessible in case you should decide to eat some!

Wait for dry, sunny weather.,
Choose a drying tray.,
Arrange your prepped vegetables.,
Place your tray in the sun.,
Protect your veggies from insects.,
Flip your vegetables.,
Test their dryness.,
Bring the tray inside at sunset.",How to Dehydrate Vegetables1," Check the forecast before purchasing or harvesting fresh vegetables. Wait for a two-day stretch with clear skies, low humidity, and temperatures near, at, or above 100 degrees Fahrenheit.If no such conditions are likely, use an alternate form of drying. Avoid ruining your vegetables with mold due to the presence of excess moisture., Just about any clean food tray (such as a cookie sheet, roasting pan, cutting board, or similar kitchen item) will suffice.But to further reduce the risk of spoilage, use a perforated surface (like a cooling rack or a plastic screen) to allow more air circulation from underneath.If using a plastic screen or a cooling rack without legs of its own, improvise a frame for it to rest on. Arrange pieces of wood, rocks, or any other solid objects of an even height to elevate the tray.

, First, line your tray with paper or cheesecloth to absorb moisture as it leeches out of your veggies. Then place your vegetables on the tray. Arrange each piece so that it does not touch any others, which will allow more air circulation and quicken the drying process., Set it where it will receive constant sunlight all day long. If no such area exists, reposition your tray over the course of the day to keep it out of the shade. To quicken the drying process, place your tray on a level surface that reflects heat (like concrete, asphalt, or even your roof). Heat your tray from underneath as well as from above., If you anticipate an insect problem, cover your tray with cheesecloth. Keep the cloth from making direct contact with your vegetables so that it doesn’t stick to them when you remove it later on.If the rims of your tray are too low, use an appropriately sized cardboard box to create a frame for your cover:


Choose a box large enough to fit your tray inside. Use a utility blade to slice off the top flaps. If necessary, trim the sides down until they will only be about an inch higher than the tray inside. Drape cheesecloth over the top. Staple one end to a side of the box, pull the cloth taut over the top, and staple the other end. Now slice off the bottom flaps so you can place your cover over the tray.

, Uncover the tray and turn each piece over every three hours. Ensure that each side dries evenly.If needed, replace the tray’s lining so your vegetables do not sit in excess moisture.


Some vegetables may dry thoroughly after six hours, so use the three-hour rule to ensure that both sides get equal time in the sun.

, When you flip your vegetables, check for signs of moisture by pushing your finger into the flesh. Or pick up a slice and gently try to bend it. If it bends without resistance, it still retains moisture. If it feels brittle enough to snap in two, it has dried out., If your veggies haven’t dried out in one day, keep them safe from dew and other moisture that might saturate them overnight. Relocate the tray to a warm, dry area indoors. As long as tomorrow’s weather promises to be warm, sunny, and dry, set the tray outside again in the morning.If a change in weather prevents you from finishing sun-drying your veggies, finish the process in your oven.

Immediately transfer the spinach over to a separate stockpot filled with ice water.,
Drain the spinach once more.",How to Cook Spinach2," Select a stockpot with a 6-quart (6-liter) capacity or more. The leaves should only reach the mid-point of the pot and should not rise much higher.








, Fill the stockpot with enough water to just cover the leaves. Make sure that there is at least 2 to 3 inches (5 to 7.6 centimeters) of empty space in between the top of the water and the top rim of the pot to prevent the water from boiling over.








, Use around 1 to 2 teaspoons (4.8 to 9.5 grams) of salt. You want just enough salt to draw out the flavor of the spinach, but not so much salt that it dominates over the taste of the spinach.








, Once it begins to steam, start timing it. Boil the spinach for 3 to 5 minutes.








, Shake the drainer to remove any excess water.








, Allow it to sit in the ice water for 30 seconds to 1 minute. The ice water ""shocks"" the spinach, preventing it from losing its bright green color.

Preheat your oven.,
Arrange your prepped vegetables.,
Place your tray inside the oven.,
Rearrange your vegetables.,
Check for dryness.",How to Dehydrate Vegetables2," Set the temperature between 120 and 140 degrees Fahrenheit. To dry vegetables faster, preheat the oven to 200 degrees. However, if you do so, lower the heat between 120 and 140 after the first hour of drying.Prolonged exposure to higher temperatures at 200 or higher will cause the vegetables to cook, rather than dry., Use an oven-safe stainless steel mesh screen as a drying tray so air can circulate underneath your veggies. Spread them so that no pieces touch each other, which will also improve air circulation. If you are filling more than one tray, do so with equal portions, so that each tray dries evenly.If you use a cookie sheet instead of a mesh screen, be sure to line it with baking paper before arranging your vegetables.

, If using a mesh screen as a tray, consider placing a sheet of aluminum foil on the rack below to catch any moisture that may drip. Keep the oven door open by at least a 3-inch crack. Allow the moisture from the vegetables to escape, as well as any excess heat, so that your oven maintains an even temperature of 140 degrees and no higher.Keep an eye on any pets or small children during this process.

, If using a cookie sheet, flip your veggies over so both sides are evenly dried. Reverse the placement of your tray if your oven doesn’t heat up evenly. If drying more than one tray, rotate their positions.Do so every two hours, since some vegetables may dry in as little as three to four.

, Remove a piece from the tray and let it cool. Push your finger into the flesh to see if any juices come out. Gently try to bend it to see if it is too tough or brittle to do so. Return the piece to the oven if it bends without snapping or emits moisture when you press it. If not, remove the tray from the oven."

Set up your dehydrator.,
Arrange your prepped vegetables.,
Dry your vegetables.",How to Dehydrate Vegetables3," Take the lid off and take all the trays out. Choose a bare, level surface to place the base. Make sure the surface is dry to avoid electric and fire hazards. Check each vent to make sure they are clear of any blockage., Use a tray with handles for your first load. Place your veggies on the smooth side of the tray. Make sure they do not overlap or touch to ensure quicker drying times. Then set the first tray onto the dehydrator’s base. For your next layer, use a handleless tray. Load it with veggies as you did with the first tray, and then set the second tray on top of the first.As you add more trays, continue stacking them with a handleless tray sandwiched in between those with handles.

, Replace the lid over the topmost tray once you have finished stacking them. Plug the base in. Refer to your dehydrator’s instructions for recommended drying times. If one tray’s veggies appear dry while others’ still seem moist, empty the dry tray and then return it to its place in the stack. Let the other trays continue to dehydrate until they feel crisp enough to break easily. Drying times will vary by method and equipment used, but expect windows of:Asparagus: 5 to seven hours

Green beans: 5 to 10 hours

Beets: 3 to 6 hours

Broccoli: 3 to 7 hours

",How to Dehydrate Vegetables4," Be aware that dehydrating your vegetables will preserve them as is. Do not expect underripe vegetables to continue ripening after rehydration. Cut or slice any areas that appear overripe, bruised, or blemished., Wash them with cold water under a running faucet. Do so even if you plan on peeling your vegetables before dehydrating them, since your peeler may transfer dirt or chemicals from the skin to the flesh. Use a cloth or paper towel to pat them dry afterward., Allow your vegetables to dehydrate evenly. Cut larger veggies into smaller, roughly uniform pieces. Be sure to follow these basic slicing guidelines:⅛” slices: beets; carrots.

¼” slices: carrots; celery; onions; peppers; potatoes; squash.

⅜” slices: mushrooms

¾” slices: tomatoes

1” pieces: asparagus; broccoli; cauliflower; green beans

, Preserve certain veggies’ flavor and color by ridding them of enzymes that might strip their flavor and color over time. Either submerge them in boiling water, or place them in a steaming tray over boiling water. Follow the recommended times for the following veggies::



Asparagus: 3.5 to 4.5 minutes in boiling water; 4 to 5 with steam.

Green beans: 2 minutes in boiling water; 2 to 2.5 with steam.

Broccoli: 2 minutes in boiling water; 3 to 3.5 steam.

Carrots: 3 minutes in boiling water; 3 to 3.5 steam.

Cauliflower: 3 to 4 minutes in boiling water; 4 to 5 with steam.

Celery: 2 minutes in boiling water or with steam.

Corn: 1.5 minutes in boiling water; 2-2.5 with steam.

Peas: 2 minutes in boiling water; 3 with steam

Potatoes: 5 to 6 minutes in boiling water; 6 to 8 with steam.

Squash: 1.5 minutes in boiling water; 2.5 to 3 with steam.

, After they have dehydrated, transfer them to a clean, sealable container to keep out air and moisture. If you dried multiple kinds of vegetables, store each one separately to avoid crossing flavors. Store them in an area that is cool, dark, and dry. Vegetables should last 6 months in average temperatures of 60 degrees Fahrenheit, or 3 months in 80 degrees.,"

Buy jujubes from specialized markets.,
Know what to look for.,
Store jujubes in the fridge.",How to Cook with Jujubes1," Unless you live in an area where jujubes are plentiful, you may have a hard time finding them in your local supermarket. You will have better luck at a farmers' market or a well-stocked health food store. Asian and Indian markets also tend to carry them., There are lots of different varieties of jujubes. In general, however, they will be round or oval-shaped and about 2 inches (5.08 centimeters) long. Young jujubes are light green. As they ripen, they will turn yellow. Sometimes, reddish-brown spots may appear on the skin. Once fully ripe, jujubes will be reddish-brown in color, soft, and wrinkly.

If you plan on eating jujubes fresh, buy them just before they turn red, soft, and wrinkly., Jujubes can last a long time, especially once they are dried. Whether you have fresh or dried jujubes, you should store them in the fridge in an airtight container."

Simmer the water.,
Peel and trim the asparagus.,
Bundle the asparagus.,
Add the lemon juice, butter, and salt to the water.,
Cook the asparagus until it becomes tender.,
Drain and serve.",How to Cook White Asparagus1," Pour approximately 4 quarts (4 L) of water into a large pot. Set it on the stove over medium heat and allow the water to reach a steady simmer.

Ideally, you should avoid using aluminum pots since minerals in the asparagus may chemically react to that metal and discolor the asparagus.
Note that you should start preparing the asparagus while the water heats up.;
, Meanwhile, use a vegetable peeler to remove the tough outer skin from each spear of white asparagus, then use a knife to trim off 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) from the woody stem end of each spear.

To peel the asparagus, lay each spear flat and run the peeler blade down the length of the spear starting 1-1/2 inches (3.75 cm) from the top.

, Separate the asparagus spears into two or four bundles, and loosely tie each bundle with clean kitchen twine.

Arranging bundles based on the anticipated number of servings can make things convenient, but keep in mind that larger bundles may slightly increase the cooking time.

, Add all three ingredients to the simmering water. Wait for the butter to melt and the water to return to a simmer.

The salt and butter add flavor to the white asparagus spears as they cook, which is especially important since the white variety has a somewhat bland flavor on its own.
The lemon juice can help prevent white asparagus from discoloring.

, Lower the bundles of asparagus into the simmering water. Cook at a steady simmer for 8 to 30 minutes, or until the asparagus is tender enough to pierce with the tines of a fork.

The exact amount of cooking time will depend on the thickness of the spears. Spears thinner than 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) in diameter may only take 8 to 12 minutes, but spears thicker than 1 inch (2.5 cm) may take up to 20 or 30 minutes.
Adjust the heat as needed to maintain a steady simmer and check for doneness frequently to avoid accidental overcooking.

, Using tongs, remove the bundles of asparagus from the water and lay them out onto a plate lined with paper towels. Cut the twine, then serve the asparagus as desired.

Consider tossing the finished asparagus in melted butter or drizzling it with hollandaise sauce. Enjoy the white asparagus while it's still warm.

Cover the dish with a sheet of plastic wrap.,
Cook the peas on HIGH until they are crisp and bright green.,
Drain the water.,
Serve the peas or use them in your recipe.",How to Cook Peas1," This method is suitable for frozen peas or fresh peas. It is not suitable for snow peas or sugar snap peas. To prepare the peas, do one of the following:


Fresh peas: snap the stems off, then tug them downwards to remove the string. Split the pods open, then run your thumb down the center to knock the peas out.
Frozen peas: simply open the bag and take the peas out. You do not have to do anything else.;
, You can add more peas, but you will have to adjust the amount of water accordingly. If the frozen peas are clumped together, break them apart with your fingers or a spoon.

, You will need 2 tablespoons (30 milliliters) of water for fresh peas, and 1 tablespoon (15 milliliters) of water for frozen peas. Frozen peas require less water than fresh peas because they release extra water while being cooked., Be sure to seal the wrap tightly around the rim of the dish so that the steam does not escape.

, This will generally take between 2 and 5 minutes. Keep in mind that each microwave is a little different, and that some microwaves cook much faster than others. It might be a good idea to check your peas after 1 minute of cooking. The general cooking times for fresh and frozen peas are as follows:Fresh peas: 5 minutes
Frozen peas: 2 minutes

, Once the peas are cooked, carefully take the dish out of the microwave using a potholder. Peel off the plastic wrap (be mindful of the escaping steam!) and drain the excess water. You can do this by pouring the peas through a strainer.

, You can add the peas to your casserole, pasta, or salad. You can also serve them as they are with a dash of salt and a knob of butter.

If your recipe calls for apples, you can easily substitute a jujube instead. You can even make them into a jujube version of apple butter!, Dried jujubes look and taste similar to dates, hence their other name: Red Date. You can add them to compotes, desserts, and jams. You can also use them in sauces, soups, and stuffing. They taste great in sweet and savory recipes., They go well with nuts, such as almonds, pistachios, and walnuts. You can also use them alongside sweeteners, such as brown sugar, chocolate, or honey. They go especially well with coconut, cream cheese, and oranges.Here are some other tasty jujube pairings to give you ideas:Sautee jujubes with some bell pepper, eggplant, greens, onion, or summer squash.

You can use any large pot for this as long as you have a steamer basket that can sit inside without touching the bottom of the pot. Avoid using aluminum cookware, however, since aluminum can have a negative chemical reaction to minerals in the asparagus.
Note that the lemon juice should get into the steam and help reduce discoloration as a result.

, Use a vegetable peeler to remove the thick skin from the outside of each asparagus spear. Cut off roughly 1/4 to 1/2 inch (0.6 to 1.25 cm) from the woody stem end of each spear.

The exact amount you should trim will vary depending on the thickness of the spear.
Peel the spears from top to bottom, starting 1-1/2 inches (3.75 cm) from the tip. Lay the spears flat on their sides while peeling them since upright peeling may cause them to snap.

, Place the steamer basket over the boiling water, then arrange the asparagus into an even layer inside the basket. Cover and cook for 20 to 30 minutes.

The exact amount of time will vary depending on the thickness of the asparagus. Check after roughly 20 minutes by piercing the thickest spear with a fork. If you can easily pierce the spear all the way through, the asparagus should be ready.

, Remove the finished white asparagus from the heat and lightly toss it with melted butter for flavor. Serve while it's still hot.

Alternatively, you could serve steamed white asparagus with a traditional hollandaise sauce for something will a little more kick.

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit (200 degrees Celsius).,
Trim and peel the asparagus.,
Coat with olive oil, salt, and pepper.,
Roast until tender.,
Serve warm.",How to Cook White Asparagus3," Prepare a rimmed baking sheet by covering it with parchment paper or a thin layer of nonstick cooking spray.

Alternatively, you could use a shallow roasting dish instead of a baking sheet. Glass and nonstick cookware do not need to be covered.
Avoid using aluminum foil. Minerals in the asparagus may react with aluminum and cause some unwanted discoloration.
Continue with the next step while the oven preheats.

, Cut roughly 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) from the stem end of each spear and peel away the tough outer layer of skin.

For spears more than 1 inch (2.5 cm) thick, you may also wish to cut each spear lengthwise to reduce the overall cooking time.
Peel the skin using a standard vegetable peeler. Hold each spear flat against the counter or table instead of holding it upright, and peel from top to bottom, starting about 1-1/2 inches (3.75 cm) from the tip.

, Place the white asparagus on your prepared baking sheet and lightly brush the spears with olive oil. Evenly sprinkle with salt and pepper.

Arrange the spears into a single layer to promote even cooking.
Lightly toss the spears using a fork or spatula after coating them to help spread out the oil and seasonings.

, Place the asparagus into the preheated oven and cook them for 15 to 20 minutes, or until they turn tender and slightly browned.

The exact amount of cooking time will vary depending on the thickness of the spears.
Consider stirring the asparagus halfway through the cooking time to help the spears cook evenly.
Note that the asparagus should be tender enough to pierce with a fork but firm enough to retain its shape.

, Remove the finished white asparagus from the oven and let it cool slightly for several minutes before serving it.

When prepared in this manner, you may not need to serve white asparagus with any accompaniments. Even so, hollandaise sauce or browned butter are popular garnishes worth considering.

Preheat the grill for medium heat.,
Trim and peel the asparagus.,
Prepare the foil.,
Toss the asparagus with oil and vinegar.,
Wrap the foil.,
Grill until tender.,
Serve warm.",How to Cook White Asparagus4," Preheat a charcoal, gas, or electric grill for medium heat.

To preheat a charcoal grill, arrange an even layer of coals in the bottom fo the grill, coat them with lighter fluid, and light them with fire. Allow the coals to turn white and ashy, then cover the grill with its lid for about 10 minutes.
To preheat a gas or electric grill, turn the heat up as high as it will go and close the lid. Watch the temperature gauge closely. Once the temperature reaches the mid-range, open the grill and turn the temperature dial down to a medium setting.

, Cut off 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) from the woody stem end of each white asparagus spear, then use a vegetable peeler to remove the tough skin from the entire length of the spear.

When peeling the asparagus, hold the spear flat against your work surface and peel from top to bottom, starting roughly 1-1/2 inches (3.75 cm) from the tip. Do not peel the asparagus upright since doing so may cause more delicate spears to break.

, Tear off four lengths of aluminum foil, making each one about 6 to 8 inches (15 to 20 cm) long.

Consider using parchment-lined foil, when available, to avoid directly exposing the asparagus to the aluminum.
When using standard aluminum foil, some mild discoloration may occur. The taste and quality of the white asparagus should remain good, however.

, Evenly divide the asparagus among the four sheets of foil. Drizzle each portion with a little olive oil and a little balsamic vinegar.

Use a fork to carefully toss the asparagus spears in the oil and vinegar to coat them evenly.
When finished, rearrange the spears so that they form an even, single layer on the foil.

, Wrap up the sides of each foil rectangle around the asparagus, forming packets.

Fold the lengthwise ends over the asparagus first, then bring together the width ends. Fold the width ends together, overlapping them two or three times, to prevent the packet from coming undone.

, Place the foil packets on your preheated stove and grill them for 5 to 10 minutes.

When using thin to moderate sized asparagus, 5 minutes should be enough. For thicker spears, however, you may need to cook the asparagus for the full 10 minutes.

, Remove the packets from the grill using tongs. Allow the asparagus to rest for a minute or so, then carefully open the packets and serve the finished white asparagus while it's still warm.

Ideally, the asparagus should be tender enough to pierce with a fork. If it's still too tough, consider returning the opened packets to the grill for another 1 or 2 minutes.

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.,
Wash and slice the sunchokes.,
Coat with oil and seasonings.,
Bake for 20 minutes.",How to Cook Sunchokes1," Set your oven to bake or convection and let it start warming up. Sunchokes are somewhat tough and fibrous, so the heat needs to be pretty high to cook them all the way through. Get out a large pan or roasting dish that you can use to cook the sunchokes.Start prepping the sunchokes while the oven is preheating.
You can also roast sunchokes and similar vegetables under a broiler, or wrapped in foil on a grill.;
, Place the sunchokes in a strainer and rinse them with lukewarm water to clean them. Try to remove any obvious clumps of dirt or sticky root residue. Using a sharp knife, cut the sunchokes into ½” slices. You can also chop them into small squares or wedges, if you prefer.Since these vegetables grow in the ground, it’s important to clean them thoroughly before you eat them.
The size and shape of the sunchokes is largely up to you. Just keep in mind that they will need more time in the oven to soften if they’re left in bigger pieces.

, Transfer the sunchokes to the roasting dish and drizzle them with olive oil. Use enough oil to form a nice even layer over each one, but don’t completely drown them. Toss the sunchokes by hand to help coat them better. Add a pinch of kosher salt, a couple crushed cloves of garlic and a minced sprig of parsley or rosemary.For a sweeter touch, go with herbs like ginger, cloves and mint.
Pour on your oil slowly so that you don’t overdo it. You can always add more later, but you can’t take it back.

, Once the oven has reached the desired temperature, it’s time to put the sunchokes in. Set a timer for 15 minutes and keep an eye on them while they roast. After the 15 minutes is up, poke one or two with a fork to see if they’re sufficiently soft. The sunchokes will be done when the edges just begin to brown.There will be some variation in cook times for dense, temperamental veggies like sunchokes, so rely on your own senses to determine when they’re done in addition to the timer you set.
Try roasting sunchokes along with new potatoes, purple carrots, parsnips and squash for a mild, autumn-inspired root vegetable medley."

Bring a pot of water to a boil.,
Peel and dice the sunchokes.,
Boil the sunchokes to soften them.,
Puree the sunchokes with the remaining ingredients.",How to Cook Sunchokes2," Take a deep pan or stockpot and fill it with water. Set the pan on the cooktop and turn the heat on high to begin warming it up. The water will be ready when it begins to bubble up from the center.The pot you use should be roomy enough to hold all the sunchokes you’re preparing along with enough water to keep them fully submerged.
Throwing a dash of salt in the bottom of the pot will help the water reach a boil faster.

, Rinse the sunchokes under running water, then use a veggie peeler to scrape off the outer layer of skin. Once they’ve been peeled, carefully cut them with a fine dice. To mash the fleshy sunchokes, it will be necessary to use a food processor rather than a traditional hand masher, so you’ll want to make sure they’re in small enough pieces to easily puree.Ordinarily it’s okay to leave the skin on if you’re roasting or frying, but for mashed sunchokes it’s better to remove it in order to achieve a smooth, creamy consistency.
Place your hand on the back edge of the knife and use a “lever” motion to chop tough sunchokes more easily.

, Drop the diced sunchokes into your pot of water. Allow them to cook at a boil for 5 minutes, then reduce the heat and let them simmer for 15 more minutes. The sunchokes should have some give to them when they’re done.You can tell when the sunchokes have cooked long enough by pressing them with a spoon or ladle.

, Drain the pot and move the sunchokes to the food processor. Combine them with garlic, shallots, heavy cream, butter, salt, pepper and any other desired spices. Pulse the mixture together until it forms a thick, batter-like puree. Serve the mashed sunchokes while they’re still hot.Unlike vegetables like potatoes or cauliflower, which can be mashed using a hand masher or egg beater, sunchokes need heavy-duty treatment in order to soften and smooth them.
Try not to leave any lumps or chunks in your mashed sunchokes. These bits may be mushy and slightly chewy, which will throw off the texture of the completed dish.

Heat oil in a large skillet.,
Slice the sunchokes thin.,
Pan-fry the sunchokes.,
Sprinkle with salt or other spices.",How to Cook Sunchokes3," Coat the bottom of a spacious pan or skillet with about ¼” of vegetable or canola oil. Turn the cooktop on to a medium-high heat. Give the oil about 5 minutes to get hot enough to cook the sunchokes.Choose a broad pan with steep sides that can easily contain the sunchokes and a layer of oil without making a mess.
Take care not to burn yourself with splattering oil.

, Reduce the sunchokes to an appropriate size for frying. You can do this using a kitchen knife or a tool like a mandolin, either slicing them into rounds like potato chips or long thin strips like French fries. The thinner you cut the sunchokes, the crispier they will fry up.For this method of preparation, you can either peel the sunchokes beforehand or leave the skin on, as it will be edible after it’s been fried.
The sunchokes will shrink down a bit as they cook, so make sure you account for this with the thickness of your cuts.

, Carefully drop the sunchoke slices into the hot oil in the skillet. Fry the sunchokes one side a time until they begin turning a delightful golden brown. The amount of time it takes them to cook will depend on their size, degree of ripeness and how thinly they’re sliced, but they’ll most likely require 2-3 minutes on each side.Try not to overcrowd your pan. This will make the sunchokes harder to turn and fry to a consistent finish. Depending on how much you’re planning on making, you may have to cook them in batches.
When they’re done, the fried sunchokes will have a hearty crunch.

, Remove the sunchokes from the pan and onto a layer of paper towels while you drain the oil from the skillet. Fold the paper towels over and blot the sunchokes to remove excess oil and moisture. From there, arrange the sunchoke chips on a serving dish and shake on some salt, white pepper and garlic or onion powder. Dig in!Sunchokes contain a lot of sugar, so savory spices will nicely offset their natural sweetness, resulting in a complex, well-balanced flavor.

Select a heat source.,
Select a roasting vessel.,
Bring meat to room temperature before roasting.,
Roast meat uncovered.,
Start meat at a higher heat, then lower the temperature.,
Rest the meat after roasting.",How to Roast Meat1," Conventional ovens are the most basic way of roasting meat, while convection ovens will use circulating air to speed up the cooking process slightly. The cooking times for convection ovens will be slightly lower for all kinds of meat. While most meat is roasted in a traditional conventional oven, meat can be roasted in a variety of ways:


Cooking indoors in a conventional oven is the most common way of roasting meats. Meat should be roasted in the middle of the rack, at a temperature between 280 and 400 degrees F. Leaner meats should be roasted at a higher temperature for a shorter period of time while fattier meats should be roasted low and slow.
Roasting pits and tandoors are very hot electric or wood-fire ovens that can be used to roast meat very quickly. In some regions, these are very common methods of commercial cooking, roasting meats at upward of 500 or 600 °F (260 or 316 °C) for a short period of time, which results in very juicy, crispy meat.
Outdoor charcoal grills or smokers can be used to roast meat, though this is more typically called barbecuing, or smoking. Still, it fits the bill of cooking meat at a low temperature for a long period of time over indirect heat, provided you have a coal chimney to heat the cooking chamber. This is a particularly common way of cooking pork.;
, Meat needs to be placed on or into some kind of dish to keep the juices from flowing all over the oven or the heat source. Typically, roasting pans are used, but different meats will need to be roasted in different vessels. If you don't have one, disposable roasting pans are available at all grocery stores, or you can fold one out of aluminum foil.


Roasting pans should be used for beef, poultry, lamb, and anything that you want to cook on top of vegetables. While the bottom of the meat won't be ""crusted,"" cooking in a roasting pan is the easiest method.
Roasting racks can be used to cook the meat on all sides. These are typically used for things like lamb, so the meat can sit up off the pan, and allow the juices to drip through to a pan underneath. This is an excellent method of roasting to collect juices for gravy.
Rotisseries are often used for cooking chickens, turning the meat continuously to achieve an even roast. While these are relatively uncommon for home cooking, some small single-chicken sized rotisseries are commercially available.

, Large roasts, chickens, and other big cuts of meat that you're planning to roast need to be set out on the counter for a few hours before you put them in the oven, bringing the meat up to room temperature. This is to ensure that the meat cooks evenly, and that you don't have a blackened outside with a nearly-raw inside on a big cut of beef.


Taking cold meat directly out of the fridge and putting it into the hot oven will heat up the outside first, while the inside remains cold. It's very difficult to cook meat properly without letting it come up to room temperature first.
Always thaw frozen meat thoroughly in the refrigerator overnight before attempting to roast it. Let it come up to room temperature as normal.

, To caramelize the outside of the roast, meat should typically be roasted uncovered for the entirety of the cooking process, then covered after removing it from the oven, to rest the meat appropriately before carving it. Covering the meat will not make it juicier or more tender. Cooking it properly will.


It's also important that you do not add any liquid to the bottom of the pan to keep the meat moist. This is a process called braising, an effective cooking technique in and of itself, but it's not done when you're roasting.

, Different meats will be roasted at different temperatures, anywhere between 280 F and 400 F, depending on the dish you're making and the cut. Typically, though, meat is started at a higher temperature, cooked for 15 or 20 minutes, then the temperature is lowered to around 350 or 375 F, while the meat roasts for several hours. Specific directions for different types of meat are discussed in the following sections.


Tender cuts, like filets and tenderloins should be roasted at a higher temperature the whole time, for a shorter period of time. These cuts do not benefit from ""low and slow"" cooking, which helps to tenderize tougher or cheaper cuts, like pork shoulder or chuck roast.
Always make sure the oven has fully pre-heated before putting the meat into it. You don't want to gradually bring the meat up, you want to put it into a fully-hot oven. This will help to cook the meat more evenly and keep it juicy. There'll be less guess-work if you do it right.

, Meat is comprised of tightly woven strands of protein, which release water as the temperature is increased. This mixes with the fat in the meat that renders as it heats, creating the flavorful juices that make meat taste good. If you cut immediately into a very hot piece of meat, those juices will run right out of the meat and onto the plate. Letting the fibers relax some by lowering the temperature slightly, letting the meat sit covered for 10-20 minutes, will reabsorb those juices into the meat and the meat will taste better. This is why all meat, especially beef and poultry, should be rested."

Make sure that the dish you use is also large enough to hold both partridges.
The water does not need to be boiling hot, but it should be as hot as your tap can make it.;
, Set the brine aside on your kitchen counter for 30 minutes, or until it cools to room temperature.


Do not refrigerate the brine yet.
You may want to loosely cover the bowl of brine with a paper towel or piece of plastic wrap to prevent dust or other contaminants from falling in.

, Place both partridges in the brine. Make sure that they are completely covered by the brine.


Once the birds are inside, cover the dish more securely with a lid or a piece of plastic wrap.

, Keep the dish there for 3 to 8 hours.


During this time, the brine breaks down some of the muscle fibers of the partridge, turning them from solids into liquids. It also seeps into the remaining fibers, infusing the meat with more moisture.
Avoid brining the birds for more than 8 hours, though, since the brine can ruin the meat if too many muscle fibers are destroyed during this stage.

, Remove the partridges from the brine and pat them dry with clean paper towels.


You should also let the birds sit out at room temperature for about 20 minutes after pulling them out of the brine. This allows more of the excess moisture to dry, and it also drops the temperature of the meat to a warmer temperature, thereby reducing the amount of time the partridges will spend cooking in dry heat.

, Prepare a small roasting pan or shallow baking dish by lining it with nonstick aluminum foil.


The foil is not strictly necessary, but it can make it easier to clean the dish later.

, Arrange both partridges in the same roasting pan, breast-side up.


Ideally, the two partridges should be in a single snug layer. There should not be much excess room for them to move around.

, Rub the softened butter over each partridge. After applying the butter, pour the chicken broth over the partridges, as well.


When applying the butter, make sure that you get all outer sides of the skin. If there is any butter left after the outside is finished, tuck it underneath the skin.
Between the salt in the brine, the salt in the broth, and the salt in the bacon (see next step), there should be plenty of salt to thoroughly season the meat of the partridges at this point. Do not add any more.

, Lay or wrap the bacon over the partridges, using two slices of bacon per bird.


If you choose to wrap the bacon over the partridges instead of merely laying it on top, you may need to use toothpicks to hold the bacon in place.Note that sliced salt pork can be used instead of bacon, if desired.
The bacon adds flavor to the partridges, but it is also another trick used to help keep the meat moist during the dry cooking process.

, Cover the entire roasting pan loosely with aluminum foil.


The wrapping should be fairly loose. If you make it too tight, it could disturb the bacon lying on top of the birds.

, Place the roasting dish in the oven and let the partridges cook, covered, for roughly 25 minutes.Meanwhile, prepare a second small baking sheet by lining it with nonstick aluminum foil.

, Remove the dish from the oven and take off the foil. Take the bacon off of the partridges, then cook both the birds and the bacon separately for another 10 minutes.


Place the bacon on the lined baking sheet before returning it to the oven.
The partridges should remain in their original roasting dish, but they should be cooked uncovered during this part of the process.
Baste the partridges with the juices in the pan before returning them to the oven. Do so once more after about 5 minutes, or halfway through this final part of the cooking process.

, Pull the partridges and the bacon out of the oven. Let the meat rest while you prepare the sauce.


The bacon will be crisp when done.
The partridges should be golden brown when done, with an internal temperature of 180 degrees Fahrenheit (82.2 degrees Celsius).
If you do not have a meat thermometer, you can perform a quick visual test for doneness by piercing the partridge with a fork. The fork should glide in easily. You should also be able to wiggle both legs of the partridge without difficulty.
Place the partridges and bacon on a warm serving plate during this time and cover them with more foil. No matter how long it takes for you to prepare the gravy, the partridges should rest for at least 5 to 10 minutes.

, Pour the leftover juices from the roasting dish into a small to medium saucepan. Set the saucepan on the stove over medium-high heat.


Since there will be a considerable amount of fat in these juices, you may wish to strain it out by pouring the juices through a sieve and into the pan. The fine mesh of the sieve should strain out most larger pieces of fat.

, In a separate small bowl, use a fork to whisk together the cornstarch and cold water, forming a slurry.


The two ingredients must be thoroughly combined before you proceed. Do not allow any of the cornstarch to stick to the bottom of the bowl.

, Pour the cornstarch slurry into the juices sitting on the stove. Stir to combine.


Cook the new mixture in the saucepan over medium-high heat until it boils and thickens, stirring the mixture occasionally as it heats up., Add these four remaining ingredients to the gravy. Stir them in thoroughly, then heat through.


If desired, you could skip the Dijon mustard and red currant jelly, adding only the salt and pepper. Doing so will create a more traditional poultry-style gravy.

, Place one partridge on one serving plate. Lay two pieces of bacon on top, then spoon some of the gravy over the entire thing.


You could also serve the bacon on the side, if desired.
If you want each person to be able to add the gravy separately, ladle it into a gravy boat and set it down on the side of the plates.

, Since partridges are so small, each person would traditionally carve his or her own while eating the bird.


If you are not concerned with presentation, however, you could carve both birds before plating them.
There is no set technique for carving a partridge, but typically, you would begin by removing the legs and wings from the body of the bird. Strip the meat off the legs and wings, then from the breast and back of the partridge.

Make chunkier puree.",How to Puree Meat," The more tender the meat you use, the smoother and better-tasting your puree will be. Whether you're pureeing beef, chicken, pork or lamb, you want to choose a tender cut that won't toughen up when cooked.Often the cheapest cuts of beef are the toughest, so try choosing a cut like top sirloin.
For chicken, you can buy the meat boneless or bone-in. If you buy it bone-in, you'll have to be careful to make sure no tiny bones get mixed in with the puree.;
, Slow cooking methods help the meat retain flavor and moisture, making it much easier to puree. No matter what type of meat you use, consider cooking it slowly so you end up with the best possible texture. Here are some methods that work well:


Braising
Using a slow cooker
Boiling

, The meat must be completely pre-cooked before you puree it. Check the temperature of the meat when it's done to make sure it has reached the correct internal temperature. Here are the correct temperatures for different types of meat:Chicken: 165 °F (74 °C)
Pork: 160 °F (71 °C)
Beef: 145 °F (63 °C)
Lamb: 145 °F (63 °C)

, After cooking, chill the meat in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours. The meat should be completely chilled in preparation for processing. Chilled meat will process into much finer pieces than meat that is still warm.

, Remove it from the refrigerator and chop the meat into chunks that will fit easily in your food processor.

, If you don't have a food processor, it's fine to use a blender, although the resulting puree may not be as silky-smooth as puree that was made in a food processor.

, ""Powdery"" may seem like a strange word to describe meat, but that's the texture it will take on when you process it cold. Keep processing the meat until the pieces are very fine, almost like sand., In order to process the meat into a smooth puree, you'll need to add some liquid to loosen it up. You'll need 1/4 cup of liquid per 1 cup of meat, regardless of what kind of meat you're pureeing. Choose from among the following liquids:Cooking liquid reserved from cooking the meat
Sodium-free meat broth
Water

, After the puree has reached your desired consistency, spoon it into a food storage container with a tight-fitting lid. Store the puree in the refrigerator until use. It will keep safely for three to four days.


You can freeze pureed meat for later use if desired. Be sure to store it in a freezer-safe container.
Before serving, let the puree come to room temperature or heat it gently in the microwave.

, You can make a complete pureed meal for a baby by mixing some pureed vegetables in with the pureed meat. This adds flavor and substance. Try the following combinations:


Chicken puree mixed with carrot puree
Beef puree mixed with pea puree
Pork puree mixed with apple puree

, While babies don't need salt and other extra seasonings, an adult might find pureed meat more appetizing if you add some salt and spices. To a cup of any type of pureed meat, add 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon of the spices of your choice.

, If your baby is getting older and can chew larger chunks of meat, you can make puree with more than one consistency. Instead of pureeing the meat until it's completely smooth, stop when there are still chunks in the puree. As an alternative, add chunks of cooked vegetables to a smooth meat puree.

Know how to thaw meat.",How to Preserve Meat1," To prevent freezer burn, prepare and package the meat before putting it in the freezer.


Meat and poultry can be frozen in the store packaging but it is advisable to over-wrap the packaging to make sure no air can enter the package. Use plastic bags and heavy duty aluminum foil specially designed for freezer use (the label will tell you) to over-wrap.Use a home vacuum sealer to remove air from packaging.Vacuum sealers come in a variety of models and prices and use special bags (sold separately) to store food.Use air-tight containers such as plastic or freezer safe jars and cans.Use wraps such as heavy weight aluminum foil, plastic freezer bags or polyethylene wrap and bags.Remove as many bones as possible before freezing as bones take up space and can contribute to freezer burn.Place freezer paper or wrap between slices or patties of meat to make separation easier after freezing.;
, Meat will not keep forever in a freezer.Uncooked meat (such as steaks or chops) can be kept frozen safely for 4-12 months.
Uncooked ground meat can only be kept safely for 3-4 months.
Cooked meat can be stored for 2-3 months.Hotdogs, ham and lunch meats can be frozen for 1-2 months.
Poultry (cooked and uncooked) can be kept for 3-12 months.
Wild game can be kept for 8-12 months.
Make sure to maintain a freezer or cooler temperature of 0 °F (−18 °C) or below., You need to know what is in the freezer and how old it is.


The label should contain the type of meat (chicken breast, steak, ground beef, etc.), whether it is raw or cooked, and the date it was frozen.
To help you find things later, it is a good idea to group like items together. For example, put all the chicken together, all the beef together, all the pork together.
Use the oldest items first to avoid having to discard out of date or freezer-burned food.,


You can use the freezer compartment that is attached to your refrigerator or use a stand-alone freezer.
Stand-alone freezers are larger than the compartment on a refrigerator.
Be aware that a freezer does use electricity so your energy bills will be higher if you use a stand-alone freezer in addition to your refrigerator. The cost increase will depend on the size of the freezer and how energy-efficient the model is.,


You can use a cooler if you are camping or if you need to store meat during an electrical outage.
You will need to fill the cooler with ice to make it cold.Place some ice on the bottom of the cooler, put in the meat, then cover the meat with more ice.
Make sure the meat is surrounded by ice to ensure complete and even freezing.
If you use a cooler you will need to replace the ice as it melts to make sure the meat does not thaw before you are ready to use it.

, Thawing properly will help reduce the chance of food-borne illness.


Thaw meat in the refrigerator. Plan ahead as large items such as turkeys will take about 24 hours to thaw this way.Thaw by submerging the meat (in air-tight packaging) in cold water. Change the water every 30 minutes until completely thawed.You can thaw meat in a microwave but be sure to cook it immediately. Microwaves thaw unevenly and may start to cook parts of the meat.Before cooking, look for freezer burn. Freezer burn is the discoloration of meat due to freezing and does not necessarily make the meat inedible. Cut off freezer burned portions before consuming.Use common sense. If the meat or poultry looks or smells “off” do not eat it.

A crown roast can be made from pork, lamb or veal. Beef loin is too large to properly form into a crown roast. You need to purchase the loin with the ribs still intact. In order to properly tie the crown you'll need to purchase 2 strips of the bone-in loin. Each strip should have at least 4 bones for it to form the crown properly.;
,


Lay the strip of loin horizontally on a cutting board in front of you. With a sharp knife, carefully make a cut from one end of the loin to the other, perpendicular to the bones, about 1 1/2 inches (3.5 cm) from the top of the bone.
Lay the second strip of loin on the cutting board and make a similar cut.
Remove the meat from between the cut you just made and the top of the bone. Use a small knife to carefully cut away this meat; you can save it for another use. Cut away enough meat to expose the bones. Do this for both strips of loin.

,


Frenching is the process of removing the meat from between each bone. Using a thin bladed knife or boning knife cut away the meat from between each bone. Cut away enough meat so that 1 1/2 inches (3.5 cm) of bone is exposed. Clean away any fat and meat from each bone until they're as close to bare bone as you can manage.

,


Lay the strips of loin on the cutting board horizontally in front of you, bone side up and with the bones facing away from you. With a small knife, make a shallow incision through the meat halfway between each bone. Your cuts should extend from the bottom of the meat up between each bone to the top of the meat.

,


Stand the strips up with the bones facing upward and the meatiest portion of the meat facing inward. Shape the 2 strips into a circle. With a long length of string, tie the meat together in a circle. One string should tie the roast across midway up the outward facing bones, and another string should tie below the bones in the meaty portion of the strips.

,,


Roast the crown roast in a 350 degree F (180 degree C) oven for 20 to 25 minutes per lb. or until the meat has reached an internal temperature of 145 degrees F (63 degrees C) in the meatiest portion.

,


Crown roasts have traditionally been stuffed prior to roasting. It is, however, easier to make the stuffing and bake it separately then spoon the stuffing into the center of the cooked crown. If the roast were stuffed and then roasted, you would have to cook the roast to a much higher internal temperature to ensure that the stuffing is cooked. This would result in overcooked meat.

,


Remove the string from the roast and place the cooked roast on a serving platter. Spoon the cooked stuffing into the center of the roast and serve.

Serve the roast.",How to Prepare and Cook a Prime Rib Roast," A prime rib roast with the bone in will have about 1 serving per pound, so plan to buy a pound of meat for every adult guest you're serving. Each guest will end up with about 6 ounces of meat. You certainly don't want to skimp, and the leftovers will be delicious, so you may want to buy an extra pound or two.;
, The prime rib roast, also called a standing rib roast, is a fairly rare cut of meat, since butchers may need to sacrifice more common cuts of meat to get a large roast. Therefore, plan ahead and ask your butcher to cut you a prime rib roast in the size you need by a certain date. When you get the roast, it should be heavily marbled with a thick cap of fat and deep red meat that springs back when touched.


You should be able to order a prime rib roast at your supermarket's meat department, but you may also try a local butcher.
This roast is far more costly than other cuts of meat. If you are going to indulge in a prime rib roast, you may as well ensure you are getting a high grade of meat, like USDA Prime, if that option is available (most meat on the market is USDA choice quality, which has less fat marbling).
You might also consider getting a dry-aged or grass-fed roast, both of which will yield beautiful results.

, You may do this at home or ask your butcher to do it for you. Cutting the bones away from the roast, then tying them back on with kitchen twine will make the roast easier to carve the roast once it's cooked.Slide a sharp knife between the top edge of the bones and the meat. Carefully cut them from the roast. You may leave the ends attached if desired.
Wrap a piece of kitchen twine under the bones and around the meat, and tie it tightly.

, If you bought a less expensive cut of meat, you might want to apply a rub and let it refrigerate overnight so the flavors meld with the meat. If you bought USDA Prime beef, grass-fed beef or dry-aged beef, there's no need for a rub; you can cook your prime rib as soon as you get home from the butcher shop.

, In order for the meat to cook evenly, it's necessary to remove it from the refrigerator and bring it to room temperature about 3 hours before you start cooking. Season it on both sides with salt and pepper. Place it on a large platter and cover it with plastic wrap, then set it on your kitchen counter.

, Position it so the fat side is up, and the rib side is down. This way the drippings from the fat will help the meat become nice and juicy while it cooks. The pan you use should only be slightly bigger than the roast.


You'll need a meat thermometer to check the internal temperature of the meat. If you have the type that should be inserted in the meat before cooking, go ahead and insert it, making sure the tip is not touching the bone.

, Cooking the roast low and slow, so that the proper internal temperature is reached without overcooking the meat, will result in a tender, succulent interior. Don't worry - the final step of searing the meat will bring about the crunchy outer crust prime rib is known for.

, When the internal temperature is 115 to 120 °F (46 to 49 °C), the meat will be rare. If you prefer it medium, wait until it reaches 125 to 130 F. The cooking time depends on the shape and size of your roast, but as a general rule you should allow 15 minutes per pound. Check the thermometer often to make sure you don't overcook the meat.


Make sure the thermometer is not touching the bone, fat or the pan when you measure the temperature.

, Let it rest for 15 to 20 minutes while you heat the oven to a higher temperature to sear the meat.After this resting period, there will be no need to rest the meat again before serving.

, At this temperature, the meat will achieve a perfect sear without overcooking the interior.

, Leave it in the oven for 8-10 minutes, or until a brown, crispy crust has formed. When you're satisfied with the crust, remove the roast and prepare to carve it right away. Do not overcook the meat or allow it to burn.

, Place the roast on a carving board. Cut and remove the string tying the bones to the meat, and set the bones aside. Carve the roast into 1⁄4 to 1⁄2 inch (0.6 to 1.3 cm) slices against the grain using a very sharp carving knife.

, In a saucepan, heat up 2 tablespoons of the drippings. Add 2 tablespoons of flour and whisk until the gravy has thickened. Add the rest of the drippings and enough cream to make 1 or 2 cups of liquid, depending on how many people you're serving. Season the gravy with salt and pepper.


Beer, stock, or water may be added instead of cream., Ask your guests how well they would like their meat done. Meat near the edge will be more done than in the center slices. Place the gravy in a dish to be passed around the table. The meal is excellent with creamed spinach, Yorkshire pudding and fresh salad.

Pick an appropriate roast.,
Season beef simply.,
Cook in a roasting pan on a bed of chopped vegetables.,
Consider trussing the roast to a uniform shape.,
Consider searing the roast in a skillet first.,
Cook beef at 325 °F (163 °C) for 30 minutes per pound of meat.,
Rest covered for 10-15 minutes.",How to Roast Meat2," Many cuts of beef are simplified and called “roasts,” which means you should have little trouble finding an appropriate cut at the grocery store. You want a cut with a decent amount of fat, which will melt in the oven and give the meat flavor. It also makes a nice base for gravy when the meat is roasted. Look for fresh, pink-colored meat without any grayness, and a good amount of fat marbling to roast. Common roasts include:


Prime rib
Tenderloin
Round roast
Chuck roast
Fillet

, You can get fancy with rubs and marinades, but the truth of the matter is beef is best served with the simplest seasonings. Roasted beef tastes better uncluttered. Season your roast immediately before putting it in the oven, when it's up to room temperature.


Coat the beef liberally with a fat source, like gram oil, or whatever your favorite cooking oil is. Butter or herbed butter is also a perfectly effective way of coating your meat for a delicious nutty-finish on the crust.
Salt and black pepper should be sprinkled liberally on each side of beef. Use your hands and pat it in gently, so the seasoning sticks.

, The best way to cook a beef roast is in a pan on seasonally-appropriate vegetables. As the juices run out of the meat, they'll help to cook and flavor the vegetables, which will end up tasting delicious, and forming the base for a great gravy, if you want to strain it out. You can also just serve up the vegetables as a side. Couldn't be easier.


Try roughly chopping carrots, onions, and red-skin potatoes and lining them in the bottom of the pan. You don't have to season them now. When you've seasoned your beef, rest it directly on top of the vegetables and you're ready to go.

, Some oblong roasts or stuffed roasts are commonly trussed with cooking twine, to make the meat into a more uniform shape and allow it to cook more evenly, holding its shape as it cooks. This does not need to be done on all roasts, but if you've butterflied a cut and stuffed it with something, you'll likely need to truss it up before you roast it.


To truss a cut of beef, you don't have to get fancy. Just use three links of kitchen twine and tie up the meat into an even log-shaped bundle. Tie tightly, so the meat remains secure in the intended shape.

, Rather than roasting at a higher temperature and then finishing lower, beef is commonly seared in a skillet first, then finished in the oven, much as you might cook a steak. This is done when making beef wellington, and other dishes.


To sear a roast, heat some cooking oil over high heat in a cast iron pan. Place the meat into the skillet just as the oil starts to smoke. It should sizzle immediately. If it doesn't, remove the meat and wait longer. Brown the meat on each side, then place it in the roasting pan and put it in the oven.
Don't remove or trim fat from meat that you're going to roast. It'll melt and make everything else taste delicious.

, Different sized roasts will need to cook for different periods of time, but a good rule of thumb is 30 minutes per pound. If you're using a meat thermometer, meat should be removed when it’s about 10 degrees cooler than the eventual internal temperature you’re looking for. Here's a breakdown of the different grades of doneness in a beef roast. Typically, beef is a lot tastier cooked on the rare side, but cook it like you enjoy.


Rare beef has an internal temperature of between 120 and 130 degrees, and it should be a bright and purple color on the inside. It should be very tender and juicy.
Medium-rare beef is between 130 and 135 degrees, and it should be slightly brighter and redder, and warmer through than rare beef.
Medium beef should be between 135 and 145 degrees, bright pink but slightly less juicy than medium-rare beef.
Medium-well beef is between 145 and 155 and is quite firm and tan-colored on the inside.
Well done beef is cooked above 155 and should be tan-colored all the way through and tough. In general, you shouldn't cook roasts well done.

, When the beef roast is nearly to the temperature you like, remove it from the oven and from the pan. Place it on a cutting board or platter, and cover the meat with aluminum foil. It will continue cooking as it rests, then the temperature will ease off slightly and the meat will be perfect to cook.


Slice beef thickly to avoid losing the heat. Slices should be generous, especially if the meat is cooked rarer, at least 3/4 of an inch thick.

Roast poultry whole.,
Brine or marinate your poultry.,
Season the outside and the inside.,
Truss the legs simply.,
Roast poultry in roasting pan.,
Start poultry at 425 F. All poultry should be started at a higher temperature, then lowered to around 350 F to continue cooking about 20 minutes per pound, plus an additional 15 minutes.",How to Roast Meat3," The best way to cook chickens, turkeys, and other game hens is to roast them whole. This requires the least amount of preparation and the most bang for your buck. It's the best way to roast juicy and flavorful chicken in the oven.


You can typically buy 3 or 5 pound roasting chickens at the supermarket, which make for perfect dinners. You don't have to break them down any before roasting.

, Poultry can be seasoned simply and roasted in the oven with a minimum amount of fuss, but taking some time to marinade can really up the ante and make your bird delicious. Dressing up a simple marinade for a couple hours before you put the chicken in the oven, or overnight for more flavor, is a great way to improve the flavor of the meat and make it delicious.Before you marinate, take a small kitchen knife and make little straight cuts into the breast, the legs, and the rest of the chicken, on all sides. Use the point and stab straight in until you get to the bone. This will help to get the marinade into the meat, not just the skin.
The simple French method of roasting a chicken is to take two whole lemons, a whole bulb of garlic, and some fresh thyme, salt, and pepper. Juice the lemons into a bowl, and cut the head of garlic in half. Season with the herbs (sage, rosemary, or other savory green herbs would also be fine), and place the chicken breast-down in the juices for several hours. Refrigerate. Before roasting the chicken, stuff the cavity with the lemons, the garlic, and the herbs.

Brining poultry involves soaking the meat in a mixture of warm water, sugar, and salt overnight to imbue the meat with juices and flavor. Drain brined chicken or turkey thoroughly before roasting.

, Even if you've marinated your poultry, it's a good idea to season it liberally with salt and pepper, both inside the cavity and out. This helps to season the meat from all angles and give the meat the most flavor while it cooks. The saltiness will transfer throughout the meat as it releases its juices.

, Before you put poultry in the oven, tie the legs together using kitchen twine. This helps to cook the chicken evenly and make sure any stuffing will remain inside the bird. If left untied, the legs of the poultry will cook more quickly and will become very dry, if they're not kept in tight to the rest of the bird, cooking more evenly.


There are a lot of fancy ways to truss a chicken, but the simplest is just to tie the legs together with a small piece of twine. Make a simple bow knot and call it a day.

, Like beef, poultry is usually best roasted in a pan on top of a bed of seasonal vegetables, like onions and carrots. Cut big chunks of whatever you want in the bottom of the pan, then lay the chicken on top of it.


Avoid roasting bags. A common gimmick at supermarkets are plastic roasting bags, which supposedly speed up the cooking time by turning conventional ovens into microwave-like super-heaters. The chicken cooked in these bags is soggy, though, losing much of the benefit of roasting in the oven. Take the time to do it right.

, Convection oven cooking times will be slightly lower. Turkeys, especially very large turkeys, may need slightly more cooking time than that.You can baste poultry, if you want, but it's not super-necessary. Resting the meat appropriately and not overcooking it is the best way to assure that your poultry is juicy.
If you use a meat thermometer, check the thigh and the breast to make sure the meat is done. The thigh should be 180 °F (82 °C) and the breast should be 160 when the meat is cooked through.
Check to make sure the juices run clear. The easiest way to check the doneness of chicken is to take a knife and poke it into the joint between the leg and the lower part of the breast. The juices should run clear. If it's pinkish and cloudy, the chicken needs more time.

Cure meat with salt.",How to Preserve Meat2," This is one of the oldest methods of preserving meat.


Use curing salt which can be purchased online through retailers such as butcher-packer.com, mortonsalt.com, and sausagemaker.com.Place pieces of meat in air-tight storage jars (or plastic storage bags), making sure to fully cover the meat with salt. Alternate layers of meat and salt to ensure all parts of the meat are covered in salt.Keep the jars/bags in a cool place (36-40 degrees Fahrenheit) for a month. Do not allow to freeze.Determine how long to salt cure meat using this formula: 7 days per inch of thickness. For example, a 12-14 pound ham which is 5 inches thick will need to cure for 35 days.Salt cured meat can last 3-4 months without refrigeration if kept in air-tight packaging such as plastic bags.
You will want to rinse the excess salt off the meat before cooking."
"
Make your own jerky.,
Use smoke to keep meat from spoiling.",How to Preserve Meat3," This can be done at home using your stove and oven. Cut meat into narrow strips with a cross section of 1cm x 1cm.Boil strips of meat on the stove for 3-5 minutes to get rid of bacteria.
Remove the meat from the water and let drain until dry.
Bake in an oven (on the lowest setting) for 8-12 hours.
You could also use a commercial food dehydrator instead of an oven.Properly dried meat will feel sticky, hard, or leathery.Meat dehydrated this way will last 1-2 months in air-tight containers without refrigeration.

, Smoking also adds flavor to meats.


Cure meat with salt before drying to extend shelf-life.
Smoke the meat in a smoker at 145 degrees Fahrenheit for 7 hours or 155 degrees Fahrenheit for 4 hours. Do not exceed 155 degrees Fahrenheit as this will cook the meat, not dry or smoke it.Some cuts of meat will take longer. For example, a brisket may take 22 hours to smoke thoroughly.Use a meat thermometer to make sure the meat reaches a safe temperature before removing from the smoker. Poultry should reach an internal temperature of 165 degrees F; pork and ground meats should be 160 degrees F; steaks, roasts and chops should be 145 degrees F.Commercial smokers use gas, electricity, charcoal or wood.Add wood such as mesquite, hickory, oak or cherry to add flavor to the meat.Smoked meats can last 1-2 months in air-tight containers.

Use the proper tools for canning.,
Can poultry to preserve it.,
Can ground or chopped meat.,
Can strips, chunks or cubes of meat.",How to Preserve Meat4," Make sure you have a pressure canner and canning jars.


Use a pressure canner (also known as a pressure cooker) to regulate the pressure during the canning process.Use good quality canning jars such as Mason jars.Hot, high-pressure steam cooks, seals and sterilizes the meat in the canning jars.
Fill the canner with 2-3 inches of water.
Start timing the canning process once the pressure gauge reaches the desired level.Once the process is complete, remove the canner from heat and allow to cool.
Do not open until fully cool and depressurized naturally. Forcing cooling by running cold water on the canner can result in food spoilage and warping of the canner lid.Canned food stored in a cool, dry place can last up to a year., Use either the hot pack or raw pack method.Hot pack the poultry. Boil, steam or bake meat until about two-thirds done. Add 1 teaspoon salt per quart to the jar, if desired. Fill jars with pieces and hot broth, leaving 1-1/4 inch headspace.
Raw pack the poultry. Add 1 teaspoon salt per quart, if desired. Fill jars loosely with raw meat pieces, leaving 1-1/4 inch headspace. Do not add liquid.
You can leave the bones in or take them out. If the bones are in, the canning time will take longer.This method also works for rabbit.

Cook the roast.,
Increase the temperature to sear the meat.",How to Reverse Sear Meat1," Start with a 5 to 6 pound roast. If it has bones, the roast will probably have about 3 bones extending out from it. Rub the entire roast with a quick brine mixture and set it in a roasting pan. Chill the roast for at least 8 hours so the brine has a chance to flavor the meat. For a brine, try mixing together:1 1/2 tablespoons of kosher salt
3/4 teaspoon of dried herbs (like thyme, sage, and rosemary, or a blend)
1/4 teaspoon of freshly ground black pepper;
, Remove the roast from the refrigerator and let it sit out for 2 hours at room temperature. This will help the roast cook evenly. Turn the oven on to 225 degrees F (107 C) while you wait for the meat.You should also move the rack to the lower third of the oven. This will ensure that you have space to set the roast.

, Put the roast in the preheated oven and cook it for 3 1/2 to 4 hours or until it has an internal temperature that you're going for. For example, if you want a medium-cooked roast, cook the roast until it reaches 130 degrees F (54 C). Remove the roast once it's as cooked as you'd like and let it rest for 30 minutes.Cover the roast with foil as it rests. This will help it retain heat and finish cooking.
Use an instant read thermometer to get accurate temperature measurements.

, To get that great crispy crust on your roast, turn the oven temperature up to 500 degrees F (260 C) while the roast rests. Move the rack of the oven up as high as you can while still being able to fit the roast. Once the roast has rested and the oven is preheated, remove the foil and place the roast back in the oven. Roast the meat for 8 to 10 minutes.The roast should crisp up and turn dark brown as it sears.

",How to Reverse Sear Meat2," Create a 2-zone setup for your charcoal grill. To do this, heat your coals and carefully push them to one side of the grill. This will give you an empty or cool side where there are no coals.


If you'll be using a gas grill, turn one half or side of the grill on and keep the other side of the grill off. This will give you a 2-zone setup., Place your steaks on the side of the grill that doesn't have coals underneath it. Grill the steaks until they come about 10 degrees lower than the overall temperature you want. For example, if you want the steaks to be finished around 130 degrees F (55 C) for medium rare, cook the steaks over indirect heat until they're at 120 degrees F (49 C). This will allow the meat to slowly come up to the proper temperature.You'll need to use an instant read thermometer to monitor the temperature of the steak.

, When the internal temperature of the meat is almost where you'd like it, use tongs to carefully move the steaks to the side of the grill with the coals. Grill the steaks over direct heat for several minutes so the outsides char and seal in the flavor.You can turn the steaks while you're finishing them. If you turn them slightly, you'll be able to make hash marks.

, Take the temperature of the steaks to determine if they're to your liking. Once they're at the right temperature, take the steaks off of the grill and set them on a serving plate. Let them sit for 10 minutes before you slice and serve the steaks. This will allow the juices redistribute within the meat. Use these temperatures as guidelines:Rare: 120 to 130 degrees F (49 to 54 C)
Medium-rare: 130 to 140 degrees F (54 to 60 C)
Medium: 140 to 150 degrees F (60 to 66 C)

Add your stock, canned tomato, thyme, rosemary, and bay leaves, then nestle in the veal shanks.,
Bring to a boil, cover the pot, then transfer everything quickly to the preheated oven.,
Flip the veal shanks after an hour of cooking, then cook for another hour.,
Remove the veal once it is tender enough to tear apart with a fork.,
Cook the remaining liquid back on the stovetop on medium heat until it thickens to your liking.,
Plate one veal shank per person, topping with vegetables and sauce just before serving.",How to Make Veal Osso Buco1," Veal osso buco is a braised dish, meaning it is cooked over direct heat (stovetop) and then slowly finished by cooking in a liquid bath (oven), keeping the meat tender. While you'll start the dish on the stovetop, you want the oven to be ready for you., Rub salt and ground black pepper on all sides of the veal shanks. Place a small amount of flour on a plate and then dip the veal shanks into it, brushing off any excess. You simply want a thin dusting of flour., Dutch ovens are the thick, heavy pots with an enamel coating over them. The come with big heavy lids and are safe for the both the stovetop and the stove. The oil should sizzle as soon as the meat hits it, otherwise it was not hot enough yet., You'll likely have to cook them veal in two batches. Once the oil is hot, put the veal in and let it cook for 4-5 minutes before turning. When each piece is evenly browned on the outside, return it to a clean plate to wait.

Remember -- this is only browning the outsides. The meat is not finished cooking yet, and you don't want to overcook it on the stove.

, With the veal finished, it is time to make your vegetable braising sauce. The butter will provide some fat and creaminess to cook the veggies in., Add a pinch of salt as the veggies hit the pan, then stir and cook for 5-6 minutes, or until everything is soft and translucent. Depending on your stove, this could take up to 10 minutes, so don't rush it.

If you're a fan of garlic, 2-3 whole peeled cloves as well, cooking with everything else.
Some recipes also call for 1 chopped leak, if you desire it., You want to let the wine cook until about half of it is gone. As soon as it hits the pan, use your wooden spoon to scrape up the browned, cooked bits on the bottom of the pot. This process is called ""deglazing.""

While red wine is more traditional, white makes a slightly different, but equally delicious, dish.

, Start with the rest of your ingredients, then tuck the veal in so that they are almost completely surrounded and covered with liquid. The pot will be packed, but that is a good thing. Make sure the liquid covered at least three-quarters of each shank., Bring your liquid around the veal to a boil, then cut the heat to the stove. Cover the pot and slide it into the oven for an hour., Use this time to look at the liquid as well. If it is getting low (lower than three-quarters down the veal), add another half cup or so of stock to bring the levels back up., Place it on a platter and cover it loosely with tin foil. The meat should be unbelievably tender, with the veal falling off the bone and the meat pulling away without resistance. Once it's done, turn off the oven and pull the veal shanks out, setting aside.

Meat should always ""stand"" after cooking. As it cools, liquid inside the meat reabsorbs into the protein fibers, leading to a more tender and flavorful dish., This usually only takes 4-5 minutes, depending on how thick you like your osso buco, so don't worry about the veal getting cold. Since the sauce pours right on top of the meat, you don't want it to be watery-thin. Furthermore, the longer sauce cooks, the richer and more flavorful it becomes.

If you've overcooked it a bit, never fear! A quarter-cup of water stirred in over low heat will bring it back to life., Simply ladle up a heap of your braising vegetables and liquid and pour it over the meat to serve it. Alternatively, place the veal shanks back in the liquid and serve the whole thing family style, letting the meat fall off the bone and into the delicious serving sauce."

Pierce through the tough skin and the top layer of fat, but do not cut too deeply into the actual meat lying beneath the two.
Scoring the meat in this manner will allow more of the fat to render out during the roasting process.

, Place the pork belly on your prepared baking rack with the skin-side facing up. Rub the top with oil, then generously season the meat with salt and pepper.


In addition to seasoning the meat, the oil and salt make it easier for the fat to render out, resulting in crispier skin.
Apply the seasonings by hand, and work the salt and pepper into the slits across the skin.
Note that salt and pepper should withstand the roasting process without deteriorating, but other spices and herbs might burn. If you decide to add others, do so within the final 30 minutes of cooking.

, Place the seasoned pork belly in the preheated oven. Roast it for 20 to 30 minutes, or until the skin browns and begins to look crispy.


This brief period of high heat will not cook the pork through, nor should you cook the pork belly at this high heat for the entire time. The intense heat is only meant to crisp the skin.
Do not wait for the skin to become dark brown or fully crisped since it will continue cooking at a lower temperature. Cooking it for too much time at a high heat could cause it to burn before the rest of the meat finishes.

, Decrease the temperature without removing the pork belly. Allow the meat to cook for another 2 to 2-1/2 hours, or until done.Check the pork belly halfway through the cooking process. If the fat gets too hot, it may start to smoke, and you'll need to transfer the meat to a clean baking dish.

Consider marinading the meat before grilling it.,
Bring the pork to room temperature before grilling.,
Season the meat on the outside immediately before grilling.,
Start the grill 20 or 30 minutes before grilling tenderloin.",How to Grill Pork Tenderloin1," Tenderloin is a very lean meat, making it easy to dry out and make tough, regardless of how you cook it, especially if you're worried about cooking it well-done because you're concerned about freshness. It's perfectly fine to cook pork to medium if you've purchased fresh meat from a reputable source, and it'll be much more delicious to buy it and cook it right away, when the meat is at its peak freshness.


Discard pork with any grayness or discoloration, and with any strange odor. Fresh pork should be bright pink and should have no noticeable odor.
Trichinosis, a parasite once common in undercooked and raw pork products, has been virtually eradicated in commercially-available pork. In the US, there are roughly 11 cases of trichinosis reported each year, most of which are contracted from wild game, not pork you bought at the store. While it's not necessary to char the heck out of pork for fear of this stomach bug, pork is as susceptible to spoilage as any meat.;
, Tenderloin should be mostly pink and clean, with few bits of connective tissue or fat attached. If you get a piece that does have some, trim it off and discard it.


Do not rinse raw meat in the sink, which can spread bacteria around your clean kitchen. Simply pat it dry with a paper towel, if there are any undesirable bits stuck to it.

, Because tenderloin is such a lean meat, it's particularly amenable to marinades, rubs, and different seasoning combinations. Rub the meat with the marinade of your choice. This might include your own blend of spices or a ready-made marinade from the store. Store the meat in a covered bowl or in a zip-lock bag, then refrigerate overnight, or for at least 4 hours before grilling. Some good flavor combinations for pork tenderloin include:



For classic sweet-sour pork marinade, mix a quarter-cup of olive oil, a clove of minced garlic, and a tablespoon each of brown mustard, soy sauce, brown sugar, with a teaspoon of red pepper flakes if desired. Vary the amounts to taste. Rub into the meat and refrigerate overnight, turning the meat periodically.

For a spicy-sweet marinade, mix a cup of orange juice, a tablespoon of tomato paste and Dijon mustard, and a teaspoon each of garlic powder, chilli powder, white sugar, paprika, and Worcestershire sauce. Add a handful of chopped cilantro to the mix.

For a sweet barbecue-style marinade, mix 2/3 cup of molasses and a half cup of brown sugar, a half teaspoon each of red pepper flakes, allspice, salt and pepper, then add 2-4 tablespoons of apple cider vinegar.

, After marinating your pork in the cool refrigerator all night, you need to let it sit out on the counter for an hour or so before putting it on the heat, to bring the temperature down and ensure a more even cooking. If the meat is cold through before you put it on the grill, it'll cook unevenly, and it'll be difficult to cook it all the way through without over-cooking it.


When you go outside to light the grill, make sure that your pork is sitting out on the counter. That should give you enough time to make sure the meat will warm up gently, rather than go onto the grill stone-cold.

, Some tenderloin lovers like to remove the pork from the marinade and add a dry rub just before the meat goes on the grill. Depending on what you've marinaded the meat in, or if you've marinaded it at all, you might opt for a stronger or simpler rub, depending. A dry rub can help to create a caramelized crust that can add a different layer of flavor to the meat. You can use commercial dry rubs, or make up your own. Whatever you use, take a handful of spice and simply rub it into the meat after adding a bit of olive oil to the outside so it sticks.Simple seasoning: Rub the tenderloin with about a tablespoon or two of olive oil, then sprinkle the outside liberally with kosher salt and fresh black pepper.

Dried spice seasoning: Rub the tenderloin with a tablespoon or two of olive oil, and a mixture of a teaspoon each of oregano, cumin powder, coriander powder, garlic powder, and thyme.

Fresh herb seasoning: Rub the tenderloin with a tablespoon or two of olive oil, then toast up a tablespoon each of fennel seeds, mustard seeds, and coriander seeds in a dry skillet. When they get fragrant, remove them from the pan and crush them in a mortar and pestle, or crush them with the flat side of a kitchen knife. Mix with a teaspoon of red pepper flakes, two tablespoons of fresh chopped rosemary, and salt and pepper to taste. Massage into the pork.

, When your meat's ready to go, you should start the grill about an hour before you plan on eating. You want to give the grill about 20 or 30 minutes to heat up to the proper temperature (it'll be quicker with a gas grill) and about 20 minutes total cooking time, with ten minutes for resting. Start it about an hour before you want to eat so you won't' have to rush around.



On the gas grill, you can probably get away with starting the grill a few minutes before you put the meat on. You want to have a cooler spot on the grill, though, so heat a section to one side so you can move the meat elsewhere and let it cook slowly over indirect heat.

On the charcoal grill, pile your coals to one side of the grill and let them reduce to a nice charred ashy glow before you put the meat on. This way, you'll be able to sear them over the coals and move them to the other side of the grill to finish them.

Preheat the oven to 250 degrees Fahrenheit (120 degrees Celsius).,
Place your seasoned ribs in the baking pan.,
Bake for 2 hours.,
Coat the ribs with sauce.,
Reduce heat and continue baking.",How to Cook Country Style Ribs," Use a sharp knife to cut any ribs that are 5 inches (12.7 cm) or longer in half.Country ribs are often 1 foot (30.5 cm) or longer. For especially long ribs that are over 1 foot (30.5 cm) in length, you can even cut them into three equal parts. Slicing long country ribs crosswise will make it easier to handle them.;
, Place the ribs cut-side down between two sheets of plastic wrap or wax paper. Use a meat tenderizer to pound the ribs until they are 3/4 inch (1.9 cm) thick.


This step is optional, but pounding the meat allows it to cook faster and makes it more tender upon consumption.

, Pour the cold water into a large bowl and stir the salt in until it completely dissolves, creating a basic brine.

, Cover the bowl with a lid, plastic wrap, or aluminum foil and refrigerate for 30 minutes to an hour.


To save time, you can salt the ribs directly instead of soaking them in a brine. Spread a coat of vegetable oil over the ribs with a basting brush. Generously salt the ribs, focusing on the fatty areas. As the fat renders during the cooking process, the salt will make it especially flavorful.

, Combine the brown sugar, chili powder, paprika, dry mustard, onion powder, black pepper, and cayenne pepper in a shallow dish, mixing the ingredients until evenly distributed.


Transfer half of the mixture to a small bowl and stir in the ketchup and vinegar until well blended.

, After removing the ribs from the brine, pat them dry with paper towels and liberally coat the ribs in your remaining spice rub. Set aside on a clean plate.

, It is important to soak the wood chips before use to control the fire and create enough smoke for the ribs.


Each type of wood will contribute different undertones to the flavor of the smoke. For instance, hickory has a strong, smoky flavor, while oak is a little more mellow. Mesquite has strong earthy undertones, while wood from fruit trees like apple or cherry have notably light, sweet flavors., Cut several small holes in the top of the foil packets to vent.


Wrapping the wood chips is another measure used to control the heat of the wood. Venting the foil allows smoke to escape, which is the desired result.

, While it is still cool, oil the grate by rubbing it down with vegetable oil or by spraying it with nonstick cooking spray.

, Get all the burners hot before turning off the heat to all but the primary burner.


Place the packet of wood chips over the primary burner.
Turn on all the burners, setting the heat to high. Allow the grill to preheat until the wood chip packet begins to smoke. This should take about 15 minutes.
Leave the primary burner on, set to high, and turn off the other burners.

, Heat the charcoal and wood chips on one side of the grill.


Evenly spread 6 quarts (6 liters) of charcoal briquettes over half the grill and set to flame with lighter fluid and a grill lighter.
When the top coals are partially covered in ash, place the wood chip packet over the coals.
Set the grate in place, cover the rill, and open the vent halfway. Continue preheating the grill for an additional 5 minutes or until the wood chips have begun to smoke.

, Cover and cook for 90 minutes untouched.Country style ribs can be cooked faster, but slow cooking them is best because it causes the fat to render and will create a smoother taste.

, After the first 90 minutes, use a basting brush to liberally coat both sides of the ribs with your sauce.


Apply additional coats of sauce in the same manner ever 30 minutes.

, Once this occurs, add another coating of sauce and move the ribs to the hot side of the grill.

, Cook the ribs on the hot side of the grill for 2 to 5 minutes or until lightly charred.


Check the internal temperature of the ribs by sticking a meat thermometer into the center of the thickest rib. The internal temperature should read 145 degrees Fahrenheit (63 degrees Celsius).

, Allow the ribs to rest off the grill for 5 to 10 minutes before serving.

, Coat a shallow baking pan or roaster with nonstick cooking spray.


You may also line the baking pan with nonstick aluminum foil.

, Arrange the ribs in a single layer, evenly spread apart.

, The ribs should become tender.


Drain any grease or liquid before proceeding to the next step.

, Use all the sauce, spreading it over the ribs generously and evenly.

, Reduce the heat to 200 degrees Fahrenheit (93 degrees Celsius) and continue cooking for an additional hour.


When finished, check the internal temperature of the ribs with a meat thermometer to verify that it is at least 145 degrees Fahrenheit (63 degrees Celsius).

Turn on the broiler and season the pork loin steaks.,
Broil the first side of the steaks.,
Turn the steaks and broil the bottom sides.,
Rest the steaks before you serve them.",How to Cook Pork Loin Steaks2," If you have a top-oven broiler, move the top rack so that it's 3 to 5 inches from the broiler. Turn the broiler on to hi and let it heat for about 10 minutes. Generously salt and pepper both sides of your pork loin steaks. You could also sprinkle them with:Ground fennel
Garlic powder
Onion powder
Ground cumin

, Cover a baking or roasting pan with foil so that it's easier to clean up. Set the seasoned pork loin steaks on the foil and place the pan under the broiler. Broil the steaks for 6 to 8 minutes. Keep in mind that thinner steaks will cook quicker while thicker steaks may take longer.If your steaks are more than 1 1/2 inches thick, consider broiling them 4 or 5 inches away from the heat source. This will prevent the outside from burning before the inside has a chance to cook.

, Carefully use tongs to flip the pork loin steaks over on the baking pan. Place the steaks back under the broiler and continue to broil them for another 6 to 8 minutes or until the steaks are golden brown.Remember to wear oven mitts and use caution when pulling the baking pan out of the oven.

, Once the pork loin steaks have browned on both sides, remove the pan and check the internal temperature of the steaks. The steaks should be between 145 degrees F (60 C) and 160 F (70 C) before you let them rest. Let them rest for 5 minutes before you serve them.Resting the steaks helps relax the muscle so the juices evenly distribute.

Heat the grill and season the steaks.,
Place the steaks on the grill.,
Turn and grill the other side.",How to Cook Pork Loin Steaks3," Turn your gas grill on to medium heat. If you have a charcoal grill, heat the coals and dump the coals in the center of the grate. Sprinkle the pork loin chops with salt and pepper on both sides. Squeeze juice from half a lime over the pork chops and brush them with 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil.While you can season the steaks with salt and pepper ahead of time, avoid squeezing the lime juice over them until right before you put them on the grill.

, Ensure that the grill's grate is clean and place your seasoned pork loin steaks on the grate. If you're using a charcoal grill, place them over direct heat (right above the coals). If your steaks are about 3/4"" thick, cook them for 4 to 6 minutes.


If your steaks are thicker (around 1 1/2""), cook them longer. They'll need closer to 10 minutes for the first side.

, Use tongs to carefully turn over the steaks. Once you've flipped the steaks, let them finish cooking. Grill the 3/4"" steaks for another 4 to 6 minutes or grill the 1 1/2"" steaks for another 10 minutes. Check the steak temperature to see if they're between 145 degrees F (60 C) and 160 F (70 C). Let them rest for 5 minutes before you serve them.If you'd like to get decorative grill marks, consider turning the steaks at a about a 90 degree angle during the last few minutes of grilling. This will give your steaks cross-hatches.

Choose the pork loin steaks.,
Store the pork loin steaks in the fridge.,
Serve the pork loin steaks.",How to Cook Pork Loin Steaks4," Decide how many people you'll be cooking for and determine how much pork you need. Plan on buying 4 ounces of pork loin steaks for each person. Look for pork that's pinkish-red in color and has a little marbled fat.Avoid choosing pork loin steaks that have a dark bone or dark spots on the fat.

, If you won't be cooking the pork loin steaks as soon as you get home, you can refrigerate them for 2 to 4 days if they're in pre-packaged containers. If they're not or you want to store them for longer, consider freezing them.To freeze the steaks, completely wrap them in a freezer-safe material (like freezer paper or aluminum foil) and remove as much of the air as you can. Label the steaks and freeze them at 0 degrees F (-17 C) until you need them.

, Since pork loin steaks can make a light meal, you can serve more filling sides like rice, beans, and potatoes. Or you can keep the meal light and serve the steaks with roasted vegetables or a tossed salad. Other serving sides include:


Coleslaw
Sweet potatoes
Red cabbage with apples
Collard greens
Pureed white beans

Season the pork belly overnight.,
Score the skin.,
Heat the olive oil in a skillet.,
Sear all sides of the meat.,
Place the ingredients in the slow cooker.,
Cook on high for 4 to 5 hours.,
Serve hot.",How to Cook Pork Belly2," Rub all sides of the pork belly with the salt, pepper, and chili powder. Wrap the meat in plastic wrap, then let it sit in your refrigerator overnight.Mix the spices together in a small dish before rubbing them over the surface of the pork belly. Doing so will ensure an even distribution of each spice.
If you're short on time, you don't have to let the pork sit overnight. Doing so can help tenderize the meat and improve the flavor, but it will still cook just fine if you season the meat and immediately proceed to the next step.

, Using a sharp knife, cut parallel diagonal lines across the skin-side of the pork belly. Cut a series of perpendicular diagonal lines over the first set, creating a cross-hatch pattern.


Scoring the skin will help the fat render as the meat cooks. Try to cut through both the skin and top layer of fat, but don't cut too deeply into the meat beneath these top two layers.

, Pour the olive oil into a large skillet and set the pan over medium-high heat.


Wait roughly 60 seconds for the oil the become adequately hot. Carefully turn the pan so that the hot oil coats the entire bottom.

, Place the pork belly in the hot oil. Sear each side for 60 seconds, or until it looks light brown and crispy.


You need to sear the thin sides of the pork belly, too. This may require you to hold the pork belly in place with tongs.
The pork belly won't crisp up much in the slow cooker, which is why you should brown the skin on the stove before cooking the rest of the meat.

, Spread the carrots and sweet potatoes over the bottom of the slow cooker. Place the pork belly on top, then pour the apple cider vinegar over everything else.


If desired, you can use other root vegetables instead of sweet potatoes and carrots. Brussels sprouts, potatoes, and turnips are other popular options.

, Cover the slow cooker and switch it onto its high heat setting. Allow the pork belly to cook until done—roughly 4 to 5 hours.When ready, the pork belly should reach a minimum internal temperature of 160 degrees Fahrenheit (70 degrees Celsius).

, Switch off the heat and allow the pork belly to rest for 10 minutes before carving it. The meat should be very tender and moist when you do cut into it.


Store leftovers in an airtight container kept in the refrigerator. You can reheat the leftover slices in a skillet so that the skin stays crispy.

Heat the dry skillet.,
Cut the pork belly into slices.,
Brown the pork belly.,
Add the seasonings.,
Reduce the heat and continue cooking.,
Serve hot.",How to Cook Pork Belly3," Set a large skillet on the stove over medium-high heat. Do not add any oil to the skillet.Since pork belly contains so much fat, adding extra oil isn't necessary. You can do so to speed up the browning process, but be aware of the fact that the addition of extra oil increases the likelihood of oil splatters.

, Using a sharp knife, cut the pork belly into 1/4 to 1/2 inch (6 to 12 mm) thick slices.


You do not need to score the skin when pan frying pork belly. Cutting the meat into slices exposes enough of the fat, so it should render well enough even in spite of the thick skin layer.

, Place the slices of pork belly in the hot pan and cooking, turning often, until both sides of each slice are golden-brown and crispy.


The exact amount of time can vary depending on how crowded the pan is, but 4 to 5 minutes per side will usually be enough time.
Use tongs to carefully turn and rotate the slices. If the oil begins to splatter, use a splatter screen to minimize the mess.

, Once the pork belly is well-browned, drain the excess fat and add the honey, soy sauce, and oyster sauce, and garlic.If puddles of fat remain on the slices of pork belly even after you drain the pan, you may need to dab off the excess fat using clean paper towels.
Consider mixing the seasoning ingredients together in a separate bowl before adding them to the pan. Doing so can ensure an even distribution of flavors.

, Reduce the heat to medium, then continue cooking until the sauce thickens and coats the pork belly like a glaze.


You'll need to continue flipping and rotating the slices so that all sides are coated in the sauce.
The exact amount of time may vary, but expect this part of the process to take roughly 2 to 3 minutes.

, Remove the pan from the heat and serve the pork belly slices with their glaze.


You can store leftovers in an airtight container kept in the refrigerator. Reheat them on the stove to maintain the crispy texture of the meat.

Sort through the beans and get rid of any small stones or other debris.
Rinse the beans with running water.
Soak the beans in 8 cups (2 L) of water inside a large covered saucepan. Allow them to soak overnight in a refrigerator.
When done, drain the water and rinse the beans once more.

, Pour the vegetable oil into a Dutch oven and warm it over medium-high heat. Give the oil a few minutes to become hot.


When at the right heat, the oil should look even glossier than normal and should glide around the pan even more readily.
Note that if you do not have a Dutch oven, a large, heavy stockpot with a lid will also work.

, Add the ham hocks to the hot oil in batches, searing them on all sides until the meat turns brown. This should take roughly 4 to 6 minutes.


Remove the ham hocks when browned and temporarily set them aside in a warm, sanitary spot.

, Add the chopped onions to the hot oil and sprinkle with ground black pepper, to taste. Sauté, stirring frequently, for about 2 minutes.


When done, the onions should look translucent and smell even more fragrant.
If you do not know how much pepper to use, start with a small amount like 1/8 tsp (0.6 ml) rather than a larger one.

, Stir the soaked and drained beans into the Dutch oven, along with the bay leaf. Add more pepper, if desired. Sauté for another 1 minute.

, Place the ham hocks back into the Dutch oven and fill with 5 cups (1250 ml) water. Bring to a boil.

, After the water reaches a boil, reduce the heat to medium-low and let it simmer, covered, until the meat falls off the bones and the beans take on a creamy consistency.


Remove the bay leaf when done.
Note that if you would prefer a simpler version of this recipe, you could add all the ingredients into a slow cooker as soon as you finish soaking and draining the beans. Cover and cook for 8 hours on high., Sprinkle with additional salt and pepper and serve while still warm.

, Let the ham hocks sit in the still-boiling water until the meat begins to fall off the bones.


Add more water to the pot as it starts boiling down. The ham hocks should always be completely covered throughout the cooking process.
The ham hocks need to be completely cooked before you add the collard greens.

, Separate the leaves and rinse each one under cool, running water. Stack the leaves on top of each other and roll them together. Cut each roll into thin strips using a cutting board and large kitchen knife.


If using frozen greens instead of fresh greens, you may not need to separate the leaves, but the leaves should still be thawed and rinsed.
Rinse each leaf individually. Do not rinse them all at once.
Rolling the leaves and chopping them up in that form can save you time.

, Add as many collard greens to the boiling water as possible until the pot is full. Cook until they begin to wilt.

, Once your initial batch of collard greens wilts, you can add the remaining greens in batches. Continue adding the greens in batches, waiting for one batch to wilt before adding the next.


Note that you should not remove any of the greens after you add them and after they wilt down.

, Sprinkle salt into the water, stir, and continue cooking for another 30 minutes on medium heat.


Stir the contents of the pot occasionally so that the taste of the smoked ham hock spreads throughout the dish.

Sear the pork for 2 minutes on each side.,
Move the meat to the cooler side of the grill.,
Cook for approximately 20 minutes.,
Remove your pork tenderloin from the grill and let it rest for 15 minutes.,
Slice the pork into 3⁄4 inch (1.9 cm) thick portions and serve immediately.",How to Grill Pork Tenderloin2," Place whole tenderloin first on the hottest side of the grill, closing the lid and letting each side sear for about 2 minutes over the direct heat. Leave it alone. After the time has elapsed, turn the meat one quarter-turn, letting the next side sear. Depending on the size of your tenderloin and the shape of the cut, you may do this four times, or fewer. Once the meat has developed a nice brownish char on the outside, you can move it to the cooler part of the grill and let it cook longer at a slightly less severe temperature.

, On a charcoal grill, move your pork to the side away from the coals, positioning the meat so that it's not in direct heat. On an electric grill, position the meat next to the heated grate. Close the lid to trap the heat in the grill, leaving the top-vent on your grill about half open, if your grill has one.Many grillers get nervous closing the lid, thinking something terrible is going to happen if you can see the meat the whole time. Try to let go of this concern. Grilling over extremely high heat with the grill open is inefficient and uneven, making it easy to dry out the pork and overcook it. Use the grill the way it was meant to be used: close the lid, set a timer, and kick back while the meat cooks.

, Over the course of the cooking time, you might open the grill once or twice to turn the pork over and make sure it isn't drying out. Keep an eye on the coals to make sure the heat stays up and the temperature in the grill remains relatively constant, but try not to fiddle with it too much. Leave the meat alone and let it cook. After 20 minutes, it should be close to done.


If you use a meat thermometer, the internal temperature should be somewhere between 140 to 155 degrees F (68 degrees C)., Put your meat on a cutting board, or a platter, and cover with tin foil to let the meat rest before carving it up. It'll be much juicer and more tender if you let it sit for a couple of minutes. Resist the urge to dig in!


Meat isn't rested because it's too hot to eat, it's rested to make it more tasty. Meat should be rested to give the exterior a chance to cool slightly, so the juices will reabsorb into the cut, making the meat more flavorful. If you cut into the meat right away, the juices will run all over the plate and you'll lose a lot of flavor., After resting, slice your tenderloin into thick portions, as much as an inch thick, and serve immediately. Pork tenderloin is often great paired with:


roasted green beans
oven potatoes
grilled sweet corn
homemade applesauce

"
While cool, slice tenderloin into steaks an inch-and-a-half thick.,
Season both sides of the meat liberally.,
Sear the pork on each side.,
Serve grilled tenderloin on a bun, sandwich style.",How to Grill Pork Tenderloin3," If you'd rather grill up individual portions to account for particular tastes, want to make grilled tenderloin sandwiches, or you just want to experiment with a few different seasonings, you can remove the tenderloin from the marinade and slice into portions before grilling. Slice 3/4 to an inch thick.


Consider pounding out the steaks to about a half-an-inch, using a meat tenderizer. Place each steak under a clean towel, then use a tenderizing hammer to bang out the steaks and flatten them. In the Midwest, pork tenderloins are pounded out to almost comically-large sizes, roughly the size of a plate. Put together on a bun, the resulting sandwich should resemble nothing so much as the planet Saturn. It's a state fair classic.
Cutting into steaks and pounding out the meat should be done after the meat has been marinaded, just before you're about to grill them. Don't try to marinade pounded-out tenderloin.

, Before grilling, sprinkle your desired seasoning on both sides of the steaks, or simply dress them with a brushing of olive oil, salt, and pepper for a simple and perfect start to a tenderloin sandwich.

, Lots of flavor comes from searing the meat and creating nice grill marks on the outside of the steaks, then moving the steaks away from direct heat and covering the grill to let them cook for a few more minutes to finish the inside of the meat.


Cook for approximately 4 to 6 minutes on each side. If you want to check the temperature, it should be about 155 degrees F (68 degrees C) when it's time to remove the steaks from the grill.

, After your tenderloins rest for 10-15 minutes, under tin foil, serve them sandwich-style on buns topped with dill pickle, brown mustard, and raw white onion. That's eating.

Tie up the stuffed tenderloin.,
Grill normally.,
Let rest, then remove the twine.",How to Grill Pork Tenderloin4," Take a sharp knife and cut the pork lengthwise, approximately 3/4 of the way through. Open the cut, flattening the meat out as much as possible.


If you want, you can take a meat tenderizer and hammer out the pork slightly, to open up the tenderloin to hold all the stuffing. Depending on how much stuffing you make, it might be necessary. You'll end up tying it up anyway, so feel free to flatten it out considerably.

, Stuffing tenderloin with a mixture of dry bread, cheese, bacon, and vegetables can up the ante considerably. If you want to kick grilled tenderloin up a couple of notches, stuffing it is the way to go. You can experiment with ingredients that you like, or go with a few tried-and-true standards.



Bacon-mushroom stuffing: In a skillet, crisp up 3-4 slices of bacon, then add two cups of white button mushrooms, and a pinch of salt. Let the mushrooms sit untouched for one minute, then stir to coat them in the mixture and cook until soft. Add 2 cloves of minced garlic and cook until soft. To this, add 2-3 tablespoons of dried breadcrumbs, and a handful of fresh chopped parsley to complete the stuffing mixture.

Italian Spinach stuffing: In a food processor, add a cup of fresh baby spinach leaves, a half cup of fresh basil, two cloves of garlic, and 2-4 tablespoons of grated parmesan cheese. Add a pinch of crushed red pepper, Italian seasoning, and a drizzle of balsamic vinegar to finish the stuffing.

Bacon-Wrapped Stuffed Tenderloin: In a bowl, combine a small finely chopped onion, 1-2 stalks of celery, 1-2 slices of dry toast, torn into small pieces, 3 tablespoons of melted butter, and salt, pepper, and oregano. Use this to stuff the tenderloin, then roll it up and wrap the whole thing with 6-8 strips of bacon, around the width of the meat. Tie it and grill it as normal. It's a delicious combo.

, After you've flattened it out slightly, you can spread an even layer of whatever stuffing you've mixed up over the inside of the meat, then either roll it up or truss it up, depending on how flat it is and how thick a layer of stuffing you've added.


If you want to roll up your tenderloin, spread a thin layer of stuffing on the meat, no more than a quarter inch or so. Start rolling the meat on the long flat side, tucking the stuffing on the inside, so it spirals. After you've rolled it up, tie it to keep it together.
If you want to keep the tenderloin more whole, don't pound it out, and stuff your stuffing into the butterfly cut as thickly as you want. Wrap it tightly in plastic wrap to get the shape to hold, then you can tie it up with twine before grilling.

, Wrap a piece of cooking twine around the width of the meat to close up the cut. You don't have to get fancy, just take a few short pieces of twine and tie at least three times around the meat, one in the middle, and one at each end.


If you don't have cooking twine, you can use some kebab skewers to pin the 2 sides of the meat together, pinching it closed. After the meat is cooked, remove the skewers and slice normally.

, Follow the basic instructions for grilling a whole tenderloin, browning on all sides, then cooking at a cooler part of the grill for about 20 minutes. If you've got a particularly-messy stuffing, you might move the tenderloin onto a piece of tinfoil after moving it to the cooler part of the grill, to collect the mess.


Take some care when you're testing the temperature of the meat, so you don't stick the reader into the stuffing, getting an inaccurate reading. The internal temperature of the meat, not the stuffing, should be between 140 and 155 degrees F (68 degrees C) according to a meat thermometer.

, Don't remove the twine right away, or the meat might start to unroll and come apart. Let the stuffed tenderloin rest normally and it'll hold it's shape. After 10 or 15 minutes, remove the twine and slice into inch-thick portions, and serve.

Rub the seasoning into the pork shoulder.,
Rub on the jerk marinade and leave it on the pork shoulder for at least 5 hours (overnight is recommended).,
The next morning, prepare a grill at a low temperature and barbecue the pork shoulder until it's nice and tender.,
Allow your roast to rest for 5-10 minutes before cutting.,
Feel free to serve it with hard dough bread, festival, fried dumplings, rice and peas, boiled yams and plantain, etc.",How to Make Jerk Pork," Leave for the pork shoulder for a minimum of 1/2 an hour (several hours is better).;
, The longer you leave it, the more the seasoning and flavour will penetrate the meat. Make sure you store it in the refrigerator in a well sealed container.

, This process can take many hours. If your pork has a layer of fat on it (which it should, for best taste), make sure to keep the fat on the TOP, not touching the grill. If you keep it on the grill, all the juice will fall out, and not into the meat. You can also use the indirect heat method of cooking. Heat one side of the grill, and keep the meat on the opposite side.

, This allows the meat to firm slightly, and retain it's tenderness. Chop the pork shoulder into bite size pieces when it is ready to serve. You can catch the drippings of the meat in a small pan and use it to make gravy for your meal. (While your meat is resting, in a small frying pan, start sauteing some diced onions with a small amount of cooking oil. When they start to brown, add your drippings from the roast. Allow the mixture to get hot. While this is going on, mix together 2 tbsp of all purpose flour with cold water, and mix well, until no lumps are in the mixture. Slowly add flour and water to your gravy until desired thickness is achieved. Allow gravy to cook for 5 minutes to that the flour taste is cooked out. You can add some of your left-over jerk seasoning to the gravy while it's cooking, for an extra hit of flavour).

Use a meat mallet.,
Use a tenderizing marinade.,
Brine the pork.,
Use a commercial meat tenderizer.",How to Tenderize Pork1," Cuts of pork are at their toughest when the muscle fibers making up the meat are long and intact. To begin tenderizing the pork before seasoning or cooking it, try breaking up the muscle fibers using a meat mallet (sometimes called a ""meat tenderizer""). These usually take the form of either a heavy hammer or mallet with a spiked surface used for beating the meat or a sharp-pronged tool used for stabbing into the meat. The goal is similar with either — simply bash or stab the meat to break up its muscle fibers.


If you don't have one of these specialty tools, don't sweat it. You can also use an ordinary fork or even your bare hands to get the same effect if you don't have a mallet handy. Stab, pummel, or mash the meat to break up the muscle fibers and make a more tender dish.;
, Marinades are a great way to both add flavor to meat and make it more tender. However, not all marinades are created equal — to tenderize pork, your marinade needs to contain either an acid or a tenderizing enzyme. Both of these types of chemicals break down the tightly coiled proteins in meat on the molecular level. However, using too much of either of these substances is a bad idea — too much acid can actually make meat tougher by denaturing its proteins and too much tenderizing enzyme can make meat mushy.Acids like citrus juices, vinegars, and wines are common in many pork marinade recipes. For instance, it's not uncommon to see red wine paired with soy sauce and other ingredients (like brown sugar) as a pork marinade.To avoid the toughening effect that can occur with strongly acidic marinades, you may want to use an acidic dairy product instead — yogurt and buttermilk are only mildly acidic and make great marinade bases for juicy, delicious pork chops.
Tenderizing enzymes can be found in the juices of several fruits. For instance, pineapple, which contains the enzyme bromelain, and papaya, which contains the enzyme papain, are both excellent tenderizing ingredients.However, it's important to remember that in high doses, these enzymes can work too well, producing mushy meat.

, Brining is a technique similar to marinating that is especially well-suited to lean cuts of pork (like loin chops). Brining involves soaking your meat in salt water to increase the tenderness and moistness of the final dish. Brines always contain salt and water, but can also include other ingredients for added flavor like apple cider, brown sugar, rosemary, and thyme. Because brining can give the pork a salty taste, generally, you'll want to avoid applying too much salt when eating your pork or applying a salty dry rub after brining.


For a great brine recipe, combine 1 gallon (3.8 L) water, 3/4 cup salt, 3/4 cup sugar, and black pepper to taste in a large bowl and stir to dissolve (heating the water in a pot can speed up the dissolving process). Add your pork to the bowl, cover, and refrigerate until you begin cooking.
Depending on the type of pork you're cooking, optimal brining times will vary. For instance, pork chops usually require about 12 hours to a full day, whole pork loin roasts can require several days of brining, and tenderloin can be ready in as few as six hours., Another option for tenderizing your pork is to use an artificial meat tenderizer. These meat-tenderizing substances usually come in the form of a powder but are also sometimes available as liquids. Often, the active ingredient in these tenderizers is papain, the natural meat-softening chemical found in papayas. As with papaya, it's important to remember not to over-use meat tenderizer or it's possible to get a piece of meat with an unpleasantly soft texture.


Always apply meat tenderizer sparingly. Lightly dampen the surface of your pork with water just before cooking, then sprinkle evenly with about 1 teaspoon of meat tenderizer per pound of meat. Pierce the meat with a fork at roughly 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) intervals and begin cooking.
If your meat tenderizer is labeled as ""seasoned"", it will usually contain salt — in this case, don't season with extra salt before cooking."

Mix up your curing brine.,
Put your meat into a brining bag.,
When the curing brine is cool, transfer it to the brining bag.,
Brine your ham in a cool place for 1 day for every 2 pounds of meat.,
After the recommended curing time, rinse the ham off under cold water.,
Set the ham down on a grated screen to drain for 24 hours.,
Make your glaze.,
Turn your smoker on and get it steady at 250° F (121° C).,
Smoke the ham at 250° F (121° C) for the first two hours.,
After two hours, turn the heat up to 325° F (163° C).,
During the final hour of the smoke, apply the glaze to the ham liberally every 15 minutes.,
Remove the ham from the smoker when the internal temperature at the deepest part of the ham reaches 165° F (74° C).,
Serve immediately, or store.",How to Smoke a Ham," Although you can dry-cure your ham, most hams are wet-cured. Instead of being rubbed with salt and sodium nitrite, they are submerged in a curing brine for about a week. Here, the liquid penetrates the meat and keeps it moist. Meanwhile, the salt and sodium nitrite in the liquid brine cure the meat, halting harmful bacteria and turning the meat slightly pink. In one gallon of water, bring the following ingredients to a boil and then allow brine to cool completely:









2 cups brown sugar
1 and 1/2 cups kosher salt
1/2 cup of pickling spice
8 teaspoons of pink salt (not to be confused with sodium nitrite). Pink salt is a mixture of salt and sodium nitrite. It is colored pink so it's not confused with regular table salt. If you were to use 8 teaspoons of sodium nitrite in this recipe, the result could be harmful.;
, You don't have to use a brining bag for brining, but it makes your job a lot easier. A brining bag will easily fit your ham, zip up for a cleaner brine, and minimize the cleanup time after you're done. If you don't have a brining bag, you can always use a clean (clean is especially important!) watercooler or container that's taller than the tallest point of the ham.









If you are using a container or cooler to brine your ham in, be sure to sterilize it beforehand with boiling water. The smallest contamination could cause off-flavors in your final dish.
If you're using a container or cooler instead of a brining bag, find something clean to weight the ham down with. You want all parts of the meat exposed to the brine.

, Be sure to get all the spices into the brining bag. Fill the brining bag with 1/2 - 1 gallon of cold water to dilute the concentrated brine and cover the ham. Mix thoroughly with a long wooden spoon.








, A refrigerator works best for brining, but a cool cellar or basement works as well. If you're brining a 15 lb. ham, for example, expect to spend about 7 1/2 days curing.









Periodically, remove the ham from the refrigerator and inject it with the brining liquid. Use a marinade injector for this. You only have to do this once or twice, at several locations in the ham. Injecting the brine into the meat of the ham will make sure that the curing salts penetrate the deepest parts of the ham.
When you're injecting the ham with the brine, take a little bit of time to inspect it. It shouldn't be giving off any strange odors, nor should there be any scum on the brining liquid., This will get rid of any salt that may have crystallized on the surface.








, Once the ham has drained, take a paper towel and wipe off any excess liquid. Store the ham in the refrigerator for up to a month before using.









If you do refrigerate the ham, be careful about what else is in your refrigerator. The fat on the ham, if there is some, will absorb other odors in your refrigerator. You might not want your Christmas ham smelling like leftover risotto.

, In this case, a glaze is a sugar-based coating adds extra flavor to the outside of the meat and absorbs smoke. Getting your glaze right is critical. For a cured ham, a sugary glaze will work best, as it cuts through the saltiness of the cure. Here's one recipe for a glaze you might want to experiment with:









In a saucepan over medium heat, mix together:

1 cup honey
1/4 cup whole-grain mustard
1/4 cup packed dark brown sugar
4 tablespoons unsalted butter (1/2 stick)Stir until butter is melted and ingredients are completely dissolved, about 3 to 4 minutes. Your glaze is ready to apply!

, While the smoker is heating up, score the ham with a sharp chef's knife to give it a diamond pattern. While this isn't necessary on all hams, it gives the ham a nice look when finished.








, Start off slow. Place the ham unadorned into the smoker, fat side up. Close the lid and smoke for 2 hours at a relatively low heat.








, Continue cooking the ham, monitoring its internal temperature closely with a thermometer.








, That makes four glazes during the final hour. You may wish to glaze the ham for longer than an hour, but the glaze will likely burn a bit. If you don't mind a darker look on some spots of your ham, go ahead!








, Total cooking time on the smoker will take 5 to 6 hours, depending on the size of the ham.








, A smoked ham like this will keep for 6 months or longer if vacuum sealed properly. Enjoy!

Preheat the oven to 375 F.;
,
Let the roast sit on the counter until it comes to room temperature.,
Season the meat liberally.,
Brown the meat on all sides.,
Add more seasonings if desired at this point.,
Lay the pork roast into a baking pan.,
Use an electronic meat thermometer with a probe if you have one.,
Remove the roast from the oven when the desired temp has been reached and allow to rest on the counter for at least five minutes.,
Remove the probe and carve into serving slices.",How to Roast a Pork Loin,", Cover it, of course, and allow the chill of the fridge to come off - it will cook more evenly.

, Salt and pepper are a miracle from God and the cosmos - even if you don't have anything else at hand, these will be wonderful (sprinkle on and rub them into the meat a little).

, Use a skillet big enough to accommodate the length of the roast, and use tongs to turn it, not a fork (don't be poking holes in it). Let it get nice and brown - about 3 minutes per side. Be sure the pan is really hot - don't stew the meat by putting it in a cold pan and then turning the heat up. Making sure the pan is hot will ensure that you get a nice sear and golden ""crust"" on the roast - and this will help keep it moist inside (which is why you don't want to be poking it full of holes - you want to keep the juices inside).

, Remove the roast from the sauté pan. You can add things like powdered garlic, thyme, or my favorite: 1/4 c. Dijon mustard mixed with 1 T. honey. Mix them well, then slather on the pork roast (after salt and pepper).

, (Not a cookie sheet, a proper baking pan like you would use to bake brownies).h

, These little gadgets have a probe attached to a wire which plugs into a timer. Insert the probe into the thickest part of the roast, making sure to keep it well centered. Set the thermometer for the temperature, not the ""meat"", desired (155F).

, This may be the most important step of all. Do not remove the probe! Residual heat will continue to cook the meat and the temp may rise another few degrees. Resting the meat like this gives the juices a chance to be reabsorbed into the roast. Don't slice it or poke it, and don't remove the probe - the roast will literally ""bleed to death"". In other words, all of the delicious juices will run out without being reabsorbed into the meat, and it will be dry and yucky.

, Do not carve more slices than you want to serve - leave the rest of the roast for the next meal, then carve and heat the slices gently in a microwave or sauté pan - because they are slices, they will come to temperature quickly, so be vigilant.

Check the temperature.",How to Reheat Ham in a Slow Cooker1," The outside of the ham will typically have a layer of fat beneath the skin. Using a sharp knife, shave away both the fat and the skin until you reach the pink meat. Do this for all sides of the ham until there is no longer any skin or excess fat., The first ingredient to go inside of the slow cooker is the ham. Place it with the flat side facing down. The rounded side should be facing up towards the cover of the pot.If you are using a bone-in ham that you have not warmed up before, check the end of the bone to see if there is a plastic cap attached. If so, remove the cap before cooking.

, The liquid will cook the ham while keeping it moist. There are many different types of cooking liquids you can use based on what type of taste you want to give the ham. Water is the easiest and most basic liquid, although it will not give any flavor.You can also try:


Chicken broth
Cola
Apple juice
Pineapple juice
Ginger ale

, Set the slow cooker to its low setting, and cover the pot. Most hams will reheat in between three and six hours, depending on their size.A three pound ham may take two and a half to three hours whereas a six or seven pound ham may take up to six., About an hour before the ham is finished, you should baste the ham using the juices that have collected at the bottom of the basin. Use a baster or a ladle to scoop up these juices, and pour them over the top of the ham to keep the ham moist.If you are glazing the ham, you can use any extra glaze to baste the ham.

, A reheated ham should have an internal temperature of at least 140 °F (60 °C). Use a meat thermometer, and stick it in the thickest part of the ham.

Let the meat rest after cooking.,
Cut the meat against the grain.",How to Tenderize Pork2," When it comes to cooking pork, a wide variety of cooking methods can give juicy, tender results as long as they're carried out properly. For instance, with thin cuts of pork like pork chops or sirloin cutlets, you may want to quickly cook the meat with high surface heat to give it a crisp, savory exterior, then transfer the pork to less-intense dry heat to finish cooking it. For instance, you might sear your pork in a hot pan on the stove (or on the grill), then transfer your pork to the oven (or move it to a cooler area of the grill and close the lid) for the rest of its cooking time.


The indirect heat is vital to keeping your pork tender and juicy. While searing is great for giving your pork a delicious exterior ""crust"", using direct heat to cook your pork completely can easily lead to a tough, over-cooked piece of meat. Indirect heat from an oven or a closed grill, however, gradually cooks the entire piece of meat, leading to a tender, evenly-cooked final product.
Since direct heat (like a hot pan) cooks the outside of your meat much quicker than it cooks the inside, you'll generally only need to cook for a minute or two per side to give your entire piece of meat a good searing. However, indirect heat (like from an oven) will take a longer time to cook your pork — usually about 20 minutes per pound., One sure-fire way to get a moist, tender piece of pork is to braise it. Braising is a slow, high-moisture cooking method that involves placing the meat in a mixture of liquid (and sometimes solid) ingredients and allowing it to simmer in the mixture for hours. Braising produces extremely moist, tender, and flavorful meat, so it's often the preferred method for cooking somewhat tougher cuts of pork, like shoulder cuts and country-style ribs. In addition, the liquid used for braising can be used as a sauce or gravy, which is handy for pork dishes served with rice or a similar side dish.


Though braising times for different pork cuts can vary, in general, you'll want to braise pork for about 30 minutes or so per pound (longer for tough meat or meat with lots of connective tissue).Often, braising recipes call for the meat to be seared or sauteed briefly before braising to give the meat a crispy exterior.

, Smoking is a very gradual, low-heat cooking method used to give many traditional barbecue dishes a distinct ""smoky"" flavor. There are a variety of ways to smoke meat, but, in general, most smoking processes involve burning special types of wood (like mesquite) in a closed container so that the meat is slowly cooked from the indirect heat. Over time, the wood gradually transfers its scent and flavor to the meat, leading to pork that's not only moist and juicy, but also has a unique taste that's hard to replicate with other cooking methods.


Since smoking can be expensive and time-consuming, it's usually reserved for big pieces of meat that require long cooking times (like brisket, pork shoulder roasts, etc.) and social events like barbecues and cookouts.
Smoking is a delicate art form for which many professionals use specialized equipment which can be quite expensive. However, it can also be accomplished with an ordinary barbecue grill. See How to Smoke Meat for a comprehensive guide to smoking meat.

, Using the gradual, moist heat of a stew pot, pressure cooker, or slow cooker can give you pork so tender that you don't need a knife to eat it. Stewing generally involves cooking the meat for long periods of time at low heat while it's submerged in a mixture of liquid and solid ingredients. Often, the meat in the stew is cut into small pieces so that every spoonful contains meat. As with braising, this type of cooking is great for softening up tough pieces of pork or cuts with lots of connective tissue (like shoulder cuts and country-style ribs).


Stewing times for pork can vary but are generally comparable to braising times.
Slow cookers (like crock pots, etc.) are especially convenient for stewing. Often, with these types of tools, all you need to do is put your ingredients in the cooker, turn it on, and let it cook for several hours without any extra work from you. Note, however, that if you're using vegetables in your stew, these should be added late in the cooking process, as they cook much faster than pork.

, If you're trying to get your pork as tender and juicy as possible, don't stop your work when the meat's done! One of the most important, but often overlooked practices in keeping meat moist and tender is the rest period. Regardless of the method you use to cook your pork, after removing it from the heat, let it sit undisturbed for about 10 minutes. You may want to cover it with a piece of foil to help keep it warm. Once the meat has had time to rest, it's ready to be enjoyed!


Cutting the meat without letting it rest first makes the meat less moist and tender. When you cook a piece of meat like pork, a great deal of the meat's internal moisture is ""squeezed"" out of the proteins that make up the meat. Giving the meat a short rest after cooking give the proteins time to re-absorb this moisture. This is why if you cut into a piece of meat that's hot off the grill, you'll see lots of juice immediately run out of the meat, but if you give it a chance to rest first, less juice spills out.

, If you're trying to get exceptionally tender pork, you should even take the way you cut it into account. To produce the most tender results possible, you'll want to cut the pork in thin slices against the grain of the meat. You'll know you're cutting against the grain if you see the cross-sections of individual fibers in the meat when examining it closely after cutting. Cutting against the grain breaks the muscle fibers into smaller sections one last time before the meat is eaten. You'll never be sorry you took this small extra precaution!


With extra-tender cooking methods like braising and stewing, your meat will generally be so soft that you won't need to bother with cutting against the grain. However, for big, thick cuts of pork that have been cooked on the grill or in the oven, you will want to cut against the grain to get your pork as tender as possible before serving it — this is why, at catered events where a large roast is on the menu, the staffer serving it will almost always make thin, diagonal cuts against the meat's grain.

Pick a cut from the loin.,
Pick a tenderloin cut.,
Pick a rib cut.,
Pick pork belly.,
Pick tougher cuts if you're willing to slow-cook.,
Pick less-common tender cuts.",How to Tenderize Pork3," When it comes to pork terminology , the word ""loin"" doesn't mean the same thing as it does for humans. The loin is a long strip of meat near the pig's spine that runs the length of the pig's back. In general, cuts of meat from the loin are some of the leanest, most tender cuts on the pig, so they're an excellent choice not only for those looking for soft, juicy pork, but also for a nutritious source of lean protein. Some common loin cuts are:Butterfly chops
Sirloin roasts
Sirloin cutlets
Loin chops
Loin roasts

, The tenderloin (sometimes called the ""pork fillet"") is a small subsection of the pig's loin that arguably produces the most tender pork of all. The tenderloin is a long, narrow, lean strip of muscle running along the upper insides of the animal's ribs. Because it is exceptionally juicy, tender, and lean, it's often one of the most expensive cuts of pork.Tenderloin is often sold:


On its own
In sliced pieces or ""medallions""
In a wrapped-up ""roast""

, A pig's rib cage extends from its spine down around to the edges of its belly and offers a variety of delicious, meaty cuts that vary in texture and flavor based on which part of the rib cage they're taken from. Rib cuts from the top of the rib cage (near the pig's spine) can resemble loin meat in that they're naturally somewhat lean, juicy, and tender. Cuts from the lower sections of the ribs (near the pig's belly) can also be quite tender when cooked correctly but are usually fattier and require longer cooking times to reach the perfect level of tenderness. Rib cuts include:


Baby back ribs
Spareribs
Country-style ribs
Rib chops

, As its name implies, pork belly is a very fatty, boneless cut of meat that's taken from the area over a pig's stomach. Many people are familiar with pork belly from eating bacon, which are thin slices of pork belly meat. Because it's so fatty, pork belly usually requires long, slow cooking in the oven or on the grill to become edible, but the results can be deliciously juicy and tender.Beside bacon and related products like pancetta (Italian bacon), pork belly often isn't sold at standard chain grocery stores. You may need to visit a butcher or specialty grocer to get a suitable cut of pork belly for your cooking project.

, Some of the most tender cuts of pork (especially from the loin) can be expensive. If you're shopping on a budget, you shouldn't feel any need to break the bank just to get deliciously tender pork. In fact, cheaper, tougher cuts (like those from the pig's shoulder region) can usually be made mouth-wateringly tender with slow, low-heat cooking methods. Below are just few cheap cuts of meat that can be made tender if cooked correctly:


Picnic shoulder
Shoulder roasts
Butt steaks
Boston butt

, If you're willing to experiment, certain less-well known parts of the pig offer the opportunity for tender, juicy pork dishes. These cuts may be somewhat uncommon in modern Western cuisine, but often are central to older recipes or traditional cooking styles. If you feel adventurous, talk to your butcher about getting your hands on these specialty cuts. Just a few non-conventional pork cuts that can be made tender (often with low-temperature slow cooking) are:Cheeks
Hocks
Trotters/feet
Tongue
Organs (liver, heart, etc.)

Slice the top of the ham.,
Mix the glaze.,
Reduce the glaze.,
Add the glaze to the ham.,
Place the ham under the broiler.",How to Reheat Ham in a Slow Cooker2," If the ham is not already sliced, you will need to make marks in the top of the ham before putting it in the slow cooker. Use a sharp knife to cut a grid or diamond pattern on the top of the ham. You should only cut 1/4 inch deep into the ham.This will allow the glaze to reach deep inside the meat.

, The glaze will both flavor the ham and keep it moist. You can use the glaze as a baste as well. Brown sugar, maple, pineapple, cloves, and honey are all popular ingredients in ham glazes. Some recipes you can use for a glaze include:



Maple Brown Sugar: 1 cup dark brown sugar, 1/2 cup pure maple syrupPineapple: 3/4 cup pineapple juice, 1 cup brown sugar, 1/3 cup Dijon mustard, 1/3 cup whole grain mustardHoney Mustard: 1/2 cup brown sugar,1/2 cup honey, 2 tablespoons Dijon mustard, 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves, If you want a thicker glaze, you can heat the glaze in a sauce pan on the stove. Keep the heat slow, and heat the glaze until the sugar dissolves. Stir as you heat to prevent the glaze from sticking to the bottom of the pan., The glaze can be added either before you start heating the ham or thirty minutes before the ham stops cooking.A glaze added sooner will impart more flavor the ham, but it may become thin and runny during cooking. A glaze added towards the end will sit at the top of the ham, but it will be thicker. Decide what your preference is, and add the glaze at the appropriate time.

, Once the ham is done cooking, place it under the broiler for between five and seven minutes. This will caramelize the glaze. Keep an eye on the ham as it is below the broiler to prevent burning or overheating.


If you don’t want to use the broiler, you can also place the ham inside an oven heated to 425 °F (218 °C) for eight minutes."
"
Cover the top of the pot with foil.,
Cut the ham to size.,
Reheat slices of ham using another method.",How to Reheat Ham in a Slow Cooker3," If the ham is too tall, the slow cooker's lid may not fit. Instead, you can use aluminum foil to make a tent that will cover the ham. Pull the foil over the top of the slow cooker, tearing off a piece that is large enough to cover the entire basin and the ham. Gently press the foil around the top of the pot, making sure that the ham is completely covered. Do not touch the foil while it is cooking; only remove it to check the temperature of the ham.Be extremely careful as you remove the foil, as steam may have built up under the foil. It may be extremely hot.

, If the ham is too large or awkwardly shaped, it may not fit in the pot correctly. You can cut off pieces of the ham to make it fit inside of the pot. Fit these pieces around the main chunk of ham in the slow cooker. You might also decide to cook them separately or to discard them.If you have a boneless ham, you can cut up the ham however you please so that it fits most conveniently in the slow cooker.
If you have a bone-in ham, you should slice parallel above the bone, as most kitchen knives will not be sharp enough to cut into the bone.

, The slow cooker method may not be ideal for ham that has already been sliced into separate pieces off the bone. While spiral-sliced hams can be reheated if they remain on the bone, ham steaks, slices, and chunks should be cooked using a different method.


You can reheat a ham steak or slice in a skillet until it is slightly browned on either side. You can also simmer it with a cup of water for two minutes to remove some of the saltiness.Ham chunks can be reheated by warming them up in a skillet or microwave. You can also add them to soups, omelets, and other recipes. You do not have reheat the chunks before adding them.

Eat or store the croutons once cool.",How to Make Salad Croutons1," Set it to 400ºF (200ºC) and place a rack in the upper middle position., A crusty, rustic loaf such as sourdough or ciabatta makes excellent croutons.Sandwich bread will work fine, as long as the slices are thick enough not to fall apart when cut. Roughly six slices' worth of bread makes one large batch, enough for several people.


Slightly stale bread crisps faster and more evenly. If using a fresh, dense bread, lower the oven temperature to 350ºF (175ºC) or less to help the bread cook evenly.

, Aim for cubes about ½ inch (1.25 cm) across. If the pieces are too different in size, they will not bake evenly.

, Put the cubed bread in a large bowl and sprinkle on salt and pepper. Optionally, sprinkle on a generous pinch of dried herbs or spices for extra flavor.


Oregano, basil, parsley, and thyme are popular flavors for Italian croutons.
Garlic powder is the easiest way to add garlic flavor, since raw garlic will burn in the oven. If you prefer to use raw garlic, infuse its flavor in olive oil instead, then strain out the garlic pieces before using the oil in the next step., This is mainly a question of flavor preference, but be aware that butter will burn faster than oil, potentially creating darker croutons. Whichever option you choose, drizzle on 3 tbsp (45 mL) and toss until the bread is coated.

, Spread out the bread in a single layer on a rimmed baking sheet. Place it in the preheated oven.

, The bread is ready once golden-brown and crunchy. This typically takes 8–10 minutes if you used fresh bread, or 6–8 minutes if the bread was already stale. Turn over the bread pieces at least once during cooking, so they crisp evenly.Cooking time can vary by several minutes based on how hot your oven runs, the age of your bread, and on how dark and crunchy you prefer your croutons. Keep an eye on them.

, These ingredients are best added after 5 minutes of baking., Wait for the croutons to reach room temperature, then store in a plastic bag or other airtight container. Storing them while hot may cause them to become soggy from trapped steam.Eat the croutons within one week, or store excess in the freezer for up to six months."

Let cool on a paper towel.",How to Make Salad Croutons2," Fried croutons can end up with a chewy interior if they don't cook all the way through. Minimize this by starting with a loaf that's slightly dried out. Cut or tear the bread into cubes or pieces roughly ½ inch (1.25 cm) across.


If all you have is fresh bread, pre-toast the cubes in a 200ºF (90ºC) oven for ten minutes or until dry at the surface.Remove them from the oven and continue to the next step.

, Coat the base of the pan and heat until the butter has melted, or until the olive oil is shimmering. Butter burns at lower temperatures, so it tends to create darker croutons.

, Drop the bread cubes in the oil and mix until well coated. If the bread still looks dry, pour more melted butter or olive oil on top.

, Stir in salt and pepper to taste. Optionally, add dried Italian seasoning, or a sprinkle of grated Parmesan cheese.

, Fry the croutons over medium heat. Once the bases have browned, turn them to expose another side to the heat. The croutons are ready once they are mostly golden-brown, and smell toasted but not burned. Taste-test as you go if you're not sure whether the croutons are done.

, Transfer the croutons onto a plate lined with paper towels to absorb excess oil. Leave the croutons to release steam and cool to room temperature before using or storing.


Once finished, store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to a week. Transfer any leftovers to the freezer after that point.

Quart sized jars: Recommended for dinner serving salads; if you wish to have a good amount of greens, accompanied with vegetables and toppings
Two quart jars: Recommended for potlucks and gatherings;
, Use a mild soap and hot water to clean the jar and lid before using.

, Start with the heaviest ingredients at the bottom and the lightest at the top.

, Depending on the size of the jar, drizzle a few tablespoons of your favorite salad dressing on the bottom.


Placing the dressings at the bottom ensures the light ingredients that get soaked easily, such as lettuce, won't be touching the dressing during storage.

, Hard vegetables, such as peppers, cucumbers, or anything sponge-like such as mushrooms can be added on top of the salad dressing.

, Tofu or beans can add a huge amount of nutrition to your salad jar.

, Shredded cheese, chicken strips, and hard-boiled eggs are great ""goodie"" ideas.

, Sprinkle some dried apricots or cranberries to have some sweetness in every bite.

, Because these are the most unfriendly ingredients with salad dressing contact for a prolonged time, make sure (if possible), they are the furthest away from the dressing. Tear into pieces to make them fit.

, Refrigerate the jars for up to a week.

, Because you will be cramming ingredients, the most effective method in eating these is to dump your salad in a separate bowl.

, This is doable, but harder to combine everything. You may have to eat a few ingredients from the top to get into the rest of the salad.

When you're short for time, lay the cubes on a baking sheet and bake them in an oven preheated to 300 F (149 C) for 15 to 20 minutes.You want the bread toasted on the outside but still soft on the inside. Flip the bread cubes twice during the baking process.

The best bread for panzanella is a loaf that has a thick and crunchy crust, such as French, Italian, baguette, or an artisan sourdough loaf. Otherwise, the bread will become soggy in the salad.
Panzanella is a dish that was created to use up stale and dried up bread ends, which is why the bread has to be dried before you can use it in the dish.;
, Peel the onion and cut it into thin slices. Transfer the slices to a medium bowl of ice water, and let them soak for about 15 minutes. This will help take some of the pungency out of the raw onions.After 15 minutes, transfer the onion slices to a colander and let them drain until you're ready to toss the salad.

, In a small bowl, combine the red wine vinegar, salt, and pepper. Whisk the ingredients together, and slowly pour in the olive oil. Continue whisking vigorously until everything is fully incorporated.Instead of red wine vinegar, you can also use Champagne vinegar., In a large mixing bowl, combine the bread cubes, onion slices, and chopped tomatoes, cucumber, and bell pepper. Drizzle the vinaigrette over the salad and toss everything together with two large spoons to coat the salad with the dressing.Red, yellow, and orange bell peppers are all suitable for this salad.
You can use heirloom tomatoes of any variety or color in this recipe. You can also substitute some or all of the heirloom tomatoes with Roma, cherry, grape, or other small tomato varieties.

, Once the salad has been tossed, set it aside on the counter and let it rest at room temperature for at least half an hour. This will give the bread time to absorb some of the dressing and the vinaigrette, and give all the flavors time to develop and marry.Don’t let the salad rest for longer than four hours before serving, otherwise the bread will become soggy.

, When you're ready to serve the salad, sprinkle in the fresh basil and toss the salad to incorporate the herbs into the salad.Serve as a main dish, or as a side dish with your favorite lunch or dinner meals., Bread salad is a delicious dish, but it’s often served as a side because it’s lacking a few things that make it a full meal. But you can turn the salad into a filling and tasty meal by adding more protein and calories. Popular choices include tossing the salad with:

6 ounces (170 g) of chicken, cooked and cubed8 anchovy fillets, sliced6 ounces (170 g) tofu, crumbled, The basic vinaigrette that’s often served with panzanella is yummy, but you can add more spice and more depth to the flavor by whisking in a teaspoon (5 g) of Dijon mustard into the dressing as well. Other types of mustard you can try include:Honey mustard
Horseradish mustard
Spicy mustard

, Typical salads tend to have more vegetables than a bread salad, but you can add any vegetables you like to the panzanella. Some popular veggies to add to this dish include:

Lettuce, chopped into bite-sized pieces
Green beans
Corn
Capers
Fennel, sliced
Olives, sliced
Spinach
Nuts
Cranberries, The dressing that’s often served with bread salad is fairly basic, but there are other herbs and spices you can add to change the flavor, make it spicier, or add more elements. Here are some aromatics you might want to add to the salad or the dressing:One to two cloves of garlic, minced
Fresh oregano
Fresh thyme
Fresh parsley
Red pepper flakes

, Cheese, bread, and salad is a classic Italian combination, and there's no reason you can't add some of your favorite cheese to a panzanella dish. Some of the most popular cheeses to pair with salad include fresh mozzarella, cut into small pieces, or shaved Parmigiano-Reggiano., Panzanella is often served as a side dish or a starter, and especially in summertime. If you want to make a full meal with the panzanella, try pairing it with another side, such as corn on the cob, and a tasty main dish, such as:

Roasted chicken
Barbecued tofu
Grilled fish
Steak

, Every meal goes great with a refreshing beverage, and panzanella is no different. Excellent refreshing beverages to drink with bread salad include lemonade, iced tea, ice water, cucumber water, and water with a slice of lemon or lime., As a fresh tomato-based dish, panzanella goes great with dry whites, dry roses, high-acid wines, and sparkling wines.You can try a sauvignon blanc, Sancerre, Vouvray, or Albariño., Because bread salad is often served in summer, it’s ideal for eating outside.

Toss with dressing.",How to Make Vegetable Salad1," The base of a green salad is crunchy leaves that can stand on their own or stay firm when dressed. Romaine or red leaf lettuce are great choices if you prefer mild flavors, while dinosaur kale offers a hearty, earthy alternative. Wash thoroughly, then chop and add to a large bowl.


For an appetizer, plan on serving about 2–3 oz (55–85g) of (total) greens per person.
Avoid the more common curly kale, which is tough to eat raw.;
, If you're not sure how to chop the leaves, take a bite to test the texture. Crisp lettuces are easy to eat torn, or cut into bite-sized pieces across the stem. For greens with a fibrous stem such as kale, cut out the stems then slice the leaves into thin pieces.


Kale also benefits from ""massaging"" to break down the fibers. Place it in a bowl of acidic dressing and squeeze handfuls of leaves with moderate pressure. Let sit for 5–15 minutes before serving., A variety of textures is key to a good salad. Add a roughly equal amount of arugula, spinach, butter leaf lettuce, or another soft, leafy green to your salad. Handle these gently while washing and chopping, as soft leaves tend to bruise more easily.

, If you like some zing in your salad, throw in a large handful of radicchio, water cress, dandelion, or frisée. These add strong peppery flavors., You can stop here, or use your mixed greens as a base for all sort of ingredients. Here are a few examples:

Put together an Asian salad.",How to Make Vegetable Salad2," These salads demand high-quality, fresh ingredients, so shop at a local market the same day if possible. Tomatoes combine well with many other vegetables; here are a few popular examples:


Greek salad: 2–4 tomatoes (in eighths), 1 large cucumber (sliced thickly), 1 small red onion (sliced thinly). Toss with generous amounts of garlic salad dressing, or a Greek vinaigrette with garlic, oregano, and black pepper.Caprese: thick slices of tomato, each topped with a slice of fresh mozzarella and a basil leaf or three. Drizzle on extra-virgin olive oil just before serving.
For an extra-refreshing salad, combine equally sized cubes of tomato and watermelon. Top with black pepper, a little salt, and vinaigrette. Let stand a few minutes before serving.

Note — If storing tomatoes for more than a day, a cellar or air-conditioned room around 55-70ºF (13–21ºC) preserves flavor better than the fridge or a warm room., Coleslaw is another summer appetizer, that pairs well with barbecue and other strong flavors. The heart of a coleslaw is a finely chopped cabbage, usually paired with other crunchy vegetables (shredded carrot is especially popular), sweet flavors (apple, golden raisins), and a binding dressing made from vinegar and mayonnaise or sour cream. Here's a recipe to get you started.

, If the weather's cold and you need a hearty dinner appetizer, roast a tray of vegetables with olive oil, salt, and pepper. Season with lemon juice and herbs and serve hot.


Include a few vegetables that don't normally go into a raw salad, such as potatoes, eggplant, or cauliflower.
Remember that different vegetables require different cooking times. This example tells you how to combine potatoes, eggplant, bell peppers, red onion, and cherry tomatoes.

, Asian and Asian-inspired salads bring many new techniques to the table. The vegetables are often marinated for an hour or more to add an acidic tang, while spicy, salty, and sweet add a great deal of complexity. Here a couple examples:


Slice cucumbers and sweet onions very thinly, preferably with a mandoline.Marinate in a homemade Asian dressing, or this sesame lemon dressing.

Fumi salad roasts sesame seeds and almonds to add flavor to cabbage and ramen noodles. You can easily turn this into a main course by adding chicken.
Add Asian flavors to any vegetable salad with soy ginger dressing or miso dressing. Go easy on these if you aren't used to them. They tend to be more concentrated than Western dressings.

",How to Make Vegetable Salad3," If you feel like inventing your own salad, move on to the next step to begin the step-by-step instructions. If you're looking for something faster, here are a few well-tested ideas that can stand at the center of your meal:


Chef's salad: sliced ham, cheese, hard-boiled egg, cucumber, and tomato on a bed of lettuce. This can stand up to thicker, stronger-flavored dressings such as Caesar salad dressing, ranch, or Thousand Island.

Salad Nicoise: a French salad of potatoes, tomatoes, egg, olives, and fish (usually anchovies or tuna), among other ingredients.
Southwest salad: Combine cooked corn and black beans with red peppers, spring onions, and plenty of avocado and/or grilled chicken. Season with cilantro and lime.

, You can start with lettuce or mixed greens, if you're prepared to amp it up with plenty of protein and starchy ingredients. Another approach is to use a bed of grains, especially something with plenty of texture like brown rice or quinoa.


A bed of rice noodles works well for Asian salads.

, This isn't just for show; a variety of colours means a variety of vitamins. Strips of red, orange, or yellow bell pepper are a great choice. Also try shredded carrot; shredded beets (raw, pickled or cooked); or sliced tomatoes.


You can even add edible flowers.

, Add intensity with roasted garlic, pitted olives, or diced hot peppers. Use avocado for a creamy texture. Keep it tasty but more casual with chopped asparagus, any kind of onion, or flavorful mushrooms.

, These little nibbles make a salad much more interesting. There are all kinds of options:


Any nuts or seeds – walnuts, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, etc.
Breads or grains – croutons, tortilla chips, popcorn, cooked quinoa
Any type of fresh or dried fruit, especially berries
Snap peas, corn niblets, or other small veggies

, A salad requires protein to become an entreé. Choose just one or two of the following, chopped into bite-size pieces.


Cooked beans – chickpeas, lentils
Cheese – Parmesan Swiss, or feta for more subtle flavor; cheddar or blue cheese for strong flavor
Other vegetarian options – soft- or hard-boiled egg, tofu
Meat – tuna, chicken breast, ham, grilled fish or steak, shrimp, squid

, Salad dressing can be purchased or made at home. Whichever you choose, drizzle over the salad and toss until thoroughly coated. If you made the salad in advance, wait until just before serving to add the dressing.


Combine one part Balsamic vinegar with three parts olive oil and add salt & pepper for a classic dressing. This is best on lettuce or tomato salads. You can easily add crushed garlic or any savory herb.
Mix Greek yoghurt with lemon juice, garlic, oregano and hot sauce for a strong dressing, best on strong-flavored leaves such as arugula or radicchio.
Mix freshly squeezed fruit juice, olive oil, salt and pepper for a fresh fruity dressing

Use lump crab meat or imitation crab.,
Pick through lump crab meat before use.,
Separate imitation crab sticks.",How to Make Crab Salad1," Both real crab and imitation crab meat can be used for crab salad, but the two have slightly different textures and, as such, will produce slightly different results.


Real crab is usually more expensive. You can buy it frozen, canned, or pasteurized, but when making crab salad, canned crab meat will work best.
Imitation crab meat is actually made from various species of white fish. The fish is ground into a paste and enhanced with crab flavoring, then molded into the form of a crab leg. You'll usually buy imitation crab as “crab sticks.”

, When using real crab meat, you'll need to sort through the contents of the can and pick out anything that isn't actually meat.


Open the can and squeeze out any excess liquid using the back of a fork.
Dump the crab meat into a bowl and use your fingers to pick over it. Remove any pieces of shell or cartilage hiding among the meat.

, If you decide to use imitation crab meat in the form of crab sticks, you'll need to separate the molded crab sticks into chunks or shreds.

, Add the chopped onion and green bell pepper to the melted butter. Cook the vegetables, stirring frequently, for about 3 minutes.The exact time may vary depending on how large your pieces are. Only cook the vegetables until they become tender, and do not wait for the onion to turn translucent or brown.

, Flake the crab meat into the vegetable mixture. Stir to combine, then continue cooking for another 3 minutes.


Stir the mixture frequently as it continues to cook.
Cook the crab meat until it becomes warm throughout.

, Place the mayonnaise, sour cream, lemon juice, Dijon mustard, and parsley in a medium mixing bowl. Whisk the ingredients together until evenly combined.Fresh parsley is ideal, but if you don't have fresh parsley, use 2 tsp (10 ml) of dried parsley instead.
Note that this amount of dressing will just barely coat the crab salad. If you prefer crab salad with heavier dressing, you may need to double the dressing ingredients.

, Remove the crab mixture from the stove and spoon it into the bowl of dressing. Mix gently until the crab mixture and vegetables are evenly coated.


If there's extra butter in the skillet after cooking the crab and vegetables, drain it before combining the mixture with the dressing. Keeping the butter could cause the salad to become runny.

, Add the mayonnaise, hot sauce, mustard, and diced celery to the bowl of seasoned crab. Mix until evenly combined.The hot sauce is another ingredient that should be added and adjusted to taste.

Note that the onion should be diced into very fine pieces.

, Place all four ingredients in a medium mixing bowl. Gently toss them together with a fork until evenly mixed.


Make sure that the corn is fully drained before adding it to the mixture. If any of the canned juice remains, it could make the resulting crab salad too runny.

, Add these two ingredients to the crab-vegetable mixture, then stir until evenly coated.Consider mixing the mayonnaise and horseradish sauce in a separate bowl before adding it to the crab mixture. Doing so is not strictly necessary, but it may make it easier for you to distribute both ingredients evenly throughout the crab salad.

, Sprinkle the crab salad with salt and pepper, then adjust these seasonings to taste.


The 1/4 tsp (1.25 ml) salt and 1/8 tsp (0.6 ml) black pepper listed in the recipe are estimates. You can add more or less as desired, or even omit the salt and pepper completely.

, Add the peas to the rest of the ingredients and gently fold them into the salad.


Adding the peas last can help prevent them from breaking apart as you mix the ingredients.
As with the canned corn, make sure that you completely drain the can of peas before adding them to the crab salad.

Remove the crab from the steamer.",How to Cook Jonah Crab Claws1," Set a tall pot on the stove. Secure a steamer inside of it. Your steamer may be a rack that rests across the length of the pot or a basket that sits inside the pot. As long as it can hold the crab and has holes in the bottom to let out the steam, it will cook the claws.Two-piece crab steamer pots also exist. The inner pot is the same as a steamer basket.;
, Add about three cups (710 mL) to the pot. You don’t need much water for boiling, so don’t let the water level reach the inside of the steamer. Use the bottom edge of the steamer as a guide.

, Turn up the heat under the pot. Wait for a little while for the water to boil. You may use this time to wash the crab, but stay aware of the water.

, Pass the claws under running water to remove debris. Do this for about two pounds (.45 kg) of Jonah crab claws. Drop them into the steamer., Place a lid on the pot, which will allow the steam to cook the crab faster. After about four minutes, the claws should be warm and have turned bright red with white-colored meat inside.You may steam the claws without a lid. It can take up to ten minutes for the claws to cook through, but you’ll be able to keep an eye on them., Remove the steamer from the pot. You can rinse the claws under running water or allow them to rest in the basket for a few minutes to cool them. Crack open the claws and eat the meat plain or serve it with melted butter or a cocktail sauce."

Add water so that the pot is about two-thirds full., For every gallon (3.7 L) of water, add 1 ½ cup (350 mL) of salt. The salt is a simple but effective starting seasoning and will also cause the water to boil faster. You may also add other seasonings, such as Old Bay crab seasoning, bay leaves, or lemon.


Claw meat has a stronger flavor than meat from other parts of the crab, so don’t feel obligated to add extra seasoning.

, Turn the heat up on the stove. Bring the water to a boil, then move the pot off the heat. While leaving the pot on the heat is useful for boiling whole crabs, Jonah claws are small and will cook quicker. By moving the pot off the heat, you can better control the cooking process., Carefully add about two pounds (.45 g) of Jonah crab claws to the water. Make sure that the crab is covered by the water. Fish out any claws that can’t get into the water. Let the claws boil until they look bright red., Remove the claws from the water. Use tongs to transfer them to a place they can drain, such as a mesh strainer or dry towel. Because the claws are so small and easy to overcook, it is helpful to then rinse the claws with cool water in the sink."

Layer the grill with aluminum foil.,
Spray the foil with non-stick cooking spray.,
Season the crab.,
Spread the claws over the grill.,
Heat up the grill.,
Grill the claws for several minutes.",How to Cook Jonah Crab Claws3," Cover a rack on the grill with a layer of foil. Add another layer tight on top of it. You can cook the claws directly on the grill, but aluminum foil makes cooking easier. The foil corrals the legs and helps them cook evenly., You may be able to quickly cook the delicate claws without using spray. However, a non-stick cooking spray like Pam ensures that any crab parts you cook won’t stick. Spray a generous amount over the foil.

, This is optional since claw meat has such a strong taste. You can melt some butter and mix it with salt, Old Bay, garlic, or other seasonings to add a different flavor. Crack open the claws a little and pour the mixture onto the meat., Spread the claws evenly along the foil. The thick parts of the claw should be closest to the hottest part of your grill. You may also choose to grill a few claws at a time, avoiding the spot on your grill that gets hottest., Turn on your grill. Using a direct heat setting will cook the claws more rapidly. Get the grill hot enough so that your hand can linger over it for several seconds. Too much heat will overcook the claws, causing the meat to stick to the shell., The claws should cook through in five minutes or less. A whole crab can be cooked on the grill in under ten minutes, but Jonah claws are small and will cook faster than that. Watch for them to turn bright red.


To ensure they cook evenly, you may flip the claws over after the first minute or two of cooking. Use a long pair of tongs.

Put the grape leaves in the boiling water for about 15 min. take them off carefully, put them in a cold-water bath, and let them soak. Otherwise, go directly to mix preparation.;
, In a mixing bowl, mix together the rice, tomato paste, allspice, black pepper, garlic, meat, onion, and 1/4 cup of water. Keep mixing until all the ingredients are well distributed (see picture).

, Take about a teaspoon of the mix and put it on the middle of the grape leaf. Then, spread the mix evenly as a half a cylinder. Remember to leave about 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) space from each end of the leaf. This will make folding the leaf easier. Now, fold from the stem end of the leaf. Then, tuck in the empty sides toward the center. After that, keep folding until you have a completer roll of a grape leaf(see picture). Repeat the folding procedure on the rest of the mix. Finally, start laying the rolled grape leaves in a pot. make sure you lay them close to each other.

, Put the pot on a stove and pour about 2 cups of water in the pot. Then, spread the butter evenly on the top of grape leaves. Cover the pot with its lid and cook on high for about two hours. Usually, the cooking time depends on the stove and the material of the pot. However, cooking can be about one hour and fifteen minutes after the mix has come to a boil. After the cooking is done, turn off the stove and let stand uncovered for about 10 minutes.

, On a serving plate, take out one grape leaf at a time and arrange them as desired. Preferably, Dolmas are served hot.

Make a classic, smokey BBQ sauce on the stovetop if you don't want to buy one.",How to Make Fall Off The Bone Ribs1," Letting the meat warm up to room temperature prevents a temperature shock that makes the outsides of the ribs cook much faster than the inside. Think of the bones like mini ice cubes, staying cold for much longer than the meat, and you'll see why letting the whole thing warm up a bit before cooking is so important.Continue with the dry rub and prep work while they warm up -- you just don't want to put the ribs in the oven before 30-60 minutes.;
, It can be a bit sticky, but it should peel off with a little prying. Cut a long slit along the top of the membrane and pull down, along the bones, to peel it away. This membrane is not only tough to chew, it prevents your flavors from penetrating the meat.

, The dry rub is more than just seasoning -- the salt and sugar work together to help retain the meat's moisture, which is essential to fall off the bone ribs. Whisk all of these spices and sugars together evenly with a fork.


You can use the dry rub recipe above, or purchase your own directly from the store.
When possible, use some specialty ""smoked salt"" to get an impressively smoky flavor., Don't be shy-- use a generous amount of your spice and sugar mixture and cover the ribs by rubbing it into the meat.


If you're going to be grilling or smoking your ribs or want to make your own sauce, set aside 3 tablespoons dry rub before starting.

, If you're cooking in the oven or using a propane grill, this is a great way to get smoky flavor without the hassle. If you don't even want a smokey flavor, however, you can also skip this step., If you have a favorite sauce already, then you can happily use it. The following recipe is simply mixed into a sauce pot, then cooked at a low simmer for 20 minute:


1 medium yellow onion, grated
1 1/2 (350ml) cups ketchup
2 tablespoons (30ml) brown mustard
1/3 cup (80ml) molasses
1/4 cup (60ml) Worcestershire
1/4 cup (60ml) apple cider vinegar
3/4 teaspoon (4ml) liquid smoke
Excess 3 tablespoon spice rub."

Return ribs the oven for 15-20 minutes, until browned.",How to Make Fall Off The Bone Ribs2," For the juiciest ribs, you want a slow, even cooking temperature for the first few hours, which cooks the meat slowly while retaining moisture. While accomplished cooks can master this art with a smoker or large grill, it is far easier to use your oven.


These ribs can either be finished in the oven or on a grill, meaning you can still get delicious smokey flavor after tenderizing the meat in the oven

, You want enough foil that the ribs are wrapped up, but there is still room for some steam in the foil above them. Don't completely close the ribs up just yet.

, These cooking acids have two jobs. First, they provide liquid for the steam, which helps keep the meat moist as it cooks. Second, they help tenderize the meat faster than cooking alone, breaking down tough tissue for truly fall off the bone ribs., Resist the urge to open the oven, and especially the foil, while the ribs cook. You want to retain a consistent heat, and as much steam as possible, for tender ribs.

, After the first two hours is up, get ready for some juggling. Be careful of steam when you first open the foil, as it will be hot. Save the juices from the pouch and toss the foil away.


Don't turn the oven off just yet!

, If they're still a little tough, put the ribs meat-side up on the baking sheet and return to the oven until they are easily pierced, checking every 15 minutes. If they are already tender, crank up the oven.If you'd like to finish the ribs on the grill, go set the burners to high and then click here for the rest of the recipe. They can also be finished right in the oven.

, The top is where the oven is the hottest, and will nicely finish your ribs. You're looking for a rich, carmelized sauce on the our side., Once the meat is tender and cooked, cover the ribs thoroughly with this sauce and spice mixture.

, Make sure the meaty side of the ribs faces upwards. This final stage will crisp up the edges, brown the meat, and bring out an incredible final flavor."

Finished.

",How to Make Fall Off The Bone Ribs3," Whenever you grill, you should have one area directly over a flame, and one that only heats from the air in the grill. Depending on your grill, there are different ways to do this:


Charcoal and wood-fired grills should be set up so that half of the grill is covered in briquets and the other half is empty.
Propane grillers can simply turn on 1 burner and leave 1-2 burners off. If you have a second, higher rack on the grill, this can work too., This usually means the medium-low setting, but all grills are different. If your grill doesn't have a thermometer, this is hot enough that you can hold your hand 2-3"" over the grill for about 10 seconds.

, If you don't want to deal with smoking wood, you can instead use about 1 teaspoon liquid smoke sprinkled over the ribs and rubbed into the meat.If using a propane grill, fill the small aluminum smoking tray with the wood instead of adding directly.

, You want to save as much smoke as possible. You will open the grill for an occasional misting, but this is explained below.

, This juice helps retain moisture, provides a light sweetness, and tenderizes the meat. These extra tender ribs basted in apple juice are generally considered ""St. Louis-style."", Prepare the aluminum foil pouch in advance, as the ribs are hot and you want to get them back in the grill quickly once they're wrapped.


If the grill needs a new chimney of charcoal to stay hot, this is generally the best time to add it.

, This stage basically steam cooks the meat, which is a crucial step to getting it to fall off the bone., This is your sign that they are finished, and only need a quick final blast of heat to caramelize the outside. It usually takes another 1-2 hours.


Spray the ribs with apple juice every hour.

, The next step requires cranking the heat up significantly on the oven, but you don't want the ribs over the heat while this happens. Instead, wrap them up in foil to stay hot and retain their moisture while you get the heat up.


Remember -- they are done when they bend slightly when lifted. But they still have one more stage until they're delicious.


, The grill should be raging hot at this point, as all you're looking for is quick sear. Don't rush -- make sure the grill is about as hot as he can get it.

, You just want the sauce to thicken around the meat and caramelize, and the beginnings of some grill marks. When done to your liking, remove the meat and serve.,"

While it's always possible to ruin a good piece of meat (or to make something great out of a mediocre piece of meat), in general, the very best brisket comes from the highest-quality meat. In addition, because cooking brisket is an enormous time investment compared to other meat dishes, you'll want to make sure that the time and effort you spend on your brisket is worth it.


In the U.S., meats are typically assigned one of four quality grades. From lowest to highest, they are: select, choice, prime, and wagyu.Try to get the highest-quality cut possible. Avoid “select” meats, which can be somewhat tough and flavorless, unless you have no alternative.;
, For this grilling recipe, we'll use a dry rub (a dry, powdery mixture of spices and seasonings that, as its name suggests, is rubbed directly onto the meat).

Regardless of the dry rub recipe you use, you'll apply it to the brisket basically the same way: wiping it on with your hands to give it a thorough coating.


It can be slightly easier to apply your dry rub if you wet your brisket with a light spritzing of water beforehand. This moisture helps the dry ingredients of the rub adhere to the meat but quickly evaporates during cooking, ensuring the meat achieves a proper blackened “bark”.

, Some brisket grillers like having having a bowl of ""mop sauce"" handy for basting, brushing or ""mopping"" the brisket as it cooks. This thin, flavorful sauce allegedly keeps the brisket moist and juicy. However, some grillers discourage this practice, claiming that it prevents the formation of a crispy ""bark"" on the outside of the meat and prolongs the cooking process.If you'd like to try making a mop sauce, try mixing together the ingredients in the recipe provided above, or use your own!


If you make your own mop sauce, remember that it should be relatively ""thin"" (certainly thinner than sauces like ketchup and barbecue sauce) to allow it to be easily brushed or mopped over the meat.

, When you've seasoned your meat and you're ready to start cooking your brisket, you can start your grill. Brisket-grilling aficionados are split on whether charcoal or gas grills provide the best cooking experience. Regardless of the type of grill you use, you'll want to cook your brisket with indirect heat, rather than direct heat, so only heat up one side of your grill. See below for more information:


For a charcoal grill, arrange your charcoals on one side of the grill with a pie tin or oven pan containing a cup or two of water on the other. Light your charcoals and wait until they have fully ashed over and are giving off a strong orange glow before laying down your meat.
For a gas grill, simply light the burner (or ‘’burners’’) on one side of the grill, set them to a medium heat, close the lid, and wait until the grill heats up.

, When your grill has warmed up, add your brisket to the side of the grill that isn't over the flame or charcoal. Unlike common barbecue meats like hamburgers and hotdogs, brisket cooks much better with low, indirect heat than it does with searing direct heat. Brisket naturally contains lots of connective tissue, which requires long cooking times before it softens and breaks down.


If you're using a gas grill, reduce the heat to ""low"" when you add your meat. If you're using a charcoal grill, the heat will naturally reduce over time.
Regardless of the type of grill you're using, you want to cook your brisket at low temperatures. Many aficionados grill at between 225-275o F (107-135o), though some grillers recommend going as high as 350o (176o C)., Many brisket grillers like to add water-soaked chips of wood like mesquite and hickory to the grill to give the meat an added smokey, savory flavor. If you'd like to smoke your meat, soak your wood chips in water until they're soaked through, then drain them and set them in a grill-safe pan over the flame or charcoals (as a reminder, your brisket should be on the opposite side of the grill). As they sear and burn, they'll release rich smoke which should smell (and eventually, taste) like heaven.


Use wood chips from heavy woods like oak, hickory, maple, and mesquite for smoking brisket. Other types of woods, like pecan and apple, offer flavorful ""accents"" if added in small quantities. Don't use pine or cedar wood — it's too resin-filled for proper smoking.

, Brisket generally takes quite a long time to cook — depending on the size of your piece of meat and the temperature you use to cook it, it may take anywhere from 8-20 hours for your brisket to cook fully. Lower temperatures (like, for instance, 225o F) can give cooking times of 20 hours or so, while hotter temperatures are often in the 8-10 hour range. When the brisket is done, it will have a blackened exterior but will be tender enough to be pulled apart with a pair of forks. Remove from the grill and allow it to sit for 10-15 minutes before cutting into thin slices and serving. Bon appetit!


Allowing the meat to rest after cooking is an old grilling trick — this allows the meat to re-absorb moisture that may have been lost during cooking, resulting in a moisture final dish.

Trim excess fat from your brisket.,
Season your meat with a marinade.,
Cook at low heat.,
Turn the meat halfway through cooking.,
When done, remove and serve.",How to Make Brisket2," If you don't have a grill or don't want to deal with the hassle of using one, fear not — brisket can also be cooked in the oven as long as you use the same long, slow style of cooking. One important change that you'll want to make, however, is to use a cut of brisket that has had most or all of the fat cut from it. Brisket is often sold with a fairly thick natural fat cap. On the grill, this fat isn't as big of a problem because it can run off of the meat as it cooks. When you're cooking brisket in a pan in the oven, however, this fat will collect in the pan, leaving you with an oily mess as your final dish.


If you're not confident in your fat-trimming ability, try asking your butcher to trim the fat from your meat for you before packing it up for you.

, In this recipe, we'll use a liquid marinade (rather than a dry rub) to flavor our meat. A marinade is simply a liquid mixture of ingredients that the meat is soaked in before cooking to give it extra flavor. You can mix ingredients in the recipe listed above if you'd like or make your own. If you do make your own, as a general rule, you'll usually want to use liquid bases that include a fat or oil and an acid. For instance, while we've used olive oil and apple cider vinegar above, you could also use lemon juice, red wine vinegar, and so on as your acid to modify the flavor of your marinade.


For most brisket, you'll want to let your meat marinate for about a day. Thick, tough, heavy pieces of meat like brisket need time to fully absorb the flavor of the marinade.

, After your brisket has marinated, put it in an oven-safe pan and pop it in the oven. Cover the pan with foil so the meat retains its moisture. As with grilling, you'll want to use slow, low heat here. Many oven-grilling recipes use a heat of around 275o F — lower or higher is also possible, but will lead to longer or shorter cooking times, respectively. Be patient as you cook your brisket. For moderate-to-large pieces of meat, expect at least a six-to-eight hour cooking time.


As your brisket cooks, check on it occasionally to monitor its progress and ensure that it's cooking at a good pace.

, After about three or four hours, check on your brisket. It should be browning nicely and should have produced a sort of natural liquid ""gravy"" in the pan. Carefully pull the pan out of the oven and turn the brisket over, then put it back in the oven. Though it's not necessarily necessary to do this to have the meat cook thoroughly, this will help ensure that the entire exterior of the piece of meat gets a satisfying ""bark"" or crust.

, Depending on your cooking temperature and the size of your meat, after about six to eight hours (or longer), your brisket should have a dark brown-to-black exterior and should be quite tender all the way through.Carefully remove the brisket from the oven, remove from its pan, and set it on a cutting board for about 10 to 15 minutes. After this, simply use a knife or a set of forks to slice or pull the meat apart and serve!


Try using a spoon or ladle to pour some of the liquid from the cooking pan on the meat as a sauce or gravy. This makes an especially great addition to sandwiches.

Try making corned beef.,
Try making pastrami.,
Try making pot roast.",How to Make Brisket3," Besides typical barbecue or stove-cooked beef brisket, several other iconic dishes are made from the same ""brisket"" cut of meat at the front of the cow. For instance, corned beef, the tender, salty dish often associated with St. Patrick's Day celebrations and Irish cuisine, is usually made from brisket. Rather than being roasted or grilled, corned beef is usually brined in salt water, then boiled and stewed with vegetables and seasonings to give it its characteristic texture and taste.

, Though traditionally made from a cut called ""beef plate"", pastrami is often also made from brisket. Like corned beef, pastrami is typically brined . After this, the meat is seasoned, smoked, and steamed to produce a zesty final product with a characteristic reddish color. This tender, delicious deli meat makes for great sandwiches, especially when paired with a hot mustard.

, Pot roast, a style of dish that often uses cuts of meat from the tough ""chuck"" region of the cow, can be replicated with brisket fairly easily. As with chuck pot roasts, brisket pot roasts are made by quickly browning the outside of the meat on a grill or in a pan or skillet, then slowly cooking the meat for hours in a pot containing water or beef stock and various seasonings and spices. Cooked in this way, a piece of brisket can make for a delicious, mouthwatering-ly tender pot roast that can serve as the centerpiece of any great feast.

Serve hot.",How to Make Beef Stew in a Crock Pot1," Pour the oil into a large skillet and heat on the stove over medium-high heat. Meanwhile, make sure that your beef and vegetables are already prepared.


The beef should be cut into 1-in (2.5-cm) cubes. You can usually find pre-cut beef stew meat in the butcher's department at the grocery store, but if not, you can trim and cut a chuck roast or bottom round cut.
The garlic clove should be minced. If using pre-minced garlic, use 1/2 tsp (2.5 ml). If using garlic powder, use 1/8 tsp (0.625 ml).
The onion and celery should be roughly chopped.
You can use 3 large baking potatoes or 6 to 9 baby potatoes.
Use 4 standard carrots or 2 cups (500 ml) baby carrots.;
, Mix the flour, salt, and pepper in a large bowl. Add the beef to the mixture and toss to coat.


Make sure that the flour, salt, and pepper are thoroughly combined before adding the beef.
Stir the beef well so that all sides of each piece are covered. You should have little to no flour left once done.
Coating the beef in flour allows the beef to brown better and also makes the finished stew thicker.

, Transfer the coated beef to the hot oil in your skillet. Cook for several minutes, uncovered, stirring frequently until all sides are browned.


Browning the beef is only optional, so you can skip this step if you are short on time. Most cooks prefer to brown the beef, though, because doing so creates a more complex taste. Moreover, browning the beef prevents grease from causing the meat to clump together in your crock pot., Transfer the beef to the crock pot. Layer the potatoes, carrots, onion, celery, and garlic on top. Add the bay leaf, paprika, and Worcestershire sauce, then pour the beef broth over everything.


The exact order of ingredients does not matter much, but for best results, the beef, potatoes, and carrots should make up the bottom three layers since these ingredients require the most heat to cook through. Note that the heating element of the crock pot is located on the bottom of the device.

, You could also cook the stew on High for 4 to 6 hours.


Keep the crock pot covered as the stew cooks. A slow cooker needs to build up heat in order to cook properly, and the heat will be unable to build up if the lid is kept off or removed during the cooking process.

, Sprinkle the beef with a dash of salt and pepper.


Rinse the beef and pat it dry before seasoning it.
You can purchase pre-cut beef from the butcher's department at most grocery stores. Alternatively, you could cut a whole chuck roast or bottom round cut into 1-in (2.5-cm) pieces.

, Place the beef in the skillet of hot oil and cook, uncovered, until browned on all sides.


This should take about 5 to 7 minutes. Stir the beef frequently so that all sides are browned.
The beef does not need to be browned beforehand, but doing so creates a more complex flavor and prevents the grease from causing it to clump up in the crock pot later on.

, Add the garlic to the hot pan and cook for 1 minute until fragrant.


If using pre-minced garlic, use 1 1/2 tsp (7.5 ml). If using garlic powder, use about 1/2 tsp (2.5 ml).
Do not let the garlic burn.

, Transfer the contents of the skillet to the slow cooker, including both the beef and garlic.


Make sure that the beef is on top of the vegetables. You do not need to stir the beef and vegetables together.

, Add the butter to the skillet and let it melt. Also add the beef broth, red wine, beer, tomato paste, sugar, soy sauce, and thyme. Boil for 2 minutes and let simmer an additional 10 minutes.


Use a wooden spoon to stir the ingredients together, scraping the bottom of the pan, as well. The liquid deglazes the pan, lifting off more flavor.

You do not need to add oil to the skillet in order to brown the meatballs. The fat in the ground beef that renders off into liquid form should suffice, even when using lean ground beef.
Drain when finished.

, Layer the potatoes, carrots, and onions on the bottom. Place the meatballs on top.


The potatoes and carrots should be placed on the bottom of the slow cooker because they require more heat to cook. The heating element of the slow cooker is located at the bottom of the device, so the bottom is the hottest portion.

, Combine the water, ketchup, cider vinegar, basil, and remaining salt and pepper in a separate bowl. Pour the mixture over the meatballs and vegetables.


You do not need to stir the sauce into the ingredients in the crock pot. Allow the sauce to seep into the ingredients on its own.

This helps to keep the shape and also stop any rising. Set your oven to approx. Gas Mark 5.

, Place them in the pan and add water. Ignite or turn on hob and bring potatoes to the boil and simmer until ready.

, Usually two standard tins are enough to make a pie but if you want more add more! Cut the corned beef into cubs as this is easier to mash.

, Add a knob of butter to the pan and start mashing making sure the texture is as lumpy as you like - obviously if you like your pie with lumps of potato don't mash too much!

, It may be too much to mash at once so add some at a time. Also add a good pinch of salt and pepper to season - add more if necessary.

, Add mix to the baking dish/tray that has been lined with pastry. Spread out evenly to the edges.

, Wet the rim of the bottom sheet of pastry so that when the top piece goes on, it will stick to the bottom piece. Place this over the corned beef, etc, that is in the dish. Cut to size then pierce pastry on top with 2 slits - this is so the steam can get out. Then press with your thumbs all the way around the edges of the pastry so that they join tightly together.

, Brush on with a pastry brush to that all the pastry is covered. This helps the pastry to go golden brown.

, (If you are using pre-prepared pastry then  follow instructions on packet as to what temperature the oven must be). Cook until pastry is golden brown.

, You can eat the pie hot or cold and with whatever you want. Enjoy!

, Set the pot on the counter or in the refrigerator to marinate for an hour or so.You simply want the flavors of the spices and the vinegar to infuse into the pork.


You will not be able to store this recipe for a long period of time, as with the other methods provided, as the pickling in this recipe is for taste, not for preservation.

, Simmer the contents for approximately 30 minutes over low heat, until the pork is well cooked and falling apart.


Keep an eye on the pork as it simmers. Give the whole thing a stir about halfway through cooking, so that that pork is cooked consistently.

, The pork should be tender and the flavor of the vinegar should give it a distinctive taste.

Freeze any leftover pickled pork.",How to Pickle Pork2," For this version of pickled pork you will make a pickling liquid which the pork will be submerged in for 3 days. Because it takes so long, be sure that you are making it far enough ahead of time.


The equipment you will need are a large pot, a large plastic zip-lock bag, and a bowl to place under the zip lock bag.
In addition to several pounds of pork (boneless pork butt works well for this) you will need 1 quart of white vinegar, a tablespoon of salt, a dozen peppercorns, and a variety of other spices. Adding a tablespoon of celery seeds, a few whole garlic cloves, or a couple bay leaves adds a nice flavor to the meat., Cook for just a few minutes over low heat to release the flavor of the spices into the liquid. Take the liquid off the heat.

, Unlike in the quick method, no heat will be applied to the pork.


While you are letting the pickling liquid cool, it is a good time to prepare the pork. Cut the pork you purchased into 2 inch chunks, removing most of the fat if there is a lot still attached to the pork.

, Add the pork pieces to the pickling liquid. Make sure that all of the pork is submerged in the pickling liquid.


When sealing up the zip-lock bag be sure to get as much air out of the bag as possible. This will make sure that none of the pork is exposed to air, which can lead to the exposed areas spoiling.

,, Although the pork is pickled, and thus preserved, the pork does still need to be cooked over some kind of heat.

At its simplest, it simply requires pork, a large non-reactive bowl (such as ceramic or stainless steel), water, and salt. However, the flavor of the pork can be greatly improved with the addition of sugar, herbs, and spices such as pepper, a bay leaf, garlic, allspice berries, onion, and dried thyme.In addition you may want to add potassium nitrate (also known as saltpeter) which inhibits the growth of certain bacteria, most importantly the bacteria responsible for botulism.
This method of pickling pork requires a significant number of days, specifically 7 - 14. Plan to make it far enough ahead so that it is ready when you want to use it.

,, Stir the liquid so that the spices are evenly distributed and the salt dissolves in the water.


The amount of salt you need to add depends on the amount of water you are dissolving it in. To make sure your water is salty enough, take a raw egg and place it in the water. If it floats, your water is salty enough., Cover the bowl and place it in the refrigerator for 7 to 14 days.

, Like other methods of pickling pork, the pork needs to be cooked in some sort of heat before you eat it.


Traditionally this form of pickled pork, also known as salt pork, was fried with apples.However, this form of pickled pork will be excellent roasted or boiled as well.

Brown (cover) the beef with flour before putting it in the stew.,
Mix flour with water to create the flour roux.,
Add the roux to the stew.",How to Thicken Beef Stew1," When browning the beef, first coat the meat in flour before adding to the braising liquid.


This will not only help caramelize the meat for better flavor, but will also help thicken the stew later as the starch from the flour mixes with the liquid.
Once you have browned the meat, deglaze the pot by adding red wine, beer or stock for extra flavor.;
, This is one of the most common methods used to thicken beef stew. The primary protein in flour is gluten. When flour is mixed with water, the protein chains link end-to-end, which forms a web that thickens the sauce.


To create the roux, reduce the heat on the stew and remove a quantity of the stewing liquid. Heat a quantity of fat (butter works best, generally about 2 tablespoons for a decent-sized stew) in a hot pan on medium heat, and add an equal quantity by weight of white flour, whisking the flour around to prevent it burning.
Some recipes call for 6 tablespoons of flour and 4 tablespoons of butter or meat drippings to create the roux.You will end up with a whiteish-yellow paste which will melt at the edges and bubble. Keep stirring the paste around and let it darken slightly. The darker your roux, the more flavor it will add (flour gets nutty flavors as it cooks!) but the less thickening power it will have, so you want a pale roux.

, Once the paste has been thinned to the thickness of a very thick gravy, it can be stirred into your stew. It is important to cook the stew for another 5-10 minutes.


This will ensure that the flour does not add a ""raw"" taste, but it should not be cooked much longer than that as the thickening power of the roux will be destroyed by prolonged cooking.
Remember, the roux will reduce the intensity of the spices a bit so be sure to taste the stew to check the seasoning balance before you serve it. You could use milk instead of water to create the flour roux, although milk sticks and burns quite easily. Oatmeal or rice flour can be used instead of white flour."

Take equal parts butter and flour.,Immediately before serving, bring the liquid to a strong simmer.,
Whisk a small dob of the beurre manié into the stew.",How to Thicken Beef Stew2," Knead them together.The butter should be slightly soft before combining it with the flour. For about 3 quarts of stew, use 2-3 tablespoons of butter and an equal amount of flour.

,, Return the liquid to a simmer, while whisking it constantly."
"
Add a dash of double cream or creme fraiche to make the stew smooth.,
Use cornstarch to create the roux instead of flour.,
Try a packet of beef gravy mix.,
Choose a gluten free option.",How to Thicken Beef Stew3," Season as desired. You can also use potato, rice starch or tapioca.Mix about 2 teaspoons of any of these ingredients with a little water or milk, and then add these into the boiling stew, slowly while stirring. Potato starch gives a different kind of elasticity, more of the dessert kind.If none of the above options is available to you, try to add thickness by being creative. For example, you could try adding instant mashed potato powder, instant sauce mix, or even crushed crackers, although they are not ideal.

, Take some of the stew broth and pour it into a medium mixing bowl. Let the broth cool if hot. Hot broth will cook the cornstarch before you have had time to mix it, and it will be a lumpy mess.


Add a small amount (1 teaspoon to 1 tablespoon) of cornstarch to the broth. Mix it in until there are no lumps. A mixer works great here. When mixing is finished, pour back into the stew, and mix thoroughly. This is called a slurry. You could also use wine to create this.Turn up the heat, and keep stirring. This will help to prevent the mixture from clumping together. Cornstarch is similar to flour in its use as a thickening agent. Guar gum is another thickening agent that is used in industrial food processing to thicken sauces and such. If you can get your hands on it, use very little because it has 8 times the thickening effect that cornstarch has.

, Combine the contents of the packet with a little water until smooth. Stir it in a bowl.


A typical packet will thicken two cups of liquid to a gravy consistency and add a little more beefy flavor.
Most packet gravies are cornstarch based, and mimic the effects of a slurry (cornstarch mixed with a little water until smooth).

, Arrowroot is a good gluten free option. If the stew is already prepared and is too thin, gradually stir in your arrowroot thickener, starting with about 1/2 teaspoon of thickener, and adding more to taste as the stew thickens.


Remember, you must stir slowly and constantly at medium heat to thicken, so do not get impatient and add too much thickener at once.
Arrowroot has more of a neutral flavor than cornstarch. It can also be used at varying temperatures without losing its ability to thicken foods. It tolerates acidic ingredients better than cornstarch and it can be cooked for a longer length of time."

Choose a lot of meaty vegetables.,
Turn vegetables into a paste.,
Finished.

",How to Thicken Beef Stew4," Use more ""meaty"" vegetables that provide tasty filling, such as potatoes, carrots, celery, and cabbage.


When they simmer or boil together with the stew, they will partially dissolve and give the surrounding sauce a richer texture.
Root vegetables work well, especially potatoes. Cooking the potatoes with the stew naturally thickens it.

, A simple method to thicken beef stew is to cook several whole vegetables in the stew pot, such as potatoes, carrots, onions and celery.


After they have cooked and contributed to the overall stew flavor, they can be removed and blended into a paste with stock or some of the cooking liquid. Pull out some of the carrots and potatoes that you cooked with the stew, mash them with a potato masher or a fork, and stir the mashed vegetables back into the beef stew for a thicker consistency.
You could also use an immersion blender directly in the stew to blend some of the vegetables in the broth to make a thicker stew. Stir this paste back into the stew to thicken it. This is a great way to improve the fiber content of a stew as well.

For the record, just because your beef doesn't smell doesn't mean it's safe to eat -- it means it's not rotten. Even beef that is fresh can have bacteria inside that will have you regretting that late-night burrito habit of yours.;
, Does it feel sticky or tacky? How about slimy? That's an indication that it has gone off. You've probably touched fresh ground beef before -- does it feel like that? If not, throw it out.

, Contrary to popular preference, ground beef isn't always that appealing cherry red. In fact, stores go to great lengths to keep their beef red, even if it's a bit unnatural (brown beef just doesn't sell). Beef that is turning brown or even gray is still safe to eat.However, if it's turning green, pitch it.


It generally starts browning or graying from the inside. This is because there's no oxygen getting through to the core, starting the myoglobin on it's pigment-creating journey. It's not uncommon to buy meat from the store, open it right up, and find brown on the inside. It's a totally normal process.
Again, ""safe"" here meaning that it's not rotten. If it has E. coli, it'll have E. Coli whether it's fresh or not.

, If the meat has been deprived of oxygen, it may have turned colors. Letting it breathe may rejuvenate the pigment-forming myoglobin.If the meat remains a gray color and does not turn red, it is probably off. Allow it to sit in the air for about 15 minutes before giving up on it.


Only try this as a last ditch effort if you're really unsure. Most packaging nowadays allows for a minimal amount of oxygen to penetrate the meat (through the plastic film).Unless you've repackaged it yourself and it's perfectly sealed, this shouldn't be an issue.

, This is just a general guideline, letting you know when the seller deems the meat of the highest quality. Generally speaking, a couple of days after the sell-by date is still fine.That is, of course, if it's been properly stored the entire time. If it's been sitting out on the shelf, not so much. And if it's been frozen, it'll be good for months.

, Raw ground beef will last 1 or 2 days past the sell-by date if constantly refrigerated. But cooked ground beef will last you an entire week.So if you didn't get to the grill when you thought you would, cook the meat anyway. You can use it in any number of recipes later.


Just make sure you put it back in the fridge in an airtight container. Any meat that's left out -- cooked or not -- isn't wise to consume at any point.

, To start saving money and saving time asking questions, freeze your beef (cooked or uncooked)! Your meat will be totally safe to eat for 6-8 months if you go this route. And no more last minute trips to the grocery store!


And if you keep it at 0°, anything will last indefinitely. It might not taste as good, but it'll be safe to eat.

, Here's a few general guidelines to remember for the next time you're in this predicament:


Meat left out will keep for about 2 hours -- don't leave it out beyond this point.Meat that has been frozen and then thawed will keep for a day or two in the fridge. However, if it's been thawed in the microwave in water, you should cook it immediately.To reiterate, ground beef will keep in the fridge for a couple of days beyond the sell-by date; up to a week if cooked. It will keep in the freezer for 6-8 months. This is all, of course, if it's kept in an airtight container and properly stored.

, Even meat that has yet to see its expiration date pass will turn bad if it's left out in room temperature. Bacteria starts growing like weeds at anywhere from 40°F to 140°F (4°C to 60°C).In general, you have up to 2 hours to forget about it when you bring it home from the grocery store. It's best to avoid that though and stick it in the fridge immediately!

Limit the jerky's exposure to air.,
Eradicate any source of moisture.,
Control the temperature around the jerky.,
Know the shelf life of your jerky.",How to Store Jerky," Retain the quality of your jerky by placing it in an airtight container. Vacuum packing, sealable bags and plastic wrap can be used to wrap your jerky and are effective at keeping air out. The option that would allow the jerky to be most easily accessible is to place it in a storage container or jar that has a lid.


Label the container with the date at the beginning of the storage life so you know the age of the jerky and how long it has been stored.






Separate your jerky by type. Place different types of jerky in different containers to keep the flavors separate, ensuring top quality.





;
, Water, including condensation in the container, will cause mold to grow on the meat. Fat is also a source of moisture that affects the quality and storage life of your jerky.


Use a paper towel to dry your jerky. If you notice moisture or oil on your jerky, noted by wetness or a sheen on the surface, gently pat the surfaces of the meat with a paper towel.
Keep moisture at bay while the jerky is in storage by placing the jerky between layers of paper towel in the container. The towels will absorb any moisture from the jerky or container. Replace the towels when you notice any presence of moisture.

, After cooking, jerky should be completely cool prior to placing it in a container. Ignoring this precaution, or exposing your stored jerky to a too warm environment will cause it to sweat, which leads to molding.

, Time will take a toll on the quality of your jerky. With proper storage techniques, jerky can safely be stored for varying lengths of time depending on where you choose to store it.


Leave your jerky in a cool, dry place. When placed properly in an airtight container, you can leave your jerky on the counter top or another cool, dry place for no longer than 1 month.






Put your jerky in the refrigerator. Jerky can be stored in the refrigerator to be used within 6 months.






Store homemade jerky in the freezer. Jerky lasts up to 1 year when kept in your freezer.

Try to ensure the brisket you buy has not been frozen. Frozen brisket makes for a less tender finished product.
Lift the brisket. If it feels stiff or flops over, either it has been frozen or it is no longer fresh.;
, Briskets turn out fall-apart tender because they are laced with fat, both inside and out. Choose a piece of meat with a good ""fat cap"" - the white layer of fat at the tip of the brisket - and plenty of marbling all over the meat.

The only part of the meat without much fat is the flat section.
The fat should be bright white. If it looks yellow, the meat has likely been frozen or is not fresh.

, A brisket between 8 and 12 pounds will feed a large party. Smaller briskets may cook too quickly, so avoid going below 8 pounds. Larger briskets cook too slowly and become tough after staying in the smoker for so long.

, Smokers cook meat slowly with indirect heat, allowing the fat from the meat to soften and distribute through the tissue, making it tender and delicious. This effect can be achieved using a grill if you don't have a smoker.
/images/thumb/5/59/Smoke-a-Brisket-Step-9-preview-Version-2.jpg/v4-550px-Smoke-a-Brisket-Step-9-preview-Version-2.jpg
/images/thumb/5/59/Smoke-a-Brisket-Step-9-preview-Version-2.jpg/v4-300px-Smoke-a-Brisket-Step-9-preview-Version-2.jpg









Use the ""indirect heat"" method of cooking on a grill by either pushing all the coals to one side and cooking on the other, or only lighting one side of a gas grill.
Place hardwood chips that have been soaking in water for at least 1 hour over the fire. These produce the smoke that flavors the meat and the moisture that keeps it from drying out.
Add a drip pan below where the meat will sit, since a fair amount of fat will drip off while it cooks.

, Set it fat side up, not directly over the heat. Let it smoke for 1 hour and 15 minutes for every pound of meat, rotating it 180 degrees in the middle of the cooking cycle. Keep the lid on the smoker when you are not rotating it.
/images/thumb/2/29/Smoke-a-Brisket-Step-10-preview-Version-2.jpg/v4-550px-Smoke-a-Brisket-Step-10-preview-Version-2.jpg
/images/thumb/2/29/Smoke-a-Brisket-Step-10-preview-Version-2.jpg/v4-300px-Smoke-a-Brisket-Step-10-preview-Version-2.jpg









Maintain a grill temperature between 200 and 250 degrees, the closer to 200 the better.
Consider basting the meat while it cooks to keep the meat moist and add extra flavor. Baste no more than once an hour, since smoke gets released every time you open the lid.

, The brisket is finished when it reaches an internal temperature of 180 degrees. Keep cooking it until the temperature rises to about 185, then remove it from the smoker and set it on a plate.

",How to Shred Beef," You cannot shred raw beef. Instead, you will need to shred the beef after you have already cooked it.


Let the beef cool slightly before shredding it. For this method, it needs to be cool enough for you to safely touch without burning your skin.;
, Place the beef on your cutting surface and hold it steady with your non-dominant hand.


Make sure that your hands are clean and dry.

, Scrape the tines (prongs) of the fork along these grains, ripping off portions of cooked beef as you go.


It will be easiest to hold the beef so that the grain runs to and away from you. As you scrape, draw the fork down the length of the grain and toward you.

, You will need to continue scraping the fork along the grains of your beef roast until all the meat has been shredded. Pause occasionally during the process to manually remove pieces of beef from the fork whenever the tines get clogged.


If you see any gristle in the beef as you work, discard the gristle, then continue shredding.

, Shredded beef can be used immediately, or you can store it in the refrigerator for up to three days.


If you plan on storing the shredded beef, place 2-cup (500-ml) portions inside airtight containers and pour enough of the cooking liquid over the beef to moisten it. This cooking liquid prevents the beef from drying out.
If you cannot use the beef within three days, place it in the freezer and store it for up to three months.
Thaw the beef in your refrigerator, or place the contents of the container in a small saucepan and heat it over medium-low until the beef is adequately warm.

, If you have not done so already, you will need to cook the beef before you can shred it. You cannot shred beef while it is still raw.


Allow the beef to cool slightly before you shred it. You do not need to handle it directly with your hands when you use this method, so it does not need to be cool to the touch. Nonetheless, allowing the beef to rest for five minutes or so will let the juices settle and disperse throughout the meat more evenly.

,, Drag both forks in exact opposite directions to remove shreds of cooked beef.


Ideally, you should shred the beef along the grain instead of trying to work against it. Shredding in the direction of the grain will make the process easier and quicker.

, Continue pulling off shreds of beef by dragging the forks across the roast in opposite directions. If the beef does not fall off naturally, peel it off the fork from time to time and continue shredding. Repeat this as needed until all the beef has been separated into shreds.


You may run across gristle and fat as you shred the beef. Discard it as you see it before continuing on.

, The shredded beef can be eaten immediately, but if you need to save it, you can store the beef in the refrigerator for up to three days.


For longer storage, freeze the shredded beef up to three months.
When preparing the refrigerate or freeze the beef, separate it into 2-cup (500-ml) portions and place those portions inside airtight containers. Pour enough cooking liquid over the beef to prevent it from drying out or from getting freezer burn.
The beef can be thawed in your refrigerator or microwave. Alternatively, you can place the contents of the container in a saucepan and heat the beef on medium-low on your stove until warm.

, One of the easiest ways to cook beef you plan on shredding is to use a slow cooker. Depending on the size of the slow cooker, you may need to cut the roast in half to ensure that the entire thing will fit inside.


For best results, use a 4-qt to 5-qt (4-L to 5-L) slow cooker.
If you can fit the beef roast inside your slow cooker without cutting it in half, consider cooking it whole.

, Place the beef roast in your slow cooker and pour the beef broth over it evenly.If desired, you could add other ingredients to the slow cooker at this time to give the taste of the beef more depth. For instance, you could add up to two onions, cut into wedges, and two cloves of garlic, minced well. Place any aromatic ingredients like these on the bottom of the slow cooker and sit the beef on top of them.

, Cover the slow cooker and slowly cook the beef roast until the beef is tender enough to peel off using nothing more than a fork.


If you have enough time, try cooking the beef on low for 11 to 12 hours. Doing so will make the beef even more tender than it will be when cooked on high.
The beef will be well-done. If you use a cooking thermometer to check the internal temperature of the beef roast, look for a temperature between 160 and 170 degrees Fahrenheit (71 and 77 degrees Celsius)., While a slow cooker is one of the simplest kitchen appliances you can use to cook beef for shredding, this is not your only option. If you do not have a slow cooker or prefer another cooking technique for roasts, you may cook the roast using an alternate technique.


Another simple way to cook beef roast is to slow cook the roast in the oven.
Similarly, you can cook the beef roast on the stove using a Dutch oven.

Use an oven-safe pan or dish large enough to hold the amount of suet you plan to render.,
Put the suet in the oven-safe pan.,
Check the suet every hour to make sure it is melting––but not boiling.,
Filter the suet.,
Allow to set.",How to Render Suet1,"  Use a pan that has high enough sides to hold all the suet when it becomes liquid. A wider pan, such as a 9"" X 13"" cake pan, with 2 inch (5.1 cm) sides will work well for 6 to 8 cups of suet.;
, Place the pan in the oven at about 200ºF/93ºC.  Rendering is a slow process of melting the fat. Do not boil the rendered fat, and be aware that rendered fat (as oil) will be flammable, so use appropriate caution if rendering suet in a gas oven or near any open flame.

, Adjust your oven temperature up or down by 25 degrees, if needed. The rendered hot oil will start to clarify. If you have used raw, untrimmed suet, you will see particles that will settle at the bottom of the pan, and some that will float to the top.

, When the suet is fully melted, (the timing will vary depending upon the quantity of suet rendered), filter it by pouring it through a fine steel mesh, or a funnel with a coffee filter or paper towel lining it. Caution! The oil is hot and will not pour through a filter quickly, so take your time to avoid spilling.

, After filtering, pour the hot, melted, filtered suet into a container. (If using plastic, make sure it will withstand heat.) As it cools, the suet will solidify again.

",How to Stretch Ground Beef," There are a variety of foods that you can mix in with ground beef to help stretch it. However, dry extenders, such as breadcrumbs and oats, require some type of binder to help hold the mixture together for burgers, loafs, or balls. Eggs are an ideal option because their proteins can easily hold the meat mixture together when heated.As a general guideline, use 1 egg for every ½ pound (227 g) of ground beef that you’re mixing an additive into in order to stretch it.
You can use egg substitute in place of the egg if you prefer.
You can also replace every whole egg with two egg whites if you prefer.;
, One of the most common extender for stretching ground beef is breadcrumbs. They work especially well in meatballs and meatloaf, but you may enjoy them in burgers as well.Some recipes call for mixing equal amounts of breadcrumbs and ground beef when trying to stretch the meat. However, that may alter the texture more than you’d like. Start with a smaller amount and only add more if you need to stretch the beef further.
White breadcrumbs work fine for stretching ground beef, but wholewheat breadcrumbs are usually a better option.

, Just like breadcrumbs, whole or rolled oats can help stretch ground beef a little further in your favorite recipe. They mix easily in with the beef and won’t be noticed once you cook the meat. Best of all, the oats are high in fiber so they can help make your meal more filling.In general, use ¼ to ½ cup (23 to 46 g) whole or rolled oats for every pound (454 g) of ground beef.
To stretch ground beef in dishes such as tacos, chili, casseroles, and pasta sauces, you can also substitute bulgur wheat, which is a type of whole wheat. A cup (250 g) of cooked bulgar wheat can replace a pound (454 g) of ground beef, so if a recipe calls for two pounds (908 g) of browned ground beef, you can use 1 pound (454 g) of the beef and 1 cup (250 g) of the cooked bulgar wheat., For tacos, chili, and casseroles, adding precooked beans to your ground beef can help stretch it. In particular, black and pinto beans mix well with the beef. Brown the beef first, though, and blot the excess grease before adding the beans.In most recipes, you can mix an equal amount of beans and ground beef.
If you aren’t a fan of beans, you can mix precooked lentils in with raw ground beef. When they are mixed, you can cook the mixture just as if it was regular ground beef. In general, use 1 cup (75 g) of cooked lentils for every pound (454 g) of meat.

, Whether you’re making burgers, meatloaf, or meatballs, mixing some grated vegetables in with the ground beef can make it go further. Grate carrots, zucchini, and onions and mix them in with the raw beef before shaping it.As a general rule, add ¾ to 1 cup (40 to 50 g) of grated vegetables for every pound (454 g) of ground beef.
Mushrooms also make a good mix in with ground beef, but you should saute them first so they release their liquid and don’t add too much moisture to the meat.
Caramelizing onions before you add them to the ground beef can help add rich flavor to burgers, meatloaf, or meatballs.
Other firm root vegetables, such as beets and parsnips, also work well as an extender for ground beef.
It may seem strange, but fruit can be a tasty contender  for ground beef. Mix crushed pineapple into meatballs, finely chopped blueberries into burgers, or peeled and shredded Granny Smith apples into meatloaf.

, If you’re making tacos, chili, or sloppy Joes, you can mix some cooked rice into the beef to help extend it. Brown the meat as you normally would and drain the excess grease before mixing in the rice.As a rule of thumb, add 1 cup (250 g) of cooked rice for every pound (454g ) of ground beef.
Both white and brown rice work well as an extender for ground beef.

, Fresh herbs have a bright taste that can help balance any flavor that might be lost by cutting back on the meat. Add finely chopped fresh herbs such as basil or parsley to the ground beef before you cook it or form it into burgers, meatloaf, or meatballs.Basil, parsley, and cilantro can work well for burgers.
Basil, parsley, rosemary, thyme, oregano, and sage can work well for meatloaf.
Basil, parsley, rosemary, thyme, and oregano can work well for meatballs.

, The right spices and dried herbs can also help make up for any flavor that might be lost if you cut back on the ground beef. Season the raw ground beef with spices and dried herbs, such as crushed red pepper or marjoram, before forming it into burgers, meatloaf, or meatballs.Crushed red pepper, cayenne pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, and steak seasoning can work well for burgers.
Crushed red pepper, cayenne pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, steak seasoning, dried oregano, and dried basil can work well for meatloaf.
Crushed red pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, dried oregano, and dried basil can work well for meatballs.

, Mixing some grated hard cheese into the ground beef before you form the burgers, meatballs, or meatloaf can help boost the flavor so you don’t notice that there’s less meat. Parmigiano-Reggiano and pecorino Romano are both ideal options.Parmigiano-Reggiano and pecorino Romano are obviously ideal for mixing into ground beef that you plan to make into meatballs, but you can also use them for burger or meatloaf mixes.

, Mixing a little sauce or your favorite condiment into raw ground beef before you make your burgers, meatballs, or meatloaf can help make up for any missing flavor from the decrease in meat. For example, add some ketchup, thick pasta sauce, whole-grain mustard, barbecue sauce, or thai curry paste to your ground beef mixture.Be careful not to add too much of the sauce or condiment. Excess moisture can lead to mushy burgers, meatloaf, and meatballs. Using 1 to 2 tablespoons (15 to 30 ml) for every pound (454 g) of meat is a good rule of thumb.

, If you’re trying to stretch ground beef to make your meals a little healthier, it’s best to start with a leaner cut of ground beef. While fatty cuts tend to be juicier, leaner cuts are lower in saturated fat and calories so you don’t have to feel as bad about using them in your recipes.Ground sirloin and ground round are usually the leanest cuts of ground beef that you can get. Ground sirloin has 10 to 14% fat, while ground round has about 12% fat.
Avoid regular ground beef, which usually has 25 to 30% fat.

, It may seem pretty obvious, but the easiest way to stretch your ground beef is just use less of it. If a recipe calls for 2 pounds (908 g) of ground beef, cut it down to 1 ½ pounds (680 g). In most cases, you won’t even notice the difference.If you’re worried that your dish will be lacking, trying mixing in more of other ingredients, such as vegetables or starches, to make up for the ground beef that you’ve cut.
If you’re making burgers, meatloaf, or meatballs, shape your patties, loaf, or balls slightly smaller than usual so you don’t need as much ground beef.

, Whether you’re adding an extender, binder, or spices and seasonings into raw ground beef, be careful not to overmix it. Mixing it too much can lead to tough burgers, meatloaf, or meatballs. Use clean hands to gently mix the beef and other ingredients until they’re just combined., When you’ve added extenders or other ingredients to the ground beef, the mixture is usually more fragile than straight ground beef. Lightly pat the meat mixture to form the burgers, loaf, or meatballs, and gently flip the burgers and meatballs with a spatula to avoid breaking them.When you’re shaping the meat mixture, do not pack the burgers or meatballs together too tightly or they may crumble.
Spoon a ground beef mixture for meatloaf into the pan without packing it too tightly against the sides.

Pork and beef tenderloin or prime rib are delicious options for slow cooking in an oven., You will adjust the temperature when the roast is put in the oven. Ensuring that your oven is heated before your put in the roast will help ensure even cooking from start to finish.

, Place a large pan over medium high heat on the stove top. Place the meat in the hot pan and sear the meat on all sides. Allow the meat to cook for about thirty seconds on all sides to quickly brown the outer layer of the meat., The rack raises the meat off the bottom of the pan to allow for better air circulation and even cooking. It also keeps the meat from stewing in the juices and becoming soggy on the bottom. If a pan with a rack is not available, place the meat on sturdy foods such as potatoes or carrots to keep it from getting too wet.

, Check your meat with a thermometer after 2.5 hours for a 2.5 pound roast. Follow these guidelines for doneness when checking temperature:


130ºF Rare
135ºF Medium Rare
150ºF Medium
160ºF Well Done
NOTE: Your meat will continue to cook slightly after removing from the oven. The final temperature may change after you take it out of the oven.

Store the leftovers.",How to Roast a Leg of Lamb," When you're planning to make roasted leg of lamb, buy the lamb from a butcher you know and trust, rather than picking it up on sale from the grocery store. That's because the quality of the meat will have a big impact on the taste of the finished roast. Ask for a leg of lamb at market weight, meaning it was butchered at the proper age.Lamb that's below market weight was butchered too early. Butchering a baby lamb is unethical and isn't a common practice among reputable farmers and butchers.
Lamb that's over market weight was butchered later in the animal's life. Older meat will taste more like mutton (the meat of an adult sheep) than lamb. Mutton has a much stronger taste that some people find distasteful.;
, Bone-in lamb, like other bone-in meats, tends to be more flavorful than boneless meat. As the bone cooks it releases juices that flavor the meat. However, bone-in lamb is a bit more difficult to cut than boneless, so you might find it easier to go with the boneless. Boneless meat usually comes in an oven-safe net or wrapped in twine, to keep the meat in the shape of a leg.


With the bone, a leg of lamb will weight about 6 1/2 to 8 pounds.
If your boneless leg of lamb does not come in an oven-safe net, use kitchen twine to tie the meat together in several spots along its length.

, The part of the lamb's leg that is edible is the upper leg, or the thigh. The bottom part of the leg is called the shank. Some people like to roast the entire leg, for an impressive presentation, while others prefer to just use the top part of the leg. The shank doesn't have enough meat to eat, but you can use the bone as a soup base., If the butcher hasn't already trimmed away the fell, a thick cap of fat that encases the leg, have them do so. If you roast the lamb leg with the fell, it will be more likely to taste of mutton, and it will be less tender. However, don't have the butcher remove all of the fat. Keeping some of the fat intact will help to flavor the lamb and keep it moist.

, Bringing the meat to room temperature will ensure that it cooks evenly. If you put it in the oven cold, you may end up with an undercooked interior and burned exterior.

,, Lamb is so tender that it doesn't need to be marinated. You can follow a recipe to marinate the lamb, but it's easier to complement the meat's flavor with a simple rub. First, rub olive oil and a few tablespoons of lemon juice all over the lamb. Then, sprinkle the leg with salt, pepper and 3 tablespoons or so of your favorite spices. Try the following, either alone or in combination:


Crushed rosemary
Dried thyme
Dried sage
Minced garlic

, Use a pan that's just slightly larger than the leg.

, Roasting for the first 30 minutes at a high heat will give the lamb a nice sear.

, Turn it down to 350 °F (177 °C) for the remainder of the roasting time. Roast for another 30 minutes to an hour or more, depending on your preferred level of doneness. No matter what, use a meat thermometer to check the meat's temperature after about an hour to see how the lamb is progressing. Here are the general guidelines for roasting times:

,



Medium-rare meat: roast until the internal temperature of the meat is 130 °F (54 °C), which will require about 20 minutes per pound.

Medium meat: roast until the internal temperature of the meat is 135 °F (57 °C), which will require about 25 minutes per pound.

Well done meat: roast until the internal temperature of the meat is 155 °F (68 °C), which will require about 30 minutes per pound.

, Give it at least 15 minutes before you start carving the meat. This allows time for the lamb's juices to absorb back into the leg, which will make the meat more flavorful and moist.

, If you used boneless lamb, simple cut it into 1-inch thick slices. For bone-in lamb, set the leg on a cutting board. Make perpendicular cuts an inch apart down the length of the leg, using a sharp knife to cut until the knife hits the bone. Stand the leg on its tip and use the knife to cut parallel to the bone so that the meat falls off in slices.

, Leg of lamb is traditionally served with a mint sauce or a gravy. The tender meat tastes delicious with a complementary sauce, and these choices don't take much extra time to make.



To make mint sauce, blend 2 cups fresh mint leaves, 1/4 cup olive oil, 2 garlic cloves, 2 tablespoons lemon juice and 1/4 cup plain yogurt in a blender. Pour over the lamb slices.

To make lamb gravy, pour the drippings from the roasting pan into a small saucepan and heat it to medium high. Add 1 chopped onion and sauté until translucent. Add 1 cup chicken stock and 1/2 cup wine, and simmer until it thickens. Season with salt and pepper. Pour over the lamb slices to serve.

, Leftover lamb will keep in the refrigerator for 3 days. You can also freeze lamb by wrapping the slices individually in aluminum foil, then reheating them as needed in an oven heated to 350 °F (177 °C).

Be sure to get every last shred of membrane, since you don't want bits of chewy membrane on your ribs.
You can ask the butcher to remove it for you.;
, You can use a rub and let the seasoning seep into the ribs overnight, or skip this step and mop the beef with barbecue sauce during the cooking process. Some chefs contend that brining overnight with a rub improves the flavor, while others prefer not to infuse the beef with spices and salt. Either method will result in fall-apart ribs that are tender on the inside and crispy on the outside.


If you're using a rub, you need to plan ahead so you have time to let the ribs brine overnight. Just rub your dry spice mix over both sides of the racks, wrap them in plastic wrap, and refrigerate overnight.
Make a homemade rub with the following ingredients:

3 Tablespoons salt
2 Tablespoons chili powder
1 1/2 teaspoons black pepper
1 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1 teaspoon smoked paprika
1 teaspoon dried thyme
1 teaspoon garlic powder



, Beef ribs need to be cooked low and slow, and you can do it either in the oven or on the grill. Preheat to 225 degrees Fahrenheit (107 degrees Celsius).


If you're cooking on the grill, you can smoke the ribs by adding applewood chips to the coals. Choose hickory, pecan, sweet maple or cherry.

, Wrap them well in several layers of aluminum foil, making sure there are no holes for the juice to leak out. You can place the wrapped ribs on a baking sheet if you're worried about getting juices in your oven.


Wrap the ribs so that you'll be able to open the foil from the top to check whether they are done. You don't want to have to completely unwrap them, since you'll get drippings everywhere if you do so.

, Put them meat side down in the oven or on the grill and close the door or lid. Cook the ribs for 3 hours without disturbing them. During this time the juices will start to flow and the meat will become succulent and tender.


Make sure the temperature stays constant at 225 degrees. If your oven tends to run hot or cold, you might need to adjust it during the cooking process. If you're cooking on a grill, monitor the temperature and adjust the gas as necessary.

, After about 3 hours, carefully unwrap the top of the foil and poke the ribs with a fork. If the meat easily falls off the bone, they're ready. If it resists, replace the foil and let the ribs cook for an additional 1/2 hour before checking again.

, When they've reached the fall-apart stage, take them out to get them ready for the next step. It's time for the final stage of cooking, which will ensure the ribs have a crispy exterior.

, If you treated your ribs with a rub, you can skip the barbecue sauce, but either way it adds a flavor burst to the ribs. Paint the top of the ribs with a liberal amount of barbecue sauce.


You can whip up your own barbecue sauce by simmering the following ingredients together for 30 minutes beforehand:

1 1/2 cups ketchup
1/2 cup brown sugar
3 garlic cloves, minced
3 tablespoons apple cider vinegar
3 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon salt



, Let them cook for an additional 10 minutes under the broiler, until the tops of the ribs turn brown and crispy.

, Place them on a plate to cool for a few moments.

, Barbecue beef ribs are excellent with potato salad, macaroni salad and extra barbecue sauce.

Make a Vietnamese-inspired mixture of crushed garlic with several tbsp. (30ml) of lime juice and (30ml) soy sauce.Try red wine, olive oil and crushed garlic for a simple Italian marinade.

, The exact amounts that you use should cover at least half the chops. Try to use equal amounts of oil and acid (vinegar, juice or wine).

, Massage the chops to coat them thoroughly with the marinade.

, Seal it.

, The longer the chops marinate, the stronger the flavors will be.

, You can also simply turn it halfway through your marinating time.

Add milk, water, pasta, and sauce mix.,
Heat to a boil.,
Turn down heat and simmer.,
Simmer, covered, for 10 to 20 minutes.,
Remove from heat when pasta is al dente.",How to Make Hamburger Helper1," Heat a large frying pan over medium-high heat for five minutes. Add a small amount of cooking spray or oil to the pan, then immediately add the hamburger. Break up the meat as it cooks with a spoon or spatula.


You want the meat to cook until it is well-browned all over and no pink remains. At medium-high heat this will usually take five to seven minutes, but feel free to cook longer as needed.;
, Depending on how lean your ground beef was, you may have just a little grease in the pan or quite a bit. There are a few different ways to drain it — see below for suggestions.


One easy option is to set a metal colander in a large glass bowl, then pour the contents of the pan into the colander. The grease will drain into the bowl, where you can allow it to cool and transfer to the garbage.
Another option is to set a lid over the pan, then shift it so a small crack remains at one side. Carefully tilt the pan to drain the grease into a container that won't melt from the heat, then discard in the garbage.

Don't pour grease down the drain. It can solidify, clogging the drain.

, Stir these ingredients in the pan to combine well with the hamburger.

, Return the pan to medium-high heat. Let the mixture heat, stirring occasionally to keep it from sticking. Watch for bubbles.

, Once the mixture reaches a healthy boil, turn the heat to medium or low. The bubbling should slow down to a slow, steady simmer.

, Add a lid to the pan. Allow to simmer, stirring every few minutes to ensure even cooking and prevent sticking. As the mixture cooks, the sauce will gradually thicken and the pasta will gradually soften.


13 minutes of cooking time is usually about enough, but depending on the level of heat, your casserole may cook more or less quickly, so test the pasta often.

, The casserole is ready to eat as soon as the pasta reaches a pleasingly soft texture that still has some firmness to it. You should feel just the slightest resistance when you bite or cut into the pasta. This texture is called ""al dente.""Let the casserole cool down for at least 2 or 3 minutes before serving. The sauce will continue to thicken as it cools.

"

Microwave beef on high until cooked all the way through.,
Drain the grease.,
Add pasta, milk, hot water, and sauce mix.,
Microwave on high for about 14-19 minutes.,
Remove from microwave and let cool when pasta is al dente.",How to Make Hamburger Helper2," If you're in a rush, Hamburger Helper can be prepared entirely in the microwave with the same basic approach as above. To start, crumble your beef into a large microwave-safe bowl. Heat the meat on high for about five to seven minutes or until any residual pinkness is gone. Break up the meat and stir at the three-minute mark.


Don't forget to crumble the meat as you put it in the bowl and to break it up halfway through the cooking process. Microwaving a single solid block of ground beef will lead to uneven cooking.

, Any of the draining techniques covered in the section above will work just as well here. Remember that, to avoid clogged drains, pour cooled grease into the garbage, not the sink.

, Stir well to combine in the bowl with the cooked ground beef.

, Stop the cooking to stir the mixture every five minutes or so. Don't cover the bowl completely as it cooks. You can use a microwave-safe lid to reduce splatters, but leave it open a crack so that steam and pressure do not build up in the container.


Use oven mitts or a towel to protect your hands when you stir. After a few minutes of cooking, the bowl will be very hot.

, Test the pasta for done-ness every time you stop to stir the casserole. Your dish is ready to serve when the pasta has a semi-soft texture that offers a little resistance (in other words, when it's ""al dente""). Carefully transfer the hot bowl out of the microwave and let it cool somewhere safe for high temperatures (like an unused burner on the stove).


As in the method above, the cooling period is important — the sauce will continue to thicken even after the bowl is removed from the heat.

Brown and drain the ground beef as normal.,
Add the pasta, milk, and water.,
Add the seasonings.,
Simmer.,
Remove from heat and add cheese.,
Let cool and serve.",How to Make Hamburger Helper3," If you don't have a package of Hamburger helper handy, you can make a very similar recipe yourself from common kitchen ingredients. Start just like you would in the sections above: by browning the ground beef. Heat a frying pan on the stove, add oil or cooking spray, then add the beef to the pan. Use your spoon or spatula to break up the meat as it cooks.


As above, you're ready to proceed when the ground beef is well-browned all over and no pink remains.
Drain the excess grease from the pan when the beef is browned exactly as in the sections above.

, Stir these ingredients well to combine. Let them heat to a boil, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking.


In the recipe above, elbow macaroni are suggested, but any similarly-sized pasta should work well. Don't use a pasta with significantly smaller- or larger-sized pieces — these can have different cooking times.

, When the mixture reaches a boil, add the cornstarch, chili powder, garlic powder, sugar, salt, paprika, cayenne, and red pepper flakes. Stir until the mixture is uniform and well-combined.

, Reduce the heat to medium or low so that the bubbling becomes slow and steady. Cover and cook at this heat for about 10-12 minutes. Stir every few minutes to prevent sticking.

, When the pasta is al dente (softened but with some firmness remaining), turn off the heat. Sprinkle the shredded cheddar cheese over the casserole. Stir well to combine.

, As with the other recipes, the liquid when you're cooking Hamburger Helper from scratch will continue to thicken as the casserole cools. Let the dish sit for at least two to three minutes before serving.

Cook the beef on a grill, in a pan or in the oven.",How to Marinate Beef," This is also usually a healthier choice because of low fat content. The act of marinating will soften the first few centimeters of a round, hanger, skirt, flank or sirloin cut.;
, The best way to do this is to place frozen meat in a sealed container in your refrigerator overnight. Ensure that the meat is defrosted about 12 to 24 hours before you plan to eat it, so that you can marinate it for an adequate amount of time., This is only recommended for cuts that have very little fat content. It will help the marinade sink deeper into the beef.

, Glass or plastic work best., Add one part acid, one part oil, one part aromatics and salt and/or sugar to taste. The following are excellent ingredients to use in marinades:


The best acids for meat are vinegar, lemon juice lime juice, Worcestershire sauce and soy sauce. If you use soy sauce, don’t add extra salt, since it is a main ingredient in the sauce.
The best acids are neutral oils, like canola oil and olive oil.
Granulated sugar or honey adds sweetness and also encourages a brown color and caramel taste.
Use aromatics like crushed garlic, rosemary, red pepper flakes, ginger, bay leaf or steak seasoning. Paprika, chili pepper and jalapenos or other fresh peppers are perfect for a spicy, smoky flavor.

, Grab a spoon and taste a small amount. The marinade should taste good before it goes on the beef, since the majority of the marinade will stay in the first few cm of the surface., The enzymes penetrate the meat and help tenderize it if used for two hours or less.

, Turn the beef to coat it entirely.

, The longer the beef is marinated, the more intense the flavor will be.

, Take the beef out of the bag or container. Shake it lightly to remove extra marinade.


Don’t leave garlic gloves on the surface, or they may burn on the surface.

, Let it sit out until it comes to room temperature. This should take at least 20 minutes or up to one hour.

, The cooking time will vary depending upon the size of the beef.

",How to Make Stew,"


You may also choose to add fennel, shallots or leaks into this mixture.;
, Add 2 tbsp. (30 ml) of oil to coat it.


If you plan to cook your stew in a Dutch oven, you may want to Sauté the aromatics before browning your meat and use the same pot.

,,, If you plan to use seafood, it should be added near the end because it cooks more quickly.


Stew meats are generally less expensive, tougher cuts of meat. The braising process breaks down the fats in the meat, tenderizing them. Choose meats like pork shoulder, chicken thighs, chuck roast, bottom round, or even meats labeled ""stew meat.""

, Defrosting in the microwave right before can change some of the stew flavors because it may cook some of the meat too quickly.

, Cut 1 to 2-inch (2.5 to 5cm) pieces of meat. The size will depend upon your preference.


Generally, the longer the cooking time, the bigger your pieces of meat should be. You do not want your meat to overcook.
Not all meat needs to be cut before adding it to a stew. Chicken thighs, chicken wings and short ribs can be cooked with the bone in and removed while eating.

, Dredge your meat pieces in flour. This will give them a crispy edge and give the stew a more complex flavor.

, Pour 1 to 2 tbsp. (15 to 30ml) of oil into the bottom of the pan to coat it.

, Brown it on all sides. This should take approximately 5 to 8 minutes with 2 lbs. (0.9kg) of meat.

, Place a towel or foil over the top to keep it warm.

,, Make sure it covers the entire bottom, adding more if necessary.

,, Make sure you loosen and incorporate as many as possible of those bits. It will strengthen the flavor.

,


If you are using a slow cooker, you should add the deglazed sauce, meat and aromatics to the crock pot now.

,


If you are using a slow cooker, you should only cover approximately half of the volume of the ingredients with your liquid. The cooker will concentrate all the steam and juices inside the pot.

, Bay leaves, salt, pepper and thyme are frequently used with stews, but you should adjust your spices according to the flavors you prefer.

,, You do not want to cook the meat too fast, just bring the temperature up so that it can stew.

, Simmer the ingredients for 1 to 4 hours, depending upon the volume of the stew and the amount of meat you have used.


If you are cooking a stew in a slow cooker, it will need to cook for 4 hours on the high setting or 6 to 8 hours on the low setting.

, Add them during the last 20 to 30 minutes of your simmering.


If you add the root vegetables too soon, they will be mushy.

, If they are tender enough to break away with only a fork, the stew is ready to serve.

Whip up your egg binding in a small bowl.,
Dump your raw ground meat in a large bowl.,
Add the egg mixture, Parmesan, and breadcrumbs to the meat and mix well.,
Form 1-inch balls by rolling the mixture in your hands.,
Cook for in a frying pan over medium heat, preferably in your sauce.,
Alternatively, cook meatballs in the oven on a baking rack for 20-30 min at 350F.,
Serve with any carbohydrate, such as spaghetti/pasta, white rice, or a baked potato.",How to Make Simple Meatballs1," Meatballs need the egg and breadcrumbs in order to hold their shape, and the egg will provide moisture as they cook. By adding the seasonings to this liquid mixture, you'll ensure that they distribute evenly throughout the meatballs. Try out the following seasoning combos, or feel free to make your own. The only essential is the one teaspoon salt:


1/2 teaspoon each oregano, garlic powder, cracked red pepper, thyme
1-2 tablespoon Italian seasoning blend (if it contains salt, do not add the teaspoon of plain salt)
1 packet powdered onion soup mixture.
Adobo chili mixture or spice packet;
, Remember that you can use anything here to form your meatballs, though hamburger tends to be the classic choice. That said, mixing things up and combining meats, like the Italian classic of burger, lamb, and veal, can lead to some truly stellar meatballs with no extra work.

, You should use your hands, if you're comfortable, to blend and mix the crumbs together, as this will ensure everything is well coated. Pinch the meat between your fingers to blend instead of kneading or smashing the meat. If not using your hands, a sturdy wooden spatula or spoon will do.


Mix as little as possible for the best texture-- just until everything is well mixed. The more you mix the meat, the tougher it gets., Simply pinch off some of the meat mixture and roll it up into a ball. You can make bigger or smaller meatballs, of course, but know that you must adjust cooking times accordingly.


Larger meatballs will take longer to cook, and you must be careful not to let the outsides burn while the insides finish.
Smaller meatballs may dry out if you're not careful -- they must hit the heat and come off quicker., You can simply cook the meatballs in hot olive oil, flipping every 2-3 minutes until well browned on all sides. But the best way to cook meatballs is in the sauce they were served. Hit up an 3/4-inch of sauce to a simmer and then just dump the meatballs in, turning occasionally for 30 minutes. This will bring out a richness in the sauce and cook the meatballs in a nice, tenderizing liquid, preventing drying out.


A slow-cooker filled with sauce and meatballs can accomplish the same thing for beautifully rich, slow-cooked meatballs.

, Make sure you rotate them every 10 minutes or so, ensuring even cooking. Roasting tends to bring out a slightly deeper flavor, as the edges brown and crisp, so choose the method that you think is the best -- neither skillet nor oven is the ""right"" way.


Finish the meatballs with 2-3 minutes in the broiler to get a wonderfully browned, crisp edge if desired., You can also freeze these meatballs for several weeks if you're not ready to eat them. Enjoy!

Add a simple glaze to serve the meatballs as their own entree.,
Brown the outside of the meatballs and then freeze them if you need to cook ahead.",How to Make Simple Meatballs2," The most common addition to simple meatballs is onion and garlic, as they bring a richness to the meatballs without a ton of extra work. If you finely chop up half an onion (less than 1/2-inch big pieces) and mince 2-3 cloves of garlic, add them to the meat before the egg and breadcrumbs.


A 1/4 cup of freshly cut parsley goes wonderfully with the onion and garlic as well.

, This pre-soaking will make the breadcrumbs soggy, which releases moisture as the meatballs cook to keep them tender and juicy throughout., Once the meatballs are formed, cook them on the stovetop at high heat just until the edges brown. Meanwhile, heat the oven to 400° F. Dump the half-cooked balls into a shallow baking dish and smother them with red sauce, then cover with cheese (mozzarella, Fontina, Parmesan). Bake the whole thing for 15-20 minutes and then serve with bread or on a roll., Tired of the classic spaghetti and meatballs? You can mix things up and make meatballs their own main course with a simple but savory glaze, made to complement your rich meatballs perfectly:

Add 1/8 teaspoon allspice and stir in.
Add the cooked meatballs into the glaze and turn to coat.
Cook for 3-5 minutes in the glaze, until it thickens around the meat., Don't just freeze the raw meat. Instead, cook the meatballs in a skillet until the outsides are brown, then cool and freeze. When ready to eat them, heat them up for 20 minutes or so in 1/2 of sauce to finish cooking them and thaw them up naturally, leading to almost no loss of texture and flavor."

Use a spatula or a wooden spoon to break the beef up into small crumbles as it browns.






The beef should appear fully browned at the end of this step, but it does not need to be fully cooked since it will continue to cook later in the process.






Drain the beef after browning it by pouring it into a colander. Return the beef to the skillet after draining it.







, Stir the taco seasoning, Rotel, beef broth, and macaroni into the skillet with the beef. Heat the mixture through until it reaches a boil.For a stronger tomato flavor, consider adding a second can of Rotel. The first can should be undrained, but if adding a second can, drain the tomatoes before dumping them into the pan.
Measure out 3 to 4 Tbsp (45 to 60 ml) of commercial or homemade taco seasoning. Alternatively, you could also use one standard packet of commercial taco seasoning.

, After the contents reach a boil, cover the pan and reduce the heat to medium-low. Let the contents simmer gently for 12 to 14 minutes, or until the macaroni is tender.


You can stir the contents of the pan occasionally as it cooks to prevent the macaroni from sticking, but do not lift the lid more than three or four times throughout the cooking process since doing so releases steam that could otherwise help cook the dish.







, While the beef and macaroni mixture simmers, start working on the cheese sauce. Place the butter in a medium saucepan and heat it on medium until it melts.


For a lower fat version, consider using margarine instead of butter. Do not use oil, however.

, Sprinkle the flour over the surface of the melted butter, whisking continuously. Whisk the flour and butter together for another 5 minutes, or until it becomes light brown.


The butter and flour roux should also become more fragrant during this time.
Do not allow the roux to burn, however. It should brown lightly but should not char.

, Slowly pour the milk into the roux, whisking continuously. Allow the mixture to reach a boil.


You may need to slow down your whisking after adding all the milk in to allow the milk a chance to boil.
As soon as a gentle boil starts, whisk the mixture more vigorously, continuing until the clumps of roux break up and the entire thing is smooth and thick.

, Remove the saucepan from the heat. Add the shredded cheese and stir it in until melted. Add the salt and pepper after that, stirring well to combine.


Shredded cheese works best because it melts the quickest. Cubes or blocks of cheese could also be added, but you should chop these blocks into smaller portions or shred them with a box shredder before adding them.
Cheddar cheese is recommended, but you could experiment with different cheeses for a simple way to change the flavor of the dish. Try something like Colby-Jack or Monterey-Jack. Use Pepper-Jack cheese for a spicy alternative, or try a cheddar blend for a more subtle change.

, Keep the cheese sauce warm until the beef mixture finishes cooking. Once the beef and macaroni mixture is done, pour the cheese sauce over the mixture and stir it in.


Stir gently to prevent the macaroni from breaking apart.






The cheese sauce should thoroughly coat all of the beef and macaroni mixture.







, Spoon the mixture into individual serving bowls. Serve the dish while it is still hot.

",How to Make Salisbury Steak Meatballs," Assemble your ingredients for easy access before you start to prepare your meatballs. First place ground beef and breadcrumbs in a large mixing bowl. Then add 1/4 cup of brown mustard, 1/4 cup of ketchup, and 1 tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce.You’ll be mixing the ingredients later, so there’s no need at this stage to stir anything up.;
, Add 1/2 teaspoon each of salt and black pepper to the bowl. If you’d like, you can crumble up a cube of beef bouillon and add it, too. Or, if you have powdered beef base on hand, use a teaspoon of that instead of the bouillon cube.


Adding the bouillon or powdered beef base will add a touch more savoriness., Wash and dry your hands before mixing the ingredients. Use kneading, mashing, and squeezing motions to combine the ingredients. Make sure the ingredients are evenly and consistently dispersed throughout the mixture., Do your best to make balls that are uniform in size and shape so they will cook more evenly. Try using a medium-sized ice cream scoop to separate out about 2 tablespoons of the mixture, then roll it in your hands to make a ball.Place the balls in another large bowl or plate after you form them. Set them aside while you prepare your pan to cook them.
Wash your hands well after forming the meatballs and before touching other items in your kitchen to avoid cross contamination. Wash your hands after each time that you handle the raw meatballs or use tongs to move them.

, Heat a large saucepan, skillet, or dutch oven over medium heat. Place the butter in the hot pan and wait for it to melt, taking care not to let it burn. When the butter is melted, add half of the meatballs to the pan.You can tell butter is burned when it turns dark brown and the bits of milk solids in it become black. Don’t cook the meatballs in burned butter.

, It will only take a few minutes to brown the meatballs. You’re only giving them some color on the outside for now, as they’ll finish cooking through later in the process. Depending on the size of your pan, you’ll probably have to divide the meatballs into two batches to brown them.Once the first batch is browned, remove them from the pan and reserve on a plate. Add another 2 tablespoons of butter, wait for it to melt, then brown the second batch of meatballs.
You’re much better off dividing the meatballs into two or more batches instead of crowding them.

, After you’ve browned and removed all the meatballs, throw your sliced onion into the hot pan. Sweat them 3 or 4 minutes, until they release some moisture and become soft, golden, and translucent. Stir occasionally as they cook., While the onions cook, put 2 tablespoons of cornstarch in a separate bowl. Add a 1/2 cup of beef broth and mix well, but be sure to keep one eye on the onions and stir them a couple times per minute. Mix the cornstarch and broth until you form a paste-like consistency, then set aside., When the onions are golden and soft, add the remainder of your beef broth. Stir to scrape and mix in the fond, or the bits off the bottom of the pan. Add the rest of the ketchup and Worcestershire sauce, then bring to a gentle boil., When it begins to boil, stir in your cornstarch paste first. Then add the meatballs and reduce heat to low. Simmer for 10 to 15 minutes, until sauce is thickened., When the sauce has thickened, you’re all done! Serve the meatballs over pasta, egg noodles, a sandwich, or simply enjoy them on their own. Ladle sauce over them and, if you’d like, garnish with chopped fresh parsley., The saute and simmer method is quick and easy, but you can try using a slow cooker if you have some extra time. Turn your slow cooker on low, and follow all the instructions for forming and browning the meatballs. Saute the onions and heat the broth, then add the meatballs, onions, and broth to the slow cooker.Cook for 6 to 8 hours. Slow cooking will develop richer, more nuanced flavors.
You can also add mushrooms for extra flavor and texture. If you don’t like mushrooms, get creative: try chopped bell peppers or slice up another favorite veggie.

, If you want to reduce the calories of your Salisbury steak meatballs, brown your meatballs and saute your onions using olive oil instead of butter. You can also use a reduced sodium beef broth. Consider swapping the cornstarch for 1 tablespoon of all-purpose flour., For a lower fat option, swap out half of the ground beef for ground turkey. Get a package marked at least 93% lean. Try making your meatballs out of only ground turkey for the lowest fat option.,"

Serve your momos while they’re still hot.",How to Make Momos," A white wheat flour, instead of whole wheat flour, is typically used to make momos. The amount of flour you’ll need will depend on how many guests you’ll be serving. If you want to make enough dough for four people, then you’ll need two cups of water and about ¾ to 1 cup of water.You can half this flour to water ratio, or double, triple or even quadruple it depending on your needs.;
, To create the dough for your momos, start by pouring your flour into a large bowl, and then adding salt and oil.








, Don’t add the water all at once because you may not need it all to form your dough. Add a little water at a time while mixing with your free hand, until the flour mixture moistens and begins to stick together.








, Knead the dough by hand, adding more water if the dough seems dry, crumbly or unwilling to stay together. Knead until the dough becomes firm, smooth, and flexible. It shouldn’t stick to your hands.








, When your dough is formed, place it in a clean bowl or container and cover with a damp cloth or lid. This is an important step that will keep your dough moist and allow the flour time to absorb the water., While your dough rests, you can prepare the filling for your momos. You can make momos with either a meat, vegetable, or cheese filling. Tofu can also be used. Typical seasonings include garlic, onion, ginger, bouillon, soy sauce, cilantro, and Szechuan pepper.


Use ground meat for a meat filling. In Tibet, Yak meat is most commonly used. Other types of meat used to make momos vary by Tibetan region or community. In some areas, pork or beef is common, while in others mutton is used. Chicken is not a common option, but it is used by those who don’t eat beef.
For veggie fillings, you can use a potato filling or an assortment of finely chopped vegetables.
Cheese fillings usually consist of either a dry cheese blended with sugar, which is mainly made in Tibet; or a soft cheese mixed with a vegetable, like cheese and spinach or cheese and mushroom.

, If making a vegetable filling, wash and peel your vegetables. They will need to be finely chopped or grated. You can either do this by hand or by using a food processor. Keep the garlic, onions, and scallions separate from the rest of the vegetables, unless including meat in your filling.


A blender may work in place of a food processor; instead of blending the mixture into a smooth puree, pulse it. This means allowing the mixture to blend a couple seconds at a time until fully chopped.
If you’d like a meat filling, simply replace the mushrooms and tofu for your choice of ground or chopped meat.

, Place your chopped vegetables and/or ground meat in a large bowl and mix together well using your hands, if needed. Season with two tablespoons of soy sauce and one teaspoon of bouillon.









To ensure your meat mixture is perfectly seasoned, cook a small piece, and taste it. Add more soy sauce and bouillon, if desired.

, Unlike the meat filling, the vegetable filling must be cooked before it's tucked inside each momo.Heat a tablespoon of oil in a large pan over medium heat.


Add your chopped garlic to the pan and sauté for 2-3 seconds. Then add the chopped onions and sauté for 10-15 seconds.
Add the remaining chopped vegetables to the pan and turn the heat up to high. Stir fry the vegetables until they’re cooked all the way through, which should take about 8-9 minutes. Add about 2 tablespoons of the scallions and cook for a minute more.
Taste the filling to see if it’s seasoned to your liking. If not, add more soy sauce, salt or pepper to taste.

, Refrigerate your filling until you’re ready to place it inside the dough. It’s best if you allow it to rest for at least an hour. This will give the flavors time to become fully absorbed by the ingredients.

, Momos are usually served with a spicy tomato sauce. If you’d like to enjoy your momos the traditional way, wash and/or peel your fresh ingredients.

, This can be done by either putting them over an open flame or by cutting them in half and putting them under a broiler until the skin blackens and splits.


If using your broiler, make sure the top rack of your oven is about three to four inches away from the heat source. Set your oven to broil and on the highest setting. Place the vegetables on a non-stick surface, in either a flat baking dish or on a cookie sheet.
Once in the oven, watch them closely as they broil. If you don’t cut them half, you’ll have to turn them as the skin blackens. Once the skin blackens and splits on all sides, they’re done.
Take them out of the oven carefully. Let them cool a bit, and then peel away the blackened skin.

, It should turn into the consistency of a paste. If the sauce is too thick, add water to thin it out to your desired consistency.

, Pour the finished sauce into a bowl or container, and let sit in the refrigerator until you're ready to serve your momos.

, The technique used by most Tibetans to shape momos requires a bit of technical skill to make sure it’s done correctly. If you’re not as skilled in the kitchen, or if this is your first time making momos and you’d like to ensure it’s done correctly, there is an alternate method you can use to shape your momos.Before getting started, lightly dust a board or clean area of your counter with flour.

, First, divide your dough into four equal sections. The amount of sections you divide your dough into will depend on how much flour you used to create the dough. These instructions are based on the use of two cups of flour to create the dough.









If only one cup of flour is used, then divide the dough into two equally sized sections. If four cups of dough are used, then slice the dough into eight equal sections.
Roll each section into a 6-7 inch log, and then cut the log into equally sized slices. Roll the slices into balls and cover them with a damp napkin or cloth until you’re ready to use them.
Using a rolling pin, roll each ball into a thin circle. Its diameter should be about 2-3 inches. Make sure the center of the circle is thick, and its edges thin. You may have to press along the edges of the circles a bit to make them thinner than the center.

, Place your dough onto a surface lightly dusted with flour. Use a rolling pin to roll it out very thinly. Don’t roll it so thin that you can see through it or that it tears apart very easily. Then use a clean glass that’s about the width of your palm to cut circles out of the dough.








, It’s best to shape each momo as you fill it with the mixture, that way you can place it in a moist environment with a non-stick surface in order to keep it from drying out before cooking. You can make momos into many different shapes, but the most common are the round and half-moon shapes.









Take your filling out of the fridge. If you rolled your dough by hand, then you’ll need to place 1-2 teaspoons of filling inside each circle. If you created your circles using the glass method, then use 1 tablespoon of filling.

, Start by putting one of the flattened circles of dough in your less-dominant hand. This means that if you’re right-handed, the dough will go in your left hand; and if you’re left- handed, then hold the piece of dough in your right hand.









Add the filling to the center of the dough, and then use your thumb and forefinger to pinch together a small piece of the dough’s edge into a fold. Without moving your thumb, gather another piece of the dough’s edge with your forefinger, fold it, and then pull it into your first fold.
Work your way around the entire circle of dough, gathering and pinching the folds together until you’re back where you started. Pinch together the folds to close the hole at the top of the momo.
Repeat the same steps to make round momo with the rest of the circles of dough. When you finish shaping each momo, place on a non-stick surface, like a lightly greased steamer or container, and cover with a lid or a damp cloth.

, Start off by putting your filling in the center of the dough. Then fold the circle in half, covering the filling. Press the edges of the circle together to close the dough. If you want to add a design to your momos, you can pinch and fold the edges of the dough, just like the round momo.


Repeat the same steps to create half-moon momos out of the remaining circles of dough. As you go along, place each shaped momo in a lightly greased steamer or container and then cover with a lid or damp cloth.

, While steaming is the most common method used to cook momos, there are other ways to cook them. You can pan fry or deep fry them, or boil and serve them in a soup called mothuk.

, Fill your steamer pot with enough water to boil for several minutes. Set it over high heat. There is too much water in the pot if your steamer basket becomes submerged under the water once you set it in the pot.









If you’ve used your steamer basket to keep your momos moist while shaping them, then you should be ready to go. If not, make sure to lightly grease your steamer basket with vegetable oil before setting your momos inside. This will keep them from sticking.
Set the steamer basket over the boiling water and cover. Allow the momos to steam until they are done. The time it takes for them to cook will vary depending on the size of your momos. If you rolled your dough into balls by hand, your momos will likely be smaller than if you created your flat circles using a glass cup.
For the smaller momos, let them steam for 5-6 minutes. For the larger momos, let them steam for closer to 10 minutes. Check the larger momos around 6 minutes to ensure they still need to cook for longer.
Momos that are fully cooked will look transparent and will not feel sticky.
Remove them from the steamer pan and sprinkle with the remaining scallions.

, Heat a frying pan over medium-high heat. Lightly coat the bottom of the pan with vegetable oil. Carefully place each momo in the pan so that they do not touch each other or the sides of the pan. Fry each until golden brown on both sides.








, You can use a deep pan to fry your momos, but they cook best in a deep fryer.Fill your pan or deep fryer with a generous amount of oil, and allow it to get hot. Check to see if the oil is hot enough by dropping a piece of dough into the oil. If it bubbles, you can now add your momos to the oil to cook.


Allow the momos to fry for a few minutes on each side. Take them out of the oil when they’re done and set them on a paper towel to let the excess oil drain off.

, Momos are best served immediately and with a spicy sauce. The sauce can either be poured over the momo, or served on the side for dunking.

Cut your beef chuck into small, 1-inch cubes.,
Coat your beef in the all-purpose flour.,
In a large Dutch oven or soup pot, begin searing the beef cubes over medium-high heat.",How to Make a Hearty Stew1," Although your beef cubes don't all need to have the same uniformity, it helps to try to be consistent. When cutting the beef chuck, remove any excess fat dangling from the outside of the cubes of meat.









What if you don't have beef chuck? Rump, bottom round, or topside cuts will all do. What you want to avoid is getting pre-cut beef ""for stewing"" at the grocery store or market.You'll end up paying more and getting a lower quality meat.;
, In batches, transfer the beef cubes into a medium bowl containing the flour. Work the beef cubes into the flour so that each cube has a thin layer of flour coating its outside. This will give the beef a nice nutty flavor and great texture. It will also help establish a tasty ""fond"" on the bottom of your cooking pot.








A fond is a sticky dark glaze that coats the bottom of the pan. It contributes to the rich, caramelized flavor that separates a merely good stew from a great one.

, First add 2 teaspoons of vegetable oil and the butter. Then, sear the beef in batches. Leave the beef on one side for 3 to 5 minutes, until it has developed great color and easily comes off the pan. Move it over to its side and brown on all sides.









When a batch is done, remove beef with a slotted spoon and add the next batch. Continue cooking in the same manner as directed above, until all beef has been adequately browned.

Do not clean the bowl after cooking the beef. You'll notice that your fond has started to develop. This fond will give your dish more of a full flavor, so don't make the mistake of removing it.

, There are many brands and styles out there—pick one that suits you. But whatever you do, don't go crazy with the rub. This is a delicious cut, and you want that rich beef flavor to predominate.

, Once your tri-tip is trimmed and prepped, give it a couple hours or so to come to room temperature. This will not only give the rub a chance to work, it'll also make it easier to grill. If it's too cold, the meat will be raw on the inside, and burned on the outside.

, Fire up your grill and get it good and hot—around 400°. When the grill is up to temperature, prep for indirect cooking.


If you're using charcoal, push the coals either to one side, or separate into large piles on either side of the grill.
If you're using gas, set one side burner to low. If your grill has 3 burners, leave one side on high, and turn the center and other side to low.

, Place the cut over the cooler part of the grill, and not over direct flame. As the meat cooks, the fat will drip off and cause flareups, which adds to the flavor, but if it's over a flame your flareups can get out of control.

, You want to keep the heat and smoke inside where it belongs, cooking and flavoring the meat. Keep an eye on the temperature, and watch for flareups, but don't keep peeking and poking.

, Grill it on one side for about 10-15 minutes or so, then flip it and cook for another 10-15 minutes. The longer it cooks, the more well-done it will be.Make sure you let it sit for about 4-5 minutes to be sure it is not too hot before eating.

, You can use a meat thermometer, and check to see what the internal temperature is. Of course, you poke a hole in your roast and let the juices run out. Seasoned cooks use the push test.


Pinch the muscle between your thumb and forefinger, and remember how that feels. Now press on the top of roast, and if it feels like that, it's still rare.
Press the muscle at the base of your thumb. Now press the top of the roast. If it feels more firm, like that, it's medium to medium-rare.
Tense your thumb muscle, and press on that. If your roast feels like that, it's well done.

,, After you've taken the roast from the grill and placed it on your cutting board, put an aluminum foil tent over it, and let it rest for another 10 minutes or so. The beef will continue cooking, and the juices will be sealed in.


While the meat is resting, prep the rest of your dinner, side dishes, drinks, and the rest. Gather your guests so that they're ready to eat when you're ready to serve.

, When you're ready (and when the roast is ready), slice against the grain and serve. Some people like to serve thin strips, others like a heartier cut.


If the roast is cooked right, you don't need to slice it too thin. 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) slices are good.
If the roast seems dried out, thinner slices are better.

, Tex-Mex flavors like beans, corn, and salsa are good choices. Garlic bread, salad, and potatoes are also very complimentary.


Pair with a Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Chateauneuf du Pape, or other full-bodied red.

Enjoy!",How to Grill a London Broil," There's no way around it: if you use high-quality meat, it's much easier to get a good-tasting result than if you use mediocre meat. While good chefs can make a tasty London Broil from a cheap piece of meat, this can be challenging, so opt for a high-grade piece of beef whenever you can. If you're unsure of which cuts of flank steak are the best, talk to your local butcher.


In the U.S., the United States Department of Agriculture grades beef as ""Select"", ""Choice"", or ""Prime"" (in order of increasing quality). ""Prime"" cuts are generally the most flavorful and well-marbled, so you'll want to spring for these if they're available.
Note that some butchers may label a cut of meat called top round steak as London Broil, rather than flank steak.;
, Flank steak sometimes has an unfair reputation as a tough, chewy, and flavorless cut of meat.However, this is only true if the meat is poorly-prepared. A number of ways can make flank steak tender before you even begin to cook it. The easiest? Hit it with a tenderizing mallet on a clean cutting board. This breaks up the meat's tough muscle fibers, giving it a softer texture.


Don't use powdered meat tenderizers or tenderizing compounds containing extracts from papaya or pineapple fruits. These are tricky to use correctly and can sometimes tenderize the meat unevenly, giving it a mushy exterior and a tough interior., Banging your flank steak with a hammer isn't the only way to make it more tender. For instance, flank steaks can benefit greatly by soaking them in a marinade before cooking — doing this not only gives the meat a chance to absorb the marinade's flavor, but also tenderizes it slightly (though this isn't true 100% of the time).We've included a few sample marinade recipes above. To marinade your meat, combine the ingredients in one of the recipes above (or your own), put your meat in an airtight plastic bag, pour the liquid ingredients over it to cover it and seal the bag. Finally, leave it in the fridge for at least a few hours. Usually, about half a day of marinating will allow the meat to absorb as much flavor as possible.To help the flank steak absorb its marinade, score the meat before marinating it. Use a sharp knife to make a few X-shaped cuts on the surface of the meat about a half inch or so deep before applying the marinade.

, When the meat has marinaded a sufficient length of time, remove it from the refrigerator and let it start to warm to room temperature. While you wait, start your grill. Let it reach a medium heat before you cook your meat — you want the grill hot enough to give the meat an initial ""searing"", but not so hot that it dries out your meat during cooking.For optimal tenderness, you want to use long, slow cooking after the initial sear. On a gas grill, this is easy — simply set one burner to ""medium"" and one to ""low"". On a charcoal grill, this is a little trickier — you want to make a large pile of charcoals on one side of the grill and a small one on the other side.
For charcoal grills, don't forget that the charcoals aren't ready to cook when they're flaming, but rather, when they're ashed-over and exuding an orange glow.

, Remove your (now roughly room temperature) meat from the marinade and use a paper towel to blot your meat so that it is somewhat dry. Paint the bars of the grill lightly with a little olive or canola oil, then gently lay your meat down. You should immediately hear a sizzling sound — if you don't, your grill probably isn't hot enough. Let your meat cook with the grill uncovered.

, Resist the urge to turn the meat frequently — doing this can dry the meat out. The exact amount of time each side of your meat will take to cook can vary greatly based both on the level of ""done""-ness you're looking for and on the thickness of your meat. In general, thicker cuts will require a few more minutes per side, as will (obviously) more well-done dishes. Below are some general guidelines for how long to spend cooking your meat per side:For rare: 2 minutes for a 1/2 inch (1.27 centimeter) steak, 2-3 minutes for a 3/4 inch (1.9 centimeter) steak, 3-4 minutes for a 1 inch (2.54 centimeter) steak.
For medium: 3-4 minutes for a 1/2 inch steak, 4-5 minutes for a 3/4 inch steak, 5-6 minutes for a 1 inch steak.
For well-done: 5-6 minutes for a 1/2 inch steak, 6-7 minutes for a 3/4 inch steak, 8-9 minutes for a 1 inch steak.

, If you divided your grill into a hot section and a cooler section (as directed above), once your meat starts to approach done-ness, if you like, you can transfer it to the cooler section. Leave it here for several more minutes with the grill cover closed. Cooking the meat for a longer period of time over lower heat helps get it as tender as possible — this is why exceptionally tough cuts of beef like brisket are sometimes cooked at low heat all day.

, If you didn't have time to apply a marinade before cooking, you still have a chance to give your meat some extra flavor during the cooking process. Using a grill brush and a small bowl of your favorite sauce, paint the top side of the meat generously, then repeat after you flip it. Give each side another application of sauce about thirty seconds before you plan to remove the meat from the grill. While the complex flavor combinations that are possible with marinades aren't possible with this trick, a piece of meat that's been generously basted with barbecue sauce, sriracha, or another delicious sauce can be outstanding in its own right.

, The meat is done when it has a pleasing brown color (flecked with black) and a utensil inserted into the thickest part of the meat doesn't encounter any tough, uncooked portions. If you're unsure about whether your meat is done or not, don't be afraid to cut into it to look for any deep red uncooked portions.


Another way to check your meat for done-ness is to use a thermometer. Inserted into the thickest part of the meat, a thermometer should read about 135o F (about 57o) for medium rare; up to ten degrees more for medium to well done.Any hotter than this and the meat can begin to dry out, so remove it immediately!

, As with most other cuts of meat, flank steak is at its most tender and flavorful not right after it comes off the grill, but after it's had a little time to rest and cool. If the meat is cut immediately after it's removed from the grill, you'll notice its internal juices spill onto the plate. These juices are responsible for the meat's flavor and texture, so doing this can make your meat lest tender and tasty. However, if you give your meat a short ""break"" before cutting into it, it has a chance to re-absorb these juices, retaining much of its moisture and flavor.


To ""rest"" your meat, place it on a clean plate or platter under tented aluminum foil and let it sit for 10-15 minutes. The foil will help the meat retain its heat as it rests.

, Flank steak is made up of long, thin muscle fibers — you can see them if you look for small, faint lines running the length of the meat. If left intact, these fibers can be tough to chew. However, by cutting the meat diagonally, perpendicular to the grain of the meat, the fibers are severed, making the slices of meat much more tender. For this reason, London Broils are traditionally served as narrow diagonal slices made against the grain of the meat.

, Divide your London Broil into a portions consisting of a few slices each. If you wish, you can now season your portions individually. A light sprinkling of salt and fresh-ground black pepper almost always pairs well with London Broil, but other seasonings can make great choices as well. Below are just a few seasoning ideas:


Pre-made seasoning mixes (Johnny's, etc.)
Rosemary, thyme, and roasted garlic
Chili powder
Paprika
Grilled/fried onions

, Congratulations! Your delicious London Broil is all ready to eat. Try serving this classic dish with roasted vegetables or sandwiching it between a few pieces of bread for classic flavor combinations.

Begin by cutting the flat.,
Stop cutting at the joint.,
Cut the point.,
Divide your slices into ""lean"" and ""marbled.""",How to Cut a Brisket," A brisket is made up of two muscles--the point and the flat. The muscles are separated by a thick, white seam of fat (that’s how you tell where one muscle ends and the other begins.) The meat of the point actually has its own separate grain that is different from the flat’s grain. This is good to keep in mind when cutting a brisket, particularly when doing it for the first time.



The Point: This is also called the deckle. This is the part of the brisket that has the most fat on it. It has a more marbled look (meaning there are more fat lines running through it.)

The Flat: This is the part of the brisket that will have less fat. As you may have guessed, it is also generally flatter than the point.

The Fat-Cap: One side of the brisket will be covered in the ‘fat cap’, the layer of fat that ardent barbecuers have many debates over. Some say the fat cap should be placed face down on the BBQ, others say it should be facing up. Either way, you want your fat cap to be facing the heat source.;
, Brisket is generally used for barbecuing, smoking or corned beef hash. The word brisket origins from an Old Norse term meaning ‘cartilage.’ The oldest recorded form of cooked brisket is corned beef. People of the old world would cover brisket in salt crystals and let is sit in a dark, cool place., Decide which way you would like to prepare your brisket. Here are some ideas:










Smoke your brisket. This is one of the most classic ways to prepare a brisket. It takes dedication and time (12 smoke-filled hours) but it completely worth it.

Cook your brisket in the oven. This is a less involved way to develop your love of brisket, but still has delicious results.

Make your own corned beef. Take a page out of a historical cookbook and corn that beef. Serve it up with potatoes or make it into a corned beef hash (yum.)

Bring out your inner Texan. Texas is where cooking brisket was nurtured and shaped into the nationally acclaimed meal it is (hence why you see smokey BBQ restaurants popping up in the most boutique parts of town.)

, You will want to study the brisket and place the meat on a cutting board, so that the ""fat cap"" side if facing up.








, You will want to go against the grain, cutting through the front portion of the flat (the part that is not connected to the point.) Going against the grain means Lining up your knife so that it is perpendicular to the fibers of the meat. Keep your knife at this orientation as you slice so that the fibers are broken. This will ensure that the meat is tender and easy to chew. If you cut along the grain, leaving the fibers intact, the meat will be tougher.








Make sure you stop slicing where the grain changes direction.

, The joint is actually the thick seam of fat that separates the flat from the point. If if you don’t know what it looks like, you will feel the difference when you run your knife across it. It is tougher to cut.








, Reposition your knife so that you cut against the grain of the point. Again, make sure to slice through the fibers at a perpendicular angle so that your meat will be much more tender.








You don't have to separate the brisket into two chunks. Each slice can include parts of both grains, but it's important to pause at the joint so that you can change the orientation of your knife.

, The uneven distribution of the fat layer inside the brisket means that some slices will have more fat than others. Those with more are called ""marbled,"" and generally a moister, tastier cut of beef.

On a cutting board cut your pork loin in 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) fillets, then place them flat in the pot, then brown them a little on each side, then turn down the heat to a medium simmer.

,
While your pork is cooking, slice up a whole green or red bell pepper in long one inch slices, then place them in the pot.

,
Slice up a 1/4 of an onion in thin slices and add them to the pot.

,
Slice up two cloves of garlic in thin slices and add them to the pot.

,
Salt and pepper all, then splash over the meat some Worcestershire sauce.

,
Stir the vegetables and pork loin until the garlic gets slightly brown, then add a 3/4 of a cup of water, keep this at a simmer for about an 90 minutes, but check now and then to make sure there is still enough water to keep the pork from drying out, if it is a little dry, just add enough to keep it moist.

,
While this is cooking, you can make a quick pasta sauce, or just use a basic store bought sauce, which ever you prefer.

,
After 90 minutes, the pork loin will be so tender, you should be able to cut it with a butter knife, at this point, all you need to do is: put your sauce and vegetables on the pork, then sprinkle Parmesan cheese on each one, then Mozzarella cheese, put a lid on to melt the cheeses fast, then serve.

Freeze the meat and chill the sausage making equipment.,
Prepare an iced bowl.,
Cut the pork meat and fat into strips.,
Add the spices.",How to Make Kielbasa1," It's important for the meat and equipment to stay very cold during the entire process of making sausage. If the meat and fat get warm, they will not properly blend, and the resulting sausage will suffer in taste and texture. Clear out your freezer and place the following ingredients and equipment inside:


The pork butt and fat
The meat grinder
The sausage stuffer
Several metal bowls;
, When you begin working with the meat, you have to keep it cold while it's outside the freezer. Set a large metal bowl on your work surface, and fill it halfway with ice. Place a smaller metal bowl on top of the ice and let it get thoroughly cold.

, The pork and fat must be cut into pieces small enough to fit into the meat grinder before you begin. Remove them from the freezer. Use a sharp knife to slice one to two-inch pieces from the bone, and then cut the fat into similar-sized cubes. Place the meat and fat pieces in the iced bowl.

, In a separate bowl, mix the kosher salt, curing salt, pepper, marjoram, sugar, and minced garlic. Add the mixture to the meat and work it in with your hands until all the ingredients are thoroughly combined.Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and put it in the freezer for 30 minutes.

"
"
Prepare the casings.,
Remove the grinder from the freezer.,
Grind the meat.,
Add 1/2 cup ice water.",How to Make Kielbasa2," Place the sausage casings in a bowl of warm water while the meat mixture is freezing. This softens them to make them easier to stuff without ripping.

, Set up the meat grinder in a large, clean work area. Place a clean chilled bowl next to the grinder to catch the ground meat as it comes out of the machine.

, Remove the meat mixture from the freezer. The meat pieces should be frozen on the outside, but still slightly soft in the middle. Feed the mixture into the grinder and grind to a fine texture. When all the meat has been ground, cover the bowl with plastic wrap and put it in the freezer. Clean the meat grinder and your work surface, and put the grinder away for later use.


While you are grinding the meat, pay attention to its temperature. If it seems to be warming up, halt the process and return it to the freezer for 15 - 20 minutes before continuing.
Keep your hands cold while you are working with the meat. Run them under cold water when they start to get too warm.

, Remove the meat from the freezer and add 1/2 cup of ice water to the bowl. Use your hands to mix the water with the meat for a little over a minute. This helps the meat bind, which results in a better texture. When you're finished, cover the bowl with plastic wrap and place it in the freezer while you get the stuffing equipment ready.

"
"
Get the stuffing equipment ready.,
Fit a casing onto the stuffing tube.,
Stuff the casing.,
Check for air bubbles.,
Form the sausage into links.",How to Make Kielbasa3," Remove the sausage stuffer from the freezer and set it up on your clean work surface. Lift the sausage casings from the bowl of water and run warm water through them from the faucet to open them up. Drape them over the rim of the bowl of water so the first part of the casing is ready to use and the tail continues to soak. Set up a cold platter where you can place the stuffed sausages, then remove the meat from the freezer.


Make sure none of the casings have a rip in them. A hole in the casing will ruin the sausage.
Don't take the meat from the freezer until you are ready to start stuffing.

, Take a casing and fit its entire length onto the tube, leaving a tail of 8–12 inches (20.3–30.5 cm) hanging off the end. This will be knotted later, but for now, it should remain open. Each casing is several feet long, so you may only need one for an entire batch of sausage.

, Fill the machine with the meat. If you have any left over, place it in a bowl on ice. Begin cranking the machine so the sausage begins moving into the casing. As the meat fills the casing, use one hand to help guide the casing from the tube so it doesn't rip. Use the other hand to begin coiling the sausage on the platter.


Don't let the machine work too quickly if this is your first time making sausage. You can easily go too fast and accidentally rip the sausage.
If you need to move on to a second casing, stop the machine and remove the end of the first casing, then fit a new casing on the stuffing tube.

, When you're finished stuffing, check the sausages for air bubbles. If you see any, use a sterilized needle to prick the casing so it lies flat against the meat.

, Tie off the casings at the front end, leaving the end with the long tail open for now. Measure six inches from the knot and pinch the sausage with your thumb and forefinger. Use your hands to twist the two pieces on either side of the pinch toward yourself three times. Measure another six inches down the coil and repeat, twisting away from you three times this time. Continue until you have reached the end of the sausage, and then knot the end tightly against the meat.

"
"
Hang the links.,
Smoke the links.,
Cold shock the sausages.",How to Make Kielbasa4," Hang the sausage from the twists in the links in a cool, dry storage area for about an hour. If the air is cold, you can hang them for several hours.

, This adds gives the kielbasa its classic smoky flavor. Light up your smoker according to the manufacturer's instructions. Place the links in the smoker for about 4 hours or longer if you prefer a smokier flavor. The links should come to an internal temperature of 155 degrees.


The wood you use to smoke the sausages will affect their flavor. Cherry wood and applewood are good choices.The longer you smoke the sausages, the smokier they will taste. Don't leave them in the smoker for longer than 8 hours or the flavor will be affected.

, When the sausages are ready, remove them from the smoker and plunge them into icy water for a few minutes to cool them down. Hang them up to dry for a few hours, then eat them, or store them for later use.

Choose your cut based on how you will cook it.,
Know the difference between high-end and low end steak.,
Understand how fat plays a role in both tenderness and taste.",How to Tenderize Steak1," Whether you plan to grill a steak or use a pan, there are some cuts of meat that are better done using the right technique. The amount of time you have will also determine what steak works best.


For example, if you want a quick meal you can use a pan for a skirt steak rather than try the same technique for a porterhouse in the same window of time.;
, The tenderness of the steak relates to how much work the muscles must work in its lifetime. So a muscle that does little work, like those in the back close to the spine, will be very tender as opposed to a muscle in the legs. The muscles around the loin, backstop, ribs are the most tender and, therefore, considered high-end.High-end steaks include the ribeye, the strip, the tenderloin, and the t-bone.

, Marbling is the amount of fat in a steak. Steaks are graded by their tenderness and marbling. The scale ranges from Prime steaks, which have a great deal of marbling in a cow younger than 42 months, Choice steaks, followed by Select steaks, and all the way down to the lowest grade of Canner steaks.Marbling shows up as the interstitial fat that looks similar to white spiderwebs within your steak. The more of these spiderwebs you see, the more marbling it has.
Marbling not only affects the tenderness but also the taste. The more marbling a steak has, the greater its tenderness. However, everyone has their own preference in taste. Some people may find too much marbling too rich in taste.

"
"
Move the steaks onto a flat surface.,
Bag the steaks into small sandwich bags or plastic wrap.,
Pound the meat.",How to Tenderize Steak2," Always start with steaks fresh out of the fridge that are not frozen. When choosing a surface, keep in mind not all surfaces can be properly sanitized.


When it comes to working in the kitchen, many cutting boards cannot be properly sanitized after contact with meat products. If you feel strongly about using natural fibre boards such as bamboo, keep a separate board to use only with meat products.Otherwise, plastic or glass cutting boards can be safely sanitized after contact with meat.Choose cutting boards not only for material, but also for sturdiness. When pounding out steak, large amounts of force may be used. A thin, glass cutting board may not be the best option for housing your steaks while the mallet is used.

, The plastic cover atop the steak has two functions: prevention of cross contamination, and loss of juices. Keeping your steak properly wrapped will minimize the contact between meat juices and cutting board.When covering your meat with plastic wrap, keep in mind that it will expand in surface area after pounding. Ensure there is enough space for your meat to spread out once you start using the mallet., Pound rhythmically, starting from the middle and working out.Rather than using excess force, apply firm but effective pounds, adding a small outwards push to the end. Proper use of the mallet will keep your steak looking plump and attractive, rather than skinny and worn down. Work over the entire surface of the steak, flip it over, and start again.


Don’t have a mallet? No problem. Try using a heavy cast iron pan, rolling pin or wine bottle.Know what side of the mallet to use. The spiky, triangular side of the meat mallet is the primary tenderizer.By poking holes in the meat, the fibres are torn apart and when heat is applied, the meat will become significantly more tender.The flat side of the hammer is responsible for thin cutlets is used to make a cutlet thinner, allowing for more efficient cooking.After using a meat mallet, your meat may look slightly defeated. Try breading or adding a topping to help hide this.

"
"
Choose the correct marinade for tenderizing.,
Mix up your marinade.,
Maximize your marinating time.,
Always keep your beef in the fridge on the lowest shelf.",How to Tenderize Steak3," Not all marinades will act as a tenderizer. Look for marinades that contain an acidic ingredient such as vinegar, or fruit juice.Also consider what varieties of spices or flavors you like. A marinade can be either purchased in store or made by hand.


Pineapple juice contains bromelin. Bromelin is excellent at breaking down toughness in meat. Unfortunately, it is denatured when heated, so any pineapple juice used for the intention of tenderizing must only be fresh., When making a marinade, you want to end up with a smooth mixture. If you’re using ingredients such as pineapple or kiwi for their enzymes, it would be a wise choice to use a food processor to help keep your marinade smooth. If you must cook your marinade, ensure to allow it to completely cool before mixing onto your steak. This prevents portions of the steak from being boiled.When soaking your meat in a marinade, there should be sufficient marinade to cover the meat entirely.Since marinades often have acidic components, avoid metal bowls. The acid can react with the metal, which may give the meat a funky taste., While more tender cuts of meat may only need two hours of marinating, a tougher cut such as rump roast can soak for several hours, up to overnight.The longer you soak the meat, the more tender it will become. As a general rule of thumb, fruit marinades are better for short term use, and an oil or vinegar based marinade is better for overnight marinating.

, Leaving any raw meat on your countertop to marinate is not practicing safe food hygiene. By storing it on the lowest shelf, it will prevent spillage or contamination onto any other foods below it."

Sear your steak on all sides.,
Deglaze the pan.,
Get the steak, vegetables and liquid simmering at 662 Fahrenheit (350 Celsius) and cover it.,
Braise the steak low and slow.,
Finished.

",How to Tenderize Steak4," Heat up a deep-dished pot that has a lid. Add a small amount of fat to the bottom, such as olive oil.After the fat heats up, add your pre-seasoned meat to the sizzling oil. After the meat is a deep brown on all sides, remove it until you are ready to move on to prevent over-cooking.If you want to add vegetables to the mix, now is the time to do it.Try diced carrots, celery, garlic, or zucchini. When cutting to the appropriate size, think small, bite-sized pieces.

, Deglazing is adding a liquid while the pan is still hot to get any meaty bits previously stuck to the pan, floating in the liquid. Deglazing is generally done with wine or stock, or a combination of both.After your liquid is adding, keep scraping the bottom of the pan to pull up the caramelized bits of meat.Wine is often used in deglazing due to its high acidity. The acidity helps break down the proteins found within the meat, adding to the tenderness. It also provides extra depth in flavor.If you aren’t a wine expert, a pinot noir is a solid choice to use for deglazing.If you’d prefer to have alcohol-free dining, use a base of broth with apple cider vinegar added. The vinegar gives the acidity as the wine and the broth will provide a positive flavor., Top off the pot with any last minute vegetables and your steak. The pot can remain on your stove top or be moved to the oven. The objective is to get the liquid boiling, then lower the temperature to have it down to a simmer.It is ideal to have the pot approximately half full, so that most of your steak is covered with liquid. If necessary, add more of your liquid at any point of the cooking stage.Letting the liquid run down will result in a dry meal.

, Check the liquid levels frequently to keep it topped at optimum levels. Don’t allow the liquid to move past a simmer. By keeping the steak braising at a lower temperature over a longer period of time, you will have a perfectly moist steak.Braising may take up to three hours. By the time your steak is done, it should be fork-tender. If you continue to cook your steak past it’s fork-tenderness, you may experience overcooked meat that is tough.,"

Purchase some pork skin.,
Trim the skin away from the fat and meat.,
Cut the skin into bite-sized pieces.,
Preheat your oven.,
Place the pork skins on a baking sheet.,
Bake the skins for 3 hours.,
Heat some oil or lard for frying.,
Test the heat.,
Fry the skins until they’re puffy.,
Season and serve the pork rinds.,
Store leftover pork rinds.,
Finished.

",How to Make Pork Rinds," Pork skin is easy to find at smaller butcher shops, charcuteries, or international meat markets.Alternatively, buy a large cut of pork belly with the skin on it. Make sure there is at least a quarter inch (0.6 centimeter) of skin on the meat.


Buy at least a pound (420 grams) of pork skin, not including the meat.
Use the skin within 3 days of purchase. The high moisture content of pork skin causes it to spoil quickly.;
, Cut away any meat by slicing through the fatty layer. Next, use the back of a knife or a large spoon to scrape the fat away from each strip of skin. The more fat you remove, the puffier the skins will become.Make sure you always practice good knife safety when handling tough cuts of meat.


Pork skin is tough and rubbery. The fat will be soft and easily scraped away.
The leftover fat can be rendered into lard or discarded. The meat can be saved for a pork dish.

, Once most of the fat is removed from the skin, cut the pork skin into small, bite-sized squares. Aim for pieces that are 2 x 2 inches (about 5 x 5 centimeters).


The pork skins will double in size when fried. Therefore, avoid making excessively large pieces.
Wash your hands, knife, and cutting surface after handling raw meat. Consuming raw meat can cause severe illness.

, Set your oven to 250 degrees Fahrenheit (120 degrees Celsius.) Many modern ovens will beep or ring when they’re done preheating. However, if your oven doesn’t have this feature, let the oven preheat for at least ten minutes. This will ensure that it comes to temperature properly.

, Use a shallow baking sheet of any size. Place the pieces of pork skins directly onto the baking sheet, skin side down. Make sure the skin pieces aren’t touching or you’ll crowd them.Depending on how much pork skin you’re cooking, you may need more than one pan.
If you want to make your cleanup easier, line the sheet with foil or wax paper.

, When the skins are cooked at a low temperature for a long time, the skins become dehydrated.This will allow them to become puffy and delicious when fried.


When the pork rinds are finished dehydrating, they will look dry and brittle like beef jerky.
It’s better to dehydrate the skins for too long than not long enough. If they don’t seem dry, let them cook for another thirty minutes or so.

, Find a deep stainless steel pan and fill it 1/3 full with lard or frying oil. Next, place the pan over medium-high heat for five to eight minutes, or until the oil bubbles.Avoid using low smoke-point oils like olive oil. Appropriate frying oils include:


Peanut oil (don’t use if you have nut allergies)
Coconut oil
Rendered animal fat, also called lard

, The oil needs to be 385 to 400 degrees Fahrenheit (196 to 204 Celsius) to properly fry the pork rinds.If you have a cooking thermometer, hold the metal end in the oil for a few seconds to get a temperature reading. If not, dip the end of a piece of bread in the oil.


If the oil vigorously bubbles around the bread, the oil is hot enough.
If the oil barely bubbles around the bread, the oil needs to heat up longer.

, Drop three to four pieces of pork skin in the hot oil. Let them fry for thirty to sixty seconds.Once the pork rinds are large, puffy, and floating on the surface of the oil, they’re finished cooking.


Fry the skins in small batches to avoid overcrowding the pot.
Use a metal slotted spoon to remove the cooked pork rinds onto a paper-towel lined plate.

, Mix a small bowl of seasonings and sprinkle them liberally over the fresh pork rinds. Many people prefer a simple blend of salt and pepper. However, a variety of seasoning mixtures can be used, including:


A spicy-sweet blend of 1.5 teaspoons salt, .5 teaspoons ancho chili powder, and 1 teaspoon of maple sugar
A teaspoon of Chinese five spice and a teaspoon of saltA teaspoon of salt, a teaspoon of pepper, and a sprinkle of paprika, Keep any leftovers in an airtight plastic container or re-sealable bag. If the container isn’t airtight, the rinds will become stale. Eat any leftover pork rinds within a week.


Pork rinds can be stored on the counter or in your pantry.
If your pork rinds begin to smell rancid, don’t eat them. This means that they’ve spoiled.

Thaw steak, if it has been kept in the freezer.,
Choose a steak that is at least 1 inch (2.54 cm) thick.,
Take the steak out of the refrigerator about 20 minutes before you want to start preparing it.,
Cut off any bones or fat, if you want to.,
Coat the steak in a thin layer of olive oil.

,
Season steak with salt and a generous layer of fresh black pepper about 15 minutes before you plan to cook it.,
Decide on the cooking time for your meat before you place it on the grill or pan.,
Heat your pan or grill and cook your steak.

",How to Prepare Steak Before Cooking," It should be placed on a plate in the refrigerator overnight. Cover the plate with plastic wrap to avoid cross-contamination with other foods.


Do not eat a steak that has been defrosted and placed back in the freezer, as the quality of the meat is in question.;
, Smaller cuts of meat can be used for other dishes. In order to achieve the medium or medium rare doneness, it must be a fairly thick cut of meat.

, This will allow it to come to room temperature and you will be able to gauge the doneness of the steak more easily.

, Some people prefer the bone or fat to stay intact for added flavor.

,, This will allow the salt to be absorbed. You can do this while the steak is coming to room temperature.


If you do not season the outside well before you cook it, most of the salt will end up on the grill.

,


Filet mignon, strip steaks and t-bone steaks often have shorter cooking times because they are usually smaller or sliced thinly. They can be tough if overcooked.
Rib eye, top sirloin and porterhouse steaks often have longer cooking times because they are very thick and include both meat and more marbled fat.

Remove the steak from the refrigerator and set it on the kitchen counter to warm for a few minutes.,
Place your leftover steak in a zip-close bag.,
Heat leftover steak in a heavy frying pan and cover it with beef broth.,
Cut leftover steak into pieces, then stir fry with your favorite vegetables.",How to Reheat Steak1," Leftover meat tastes better when heated from room temperature. Heat a skillet or sauté pan. Place the steak in the skillet, and drizzle butter over the top. Heat until the meat is warm but not hot.









It may be easiest to turn the heat up initially -- but as soon as you get that butter going, bring it back down. The meat loses its flavor remarkably quickly, so be attentive to it.;
, Add ingredients and seasonings of your choice, such as minced garlic, chopped onions or shallots and salt and freshly ground black pepper. Seal the bag securely, then place the sealed bag in a saucepan filled with simmering water. Heat until the meat is hot, about 4 to 6 minutes, depending on the thickness.









This method isn't great if you have more than one steak to reheat. If you have a family waiting for leftovers, you'd be better off sticking them in the oven for a bit or directly using a frying pan.

, Turn the heat up until the broth simmers, then allow the meat to simmer in the broth until it is thoroughly heated. Eat as is, or slice it for use in a hoagie roll or a French dip sandwich.








, Serve the stir fry with hot rice and soy sauce on the side. Since the rice is hot, it'll mask any pieces of steak that are only warm, preserving their flavor.

Maintain the flavor of a juicy steak by reheating it in a microwave oven.,
As an alternative method, let the steaks come to room temperature for about 30-45 minutes.",How to Reheat Steak2," Place the meat in a microwavable dish, then drizzle a small amount of steak sauce, Italian dressing, teriyaki or barbecue sauce over the top, along with a few drops of oil or melted butter. Cover the dish, then warm the steak on your microwave's medium setting.









Heat until just barely hot, checking every few seconds, as overcooking will dry the meat. Using your microwave's medium setting is important here -- if it's on high (which is normal), it'll ruin the flavor.

, This allows the fat and juices to bloom and open back up and the flavor to reignite. While you're waiting for this, preheat your oven to 175°F (80°C).









When your oven reaches temperature, put those puppies in for about 10-12 minutes on a rimmed baking sheet. This will warm them, not cook them. Combine them with hot side dishes to keep up the temperature.

"
"
Preheat your oven to 250°F (120°C).








,
Set your steaks on a wire rack on a baking sheet.,
Heat a couple tablespoons of oil in a skillet.,
Sear the steaks on both sides until they're crisp and brown.",How to Reheat Steak3,", Place them in the oven for about 30 minutes until they reach 110°F (43°C) at their center. Use a good meat thermometer for this part.









Make sure they don't get hotter than this! Otherwise they'll start cooking. And note that timing will vary depending on the thickness of your steaks.

, Time this so while the oil is heating, you can take the steaks out. Pat them dry with a paper towel and set them aside. The oil is ready when it starts to smoke.








, This should take about 60 to 90 seconds per side. Take the steaks off the heat and let them rest for about 5 minutes before you serve them.









They should only be slightly less juicy than their once-cooked counterparts and their crusts should actually be more crispy -- always a good thing. This may take more time than zapping in the microwave, but it's worth it.

Learn about how black pepper can be used.,
Toast the peppercorns before crushing.,
Crush the peppercorns using one of these techniques.,
Coat the meat with the crushed peppercorns.",How to Pepper Crust a Steak,"


Whole black peppercorns can be used to flavor long-simmered sauces or soups. When used in this fashion, a subtle, almost floral, pepper flavor is imparted into the food.
When ground, some of the essential oils of the peppercorns are disbursed into the air and the resulting flavor is pungent.
Crushed peppercorns retain most of their essential oils, giving them a very pungent flavor that pairs well with the taste of beef.;
,


While many recipes do not require toasting the peppercorns before using them, doing so can help to improve the flavor of your dish. As is the case with most spices, the heat from toasting brings out the essential oils in the peppercorns and allows the full flavor of these dried berries to be tasted.
To toast, simply heat the peppercorns in a dry skillet over medium heat, shaking occasionally, until fragrant, which should only take 3-to-5 minutes. Allow them to cool before crushing.

,


The classic way to crush peppercorns is by using a mortal and pestle. Crushing by hand allows you to easily monitor the extent of the crushing.
Using an electric spice or coffee grinder is more time-saving if a large amount of peppercorns need to be crushed. Grind the peppercorns by pulsing, checking periodically to make sure they don't get over processed.
Another technique that takes some arm strength, but gets excellent results, uses common kitchen pans. Pour the peppercorns into a large heavy skillet. Crush the pepper using the bottom of a heavy saucepan. The skillet helps to keep the berries from shooting all over your kitchen.
A simpler technique is to pour the peppercorns into a zip-top bag and sealing it after removing as much air as possible. Lay the bag down, smoothing the berries out into a single layer. Then pound the berries with a rolling pin, meat mallet or even a hammer.

,


Most recipes will have you oil and salt the meat, then press the pepper into the surface. Follow your recipe for best results.

, Using your wooden spoon, create a well in the centre of the sifted flour. Pour the egg yolk into the centre of the well and set aside for later.

, Tip the lard into the saucepan and add the milk. Place the pan onto a medium heat and allow the lard to melt. Once melted, bring it to a rapid boil.

, Immediately add the boiling lard into the well in the bowl of flour. It is very important that it is boiling when added. Using your wooden spoon, draw the ingredients into the centre of the bowl.

, Dust your working surface lightly with flour. Place the ball of dough into the flour and also dust it lightly. Knead the dough, using both the heel of your hand and fingers, for roughly 5 minutes. This will pump some air into the dough and keep it light, so do not rush this step!

, Take a sheet of cling film and completely wrap the entire ball of dough. Set it aside in a warm place for 20-30 minutes to rest.

, Set the oven to 200ºC (400ºF/gas mark 6).

, Add the bacon pieces into the bowl of diced pork meat. Follow with the anchovy oil, thyme, sage and all spice. Sprinkle in some salt then pepper and 3 tbsp of the stock. Mix in well with your wooden spoon. Set aside to rest, while we concentrate on the pastry.

, Unwrap the pastry after it has rested, and cut off two thirds. Re-wrap the remaining pastry as we will need it later on. Sprinkle the work surface with flour and place the dough into it. Dust the dough with flour. Carefully start to roll it out with the rolling pin, into roughly into the size of the tin. Lay the cake tin, upside down, into the centre of the dough and cut around the sides. Remove the excess pastry but do not discard. Remove the cake tin, place the parchment paper in the bottom of it, and sliding the knife under the circle of pastry, lift it up, and lay it into the bottom of the tin, pushing it down to mould.

, Roll out the second part of the pastry and cut down the middle. Pick up one half and lay against the side of the tin. Gently knead into and around the mould. Take the remaining half and lay it against the other side of the tin and knead in and around the mould. Trim away any excess pastry and reserve for later.

, When the dough is nicely molded around the tin, take the meat mix and spoon it into the tin. Push it down lightly, then set it aside for a minute.

, Roll out all the remaining pastry. Place the cake tin into the middle of the dough and cut around it to create a circle. Take away the excess pastry and reserve for the decoration, later on. Taking your tin, begin to cut away and tidy up any excess pastry from the sides, but leaving enough to make a tight seal, when we put the lid on. Take your pastry lid and lay it gently over the meat, pushing it down lightly with your fingers, to create the tight seal. Finally cut a small hole in the centre of the pastry lid, to pour the liquid in later on.

, Dust some flour onto your work surface. Roll out any of the remaining dough, dusting it occasionally with flour to avoid sticking. Then with your pastry cutter, cut out three shapes and place them decoratively around the hole on the pie.

, It is now ready to bake!

, Place the tin into the centre of the oven and bake at 200ºC for 20 minutes. After this time, reduce the heat to 180ºC (350ºF/ gas mark 4). Cook for a further 2 hours. Brush with the egg wash again, and cook for a further ten minutes, after this time. Remove from the oven.

, After removing the pie, leave it to cool completely before continuing with adding the stock (step 19).

, Place a small saucepan on a medium heat, pour in the stock and bring to the boil, which will take approx 5 minutes. Add the gelatin into the boiling stock and whisk well to dissolve.

, Now that your pie has cooled, pour the stock into a jug and carefully begin to add the stock in little amounts through the hole in your pastry. Allow it to seep through. Then add a little more.

Beef may be the first kind of ""steak"" to come to mind, but a crisp, intensely flavorful browned surface over a moist interior can be great on a burger, pork chop, chicken, fish, or even a thick, firm slice of a vegetable such as an eggplant or portobello mushroom.
Pan-searing works best on boneless cuts. A pan is much cooler than a fire or electric element and so must heat the meat mostly by conduction. As it begins to cook, meat will shrink thinner than a bone running through it, be propped away from a hot pan, and not sear well in that area. If you really want a cut with a bone, be sure to use a steak weight to hold it relatively flat, and an ample coating of oil in the pan to conduct heat to the still not quite flat surface.
For the best-tasting results, it's wise to start with a high-quality steak (tender, well-marbled and typically more expensive). Pick a steak with a reasonable fat content, like a ribeye or strip steak, that's about 1"" - 1.5"" thick. Pick thicker steaks at your own risk - they may be suitable if you like rare steaks, but if you don't, they can prove difficult to cook through before overcooking the outside. If you can, pick a steak with a strip of fat on one side - the fat will render as the steak cooks, creating a great natural taste and crisp outer crust.
Cheaper steaks are equally nutritious, leaner, and can be tenderized (mechanically or enzymatically; slow, through cooking is not consistent with the typical seared style). Mechanical tenderization such as perforation can drive in surface pathogens, so it needs to be cooked through well enough to kill them.;
, For the best sear on your steak, it's important to choose a skillet that's up to the task.


A cast-iron pan is best. It accumulates heat to brown and crisp the exterior faster than the interior can cool it to cook only slowly. It will not melt, scorch, or warp (but it's relatively brittle for metal: don't thermally shock it with water right after you finish, but wait for it to cool to clean it.) Its rough metal surface turns the problem of burnt-on grease into the feature of a non-flaking, rust-resistant, semi-nonstick, antique-looking coating. And, it's cheap!
Other kinds of dense, all-metal pans work well too.
Do not use a Teflon or similar nonstick-coated pan! High heat will damage the coating and make it flake off into food. (This coating works best on electric skillet appliances, not regular pans, because the built-in elements distribute their heat very evenly and the thermostats prevent overall overheating. Those can do light browning, but accumulating a stove's greater power into a heavy pan sears better.) Metal utensils, necessary to not melt on a very hot pan, can also damage the nonstick coating.
You'll also want to consider the size of your pan - pick a pan that's just big enough for your steak. If your pan is much bigger than your steak, the steak's juices will spill into the unused space and burn up.

, This is a heavy, flat object to press the steak evenly against the pan as it cooks, preventing it from curling away to sear only in spots. A ""bacon press"" is essentially the same thing; purpose-made ones often have a waffle face to allow excess fat to ooze out. The bottom of a smaller pot or pan that can nest over the steak in the skillet, preferably without a long handle to unbalance it, can substitute. After using it against a raw side of the steak it might best be heated against the skillet briefly to sterilize the surface before proceeding with the now-cooked side.

, Before cooking, allow the steak to sit, gradually coming to room temperature. If the steak is frozen, allow it to thaw overnight in the refrigerator, then let it sit to come to room temperature. As you wait for the steak to warm up, you can proceed to the other preparatory steps.


It's important to let the meat warm up not only because a room-temperature steak sears faster, before the accumulated temperature in a thinner pan runs low, but because more heat needs to conduct through and potentially overcook the outside of the steak to not only cook but warm up a cold inside.

, You don't have to season it before cooking, but pre-applied seasonings can diffuse and permeate the steak before and during cooking. Some salt is very important to flavoring meat. Oil can help conduct heat to the surface for efficient searing (olive oil has a popular flavor; clearer oils have higher smoke points for cleaner, less noxious use at desirable high temperatures). Applying a generous coat to the steak (after salt, herbs and spices, so it doesn't seal them out) reduces the amount sitting unneeded on the pan to waste, smoke, or even catch fire. Peppering a steak beforehand is also popular but herbs and spices can scorch (black pepper is fairly resistant); apply them before serving or if a little wilting, tenderizing, or cooking-in is desired, toward the end of cooking at lower temperature.


Before coating your steaks, use a paper towel to absorb any moisture on the surface of the steaks. A watery steak is anathema to pan searing - the water cools the surface to make it cook slowly, and may even ""steam"" the steak, giving a tough, leathery texture.
You shouldn't go completely overboard with your salt and pepper, but you should try to give each side a generous coat. Keep in mind that, with pan-seared steaks, the flavor of the steak's crust is extra-important. Since the steak isn't marinated in any way, the inside of the steak will have only the natural flavor of the beef.

, When cooking a steak on the stove, it's important to have an extra-hot pan for a powerful initial sear. If you have time, you may want to heat your pan in the oven to get it suitably hot for this purpose. If you do, be extremely careful when you take the pan out of the oven - use thick oven mitts and/or a towel to protect yourself from burns.


Don't heat your skillet in the oven if it's not oven-safe - that is, if it contains components that will melt at high heat, like a rubber handle. Instead, with a pan like this, it's best to simply heat the pan on the stove.
Many home stoves have enough power so that preheating the skillet in the oven or using the oven to help heat the skillet on the stove (presumably on a burner over the exhaust vent) is simply unnecessary, wasteful, and risky in handling hot metal and leaving appliances on.

, If you heated your pan in the oven, leave the oven on. If you didn't, set the oven to about 400-450 degrees and allow the pan to heat on the burner. You'll know your pan is hot enough when drops of water sprinkled on the surface of the pan evaporate almost instantly or ""dance"" across the surface of the pan. A cast-iron skillet's black ""seasoning"" may begin to smoke just a little. Higher temperatures give a more distinct, crunchy, even blackened crust, but increase smoke that will need ventilation such as a range hood to remove, and can risk fire with much oil.








, When your pan is nice and hot, lay your steaks down in the pan with a pair of tongs. You should immediately hear a furious sizzling sound - this is crucial to get that delicious initial sear.









If one side of your steak has more fat than the other, lay the fatty side down first. The fat will quickly render as it comes into contact with the hot pan, helping to form a delicious, mouth-watering crust.
Do not use plastic-ended utensils and do not allow plastic handles to lean on extra hot, water-less pans. They can melt.

, It should not take long for a crisp brown crust to form. Depending on the heat of your pan, it should take about 2-4 minutes (or less) for each side to finish cooking. When the first side is done, flip your steak and cook the second side for about as long. Ideally, you'll only need to flip your steak once.










Resist the urge to meddle with your steak as it cooks. Don't flip the steak more than you need to - again, if possible, you should only flip it once. Each time you flip the steak, you ""reset"" the process of heat from the pan penetrating to the interior of the meat and may drain off juices, ensuring that you're left with a steak with a tough exterior and, by the time that takes to cook, a potentially over-cooked interior.

, A hot pan is great for a crisp exterior, but doesn't get heat through to the center any faster: past the boiling point, the outside just dries out, and close to that, it gets an overcooked dry texture (so don't use a pressure cooker). There are a few ways to do this. Check the steak's internal temperature to the desired cooking point (lower for medium cooking of red meat, or fish; higher for pork and other well-done denser meat) with a thermometer or, less accurately and somewhat drying, a check for clear juices and a slice through. Or put in an electronic thermometer with an alarm or even a probe and let it call you!









The simplest way is to turn down the heat and cover the pan for convection of heat to the top simultaneously.
A popular, more even way is to put everything in an oven at moderate heat: 300 °F (149 °C) or so.A trendy, potentially delicious way would be to cook the interior evenly and at lower temperatures that favor tenderizing reactions over over-cooking, ""drying"" ones ""sous vide"" (in a carefully monitored hot water bath) before searing. A microwave also delivers even, penetrating heat and at low intensity over time could have a similar effect. Potentially a great way to upgrade inexpensive tougher cuts...experiment and check internal temperatures to be sure to kill bacteria rather than incubate them with exotic cooking process.

, If you cut into a steak immediately after you finish cooking it, its flavorful internal juices will run onto your plate. To help preserve this internal source of flavor, give the steak a chance to reabsorb these juices by allowing the steak to rest for about ten minutes before eating. You can do this by removing the pan from heat and covering with aluminum foil or by letting the steak sit on a wire rack. A steak that's been allowed to rest is generally moister, more flavorful, and has better texture than a steak that hasn't been allowed to sit.









Keep in mind, however, that as the steak rests, it will actually continue to cook, especially if you keep it in the pan and cover it with tin foil. This means that the final product may be more well done than you initially intended, so if you're aiming for a rare steak, be conservative and remove the steak from heat slightly early.

, Congratulations! You've (hopefully) just pan seared a delicious steak. Serve alone or with potatoes and/or garlic butter for a delicious, hearty meal.

, If the steak drippings aren't overly burnt, they can be a rich dressing or gravy component, or they can simmer down to fat for flavorful sauteing vegetables.

, Scorched meat takes time to soften and clean from a pan. ""Elbow grease"" tires you out and can wear the pan. Once the pan has cooled enough to handle, dispose of excess grease in the garbage (or a can headed for the garbage), not the drain, to avoid clogs and not subject your public works department to sewer-stopping fatbergs. Put a few squirts of hand dishwashing liquid in the pan and allow to sit. Cast iron pans can rust, so don't soak the whole, less-seasoned thing, or allow water to remain in the cooking area for days.

These pans can reach really high temperatures that help sear the edge of the meat and keep in the flavors. They also help to produce that slightly crusted char that provides a sweet flavor.


Many prefer a cast-iron pan because it can be used to sear the meat before transferring it into the oven.A griddle pan could work as a substitute for a flat pan.
Select a smaller pan if possible. If you choose a larger pan you may be tempted to cook more than one steak at a time, and potentially miss the mark on the doneness.;
, The reason you preheat is that the steak tastes better when the edges get seared quicker. A preheated pan allows the ribeye to brown evenly, eliminating the water and creating a sweet caramelization. Aside from that, a hot pan eliminates the need to flip the meat multiple times during cooking.If you have to flip the ribeye multiple times, don’t worry too much. Some tests have shown the meat to be cooked more evenly and quickly when flipped multiple times., Choose something neutral like groundnut oil, which has a mild flavor and doesn’t burn at high temperatures. Some other oils with high with smoke points are peanut oil, rice oil, and corn oil. If the oil is not hot, it could transfer an oily or greasy flavor to the meat. Use about a quarter cup (60ml) in a traditional 12-inch pan.


Do not use butter as your medium, because it smokes too quickly at high temperatures.
Do not mix butter with the oil. It will not stop the milk proteins in the butter from burning.To know when the oil is ready, wiggle the pan around and there should be a nice, free-flowing movement to the oil., Ribeyes come in all shapes and sizes, but finding one roughly an inch (2.5 cm) thick is ideal. These steaks typically have the nice, fatty marbling on the interior that makes it delicious and moist. Additionally, there is little waste because of minimal gristle and a only thin strip of fat on the edge., Getting the meat to room temperature helps to ensure it’s cooked all the way through. If the meat is cold, the outside of the meat may get dried out before everything is cooked through. It may take up to 30 minutes for a fresh out of the fridge ribeye to be ready for cooking.Be cautious not to leave the meat out too long, however; it could invite bacteria growth.


Room temperature meat also cooks quicker.
If it’s not room temperature, there is a risk of a cold center. , Use a paper towel to get rid of some of the outer moisture on the steak. If there are water droplets or extra moisture, you run the risk of steaming the steak. If the moisture is removed, the steak has a better chance of reacting with the hot oil to produce that great char.This doesn’t need to be done aggressively. Patting too hard may flatten the meat out some.

, After the meat is patted dry, it’s almost time to cook. First, it’s time to apply spices. Different spices please different palates, and you’ll know what works for you. In general, however, many chefs recommended dressing a steak with a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil, some black pepper, and kosher salt. Wait until just before cooking to apply the spices. Seasoning too long before cooking could cause the salt to dry out the ribeye., Putting it down too quickly can cause the hot oil to splatter. Try to centralize it in the pan so the heat is evenly distributed. It should make a pleasing sizzling sound immediately. If not, the oil is not hot enough. Additionally, it should stick to the pan. Give it a firm push all around to ensure there are no air pockets and all portions of the meat are touching the pan., No matter what you do, don’t be tempted to peek at the steak’s underside. Don’t flip it. Don’t move it. Simply wiggle the pan back and forth. If the meat releases, it’s likely ready to flip onto the other side. If not, it needs more time.The generally accepted practice is to flip the steak one time.After each side is cooked, some prefer to use tongs and hold the ribeye fat-side-down, just to cook off some of the excess fat., Depending on the size of the steak and the thickness, cooking times vary. The same can be said for how hot the pan is. In general, however, the steak should be on each side for 2:30-4:30 minutes, depending on the level of doneness you prefer. This helps it cook all the way through, as well as cook off some of the fat.For a 3.5cm/1.3in. steak, the following is a good guideline:


Rare – 2:15 per side (125 F/ 51C) – There will be significant redness inside. A very pliable ribeye.
Medium-rare – 3:15 per side (135 F/ 57C) – More pink than red, this steak will be slightly tougher than rare and have considerable juices flowing.
Medium – 4:15 per side (140 F/ 60C) – Slightly pink inside, there will be minimal juice escaping.
Well-done – Over 4:15 per side (155 F/ 68C) – Cooked until thoroughly dark, the level of doneness ranges from spongy to hockey puck, depending on the desired result.Some prefer to get the initial char and then put it into the oven. This is a good way to retain moistness and flavor.

, While you’re cooking it, put in a few slabs of butter. Once the butter is melted, use a spoon and repeatedly baste the steak over and over.The reason for this is to establish an outer-crust, as well as improve and accentuate the flavor., Take it out and let it sit for 5-10 minutes after you’re done cooking.When the steak rests, the meat fibers reabsorb the juices of the steak. Realistically, the meat remains moist and retains heat for nearly 10 minutes after being taken out of the pan.You can even add a pat of butter onto the hot steak once it’s been set on a plate.

Set the temperature to 325 degrees Fahrenheit (170 degrees Celsius), and make sure that the rack is in the middle position.Be aware of how your oven indicates that it’s reached the desired temperature. In most cases, it will beep and/or flash an indicator light.;
, Take 2 pounds (907 g) of beef bottom or top round steak that you’ve trimmed the excess fat from, and use a sharp knife to cut it into ½-inch (1.2 cm) thick slices, going with the grain of the meat. Next, season both sides of the steaks with 2 teaspoons (12 g) of kosher salt and 1 teaspoon (2 g) of freshly ground black pepper.When you cut the meat, you can vary the size of the slices to suit your preference. Keep in mind, though, that they should be serving size pieces so you don’t want them too large or too small.

, Place ¾ cup (75 g) of all-purpose flour in a shallow dish or pie pan, and dredge the meat on both sides in the flour. Next, use a needle or blade meat tenderizer to tenderize the meat so that each slice is ¼-inch thick.Tenderize both sides of the meat, but be careful not to shred the slices.If you don’t have a needle or blade tenderizer, you can use at a meat mallet instead.

, After you’ve tenderized the meat, dip it back into the flour. Make sure to coat each side of the slices evenly, and then set the meat aside., In a 4 to 5 quart (4 to 5 L) Dutch oven, add up to ¼ cup (59 ml) of vegetable oil to cover the bottom. Turn the burner to medium-high heat, and allow the oil to heat for 3 to 5 minutes or until it starts to shimmer.You can substitute canola oil or bacon drippings for the vegetable oil.

, Place as many steaks as will fit in a single layer on the bottom of the Dutch oven. Allow the steaks to cook until they are golden brown on both sides, which should take approximately 2 minutes per side., When the steaks are browned, remove them from the pan and set them on a plate. Brown the remaining steaks in the exact same way, and remove to the plate with the others so you can set them aside.Some Swiss steak recipes advise leaving the finished steaks in the Dutch oven when they’ve finished browning and adding the other ingredients over them. You can do it that way, but it’s often difficult to mix the sauce for the dish with the meat in the way.

, Add 1 large onion that’s been thinly sliced, 2 cloves of minced garlic, and 2 celery stalks that have been chopped to the pan. Allow them to cook on medium-high for 1 to 2 minutes, or until they’re tender.Be sure to stir the onion, garlic, and celery as you saute them to ensure that they cook evenly.
If desired, you can add other vegetables and seasonings to the pan, such as chopped bell peppers, chopped carrots, and/or sliced mushrooms., Once the onion, garlic, and celery have sauteed for a couple of minutes, mix in 1 tablespoon (15 g) of tomato paste. Stir well until the tomato paste is fully combined with the other ingredients.If you don’t have any tomato paste, you can use canned tomato sauced that’s been reduced over medium heat by approximately ⅔’s, which should take approximately 7 to 10 minutes., When the tomato paste is fully incorporated, add 1 14.5 (411 g) ounce can of diced tomatoes, 1 teaspoon (2 g) of smoked paprika, 1 teaspoon (2 g) of dried oregano, 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of Worcestershire sauce, and 1 ½ cups (355 ml) of beef broth. Stir until all of the ingredients are fully combined in the sauce.If you don’t have smoked paprika in your spice rack, you can substitute chipotle powder., Once you’ve mixed up the sauce, return the browned meat to the Dutch oven, submerging it in the liquid ingredients. Cover the pan, and place it in the oven on the middle rack. Allow it to cook for 1 ½ to 2 hours or until the meat is tender., When the meat is tender and falling apart, remove the pan from the oven. Plate each steak, and spoon some of the sauce over the meat. You can garnish the dish with a sprig of parsley if desired.Swiss steak is often served with egg noodles or mashed potatoes.

Select the type of Beef Bone-In Rib Roast you want.,
Choose the size of your rib roast.,
Have your butcher tie the roast.,
Leave the roast out until it hits room temperature.",How to Cook Prime Rib1," This may not be called ""Prime Rib"" at your local grocery store or butcher's as ""prime"" is a grade used by the USDA and, in this context, it refers to a kind of cooking. But, rest assured, Beef Bone-In Rib Roast is what you want.


If you are really thinking ahead, you can special order a prime-quality Beef Bone-In Rib Roast. Ask your butcher when he can have you one ready by. Odds are one won't be readily available because the cost incurred is much higher than other grades.
You're looking for ribs 6 through 12. If your butcher knows his meat, he'll get you one from the small end toward the back of the rib section. It's generally leaner and gives you more bang for your buck. This is usually called the first cut on the loin, or small, end, because the ribs get larger as they get closer to the shoulder.If you prefer more fat, you may want to go a different route. To help you decide, the small end is where the Ribeye steaks are produced and the large end is used for Delmonico steaks. Does that help?

;
, Figure about 2 people per rib. So, for six people, you'll need 3 ribs. For fourteen people, you'll need 7. If you have less than six people, you're better off going with individual steaks -- too small a slab of meat won't cook like you want it to.


Always check the date your beef was packaged. If it's been sitting around in the store for a tic, it's not good. It should have a bright red color and absolutely no dry or brown edges. If there's any damage to the wrapping, set it down and choose another option., You'll need the prime rib tied before roasting, so you might as well get it done right when you buy it. If it's left untied, the outer layer will overcook, pulling away from the muscle. This is totally protocol for it to be done for you, so don't be shy. However, if you forget to ask or if for some odd reason he cannot or does not, here's how:


Trim your roast of any excess fat -- but leave on a thin layer to protect it while it cooks. If it's more than 1"" (2.5 cm) thick, it's gotta go. But leave that much on to give your meal more flavor.
Run the twine parallel to the bone and tie at both ends. This literally ties the meat to the bones, keeping it together. Tie around the meat in between the bones and don't forget about the chine bones on the end., This should take about 2-4 hours and is absolutely essential. If you don't let the roast come to room temperature, you'll regret it: It will take longer to cook your roast, your roast won't cook evenly, and you'll end up with well-done slices on the end and raw meat in the center.


The amount of time it takes greatly depends on the size of your cut. Use your best judgment on room temperature times.

In a stainless-steel or metal roasting pan, place your roast.,

, Either ribs side down or fat side up is okay. When choosing a pan, make sure the sides are at least 3"" (7.5 cm) deep.


Nonstick pans are a waste of energy. You'll get fewer tasty bits that give your au jus or gravy flavor. And the rib bones serve as a natural rack, so you won't need a metal one., Some people believe wholeheartedly that you should coat your roast in salt and pepper. Others swear that the salt just dries out the meat -- so avoid it all costs. This is, ultimately, up to you.


You may also find that smearing the cut ends of the roast with a couple tablespoons (30 g) of butter seals in the moisture and makes the ends more tender. Again, proceed at your own discretion.

, Then turn the oven to 325°F (162°C) for the rest of the cooking time. Every 1/2 hour, baste the cut ends of the roast with the fat accumulated in the roasting pan. Do not cover the roast.

, To figure out the total cooking time needed for your roast, allow about 13-15 minutes per pound for rare and 15-17 minutes per pound for medium rare.Grab your meat thermometer (an instant-read digital one makes it easy) and check the internal temperature about 45 minute before you think the prime rib will finish. If anything, start checking early; if something's going wrong, you'll be able to catch it.
Meat thermometers will only give you an accurate reading if you're inserting it into the thickest part of the beef. It should not be touching fat or bone. Cook until the temperature is 120° F (49°C) (or your desired temperature).Rare starts at 120°F (49°C) regardless of size. Medium rare is between 125° and 130°F (51° to 54° C). To make sure you're getting the doneness you desire, use a good digital meat thermometer., Cover loosely with aluminum foil, and let sit approximately 15 to 20 minutes. Cutting into the meat too early will cause a significant loss of juice. Do not skip the resting stage.



Do not cover the roast tightly; that will make the crust soggy.
Transfer fat and dark drippings from the pan into a fat separator. Set aside.

Grab a long, thin, sharp knife.,
Place the roast on a large meat cutting board.,
Start carving.,
Set roast cut-side down.",How to Cook Prime Rib3," Sharpen your carving knife, if necessary, using either a sharpening rod or stone.


To use a sharpening rod, pull the edge of the knife down and across the rod, holding it at a 22° angle (you know what that looks like, right?). Repeat this process 5 to 10 times.
If you're using a sharpening stone, hold your knife at a 10° to 15° angle to the stone. Push back and forth in smooth, steady strokes., If you have one with a well at one end to contain the juices, good for you. First things first, remove the cooking twine with a knife or scissors and dispose.

, To make it easy on yourself, use a carving fork to hold the roast in place. Turn the platter to where the rib bones are on your left if you are right-handed, or on your right if you use your left hand to carve.


Using your ultra-sharp carving knife, make one cut, slicing off the chine bones (the bones on the large end) to sever the meat from the bones in one piece.

Save the bones for nibbling on later. Or, if you're crafty in the kitchen, make a scrumptious soup!



, Slice the meat across the grain to the thickness you prefer. 1/4 - 1/2"" (.6-1.25 cm) is fairly standard. Serve, enjoy, loosen your belt a notch, and moan away in prime rib ecstasy.

Round steaks, chicken breasts and pork chops may be less flavorful, because they don’t have much fat inside the cut of meat. , Buy pork shoulder instead of pork chops, chicken thighs instead of chicken breasts and round steak, instead of fillets when you braise. The meat will break down over the extended cooking time, making it taste just as good, or better, than more expensive cuts.

, You can save money by learning how to cut sections of meat at home.

, Bison is a low-fat alternative to beef. Ostrich is a low-fat alternative to chicken.


Venison and elk can be cooked like cuts of beef or lamb. They are better when seared on high heat, rather than cooked longer at lower heat. , Place it into an airtight plastic bag and allow it to slowly defrost in the refrigerator for 12 to 24 hours.


Larger cuts of meat, such as whole turkeys and roasts may require 2 or more days to defrost in the refrigerator.
Microwave defrosting can ruin the taste and texture of meat. It may not defrost evenly, and it may start to cook the meat.
Never thaw meat at room temperature on your counter. , A roast or pork chop will benefit from up to 1/4 inch (0.6 cm) of fat. Anything more than that should be removed with a boning knife and discarded. Leave the skin on a chicken or turkey. Then, remove it before you serve it. If you season it underneath the skin, it will trap the seasoning and keep moisture in the bird.
Also remove any connective tissue, which will harden when cooked.

, While fillets or pork chops may taste better with a little salt and pepper, most cuts of meat benefit from 1 to 12 hours of marinating in the refrigerator. Use marinades with wine, herbs, spices and juices to tenderize and flavor meat.

, It is better to apply a sprinkling of salt directly on the meat after you remove it from the marinade. Salt is a more powerful tenderizer and seasoning when used directly than in a mix. , The larger the cut, the longer you need to let it sit. Failing to bring a cut of meat to room temperature may result in an uncooked center and burned exterior. , Once you form your patty, don’t keep working with them, or they can get dry. Press your thumb into the center to form a nickel-sized divot and they won’t shrink in the center. , The following are good guidelines for the most common types of meat.


Pork should be cooked to an internal temperature of 145 degrees Fahrenheit (63 degrees Celsius).
Poultry should be cooked to an internal temperature of 165 degrees Fahrenheit (74 degrees Celsius).
Ground meat should be cooked to 165 degrees Fahrenheit.
Beef and lamb should be cooked to 145 degrees Fahrenheit.
Seafood should also be cooked to 145 degrees Fahrenheit. , Beef, seafood and lamb are usually more flavorful if cooked at higher temperatures (400+ degrees Fahrenheit, 204 Celsius). Pork and poultry benefit from medium temperatures (300 to 350 degrees Fahrenheit, 149 to 177 degrees Celsius).


Slow cooking at very low temperatures (180 to 200 degrees Fahrenheit, 82 to 93 degrees Celsius) for 6 to 8 hours is recommended for some cuts of pork and beef, as well as poultry. Try a crock pot first, and then start braising your meat in sauces in a Dutch oven.
Slow cooking works great with tougher cuts that have a lot of connective tissue and fat.

, Use a model that allows you to insert the probe into the center and then keep the monitor on the outside of the oven. You can observe when it reaches the perfect temperature and you will minimize the loss of heat from opening the oven door. , Remove it from the pan and place it on the counter. Tent it with foil to retain warmth.


The result will be juicy and moist, because the moisture remains inside the meat, rather than dripping onto your plate.
Rest meat between 5 and 20 minutes, with resting time being proportionate to the size of the cut. , You can remove pork, beef and lamb when it is 5 degrees Fahrenheit (approximately 2.5 degrees Celsius) under the internal cooking temperature. It will finish cooking as it rests. , Look for the pattern in the surface of the meat. Then, cut perpendicular to it. Cutting the meat fibers makes the meat tender because it is easy to chew. , Place the meat in a pan with a lip. Then, hold the roast in place with a large fork and carve in 1-inch (2.5 cm) slices against the grain. , This rule is good for both uncooked and cooked meats.


If you are going to cook it within a week, you can freeze it in the supermarket packaging.
If you may not use the meat for several weeks or months, put it in a freezer bag and squeeze out all the air before storing.
Use meat within approximately 9 months. Ground meats will last 3 to 6 months, while roasts and steaks will last 9 to 12 months. , Food-borne bacteria grows best between 40 degrees and 140 degrees Fahrenheit (4.4 to 60 degrees Celsius). , Bacteria that develops at room temperature may lead to illness.

, Poultry, seafood and ground meat can be stored for 1 to 3 days, while beef, pork and lamb can be stored for 3 to 5 days. Larger cuts of poultry can be stored for 3 to 4 daysStore it in a sealed bowl or freezer bag.

Freeze meatballs for later use.",How to Cook Meatballs," Tear off a sheet of parchment paper roughly 18 inches (46 cm) in length and spread it over a flat portion of your kitchen counter.









This section or parchment paper will provide you with a clean, nonstick surface on which to place your formed meatballs before you cook them.
Note that you can also use wax paper instead of parchment paper.
If you plan on baking your meatballs, you can line a baking dish or baking sheet with parchment paper instead of lining the counter. You could also grease the dish and line the formed meatballs on it without the use of parchment paper.;
, Use your hands or a wooden spoon to mix the ingredients thoroughly.









Ground beef is the simplest meat option for you to use, but you can also use a combination made of equal parts ground beef and ground pork, ground beef and ground sausage, or ground beef and ground veal. For a healthier option, you could skip the beef completely and use ground turkey, instead.
You can use either unseasoned or seasoned bread crumbs. Dry bread crumbs are often easiest to work with, but you could also tear a slice of fresh bread into small crumbs and use that in place of dry crumbs for a fresher, softer result.
Make sure to slightly beat the egg with a fork or whisk before adding it to the mixture. Otherwise, it may fail to bind the meat properly.
Salt and pepper are basic seasonings to add to your meatballs, but minced onion and parsley can be used if you want to give the flavor more depth. Other herbs, like oregano or cilantro, could be used instead of or alongside the parsley, as well.

, Use your hands to roll portions of the meat mixture into balls. Line the meatballs up on your parchment paper until ready to cook.









If you have a melon-baller or small ice cream scoop, you could use that to form your meatballs instead of your hands. You could also use a teaspoon to help you portion off the meat into workable amounts.

, Place the baking dish in the oven as it preheats to warm the dish and the oil.









Only use enough oil to grease the pan. If you notice any puddles of olive oil, you should wipe them out or spread them further with a clean paper towel.
Nonstick cooking spray may be used instead of cooking oil.

, Remove your baking dish from the oven after it finishes preheating. Place your meatballs in the dish, spacing them roughly 1 inch (2.5 cm) apart from one another.









Keep the meatballs in a single layer and do not allow them to touch as they bake. If the meatballs bake while touching one another, they may end up sticking together.
Gently press down on each meatball as you place it in the baking dish in order to somewhat flatten the bottom. By giving each ball a flat edge, you reduce the risk of the meatballs rolling around and coming into contact with each other in the oven.

, Place the baking dish with the meatball in the preheated oven. Cook for 15 minutes, or until the top sides are well-browned.








, Use tongs to turn the meatballs to the other side. Return them to the oven and continue baking for an additional 5 minutes.









When done, the meatballs should be slightly crispy on the outside. They should not be burnt, however.

, Remove the meatballs from the oven and let rest for 3 to 5 minutes before serving. The meatballs can be enjoyed on their own, with pasta, or in a variety of other dishes.








,









Let the oil heat for 1 or 2 minutes to ensure that it reaches an adequate temperature.
If you do not have olive oil, standard vegetable oil can be used instead.

, Add the meatballs to the hot oil and cook on medium-high for 2 to 5 minutes, stirring frequently, until well-browned on all sides.









The meatballs should not be stacked or touching when you add them to the pan. If you cannot comfortably fit all of the meatballs into the pan at once, prepare them in batches.

, After the meatballs have browned, turn the heat down to medium-low and continue cooking for 5 to 7 minutes.









The meatballs are done once the juices run clear and the inside is no longer pink.

, Remove the meatballs from the heat and let rest for 5 minutes before serving alone, with pasta, or in other dishes.








, By combining ground hamburger with eggs, bread crumbs, grated Parmesan cheese, and dry onion soup mix, you can create meatballs that are both flavorful and supremely easy to make.








, Mix ground beef together with classic Italian flavors like garlic, Romano cheese, and oregano to form meatballs that serve as the perfect accompaniment to spaghetti and other Italian dishes.








, These Spanish-style meatballs are prepared with ground beef, ground pork, onion, garlic, oregano, and cumin.









Albondigas meatballs can be enjoyed on their own or in a variety of other Spanish dishes. Use them in soups or drench them in tomato-based sauce to serve as an appetizer.

, These meatballs get their trademark ""spiky"" appearance from the addition of white rice, which is added to the ground beef prior to forming it into balls.








, Meatballs made from a simple recipe are tossed with a tangy sauce made of white vinegar, brown sugar, and soy sauce.









Serve these meatballs in stir-fries or on their own with a side of rice or noodles.

, Swedish meatballs are served in a rich sauce and prepared with warm spices like nutmeg and allspice. Serve up a batch as an appetizer or main dish.









For a unique twist, prepare Swedish meatballs with sweet and sour sauce. Use a standard Swedish meatball recipe but serve the meatballs in a tangy sauce instead of the traditional rich, creamy sauce that usually accompanies them.

, You can replace meats like beef, pork, and turkey with textured vegetable protein in order to create a healthy vegetarian alternative to the standard meatball.









Serve these meatless meatballs as you would serve any ordinary meatball. For instance, you can enjoy them on their own, in pasta dishes and soups, or on sandwiches.

, Most meatball recipes can be served and enjoyed on their own, but adding meatballs to other dishes can be a good way to enhance the flavor of both the meatballs and the dish itself.









Italian pasta dishes like spaghetti and meatballs are, perhaps, the most common example of a dish that features meatballs.

Meatball soup is also a popular meatball dish. For a cheap, easy twist, you could also add meatballs to ramen in order to create Ramen meatball soup.
Meatball sub sandwiches are a relatively mess-free way to enjoy meatballs drenched in sauce, as well.

, If you are unable to cook and serve your meatballs right this moment, but you still want to have some on hand for easy access, you can freeze the pre-formed meatballs until ready to use.

Allow it to heat for 30 to 60 seconds before continuing. The oil should become more fluid and easier to spread, but it should not get hot enough to produce smoke.

, Add the onion, garlic, and parsley to the hot oil. Cook for 1 to 2 minutes, stirring frequently.


When ready, both the onion and garlic should smell stronger and look lightly browned.

, Add the ketchup, beef broth, Worcestershire sauce, lemon juice, brown sugar, and black pepper to the contents of the saucepan. Stir or whisk to combine.

, Bring the contents of the saucepan to a steady simmer. Once the mixture starts to simmer, set your timer for 20 minutes and continue cooking the sauce.


Return to the sauce and stir it every few minutes. Doing so should help distribute the flavors evenly while preventing the sauce from sticking to the bottom of the pan.

, Remove the saucepan from the stove. Using an immersion blender, blend the sauce on high speed for 30 to 60 seconds, or until the solid pieces break down and the sauce turns into a thin puree.


If you do not have an immersion blender, pour the sauce into a standard blender and puree it that way.
For a thinner sauce, strain out the solid pieces instead of blending them down. Pour the sauce through a colander or sieve. Keep the liquid portion and discard the solid parts.

, Allow the sauce to cool at room temperature, then place it in a sealed glass or plastic container. Store the sauce in your refrigerator for one to two weeks.

Use the back of your mixing spoon to gently crush one-third to one-half of the peppercorns while heating them up. Doing so releases more flavor.

, Pour the Merlot, balsamic vinegar, and Worcestershire sauce into the saucepan. Stir to combine.

, Allow the contents of the saucepan to reach a steady simmer, then keep the sauce at a simmer for a full 10 to 15 minutes, or until it thickens to your preferred consistency.


Periodically stir the sauce as it continues to simmer. Doing so will distribute the flavors more evenly while preventing the bottom from burning.

, Allow the sauce to cool at room temperature. After it cools, use it for your steak or store it in your refrigerator.


To store the sauce, pour it into a sealed plastic or glass container and refrigerate it for one to two weeks.

Heat until smooth.,
Serve warm.",How to Make Steak Sauce5," Pour the cream into a small saucepan and set it over medium heat. Wait for bubbles to develop before continuing.


You must heat the cream slowly, so do not use any temperature above medium. If the cream gets too hot, it could curdle and ruin the texture and taste of the sauce.

, Break the blue cheese into small crumbles, then sprinkle those crumbles over the cream. Stir the cheese into the cream with a mixing spoon.


Stir the sauce rapidly and continuously after adding the blue cheese. Doing so distributes the heat evenly and allows the cheese to melt before the cream has a chance to curdle.

, Continue heating and stirring the mixture until the cheese completely melts and the sauce becomes smooth.


The heat still needs to remain at medium since the dairy-based sauce can curdle easily. If the sauce begins to simmer rapidly during this stage, turn the heat down to an even lower heat setting.

, Remove the sauce from the stove and immediately serve it over cooked steak.


You can store this sauce for about one week if you keep in a sealed plastic or glass container in your refrigerator.
This sauce is best served warm and can be reheated using the stove or microwave.

You only need to lightly coat the baking dish. As the fat from the bacon renders, it will naturally seep to the bottom of the pan, preventing the contents of the dish from sticking even without the use of much cooking spray or additional grease.;
, Lay three of the bacon pieces out across the bottom of the baking dish, spacing them apart evenly. Sprinkle the onions over the bacon, and top the layer of onions with your remaining three pieces of bacon.


Add the butter on top, spooning it out in small dabs.

, Pour this mixture over the onions and bacon, drenching the dish as evenly as possible.


It is recommended that you combine the ingredients before adding them to the baking dish so that the entire mixture can be distributed as evenly as possible throughout the contents of the dish.

, Cover the dish with aluminum foil and place it in your preheated oven. Bake until the onions and bacon become very fragrant.

, As the onions bake, spread the flour out in a shallow dish and dredge all sides of each piece of liver in the flour.


You could add the flour to a large resealable plastic bag instead of using a shallow dish. Place the slices of liver in the bag one at a time, zip closed, and shake thoroughly to coat all sides.
No matter what method you use, you should gently shake the liver over the bag or dish to remove any excess flour.

, Temporarily remove the foil covering and arrange the coated liver slices over the bacon in the baking dish, spacing the pieces apart as evenly as possible.


When done, cover the dish with the foil again.

, Keep the dish covered for the first 30 minutes. For the final 10 minutes, remove the foil and continue baking uncovered.As the liver cooks, you should baste it two or three times. Use a baster or basting brush to coat the liver in some of the pan juices gathering in the baking dish. This spreads out the flavor and prevents the liver from drying out.

Add the liver a few pieces at a time to avoid overcrowding the bag. If you overcrowd the bag, you will have a harder time coating all sides of all pieces.
If you have the flour mixture inside a shallow dish instead of a bag, you will need to toss the liver in the dish of flour and turn with your fingers, a fork, or tongs.
No matter what method you use, you should gently shake the liver over the bag or dish to remove any excess flour.

, Place the water, ketchup, brown sugar, apple cider vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, and garlic powder in a small mixing bowl. Blend the ingredients together using a whisk or mixing spoon until well combined.

, Add the oil to a large skillet and heat it over medium heat for a minute or two, just until the oil becomes glossy and notably easier to spread.


Do not let the oil start to smoke. If it begins to smoke, the oil has begun breaking down, and it will be too hot for this particular recipe.

, Place the pieces of coated liver in the oil and cook for 4 to 6 minutes on both sides, or until browned on both sides.


Carefully turn the liver with tongs. Ideally, you will only need to turn the liver once as it browns, but if you need to turn it multiple times to prevent it from sticking or over-browning on one side, that will not harm the liver or ruin the dish.

, Pour the sauce over the liver in the pan and bring it to a boil. After it reaches a boil, reduce the heat to low and cover.


By boiling the sauce first, you can ensure that everything has been brought up to temperature. Do not keep it at a rolling boil, however, since this sort of heat can cause the liver to cook too fast and become too tough as a result.

, When done, the liver should be tender.Keep the lid on for as much of the cooking process as possible.
If desired, you can turn the liver inside the pan as once or twice as it cooks. Doing so can help prevent it from sticking to the skillet.

If you have the flour mixture inside a shallow dish instead of a bag, you will need to toss the liver in the dish of flour and turn with your fingers, a fork, or tongs.
No matter what method you use, you should gently shake the liver over the bag or dish to remove any excess flour.

, Carefully place a few chicken livers at a time in your hot oil. Cook each chicken liver until they become crisp and golden brown.To protect yourself from popping, splattering oil, try using a frying screen to cover the dish as the chicken livers cook. Do not use a lid, however, since the space inside the pan can become too hot and the cooking time can become unbalanced.

, Remove the fried chicken livers from the oil using a slotted spoon. Drain them on paper towels or brown paper bags for a couple of minutes before transferring to individual serving dishes and enjoying.

Combine the remaining vinegar with the honey.,
Roast the ribs for 2 hours and 30 minutes.,
Baste the ribs with the honey mixture.,
Roast for another 30 minutes.,
Serve warm.",How to Cook Lamb Spare Ribs1," Combine 3/4 cup (180 ml) of the balsamic vinegar with the olive oil. Whisk until well combined.Note that you should still have 1/2 cup (125 ml) of balsamic vinegar left after completing this step.;
, Stir the garlic and rosemary into the vinegar-oil mixture. Pour the entire marinade into a large resealable plastic bag.

, Sprinkle the salt over the ribs, then use your hands to massage the salt into the meat as evenly as possible.

, Place the ribs in the bag of marinade. Seal the bag, then refrigerate it for at least six hours.


To further intensify the flavor, massage the marinade into the meat through the plastic bag after sealing it and before refrigerating it.
You can marinade the lamb spare ribs overnight for a stronger flavor, as well.

,


To minimize the mess, spray the rack with nonstick cooking spray before placing the ribs on top. Doing so will help prevent the meat from sticking to the metal.
Discard the leftover marinade after removing the ribs from the bag. Do not attempt to reuse it.

, In a small bowl, whisk together the remaining 1/2 cup (125 ml) balsamic vinegar with the honey to form a glaze.


Loosely cover the glaze mixture with a paper towel, lid, or piece of plastic wrap after combining the two ingredients. Set it aside for later use.

, Place the roasting pan in the oven, uncovered, and roast the lamb spare ribs for a full 2 hours and 30 minutes.


Since lamb spare ribs have a lot of fat, they won't dry out in the oven as easily as many other cuts of meat do. The meat is also fairly tough, so it benefits from slow cooking done at a low temperature.
Turn the ribs once after about 1 hour and 15 minutes, or halfway through the full cooking time.

, Remove the ribs from the oven and brush the reserved honey glaze over all sides, using as much of the glaze as possible.

, Return the ribs to the oven and cook for another 30 minutes, or until done.


If you still have glaze left over, you can continue basting the ribs in 10-minute intervals during this last 30 minutes of cooking.
At this point, the ribs should be thoroughly browned and the meat should be tender, yet not quite falling off the bone.
If you want the ribs to be a bit more tender, you can continue roasting them for another 30 minutes or so after this set, but you should keep a close eye on them to make sure that they do not burn or become too dry.

, Remove the lamb spare ribs from the oven and let them rest for 5 minutes before serving.


To serve, cut the ribs into 2 or 3 rib portions.

Preheat the oven to 325 °F (163 °C).,
Wash and trim the shanks.,
Heat the oil.,
Brown the lamb shanks.,
Add the vegetables, peppercorns and wine.,
Cover the dish and transfer it to the oven for braising.,
Strain and reduce the braising liquid.,
Serve the lamb shanks.",How to Cook Lamb Shanks1,";
, Wash the shanks and use a sharp knife to remove some of the larger deposits of fat, but don't trim the shanks of all visible fat. The fat will render and contribute to the flavor of the final dish., Pour the oil into a large dutch oven or another oven-safe dish and place it over medium high heat. Allow it to heat completely, until it begins to smoke just slightly.

, Season the shanks with salt and pepper on all sides. Place them in the hot oil and brown them on all three sides. Brown each side for about 4 minutes, enough to get a good sear on each side.


Don't cook the lamb shanks all the way through. Browning them will bring out the deep flavor of the shanks, but longer cooking will bring about the soft, fall-apart texture you want.
Make sure the oil is nice and hot before you put the shanks in the pot.

, Arrange the vegetables and garlic cloves around the lamb shanks, and drop in the peppercorns. Pour the wine over the entire contents of the pot. Let the red wine come to a boil, and boil it for three minutes. Add the water and reduce the heat to bring everything to a quick simmer.


Boiling the wine for three minutes will lower the alcohol content a bit, leaving the deep flavor of the wine behind.
With the addition of the water, the shanks and vegetables should be fully submerged in liquid. If they aren't, add a little more water.

, If you don't have a tight-fitting lid for the dutch oven, cover it tightly with aluminum foil. Place it in the oven and braise it for 1 hour and 30 minutes. Every half hour, remove it from the oven and turn the shanks so they cook evenly.After 1 hour and 30 minutes, the shanks should be quite tender. If they aren't, return them to the oven and continue braising, checking every 15 minutes until they've reached the correct texture.

, Transfer the cooked lamb shanks to a serving platter. Pour the braising liquid through a fine-mesh sieve to strain out the vegetables and keep the liquid. Pour the liquid into a saucepan and cook it over medium heat, stirring often, until it has reduced and become a thick sauce.


Season it with salt and pepper to taste.
To make the sauce thicker, add a teaspoon of cornstarch.

, Pour the braising liquid over the lamb shanks and serve the dish with roasted vegetables or mashed potatoes. Each shank is enough for one serving.

Season the lamb chops.,
Grill the chops for 8 to 9 minutes.,
Serve warm.",How to Cook Lamb Chops," Warm a large, nonstick skillet over medium-high to high heat.


You can also spray the pan with a coating of nonstick cooking spray to ensure that the chops will not stick.
Give the pan 1 or 2 minutes to heat up. To test whether or not the pan is hot enough, sprinkle 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of water into the skillet. If the water sizzles and evaporates immediately, the pan is ready.;
, Rub the salt, pepper, oregano, thyme, and garlic powder over both sides of each lamb chop.


To make it easier to distribute the seasonings evenly, you may wish to combine them in a small bowl before rubbing the blend on the meat.
Only salt and pepper are absolutely necessary, but oregano, thyme, and garlic powder are also frequently used with lamb chops and complement the taste well.

, Place the lamb chops in the skillet and flip them over after 3 1/2 to 4 minutes using tongs. Continue cooking for an additional 3 1/2 to 4 minutes, or until done.The lamb chops should sizzle immediately upon being added to the pan. If they don't sizzle, the pan may not be hot enough.
The chops are ready to be flipped once the side touching the pan turns a rich ""nut"" color brown.
Use a kitchen timer to monitor the time, if necessary.
When done, the lamb chops should be browned on all sides and the juices should run clear. Use a meat thermometer to check the internal temperature of the meat. Lamb chops should reach a minimum internal temperature of 155 degrees Fahrenheit (68 degrees Celsius).

, Use tongs to transfer the chops to a serving dish. Keep warm.

, Add the chopped onions to the pan and cook for 2 to 4 minutes, until the onions begin to caramelize and wilt.


You can skip this step if you do not like onions.

, Pour the lamb broth or beef broth into the pan and stir, scraping the bottom of the pan as you go. Heat to a boil and allow the juices to thicken slightly.If you would prefer thicker gravy, add a slurry of 1 Tbsp (15 ml) cornstarch and 1 Tbsp (15 ml) cold water. Heat to a boil and continue stirring until the gravy thickens more.

, Ladle the gravy over the lamb chops and serve.


, Prepare a baking tray by covering it with parchment paper or a thin coating of nonstick cooking spray.


, Rub salt, pepper, oregano, thyme, and garlic powder onto both sides of each chop.


Blend the seasonings together before rubbing the lamb chops to distribute them evenly.
If you prefer a simpler taste, skip the herbs and only season the chops with salt and pepper.
If desired, you can also spray the chops lightly with cooking spray or drizzle them with 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of olive oil to help them brown.


, Lay the chops inside the pan and sprinkle the chopped onion around them. Do not cover the meat, however.


The onions will not caramelize completely in the oven, but they will wilt enough to help flavor the lamb chops.
The onions are only optional.


, Use tongs to turn the chops at the 10 minute mark so that both sides are able to brown.The chops are finished once the juices run clear and a meat thermometer registers an internal temperature of 155 degrees Fahrenheit (68 degrees Celsius).


, Allow the chops to rest for 5 minutes before serving with or without the onions.


You can cook the onions further by quickly transferring them to a small skillet preheated over medium-high heat. Melt 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of butter in the skillet and sauté the onions for 2 to 4 additional minutes, or until caramelized. Serve over the chops.

, Place the onion in a 3-quart (3-liter) slow cooker.


There should be an even layer of chopped onion covering the entire bottom of the slow cooker.
To make clean-up easier later on, you can apply a thin coating of nonstick cooking spray to the inside of the slow cooker. There are also specially designed slow cooker liners you can use that make cleaning up even easier.

, Rub the salt, pepper, oregano, thyme, and garlic powder into the lamb chops.


For best results, combine the seasonings in a small bowl first and rub the blend over both sides of the chops.
If desired, you can skip the oregano, thyme, and garlic powder, but adding all five seasonings is the best way to ensure that the chops will be as flavorful as possible.

, Lay the chops directly on top of the onion layer.


You may not be able to fit the chops in a single layer, but a single layer is not necessary for the slow cooker.
If desired, you can also add the lamb broth or beef broth, as well. It is not necessary for this particular recipe, but adding a little liquid to slow cooker recipes results in juicier meat.

,


Resist the urge to uncover the slow cooker and peek in before the minimum amount of time elapses. Uncovering the slow cooker prematurely can cause the cooker to lose heat and may result in the meat needing up to an additional 30 minutes to cook.
Check the internal temperature of the lamb chops with a cooking thermometer to verify that the meat is at least 155 degrees Fahrenheit (68 degrees Celsius).

, Transfer the lamb chops to a serving platter and ladle the onions on top.

, Spray the grill grate with nonstick cooking spray and allow the grill to get hot.


For gas grills, heat the grill on high heat with the lid closed for 10 to 15 minutes.
For charcoal grills, create three distinct zones. One area should have no coals, one area should have a single layer of coals, and the final area should have two layers of coals. Heat the coals until a layer of ash begins to form on the top.

, Use a sharp knife to cut away the fat along the outside of the chops.


The marbled fat throughout the chops adds flavor, not the fat on the end. Moreover, leaving the fat on the ends increases the risk of fiery flare-ups during the cooking process.

, Evenly rub both sides of the chops with salt, pepper, oregano, thyme, and garlic powder.


For a simpler chop, only use salt and pepper.
For best results, mix the seasonings in a small bowl first. Once they are evenly distributed, rub the blend into the meat.
You can also spray the chops with cooking spray or brush them with 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of olive oil to help the browning process and improve the overall flavor.

, Place the chops directly above the hottest part of the grill and cook over high heat with the lid open. Use tongs to flip the chops once after 4 minutes and continue cooking for an additional 4 to 5 minutes.The hottest area of a gas grill is above the primary heating element.
The hottest area of a charcoal grill will be above the largest pile of coals.
If the flames threaten to flare up, move the chops to a cooler part of the grill until the fire dies down.
Check the internal temperature of the meat with a meat thermometer. At minimum, you should look for an internal temperature of 155 degrees Fahrenheit (68 degrees Celsius).

, Remove the lamb chops from the grill, cover, and let rest for 5 minutes before serving.

, Score the fatty side into one inch (2.5cm) crisscrossed squares.

,, Rub all over the surface of the meat.

, Place it in the refrigerator for 12 hours. If you are running behind, make sure you marinate it for at least two hours.

,,, Add a cup of water to the pan to ensure it stays moist. You will want to add water by one-fourth cup measurements if the pan dries out to improve the moisture content of the roast.

, Cook for four to four and a half hours on 325 degrees Fahrenheit. Baste every few hours with the juice from the bottom of the pan using a turkey baster., With this slow-cooking method, it usually is cooked slightly longer than other dishes in order to break down the fat. It should read at least 140 degrees Fahrenheit (60 degrees Celsius) for medium meat.The true test of “doneness” for a lamb shoulder is whether it is tender. If you can easily pry the meat apart with two forks, it is done.

, Set it on top. Preheat the broiler.

The ingredients should form a spreadable paste.

, Use your hands to rub the seasoning paste over all sides of the lamb spare ribs, distributing it as evenly as possible over the surface of the meat.


Place the ribs on a large plate and set them aside. The ribs should marinate for 20 to 60 minutes at room temperature.

, Preheat a gas or charcoal grill to a medium-high heat setting.If you are using a gas grill, start by turning all the burners to high. After 15 minutes, turn off the center burners and reduce the remaining burners to a medium heat setting.
If you are using a charcoal grill, light roughly 50 charcoal briquettes and let them burn down until a thick coat of gray ash covers them. Rearrange them into 2 piles on either side of the grill grate, then place a drip pan between the piles. Set the grill grate over the entire structure.

, Use a dull knife or your hands to scrape any thick chunks of paste off the meat.


The meat does not need to be perfectly clean at this point, but you should remove excess paste.
Discard any of the excess paste you remove. Do not attempt to reuse it.

, Use a basting brush to brush all sides of the ribs with additional olive oil. Sprinkle all sides with additional salt and pepper, as well.


You only need enough oil to lightly coat the meat.
Similarly, you should only sprinkle a small amount of salt and pepper over the ribs. The seasonings from the paste should still give the meat plenty of flavor, even after most of the paste has been scraped off.

, Place the ribs on the grill fat-side down and grill until they reach your desired doneness.


If you want the ribs to be charred on the outside but medium-rare inside, only grill them for about 10 to 12 minutes.If you want the ribs to be thoroughly cooked so that the meat is tender and pulls away at the ends of the bones, grill them for about 15 to 20 minutes.

, Remove the ribs from the grill and let them rest for 5 minutes. Enjoy them while they are still hot.


For ease, separate the ribs into 2 to 4 rib portions before serving them.

Meanwhile, prepare a grill rack or roasting pan with a rack by laying a sheet of parchment paper underneath the rack.

, Sprinkle the salt evenly over the ribs. Use your hands to massage the salt into the meat.


To make the ribs easier to handle, you may also wish to cut them into 2 or 3 rib chunks at this time.

, Broil for 20 minutes, or until well-browned.


If you want to brown both sides evenly, turn the ribs once during the middle of the process.
If you cannot fit all of the ribs on the rack at once, broil them in batches. Wait until all of the ribs have been broiled before proceeding with the slow cooker steps.
Technically, browning the ribs is only optional. If you don't care about browning them, you can skip the broiler steps and only follow the slow cooker steps.

, Remove the ribs from the broiler and place them directly in your slow cooker.


For easier clean-up, spray the slow cooker with nonstick cooking spray or use a slow cooker liner.

, Layer the onion over the ribs, then pour the barbecue sauce on top.


To make sure that all of the ribs are covered in sauce, you can either brush a little of the sauce over the ribs before adding the onion and the rest of the sauce, or you can stir the ribs inside the slow cooker after pouring the entire batch of sauce on top.

, Cover the slow cooker and cook the ribs on low until the meat becomes tender enough to fall off the bones.


If you did not broil the ribs first, you may need to keep them in the slow cooker for up to 8 hours.Keep the slow cooker covered throughout the entire cooking time. Opening the slow cooker can release some of the heat that has built up inside, thereby increasing the necessary amount of cooking time.

, Remove the lamb spare ribs from the slow cooker. Let them rest for about 5 minutes before enjoying.


If you have not done so already, cut the ribs into 2 to 3 rib sections before serving.

, Use a sharp knife to slightly separate the meat from the bone at the base of each lamb shank. Put your finger into the holes you've created to make a small pocket in each shank.


Don't completely remove the meat from the bone. Just separate it enough to create a little pocket.

, Divide the mixture between the four shanks, using a spoon to stuff it deep into the pockets. As the shanks bake, the butter will melt and flavor them from the inside out.

, Rub the outside of each lamb shank with olive oil and season with salt and pepper.

, Tear off four large pieces of aluminum foil and fold each one in half. Place one lamb shank in the middle of each piece of foil. They should each be in an upright position, with the bones pointing up. Gather the edges of the aluminum foil around the shank and toward the bone, so that each shank is sitting in a sort of bowl shaped from aluminum foil.


Make sure you use enough foil so that it won't rip. You need enough to gather the ends over the bone before putting the packets in the oven.

, Divide the vegetables evenly among the packets. Divide the garlic cloves evenly among the packets, too. Finally, divide the wine evenly among the packets, pouring a few glugs into each.

, Twist the aluminum foil around the bones so that each packet is tightly sealed. Arrange them on a baking sheet so they won't drip as they bake.

, Place the baking sheet in the oven and bake the packets for 2 1/2 hours.

Ground sirloin will be leaner, in general, but will also result in a drier burger. Ground round has about the same fat content as ground chuck, but lacks that rich, beefy flavor of either chuck or sirloin. Avoid buying ground beef that has no specific cut labeled: this can be a mixture of a variety of beef cuts, can be very fatty (without the flavor) and very mushy—and nobody likes a mushy burger.For the ambitious chef, try grinding your own beef in your food processor. Do it in 4 batches, and do not touch the beef while grinding (to avoid bacterial contamination). Use a spatula to scrape down the sides so that your beef is ground uniformly.;
, While you can use a skillet, the best burgers are cooked on a medium-hot grill.


If you opt to use a skillet, after you've formed the patties, heat a teaspoon or two of vegetable oil until it just begins to smoke, then back down the temperature until it stops smoking. You want it hot, but not so hot that the outside burns before the inside is fully cooked.

, Place the meat into a large bowl, season with pepper, and add 4 tablespoons melted butter. You can add other spices if desired, but less you add, the more beefy flavor comes through. Mix the seasoned beef together gently; mashing the burger and packing the meat tightly will result in something more like a flat meatloaf, not a juicy hamburger. The lighter touch you use, the better.

, Divide the seasoned meat into four sections. Gently form round patties so that they are about 4-1/2 inches (11cm) in diameter. Place in the refrigerator while you finish prepping and the grill or skillet heats up., The best burger is an individual affair: some people like mushrooms, others like their onions grilled, and some think the best hamburger is about the beef, and too many condiments is just a distraction. Here are some ideas for what to prepare:


Mustard and ketchup. Dijon mustard works great for burgers, complimenting—not overwhelming—the flavor of the beef.
Lettuce. This adds a satisfying, cool crunch to your hamburger. Traditionally, iceberg lettuce is a favorite, though romaine lettuce has a richer flavor.
Tomato. Vine-ripened tomatoes are best. When you buy them, they should be firm and have a rich tomato aroma. For extra zest, brush a little olive oil on the tomatoes, and grill them for a couple minutes.
Mushrooms. Sautéed white or crimini mushrooms add an earthiness to the hamburger to balance out the bright flavors of the lettuce and tomato.
Onions. Raw, they add tanginess and bite; sautéed, they add a sweet depth to the combination of flavors. You can also split the difference: brush them with olive oil, and grill for up to 10 minutes.
Cheese. Who doesn't love cheese on their burger? This can range from mild Swiss cheese to sharp cheddar to spicy pepper jack. Rather than slicing it (or using pre-sliced cheese products), use a grater to shred the cheese. It'll melt quicker, and lends itself to combinations like melted swiss combined with spicy pepper jack.
Bacon. Bacon needs no introduction! While it can up the calorie count significantly, it can also add a deep smoky, sweet richness to your sandwich.
Special sauce. This can be anything. You might love thousand island dressing, a swipe of mayonnaise, horseradish, or any other condiment. Just keep in mind, this is a recipe for the best hamburger, so let the flavor of the ground beef be the star.

, Place the patties on your heated grill or skillet, and cook, covered and undisturbed, for about 5-6 minutes. Flip and cook the other side. Burgers are done when the temperature reaches 160°F (65°C). About a minute before removing the burger, add the shredded cheese so that it is just beginning to melt when the burgers are done.


Note: because hamburger carries an elevated risk of bacteria, it's safest to cook ground beef to the recommended texture. However, many people prefer their hamburgers rare or medium rare. If so, reduce cooking times, and let the internal temperature rise to about 125°F (51°C).

, When the burgers reach the desired degree of doneness, remove them to a heated plate, brush the buns with a little butter or olive oil, then grill briefly until toasty brown.

, Put a layer of ketchup on the bottom bun, then the beef patty. Salt and pepper to taste, then add the tomato, lettuce, and other toppings as desired. Put the mustard on the top bun, and press it all together gently so that it sets.

, You can serve this with chips, fries, potato salad, coleslaw, a dill pickle, or whatever you like. An icy carbonated beverage, a cold beer, or a spicy zinfandel tops the meal. Bon appetite!, This recipe uses ground sirloin, as it's flavor is very good, and its fat content is much lower than ground chuck. Heat 2 tablespoons vegetable oil in a heavy skillet until it just starts to smoke, then brown the ground beef in two batches. You do not need to cook it all the way through, just sear it to boost the beefy flavors. By browning in two batches, you avoid steaming the beef, which doesn't add anything at all to the flavor. If your skillet is on the small side, three or even four batches are recommended.


When the beef is browned, set it aside.

, Place a strainer over a large bowl, and empty the two cans of whole tomatoes into it. Slice open the tomatoes, removing and discarding seeds or tough parts. Press the seeded and cored tomatoes to remove as much juice as possible.


Set aside 3/4 to 1 cup of the prepared tomatoes, and 2-1/2 cups of the strained tomato juice. Keep the remaining juice in case you need to add liquid later in the cooking process, after which you can then discard.

, Heat the olive oil over medium heat in a heavy 12-inch skillet until shimmering (but not smoking). Add the onions, and sauté until beginning to brown, then add the garlic and oregano. Cook for about 30 seconds, then turn up the heat to medium-high.

, Add the larger quantity of tomatoes to the skillet and cook, stirring frequently, for about 10 minutes, until browned and sticking on the bottom of the skillet.

, Pour the wine into the mixture, and stir with a wooden spoon, scraping the bottom to incorporate the fond (the brown bits that stuck to the skillet). Cook until mixture begins to thicken, then add in the ground sirloin, bay leaf, and brown sugar.

, Pour in the 2-1/2 cups tomato juice, and stir until combined, reduce heat to medium low, and let simmer for 10 to 30 minutes.


For a richer, more complex sauce, keep the simmer very low, add an anchovy, and add more tomato juice, wine, or tomato sauce as needed.

, Dice the tomatoes until chunky. About 5 minutes before you serve the sauce, add the tomatoes and basil. Check your seasonings, and add salt and pepper to taste.

, Ladle generous portions of sauce over your favorite pasta, and serve with grated parmesan reggiano cheese, fresh crusty bread, and a nice chianti., In a large heavy skillet, heat 1 tablespoon vegetable oil (per batch) until just beginning to smoke, and cook the beef in 4 or 5 batches until browned, and then set aside.

, While the beef is browning, combine the cayenne, oregano, and cumin together in a small bowl.

, In the same skillet, add another tablespoon vegetable oil, and cook the onions until soft and beginning to brown. This will add a nice sweetness to the chili. About 30 seconds before the onions are ready, add the garlic and jalapeños, and stir until just softened and aromatic. When ready, remove the onion mix from the skillet and set aside.

, shake the cayenne, oregano, and cumin into the skillet. Cook for about 15 seconds, then add the ground beef and onion mix back into the skillet, stirring to blend.

, Pour in the tomato sauce, the water or stock, and the lime juice, then stir to blend. Reduce heat to low, then cover and simmer for about 20 minutes.

, Taste your chili, then add salt and pepper to taste, stirring to blend.

, Increase the heat to medium, stir in the masa flour or cornstarch until blended, then stir in the beans and diced tomatoes. Cook until heated through—about 5 minutes—then serve in large bowls. Garnish with cilantro, top with shredded cheese and chopped scallions, and serve with tortilla chips, an icy cerveza, or a refreshing margarita.

, In a medium saucepan, add a teaspoon of salt and the peeled and chopped potatoes, then cover with cold water.


Bring to a full boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to simmer. Cook for about ten minutes, until a fork or knife can easily pierce the potato.
Drain the potatoes, then return the saucepan to the stove, stirring occasionally for about a minute until the surface moisture has steamed away.

, In a large bowl, mash the potatoes until smooth.


Mix the egg yolk and cream together, and blend into the potatoes along with the melted butter.
Add the scallions, then salt and pepper to taste. When you're satisfied, cover and set aside while you prepare the filling.

, Heat 1 teaspoon vegetable oil in a heavy skillet until just beginning to smoke, and quickly brown the beef in 4 batches. When finished, set aside.

, In the same skillet, heat 1 teaspoon vegetable oil until shimmering, then add the mushrooms and onions. Cook 5 to 6 minutes, until the onions are just softened and turning brown at the edges. Add the garlic and tomato paste and cook for about 2 minutes.

, Stir in the porter, scraping the bottom to loosen the fond, and cook for about a minute, then add the flour, stirring and cooking for another minute.

, Pour in the stock, add the anchovy, thyme and bay leaf bundle, and carrots. When the mixture comes to a boil, reduce heat and bring the mix to a low simmer. Stir in the beef, cooking for five to ten minutes, and continue stirring occasionally.


Add in the cornstarch, and stir for another 30 seconds. Remove the thyme and bay leaf bundle, and adjust seasonings with salt and pepper, to taste.

, Set your oven rack to the top shelf, leaving enough room for the pie with about 3 inches clearance.

, In a deep-dish pie pan, add the meat filling mixture. Layer the mashed potatoes on top of the meat with a pastry bag, covering the entire surface. Swirl the potatoes with a fork to form ridges, then place the pie on a rimmed baking sheet., Slide the pie into the oven, and broil for 10 to 15 minutes, until the potatoes are nicely browned. Remove, let sit for for a few minutes. Garnish with scallions and parsley, and serve piping hot with a hearty ale."

Serve on the side.",How to Cook Corned Beef and Cabbage in the Crock Pot," The potatoes, celery, and cabbage will all need to be cut into smaller pieces.


The baby red potatoes should be briefly rinsed with cool water and scrubbed with a vegetable brush. When done, cut them in half crosswise.
The celery stalks should be cut into pieces that are roughly 3 inches (7.6 cm) long. Rinse under cool water if necessary.
The cabbage must cut into six or more wedges. Cut the cabbage in half lengthwise and remove part of the core, leaving just enough intact to hold the leaves together. Cut each half into three or four wedges. Rinse under cool water, if necessary.
The baby carrots and pearl onions do not need to be cut for this recipe. If, however, you are using standard carrots and standard onions, the carrots must be cleaned and cut into 2-inch (5-cm) pieces, and the onion should be peeled and cut into wedges.;
, Quickly rinse the brisket under cool, running water for a few seconds to remove any traces of ice or other substances. Pat dry with clean paper towels.


If you stored the corned beef brisket in the freezer beforehand, it should be thawed before you begin the cooking process. Thaw meat in your refrigerator overnight in order to defrost it carefully and effectively.

, Coat the bottom and sides of the slow cooker with a fine spray.


Alternatively, you could use a slow cooker liner, instead. Either option will be enough to minimize or prevent the amount of burnt, stuck-on food.

, Place the mustard seeds, bay leaves, and Allspice berries in a mortar and grind them together using a pestle.


If you do not have a mortar and pestle, you could use the handle of a meat tenderizer or other utensil and a small dish, like a custard dish or ramekin. Similarly, you could place the spices in a resealable plastic bag, seal it, and crush them with a rolling pin.

,


The spices can be mixed together with a spoon or fork.
Set aside once combined.

, Arrange these hardier vegetables at the bottom of the slow cooker in even layers.


Onions are less likely to stick to the sides of the slow cooker as much as many of the other ingredients might. Moreover, as fragrant vegetables, the aroma and flavor of the onions can seep upward and into the less dense, more permeable ingredients.

, If you cannot fit the brisket in as a whole piece, cut it into two pieces and rearrange as needed to make it fit.

, Scatter the celery and carrots over the beef in even layers.


These are the only vegetables you should add at this point. Do not add the cabbage yet. It cooks too quickly and will disintegrate if cooked for the full time.

, Drizzle the ale or beer over the beef and vegetables in the slow cooker. Sprinkle evenly with the spice blend.


Make sure that the ale completely covers the meat in the slow cooker. If it does not, add just enough water to bring the level of the liquid up to the top of the brisket.Use the spice blend provided in this article, or, if you would prefer, you could also use a pre-made pickling spice blend or the spice blend that usually comes with the corned beef brisket.

, Leave the lid on the entire 7 hours.


If you do not have a full 7 hours, you could cook the corned beef and vegetables on high for 4 hours, instead.Keeping the lid on is crucial. Crock Pots and other slow cookers work by building up heat, and when you remove the lid, you let a portion of that heat escape. This could lengthen the overall cooking time.

, Arrange the cabbage wedges in an even layer across the top of the slow cooker. Cover again and cook on low for another hour, until the cabbage becomes tender.


Alternatively, you could switch the slow cooker to high and cook the cabbage and other ingredients for only 20 to 30 minutes longer.
You do not need to stir the ingredients previously in the slow cooker before adding the cabbage. Simply rest the cabbage on top, spreading it out as evenly as possible.

, Transfer the cooked corned beef and vegetables to serving plates while still hot. Pour the remainder of the juices from the slow cooker over the meat, if desired, and serve with sides of mustard and horseradish sauce.


When slicing the corned beef, cut it into thin slices across the grain. Doing so creates tender slices, while cutting with the grain will produce tougher slices.
You could also consider pouring the remaining juices into a gravy boat and placing it alongside the Dijon mustard and horseradish sauce on the table.

, Use an electric mixer to beat the heavy cream in a medium mixing bowl until soft peaks form.


If you do not want to use an electric mixer or do not have one on hand, you could beat the whipping cream by hand, using a whisk. You will need to whip rapidly and for several minutes, however.
To determine when the whipping cream has reached the soft peak stage, turn the whisk or mixer attachment upside down, breaking the surface of the cream. The peaks should take shape and hold for a second or so before melting back into the rest of the cream.

,


If you beat the sour cream and horseradish into the cream with too much force, you will end up deflating the cream, thereby negating all the effort you put into whipping it and causing the sauce to become too runny.
Use more or less horseradish according to your own tastes.

, Add as much of these seasonings as desired and fold them in with the rubber spatula.


If you are not sure about how much of each ingredient to use, start with 1/2 tsp (2.5 ml) salt, 1/2 tsp (2.5 ml) pepper, and a dash of hot sauce. Taste with a clean spoon and adjust the seasonings as needed.

, This sauce should be served on the side of your prepared slow cooker corned beef."

Whisk the ingredients together.,
Add to the ham halfway through cooking.",How to Make Glaze for Ham1," Combine the maple syrup, brown sugar, and black pepper in a small mixing bowl, whisking well until evenly combined.


If you'd prefer glaze with a little more kick, add 1/4 tsp (1.25 ml) of cayenne pepper to the glaze alongside the black pepper.
This glaze will already be quite thick at room temperature, so you do not need to cook it on the stove.;
, Bake the ham as directed, and brush the entire batch of glaze over the surface of the ham halfway through the overall cooking time.


If the glaze has been sitting out for a while, quickly whisk it again before applying it to the ham.
For most hams, you'll need to cook the ham for 15 to 20 minutes per 1 lb (450 g) of meat at 325 degrees Fahrenheit (163 degrees Celsius).If you're cooking an 8-lb (3.6-kg) ham, this means you'll need to cook it between 2 to 2-1/2 hours; add this glaze after the first 60 to 90 minutes.

"
Combine the three ingredients.,
Glaze the ham continuously during the last hour.",How to Make Glaze for Ham2," Whisk the brown sugar and prepared mustard together with 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of apple cider vinegar.


If the glaze seems chunky or won't hold together, add another 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of apple cider vinegar and continue whisking. The final glaze should form a thick, consistent paste.
Note that you do not need to heat this glaze prior to using it. You may need to periodically remix it, however, if it sits out for more than a few minutes before use.

, Brush this glaze over the ham once the ham only has an estimated 60 minutes left in cooking time. Reapply the glaze every 15 minutes until the ham is finished.


Whisk the remaining glaze immediately before each reapplication.
Ideally, you should apply this glaze to the ham a total of four times. Do not re-glaze the ham after it finishes cooking.

This glaze should be thick enough to use without thickening it over heat.
Make this glaze immediately before you intend to use it and only whisk it together well enough to combine the ingredients. The carbonation will eventually flatten after you add the glaze to the ham, but you should try to retain some of it prior to application.

, Cook the ham as usual, then pour or brush this glaze evenly over the surface of the ham during the final 30 to 45 minutes of anticipated cooking time.


This glaze can burn easily, so it's important to avoid applying it too early in the cooking process.

Boiling this glaze is important since it causes the sugars in the apricot preserves to break down and mix into the rest of the ingredients, creating a thick and consistently blended product.
Since you need to boil and cool this glaze, it's best to prepare it before you start cooking the ham. You can prepare it up to five days in advance.

, Transfer the contents of the saucepan to a blender. Process on medium speed until a smooth glaze forms.


This step is technically optional. If you'd prefer a glaze with chunks of pineapple in it, you can skip the blending process and move directly into the next step.

, Allow the glaze to sit out at room temperature until it cools down.


If you don't plan to use the glaze immediately after cooling it, transfer it to an airtight container and store it in your refrigerator for up to five days.

, Bake the ham as usual, and brush this glaze over the surface of the ham once the ham only has an estimated 30 to 40 minutes left of bake time.


Quickly stir the glaze again before you apply it.

If you'd rather not use freshly minced garlic or freshly grated ginger, you can use their powdered forms instead. Use only 1/8 tsp (0.6 ml) of each when opting for the ground and dried versions.

, Lightly brush this glaze over the ham immediately before baking it. Once the ham is halfway through its anticipated cooking time, apply the remainder of the glaze and continue baking the ham.


Note that you may need to quickly whisk the glaze together again prior to each application.
The exact times will vary depending on the weight of the ham. You'll usually need to bake ham for 15 to 20 minutes per 1 lb (450 g) at a temperature of 325 degrees Fahrenheit (163 degrees Celsius).

The best cut to use in a slow cooker is a pork picnic shoulder roast. This cut, also known as a pork arm shoulder, is often used to make pulled pork. The fat and marbling this cut brings helps it to stay moist and tender after cooking for a long time in the slow cooker.
This recipe calls for 2 boneless pork picnic shoulder roasts, 4,5 lbs.(1.1-to-1.4 kg) each, trimmed and tied.;
,









Mince 2 onions, 6 cloves of garlic and 1 tbsp. of fresh thyme.
Peel 1 lb. (.5 kg) each of carrots and parsnips and cut them into 1-inch (2.5 cm) pieces.

,









Heat 2 tbsp. of vegetable oil in a 12-inch (30.5 cm) skillet over medium-high heat until it begins to shimmer.
Add onions, garlic, 1 tbsp. of tomato paste and thyme. Cook this until the onions are soft and slightly brown--about 8-to-10 minutes.

,









Stir 1/4 cup of all-purpose flour into the onion mixture and cook, stirring with a wooden spoon for 1 minute.
Slowly whisk in 1/2 cup dry white wine. With a whisk or a wooden spoon, scrape up any brown bits that have stuck to the bottom of the skillet. Whisk to remove any lumps. Pour this mixture into the slow cooker.

,









Add 28 oz. of diced tomatoes and the carrot and parsnip chunks to the slow cooker.
Season the roasts well with salt and pepper and place them in the slow cooker, pushing them down so they are surrounded by the other ingredients.

,









Cover the slow cooker and cook until the pork is tender: 9-to-11 hours on low or 5-to-7 hours on high.

,









When they are cooked, place the roasts on a cutting board to rest for 20 minutes. Loosely cover them with aluminum foil to keep them from cooling too much.
Let the liquid in the cooker settle for about 5 minutes and then remove any fat that has risen to the top with a large spoon.
Stir in 2 tsp. of white wine vinegar and season sauce to taste with salt and vinegar.

,









Remove the twine from the roasts and slice the pork into 1/4 inch (1.25 cm) slices and place on a serving platter. Spoon about 1 cup of sauce over the meat and serve the rest of the sauce at the table.

Preheat the grill pan.,
Soak some toothpicks in water.,
Butterfly the steak.,
Open up the steak and season it with salt and pepper.,
Layer the Asiago on the steak.,
Place the spinach over the Asiago.,
Lay the Gorgonzola and scallions over the spinach.,
Roll the steak up tightly.,
Use toothpicks to seal the seam of the steak.,
Cut the pinwheel into slices.,
Place the pinwheel slices in the pan and grill for several minutes.,
Flip the pinwheels and cook on the other side for several minutes.,
Remove the toothpicks and allow the pinwheels to rest.",How to Make Flank Steak Pinwheels," To ensure that the grill pan is hot enough to cook the steak, it’s important to preheat it. Place the pan on the stovetop, and turn the heat to high. Allow the pan to heat for approximately 5 minutes.You’ll know that the pan is hot enough when you sprinkle a few drops of water over the pan and it evaporates quickly.
You can cook the flank steak pinwheels on an actual grill if you prefer. Preheat it on high just as you would with a pan.;
, To secure the pinwheels for grilling, you’ll need toothpicks to keep the rolls shut as they cooks. However, you need to soak the toothpicks in water first to keep them from burning. Place 8 to 10 toothpicks in a glass of water for at least 20 minutes.You can also use wooden skewers usually used for making kabobs. Soak them as you would the toothpicks.

, For the pinwheels, you’ll need 1 large flank steak that’s approximately 1 to 2 pounds (454 to 904 g). Ready it for the pinwheels by taking a very sharp knife and cutting the steak in half horizontally with the grain of the meat. Stop approximately 1-inch (2.5-cm) from where you would completely slice it in half, though, so the steak remains intact.Before you butterfly the steak, you may want to slice off the edges to create a square. That often makes it easier to roll it up later.
As you’re cutting the steak, trim away any fat that you see.
If you’re not comfortable butterflying the steak yourself, you can ask your butcher to do it when you buy the steak.

, Once the steak is butterflied, unfold it so it lays flat on your work surface. Season both sides of the meat with salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste.You can add other herbs to season the steak if you like. Italian seasoning, oregano, or basil would all work well.

, When the steak is properly seasoned, lay it out so the grain runs left to right. Spread 6 ounces (150 g) of shredded Asiago cheese across the meat to make the first layer of the pinwheel.You can substitute mozzarella or provolone for the Asiago if you prefer.
Make sure to leave a 1-inch (2.5-cm) border on one end of the meat. That way, when you roll up the steak, the fillings won’t spill out.

, With the Asiago cheese in place on the steak, lay 8 ounces (225 g) of loose spinach leaves with the stems removed over it. Try to create as even as layer of the leaves as possible.You can substitute arugula leaves for the spinach if you prefer.

, After you’ve added the spinach layer, place 6 ounces (188 g) of crumbled Gorgonzola over it. Next, set 4 whole scallions over the Gorgonzola to serve as the final layer of the pinwheel.You can omit the scallions if you prefer.

, When all of the layers are in place on the steak, start rolling it up on one of the long sides. Roll away from you, keeping the steak as tight as possible.Make sure to tuck the fillings in as you roll to keep them from falling out.

, Once the steak is fully rolled up, close the seam with the soaked toothpicks. Place them as evenly as you can along the seam so the meat is divided equally., With a sharp knife, carefully cut the pinwheel into slices. Use the toothpicks as a guide, cutting just behind each one. That will keep all of the pinwheels closed.Handle the steak very gently as you cut it to avoid squeezing out too much of the filling.
You should wind up with 8 to 10 pinwheels when you’re finished cutting the steak.

, When the slices are cut, set them in the heated grill pan. Allow the pinwheels to cook for 6 to 7 minutes for medium-rare to medium.Adjust the cooking time based on your doneness preference. Cook the first side for 8 to 10 minutes for medium-well to well.

, Once the first side of the pinwheels is finished cooking, use a spatula to carefully flip them over. Allow them to cook on the other side for another 6 to 7 minutes.You should cook each side of the pinwheel for the same amount of time, so if you’re adjusting the cooking time for the first side, do the same for the second side.
To ensure that your steak is cooked properly, it’s a good idea to use a digital meat thermometer to test the temperature. Look for 120 degrees Fahrenheit (49 degrees Celsius) for medium-rare or 140 degrees Fahrenheit (60 degrees Celsius) for medium. For medium-well, look for 150 degrees Fahrenheit (66 degrees Celsius). Well done steaks should be at 155 to 160 degrees Fahrenheit (68 to 71 degrees Celsius).

, When the pinwheels are finished cooking, transfer them to a cutting board. Take out the toothpicks, and let the meat rest for approximately 5 minutes. Next, plate the pinwheels up and serve."

The grain refers to the direction in which the muscle fibers in the beef are aligned, and it can be spotted by examining your steak for fine lines. Cutting with the grain means will result in tough, stringy steak, while cutting against it will make the steak more tender.If you cannot find flank steak, look for top sirloin, beef round, or chuck steaks, instead. Steaks marked ""for swissing"" will also work.;
, Mix these five ingredients together in a large bowl with a tight lid. Continue stirring until the cornstarch thickens up the marinade.


If you do not have rice wine, you could also use rice wine vinegar, dry sherry, or cooking sherry.
If you do not have minced garlic, you could also use 1/4 tsp (1 ml) garlic powder, instead.

, Place the steak in the bowl with the marinade and toss gently to coat. Let sit for 10 to 30 minutes.


There should be just enough liquid to cover the pieces of steak.
Cover the bowl and place it in the refrigerator as the steak marinates.

, Use a serrated knife to cut the onion into thin strips. You could also cut the onion into wedges.


If you prefer a less pungent taste, you could reduce the amount of onion down to half an onion instead of a whole one.
Slice both the stem and root ends off the onion. If you notice that the papery skin layers are starting to come off with one of the ends, grab these outer layers and peel them away. If they do not come off as easily, you may need to slide your fingernail beneath these outer layers to loosen them and peel them away.
Cut the onion in half from top to bottom, then in half again in the same direction.
Make a few slices, starting in the center of each wedge. Do this for each quarter until layered slices are left behind. These layers should break apart naturally when the slices are moved.

, Use a sharp knife to cut the peppers into 1-inch (2.5-cm) pieces.


Use one green bell pepper and one red bell pepper.
Cut into each indentation in the pepper without detaching the slices from the center of the vegetable. Note where the indented sections of the pepper begin on the inside top, near the stem. Begin each slice at this starting point, but do not slice through into the bottom of the stem. Cut straight down from top to bottom, freeing the bottom of each slice but not the top.
When all slices are made, use your fingers to gently break them off from the center of the pepper. The seeded part of the pepper, located just below the stem, should not break free. As a result, you should have very few seeds to clean up. Discard this portion and turn your attention back to your strips.
Cut each strip into 1-inch (2.5-cm) chunks. You may need to cut larger sections in half lengthwise in order to get the proper size.

,


You could also dice a large tomato or use a drained 10-oz (310-ml) can of diced tomatoes.

, Add 1 to 2 Tbsp (15 to 30 ml) of cooking oil to the pan and heat over medium-high heat.


Use an oil with a high smoking point, like grape seed, safflower, or canola oil. Plain vegetable oil will also work in a pinch.
A wok works wonderfully for this recipe, but if you do not have one, any heavy skillet pan that is at least 10 inches (25 cm) in diameter will also work.

, Add the marinated beef to the pan and stir until it is well-browned and cooked through.


Stir or gently toss the beef strips frequently to ensure even cooking.
Cooking the beef should only take a few minutes when it is sliced this thin, but you may need to cook it in batches if your pan is too small to allow each piece to touch the bottom.

, Transfer the beef to a plate or bowl. Set it aside and keep it warm.


Drain any fat from the pan before proceeding.

, Add another 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of cooking oil to the pan and reduce the heat to medium. Add the peppers and onions and cook until they are tender-crisp.


Stir the peppers and onions continually for 3 or 4 minutes. The pepper should start feeling soft and the onion should begin turning translucent.

, Once the peppers and onions are finished, return the beef to the skillet and give it a quick stir to mix it into the vegetables.

, Pour it into the pan and heat through.


Heating the gravy should take no longer than 1 or 2 minutes.
Many pepper steak recipes do not include the addition of beef gravy, but if you are someone who enjoys having a sauce to go with your stir-fry, beef gravy is a convenient and appropriate option.

, Just before turning off the heat, add your tomatoes to the skillet and heat through.


The tomatoes should be cooked for no longer than 30 seconds before removing the pan from the heat.
Make sure that you mix the tomatoes in thoroughly as they cook.
The tomatoes can be added whether you add the beef gravy or not.

, Spoon out the pepper steak and serve it warm over a pile of hot, cooked rice.


You can use just about any type of rice you want, including white rice, brown rice, and fried rice.
You could also serve the pepper steak over thin spaghetti noodles, egg noodles, or rice noodles.

Slow-cook the steak.",How to Make Carne Asada," In a large bowl, whisk together all ingredients except for the steak.Make sure to use a bowl or baking dish made from a non-reactive material, like glass. The acid in the vinegar and lime juice can react with metals like aluminum, making them a poor choice.
If you are unable to find fresh jalapeno peppers, you could also use a serrano chile, which is just about as hot as a jalapeno is. You could also use a canned jalapeno, which has slightly less kick, or 1 tsp (5 ml) of ground red pepper.
If you do not have fresh minced garlic, you could also use 1/2 tsp (2.5 ml) garlic powder.
If you only have dried cilantro, use about 8 tsp (40 ml) instead of the 1/2 cup (125 ml) called for with fresh cilantro.;
, Add the steak to the marinade and turn the steak several times to coat all sides thoroughly.

Flank steak is the most traditional option for carne asada, but other varieties of thin-sliced steak, like skirt steak, can also be used.

, Cover the bowl or baking dish with plastic wrap and let it sit in the refrigerator.

Generally, the longer you let the steak sit in the marinade, the more tender and more flavorful it will become. Letting it sit in the marinade too long can actually cause it to become tough, though.
Four hours is the longest recommended time. After that, there will be relatively no difference in the flavor of the steak. You can, however, let it sit up to 24 hours before it starts becoming unpleasant.
Do not marinate your steak on the kitchen counter. Doing so invites bacteria to grow in the meat. Only marinate the steak in the refrigerator.

, Use a wire brush to scrub the grill grate, removing any traces of burnt on food from previous grilling sessions.


Even if you cleaned your grill after using it, it is still a wise idea to clean it again, especially if it has not been used for a while. Scrubbing the grill grate also helps to remove other debris that could have gathered on it in between uses.

, Pour a small amount of canola oil onto a clean paper towel and rub the paper towel over the grate.


The oil creates a non-stick coating that will limit the amount of steak getting stuck to the grill as it cooks.
In the absence of oil, you could also use aluminum foil. Cover the grill grate in aluminum and poke holes throughout the foil with the tines of a grilling fork. You must poke the holes in the foil so that enough heat can travel through.

, You should begin 20 minutes before cooking, and you need to prepare two areas of high heat and one cooler area.


Set the grill grate aside temporarily.
Use a chimney starter to ignite a moderate pile of charcoal briquettes. Let them burn until they are covered in white ash.
Dump the hot coals into the bottom of the grill. Use tongs with a long handle to carefully spread the coals. You should have two or three layers in one-third of the fire bed, and one or two layers in another third. The remaining third should have no coals.
Return the grill grate to the grill

, As with the charcoal grill, begin 20 minutes before you plan on cooking. Turn all heat elements on as high as they will go.

, The grill must be very hot before you can add the steak.


To check a charcoal grill, hold your hand roughly 4 inches (10 cm) above the tallest flames. You should only be able to count to 1 before needing to pull your hand away. If you can tolerate the heat longer, the grill is not hot enough yet.
For a gas grill, the temperature gauge needs to reach 500 degrees Fahrenheit (260 degrees Celsius) before it is ready.

, Use tongs to remove the steak from the marinade and place it on the hottest portion of the grill.


Hold the steak above the bowl of marinade so that excess marinade drips off. Discard the marinade.
You can cover the grill after placing the steak on it, but it is not necessary.

, After 4 minutes pass and the underside has browned, use tongs to turn the steak over onto the other side. Cook for another 4 minutes for a medium-rare steak.


The moisture from the marinade should be enough to prevent a crust from forming on the bottom of the steak as it cooks.
If you want cross-hatching on your steak, rotate the meat 90 degrees after cooking it for 2 minutes. To get cross-hatching on the other side, rotate it 90 degrees after 2 minutes pass on that side.
You will need to cook the steak for several more minutes per side if you want it to be more well done.

, Insert an instant-read meat thermometer into the thickest part of the steak. The thermometer should read a minimum of 140 degrees Fahrenheit (60 degrees Celsius).


You could also cut into the center of the steak and check the color. At medium-rare, it should be deep pink. At medium, it should start turning brown. At medium-well, it should be mostly brown with a little hint of pink, and at well, it should be completely brown.

, Transfer the grilled steak to a carving board and let it rest for 3 to 5 minutes.


By allowing the steak to rest, you give the juices a chance to redistribute themselves in the meat. You will end up with a more thoroughly juicy steak as a result.

, Hold the steak steady with a meat fork and use your other hand to slice the meat with a carving knife.


Use a carving knife with a thin blade.
Turn the steak so that the long end faces you. The muscle fibers, or ""grain,"" should run horizontally.
Hold the knife at a 45 degree angle and cut the steak across the grain. Do not cut the steak alongside the grain, since doing so will result in tough, chewy meat.

, Carne asada is best served hot.

,


Pour 1 to 2 Tbsp (15 to 30 ml) canola oil in the bottom of the skillet and heat over medium-high heat. Let the oil heat for 1 or 2 minutes so that it becomes sufficiently hot.
Add the steak to the pan. Cook it for 4 minutes on one side before flipping it over to the other side using tongs. Cook for an additional 4 minutes.
This will produce a medium-rare steak. Add 1 or 2 minutes onto the cooking time for each additional degree of doneness desired.

, Cook the steak in a slow cooker for 10 to 12 hours on low.Add both the marinated steak and leftover marinade to the slow cooker.
When cooked this way, the steak will be tender enough to shred with a fork.

, Using a cooking mallet, lightly hammer each steak until it begins to tenderize and grows by roughly half.








, Make space for one cutting board to season the meat, one bowl with flour, one bowl with the beaten egg mixture, and a resting surface, like a bowl or plate.









To make the egg mixture, mix together all the dry ingredients first in a medium bowl — the baking powder, baking soda, pepper, and salt. To the dry ingredients, add the buttermilk, egg, and hot sauce to create a kind of slurry.

, To dredge, put a steak through flour, then soak in the egg mixture, then the flour again and put on resting surface. Do this for all the steaks. Let them rest for 10-15 minutes.









When covering the steaks with flour for the second time, make sure they are evenly patted down and completely coated. For a fully-developed crust, make sure to pat down the steaks several times in the flour.

Good steaks will be streaky with white fat. That's a good sign that means flavor. Very lean meat can also be cooked to taste delicious, but sometimes you'll need to add some fat to make up for the leanness.
If you're grilling, strip steak or rib eye are great choices. If you're cooking in a pan, go for a sirloin, New York strip, or a porterhouse. Most steak cuts can be cooked in basically the same way. Don't be too intimidated by the different varieties. Experiment with different cuts and see what you like best.;
, Season both sides of a steak with coarse salt, black pepper, and other seasonings or spice rubs you like to use. Read the last section for some specific ideas about seasonings and marinades.


There's some debate about when to season steak. Some people think that you shouldn't salt steak until it's about to go on the heat, because it draws out the water on the meat and makes it dry. Others think the earlier you salt the meat (up to 24 hours before cooking) the more flavor and juiciness in the meat.Both methods are common.
Put salt on the steak ahead of time, but wait on pepper and other spices. These will burn and taste bitter if you put them into the high-heat skillet.
Don't completely smother the steak in salt, as it can just make the steak super salty. A light coating on each side (enough for the steak juices to rinse off while cooking) is ideal. Avoid making it like a sugared donut.

, Take your steak out of the refrigerator at least an hour or two before you cook it, giving it time to gently come up to room temperature.


If you throw a cold steak on the grill or stove, the inside will be very cold while the outside gets cooked. It's very difficult to cook a cold steak properly.

, Good flavor comes from the golden-brown crust on the outside of steak. The only way to do this is to cook it over fairly high heat, then reduce the heat to finish the inside, or finish the steak in the oven, depending on how done you want it.


Cooking steak at a lower temperature will take longer and make the stake quite a bit tougher.If you have a tough cut you want to tenderize, consider braising or otherwise tenderizing the meat before you cook it.

, Meat will continue cooking while it rests, which means you should take it off direct heat when it's just under (within 15 degrees or so) of the doneness you're looking for.Use a meat thermometer, or the finger test. Beef steaks are done at the following temperatures:


Blue-Rare or Very Rare: 110° F (43.3° C)
Rare: 120° F (48.8° C)
Medium-rare: 130° F (54.4° C)
Medium: 140° F (60° C)
Medium-well: 150° F (65.5° C)
Well Done: 160° F (71.1° C)

, Sometimes called the ""thumb method,"" you can test to see how done your steak is by pushing on the meat gently with your finger and seeing how much it gives. Then, touch your forefinger to the thumb of one hand, and press into the underside of your thumb, the fleshiest part, with your other hand. This is what a rare steak feels like. Continue with each of the fingers for progressive levels of doneness:


Rare: Forefinger
Medium-Rare: Middle Finger
Medium: Ring Finger
Well Done: Little finger

, Lots of people get worried that their meat is underdone or overdone. Some people love a rare steak, while others won't touch meat with any pink in the center. If you're cooking for a picky eater, or just want to make sure your steak is right, just cut into it and check. You're not cooking at a restaurant. It'll still taste great.

, Remove the meat to a plate, cover with aluminum foil, and let it rest for 10 minutes before cutting into the meat. This allows the meat fibers, which contract during cooking, to relax and redistribute the juice throughout the meat.Steak will be juicier and tastier if you let it rest.

Serve hot with desired garnishes.",How to Make Caldo de Res," Use a sharp knife to cut the beef into 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) pieces. Leave some of the beef on the bones.Beef shank and beef short ribs are both good options, but you can use nearly any bone-in cut of meat.
You need to use the bones in the soup, even if you completely remove the beef from the bones while cutting it. The bone marrow helps flavor the broth.;
, Rinse the vegetables under running water, then dry them off with clean paper towels.


Scrub vegetables with rough skins (carrots, potatoes) using a stiff vegetable brush to remove the dirt. You could peel the skins, if desired, but doing so is unconventional for caldo de res.
Husk the corn and rinse the exposed ears under cool water to help remove the silky strings left behind.

, Chop or slice the vegetables into relatively large chunks using a sharp kitchen knife.


Roughly chop the onion, tomatoes, and cilantro.
Quarter each ear of corn and each potato.
Slice the carrots and chayote into equally sized portions, roughly 1/2 to 1 inch (1.25 to 2.5 cm) thick. If you opt to use zucchini instead of chayote, make the piece slightly larger since zucchini is softer and cooks faster.
Cut the head of cabbage in half, then cut each half into three equal portions. You can remove the core, but it's more common to leave the stem intact.

, Process the two ingredients until a thick, chunky puree forms.


You could also use a food processor instead of a blender.
Don't worry about creating a smooth puree. The tomatoes will continue breaking down as they cook in the soup.
If you would prefer soup with larger chunks of tomato, skip this step and add the chopped tomatoes at the usual stage without pureeing them.

, Pour the oil into a large, heavy stockpot. Set the stockpot on the stove over medium-high heat.


After 1 or 2 minutes, the oil and the pot should become very hot. Carefully tilt and rotate the stockpot so that the hot oil coats the entire bottom.

, Add the beef and beef bones to the stockpot. Season the meat with salt and pepper, then cook, stirring frequently, until the beef browns on all sides.

, Sprinkle the chopped onions over the meat in the stockpot. Continue cooking and stirring until the onion lightly browns, as well.

, Add the tomatoes and remaining 2-1/2 cups (625 ml) of beef broth to the stockpot. Stir the ingredients together until evenly combined.


At this point, the liquid in the stockpot should be high enough to cover the solid ingredients (including the bones) by 1/2 inch (1.25 cm). If the liquid does not reach that high, add enough lukewarm water to satisfy that condition.

, Wait for the soup to reach a full, rolling boil over medium-high heat. Keep the stockpot uncovered and occasionally stir the ingredients while waiting.

, Discard the foam and rinse the spoon.

, Cook the soup for 60 to 90 minutes, or until the beef is tender.


During this time, the liquid should continue to simmer and bubble, but it should not reach a full boil. Keep the lid slightly ajar to prevent pressure from building up.
Stirring is not necessary during this stretch of time, but if you large amounts of additional foam rising to the surface, periodically skim them off using a ladle or slotted spoon.
Check the meat after the first 60 minutes. The beef should be tender enough to cut with the side of a spoon or fork when ready. If it isn't, continue cooking for up to 30 minutes more, checking again at 10-minute intervals.

, Toss the carrot and chopped cilantro into the soup; stir well to combine. Continue cooking the soup, uncovered, for 10 to 15 minutes.


Maintain the conditions of the liquid after adding the carrot and cilantro. Skim off any foam that developed. If the level of liquid drops beneath the solid ingredients, add enough water to keep the vegetables, meat, and bones covered.

, Place the potatoes and corn cobs in the soup and stir to combine. Cook for another 15 minutes, keeping the liquid at a steady simmer and leaving the lid off the stockpot.


Continue adding more water, as needed, to maintain the proper level of liquid. Skim off any foam that develops.

, Add the chopped chayote to the soup and stir it into the other ingredients. Continue cooking the soup at a steady simmer for another 10 minutes.


If you use zucchini instead of chayote, drop the amount of cook time to 5 minutes. Zucchini cooks faster than chayote, and it can become soggy if cooked too long.

, Evenly distribute the wedges of cabbage around the surface of the soup. Use the back of the ladle to push the wedges beneath the surface, then continue cooking the soup for another 10 minutes.


This is the last time you'll need to check the level of liquid in the soup. Add more water, if necessary, and skim off any developing foam.

, Test the taste of the broth and the tenderness of the vegetables. Make any necessary adjustments to improve both qualities to your liking.


If the broth seems too bland, you can add more salt, pepper, and cilantro.
All of the vegetables should feel tender when pierced with a fork. If they aren't tender, continue cooking the soup until they are, checking every 5 to 10 minutes.

, Once the soup is ready, remove it from the heat and fish out any bones.


Most of the meat should have fallen off the bones while cooking. If any beef is still attached to the bones, however, remove the entire piece, separate the two elements, and return the beef to the stockpot while discarding the bone.

, Ladle the hot soup into individual serving bowls, making sure that each portion contains all of the various ingredients. Allow each guest to garnish his or her portion as desired.


Traditionally, you should squeeze fresh lime juice over the caldo de res and serve the soup with warm corn tortillas. The chopped onions, chopped cilantro, and sliced jalapeños can be added according to taste.

Use a cast iron skillet over medium-high heat.,
Use a high-heat oil to coat the skillet.,
Cook one steak at a time.,
Cook 4-6 minutes on each side.,
Flip the steak with tongs or a fork.,
Lower the heat and finish the steak, if necessary.",How to Make a Steak2," The best skillets for cooking a steak on the stove are cast iron skillets, which get very hot, distribute the heat evenly, and create an even crust on the meat.


If you don't have a cast iron skillet, use the skillet or pan with the thickest bottom that you have.

, Olive oil has a low smoke point, and will smoke very quickly and taste somewhat bitter. You want an oil that will get hotter without smoking too much. Grapeseed, gram, or canola are all ideal.


Some people like to add a little butter to the skillet as well, for an added nutty flavor. You can add it at the beginning, or wait until you flip the steak.

, Don't crowd the skillet with too many steaks, or the temperature will lower in the pan and the steaks will cook unevenly. Steaks don't take long to cook, so take your time and do them one at a time.


When the skillet it hot, lay in the seasoned steak, dropping it into the skillet away from you to avoid splatter.
If the skillet isn't hot and the meat doesn't sizzle, take the meat out and wait. Putting a piece of steak into a cold pan will make a tough steak.

, Put the meat in the skillet and leave it alone for about five minutes. Let it caramelize on that side. You don't need to prod at it, check on it, or do anything. Just let the meat cook.


Don't push on the steak or press it into the skillet. There's no need to do this.
Cook thinner steaks for no more than four minutes and thicker steaks for up to six, depending on how done you like your steak. Flip the steak to the other side when it's ready.

, If you have them, tongs are great for cooking a steak, because you don't have to pierce the meat. Forks are also fine, though some people prefer not to pierce the meat before slicing it. It's not a huge deal, either way, and some people swear by either method.

, If you like a steak on the rare side, it should be done with a few minutes on each side, and 10-15 minutes of resting while covered. But if your steaks are very thick, or you like them a little more done, the best way to cook them is by finishing them in the oven.


Spoon extra butter over the steak and plate in the center of the oven at 275 degrees F. Finish it for 5-10 minutes, until the temperature shows where you want it on the thermometer, or it feels the firmness you're looking for.

Use hard-wood coals.,
Brush oil and seasoning on both sides of the steaks.,
Let the grate heat up and put the steaks on.,
Cover the grill and let the meat cook.,
Move the steak to the cooler part of the grill.",How to Make a Steak3," Sometimes called ""lump charcoal,"" hardwood burns at high temperature for a short amount of time, making it ideal for cooking steaks. It's easy to light without lighter fluid, so just use a charcoal chimney and some newspaper to get it started.


Arrange a sear-side and a warm side by putting the coals to one side of the grill. This means you can cook steaks to a variety of levels of done-ness if necessary, giving you more control.
If you use a gas grill, turn the flame on medium-high. You'll probably end up having to cook the steaks a little longer on gas, but it'll still be great.

, Prepare the steaks as if you were cooking them in any other way, bringing them to room temperature and seasoning them a bit ahead of time. Instead of greasing the skillet or the grate, though, you'll brush some cooking oil onto the meat itself.


Some people will skip this step, but it's a nice way to get a crust on your meat.
Alternatively, some people like to put a dab of butter on the meat, after flipping it.

, Once the coals are ready, replace the grill grate and the lid of the grill, to give it enough time to come up to heat. The coals cook the grill, but the grate gives it it's tasty crust and grill-marks.


When the grill gets hot and the coals are ready, put the steaks over the hot part of the grill, so they sizzle.
Some people prefer cooking the steaks over the cold part of the grill first, then searing at the end. This works fine for cold steaks.If your steak is room temperature, like it should be, sear it first.

, Put the steak on the grill, put the lid on the grill and let the hardwood smoke flavor the meat and cook it. Wait for about 4-5 minutes until you do anything. Nothing bad is going to happen to the steak. Just keep an eye on the timer and let the grill cook the steak.


Flip the steak to the other side and let it sear and cook for another five minutes. Depending on your cuts and the temperature of your steak, it should be done after about 10 minutes total.Lot of people like to be hands-on with a nice piece of steak. Some people swear by the ""don't touch it"" method, while others prefer flipping regularly to cook the steak evenly. The truth is that neither method is wrong and they're both great ways to cook steak done properly. Flip it early and often, if you want.You're not at a restaurant and you don't need to rush.

, After searing the steak, it should be just about done, if it's not done already. Use your thermometer or your finger to check for doneness and move the steak to a cooler part of the grill if you want to cook it longer.


When the steak is done, remove from the heat, put it on a plate, and rest it covered for 10-15 minutes before slicing and serving.

Serve grilled steak with a lemon wedge.",How to Make a Steak4," In a bowl, mix two cloves of fresh minced garlic, one eighth of a cup of your favorite steak sauce, a few dashes of Worcestershire, 4 tbsp of olive oil and a cup of dry red wine.


Mix the marinade up in a plastic Ziplock bag, add the steaks, and marinade overnight in the refrigerator. Don't forget to let the meat get back to room temperature before grilling.
Some people favor marinades as diverse as Italian salad dressing, barbecue sauce, soy sauce and mustard. If you'd put something on a steak, use it as a marinade beforehand.

, If you prefer, a dry rub of herbs and other seasonings can be a great addition to a cut of steak. Green herbs like rosemary, thyme, and oregano can be great on steak, while red pepper flakes, black pepper, coriander, and mustard seed can be surprising additions. Use flavors you like.


For something surprising and unusual, try mixing up a tablespoon each of fresh-ground or crushed fennel seed, anise, cinnamon, peppercorn, and clove, along with salt to taste.Lots of commercial dry rubs are available as well, which you can experiment with. They're easy to use and can be quite good.

, Take one half-stick of butter, softened, and mix well with peeled, chopped garlic, chopped herbs, and lemon zest. Form into a log and refrigerate.


Generously season your steak with salt and pepper on both sides and sear the steak in olive oil. In the last minute of cooking, take the log of compound butter and slice a nice thick piece to place on top.

, After grilling, resting, and slicing steak, chop up a handful of fresh parsley, cilantro, thyme, or rosemary to top the meat before serving. Fresh herbs make for an excellent addition to grilled meats, added at the last minute. They add aromatic flavor and bright color to the dish.

, In Mediterranean regions, grilled meats are rarely served without slices of lemon on the side, to squeeze over the top. Lemon can add a brightness and tanginess to grilled steak, especially with some chopped cilantro on top.

Cut the meat against the grain.,
Season with salt and pepper and serve.",How to Grill Flank Steak," Regardless of the seasonings (or lack thereof) you choose to use for your flank steak, you will probably want to begin by scoring it, especially if you have a thick piece of meat. Scoring is a process in which shallow cuts are made into the surface of the steak to allow both heat and seasonings to penetrate deeper into the meat. To score your flank steak, place the flank steak on a cutting board, then use the tip of a sharp knife to make several shallow cuts into the surface of both sides of the steak in a diamond pattern. Try to make each cut about 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) deep.


If you can, cut against the grain of the meat. As we'll eventually learn, the general rule with flank steak is to always cut against the grain to reduce the meat's toughness.;
, If cooked correctly, flank steak can taste great without any seasoning at all. However, proper seasonings give this dish a burst of zesty flavor that can make it absolutely irresistible. When it comes to seasoning your flank steak, generally, your two options will be to use a marinade or a dry rub. Marinading your steak means letting soak in a mix of flavorful liquid ingredients so that it absorbs its flavor, while a dry rub is exactly what it sounds like — a mix of dry ingredients that you rub onto the outside of the steak. Both options can result in great flank steak. However, these seasoning methods aren't usually used together, so it's a wise idea to decide which method you're using before you start to cook.


Note that sample marinade and dry rub recipes are listed above in the ""Ingredients"" section.
If you're using a marinade, you will want to begin early so that your flank steak has enough time to soak before cooking. Generally, you'll want to let your meat marinate for at least 2-3 hours, though marinating for as long as overnight can give stronger flavors.

, Whether you're using a marinade or a dry rub, the basic process for preparing each is the same. Simply combine the ingredients in a single vessel and mix thoroughly until the ingredients are combined. When you've achieved a thorough mix, your seasonings are ready to be applied to your flank steak.


If you're not interested in the pair of delicious marinade and dry rub recipes listed above, it's easy to make your own. For marinades, you'll want to start with an oil base (like olive oil or vegetable oil) and add your preferred seasonings, some of which should be acidic liquids (like citrus juice or vinegar) to cut the oil. To make a dry rub, simply combine dry or powdered ingredients that you like. A good mix of sweet, salty, savory, and spicy flavors is always a good bet.

, If you've chosen to add flavor to your steak with a marinade, begin by pouring the marinade in to a large zip-lock bag, then add the flank steak. Squeeze most of the air out of the bag, then seal it securely shut. Knead the bag to be sure the steak is completely coated in marinade. Leave the marinating steak in its bag in the refrigerator for at least 2-3 hours; some prefer to allow the meat to marinate overnight. Note, however, that the longer you allow your meat to marinate, the stronger it will taste.


If you don't have any zip-lock bags handy, you can soak your meat in a bowl covered with plastic wrap, a tupperware container, or any other plastic container with a seal.

, On the other hand, if you're more interested in the tasty exterior crust that a dry rub provides, skip the marinade and apply your dry rub instead. Pour your dry rub into a large bowl and drop your flank steak in. Use your hands to toss your meat in the dry rub until it is completely covered. Be generous with your dry rub — you want every surface of your flank steak to receive a thorough coating.


When done, let the meat sit until it reaches room temperature, or, if you're not grilling immediately, place it on a platter in the refrigerator.

, Whether you're using a gas or charcoal grill, you'll want it nice and hot by the time you plan to start cooking. Use the directions below to get your grill to the perfect flank steak-grilling temperature:


For gas grills: Light one burner and set it to ""high"". Allow to sit for several minutes (with the grill's lid closed) before cooking. If possible, leave a second burner off so that there will be space to transfer the meat to for slow-cooking after the initial sear.
For charcoal grills: Pour charcoal into the bottom of the grill until the entire bottom surface is covered. If possible, push all of the charcoal to one side so that one half of the grill has no charcoal under it. This portion of the grill will be used for slow cooking after the initial sear. Light the charcoal and allow to burn freely until the flames die down and the charcoal turns mostly grey. The grill surface should be quite hot; you should not be able to hold your hand near the grill for more than a second.

, When meat cooks on a grill, the characteristic black and brown ""sear"" that creates a crispy, delicious exterior can't begin to form until the moisture on the outer layer of the meat has evaporated. Since it takes a great deal of energy to evaporate water, grilling meat that's soaking wet is not only an inefficient use of the grill's heat, but also a bad idea for those looking to cook a crispy browned steak. To eliminate the moisture from the surface of the meat, use a dry paper towel to pat it down until it's slightly damp, but not dripping.


If you used a dry rub, you may not need to perform this step, as the powdered ingredients will likely have soaked up much of the moisture already and patting with a paper towel can cause the rub to come unstuck from the meat.

, When your grill is nice and hot, carefully use a grill brush to paint the metal bars with olive oil or vegetable oil above the burner or charcoal. Then, transfer your flank steak to the grill directly onto the spot you just applied oil to. You should hear a noticeable sizzling sound as soon as the meat touches the grill surface. Let the meat sit momentarily.


If you don't have a grill brush handy, you can try bunching up a paper towel and dipping it in your oil, then using this to paint the grill. Be careful when attempting this method, as it requires you to get your hand very close to the hot grill surface.

, Once you've placed your meat on the grill, let it cook undisturbed for about 3 or 4 minutes, then flip it over with a pair of tongs. If your grill was hot enough, your steak should be well-browned with crispy dark brown or blackened portions. If it is not well-seared, immediately flip it back over and allow it to continue cooking. Otherwise, cook the other side for 3-4 minutes before flipping again. Cooking the flank steak over high heat initially helps ""sear"" the meat, creating a crisp outer layer that tastes great and gives your meat a mouth-watering texture.


Contrary to popular belief, searing the meat doesn't actually ""seal in the moisture"".The steak's internal juices can flow out of the meat just as easily after it's seared as they can before. The primary reason for searing is simply for taste and texture — most people like a crispy, caramelized exterior on their meat.

, After each side of the steak has been seared to the point that its exterior appears brown with crisp black areas, transfer your meat to a cooler area of the grill with your tongs. On a gas grill, this means moving the meat over a burner that's set to ""off"", while, on a charcoal grill, this means moving the meat over the side of the grill that contains no charcoal. While high heat cooking is great for searing the meat's outside, it's difficult to cook the meat all the way through over high heat without burning it. For this, low, steady heat is best, as it gives the inside of the meat a chance to catch up with the outside without burning the latter. Cook in this way for about 3 more minutes per side.


Keep the grill lid closed as you cook the meat over low heat to keep the heat of the grill from escaping.

, After searing both sides and allowing the meat to cook over low heat, your meat should be done. To make sure, test with a meat thermometer. Stick the pointed end of the thermometer into the thickest part of the meat. Ensure that the tip is not touching the grill surface, then wait for a temperature reading. Generally, a reading of 130o F (54.5o C) means your meat is cooked to a delicious medium-rare. Different readings can give different levels of done-ness, but you will want to take care not to remove any meat with a temperature of less than 120o F (49o C) or so, as undercooked meat can be unsafe to eat. Below are approximate temperatures for different levels of done-ness:120o F (49o C): Rare
130o F (54.5o C): Medium rare
140o F (60o C): Medium
150o F (65.5o C): Medium well
160o F (71.1o C): Well done

, If you don't have a meat thermometer, don't worry — it's still possible to test the meat for done-ness the old-fashioned way. As a general rule, the pinker the inside of your flank steak is, the less it has been cooked. Slice a thick section of the meat open to examine the inside. If the inside of your meat has a tougher texture than the outside, has a bright pink color, and/or has juices that don't run clear, your meat still needs to cook. If, on the other hand, the outside edges of the meat are brownish-grey while the inside retains a light pink color and the meat's juices run clear, you're ready to eat!


For well-done flank steak, cook until the meat is just barely pink or greyish-brown all the way through. Note that because flank steak is naturally somewhat tough and cooking a piece of meat to well-done can cause it to become even tougher, this isn't usually done.

, After you remove the meat from the grill, it should not touch any cutlery or plates that you used to handle it when it was raw. Either use entirely new serving utensils or wash the old ones thoroughly with soap and water before using them again. This prevents a condition called cross-contamination in which bacteria from the uncooked meat transfer to the cooked meat via unclean kitchenware. These bacteria can cause you to become seriously ill if ingested. Even death is possible, though it is exceedingly rare.In any case, you will definitely want to avoid cross-contaminating your flank steak with unclean utensils or plates, so be sure that you only touch your cooked meat with clean kitchenware.

, When you remove the meat from the grill to a platter, cutting board, or other serving surface, don't immediately cut into it. Instead, allow the meat to sit for 10-15 minutes. Cutting into the meat immediately causes the meat's internal juices to spill out onto your plate or platter, leading to a less juicy, flavorful cut of meat. On the other hand, allowing the meat to ""rest"" for a short time gives the moisture a chance to be re-absorbed by the meat's muscle fibers, making the meat ultimately more tender and moist. Since flank steak is somewhat tough by its very nature, it's extra-important to give it time to rest so that the meat is as tender as possible when you eventually bite into it.


To keep your meat warm while it rests, take a piece of aluminum foil and fold it over the meat like a tent. The foil helps retain the meat's internal heat, ensuring your first bite is still pleasantly hot even after the meat has rested.

, After it has rested, place the grilled flank steak on a cutting board. Examine the flank steak to determine the direction of its muscle fibers — there should be long, thin lines running in one direction on the surface of the steak. Use a sharp knife to cut the steak thin diagonal slices against the grain of the muscle fibers. In other words, cut the meat at a perpendicular angle to the lines on the surface of the meat.


Doing this help makes the meat as tender as possible. Much of the reason that flank steak is so naturally tough stems from the fact that its muscle fibers are fairly taught and strong. Cutting the meat against the grain severs the muscle fibers, releasing their hold on the meat and giving a more tender texture.

, Congratulations! Your flank steak should be ready to eat. If you desire, at this point, you may want to season the meat with salt and pepper or garnish with any extra ingredients of your choosing, though your meat should be mouthwatering as-is. Enjoy!


Your flank steak should serve roughly three people per pound, though, if they are very hungry, it may take up to one and a half pounds to serve three people.

Let the steak stand for 10 minutes at room temperature before eating.",How to Grill Sirloin Steak1," The sirloin is from the rear part of the beef, specifically the hip. Look for steaks that are marbled, where the white stripes of fat are interspersed evenly throughout the meat. Choose steaks with a light, bright red color, and pick steaks that are 1 inch (25.4 mm) to 1-1/2 inches (38.1 mm) thick.Ask the butcher to cut you a fresh steak if they all seem brown on the outside -- this means they have been sitting out in the air for too long.;
, Many people swear that a grilled steak, with a little salt and pepper, is one of nature's finest meals. Sirloins, though not extra tender, pack a lot of flavor even without seasoning. The real flavor comes from the interaction between the meat and the heat source. They only need a light searing on the outside to taste flavorful and juicy. Depending on your grill, you may get very different flavors from your steak:



Propane: Gas grills impart little additional flavor on the meat. They are, however, easy to control and get hot the quickest. You can adjust the temperatures with a simple knob, allowing you to perfect the cooking process to your liking, and they usually have attached thermometers.

Charcoal: Briquettes light up relatively fast and get hot quickly. They impart the ""classic"" BBQ flavor, with a hint of smokiness, but are a bit trickier to get to the right temperature.

Wood-fire: Wood chips, like hickory or oak, give the best natural flavor to the meat. However, they are harder to maintain and light, so many people use a mixture of charcoal and wood to get the best of both worlds., If you are using charcoal and/or wood this might take 30-40 minutes, until the briquets are covered in gray ash, but propane grills only take a few minutes to get hot. Aim to have the inside of the grill around 375°F by leaving the cover on as it heats.The thinner the steak, the hotter you want the grill:



3/4-1 inch thick: 360-400°F You shouldn't be able to hold your hand over the grill longer than 4-5 seconds.

1-1 1/2 inch thick: 325-360°F You shouldn't be able to hold your hand over the grill longer than 5-6 seconds., Most steaks are best with only a little bit of seasoning. Rub 1/2 tablespoon of both salt and crushed black pepper on both sides of the steak and let it sit at room temperature for 15-20 minutes while the grill heats.You want the steak to sit at room temperature so that it isn't cold when you put it on the grill-- this can cause the meat to contract and tighten up as it cooks.


Be liberal with the salt -- a nice crusting is perfect, but you should still be able to see the meat underneath.Bigger kernels of salt (course sea salt or kosher salt, for example) will caramelize the outside better, so avoid using fine table salt whenever possible., You want to sear the outside with nice, caramelized crust for the best texture and flavor. Slap the steak over the flame and then leave it alone, closing the top of the grill as it cooks.Resist the urge to poke, prod, or move it as it cooks.

, They should be dark brown when you flip them over. If they are black, the grill was too hot. If they are pink, the grill was not hot enough, so try and raise the heat or leave them over the flame for another 2-3 minutes. You can also turn them 45 degrees halfway through cooking to get the perfect cross-cut grill marks. For reference:



Medium rare steaks should be grilled for roughly 5 minutes a side.

Medium steaks should be grilled for roughly 7 minutes a side.

Well done steaks should be cooked for ten minutes on each side, then left on indirect heat to keep cooking.
Use tongs to turn the steak instead of a fork as piercing it causes the juices to drain out., Move the steak to another side of the grill, one without direct flame, and let it keep cooking until the inside is done to your liking. With a charcoal grill you can open or close the top vent to control the smokiness, closing it for smokier texture. You can use a meat thermometer to gauge the meat's internal cooking, or just estimate with time.



Rare: 130-135°F. Remove immediately after flipping each side.

Medium-Rare: 140°F. Sear each side for an extra minute or 30 seconds longer than you would for a rare steak.

Medium: 155°F. Let it continue cooking for an extra 1-2 minutes off of direct heat. Flip halfway through.

Well Done: 165°F Let the steak cook on indirect heat for 3-4 minutes, flipping halfway through., Press on the center of the steak with one finger. For medium steaks, it should have a give, similar to pressing on the center your palm. For medium-rare it will feel bouncy and spongy, like the pad right below your thumb., Tent a piece of aluminum foil over the steak let it rest before eating. This traps the flavors in the meat and leads to a better tasting steak."

",How to Cook Corned Beef and Cabbage,";
, For ease of cooking, you may simply want to buy a fresh brisket.

, Slice off large chunks of fat on the surface of the meat. Unless you are making pastrami with part of it, this will just turn to gelatin after cooking for several hours.

, Some chefs brine for 48 hours and others do it for 7 to 10 days before.


If you are cooking corned beef for the first time, you may want to start brining for less time and increase in the future.

, Add the following:


2 qts. (1.9l) of water, 1 cup of kosher salt and 4 tbsp. (20g) of pink curing salt #1. This is what gives corned beef its pink color. Using other salt will leave the flesh gray.
Pour in 1/2 cup (94.5g) of brown sugar, 2 bay leaves and 2 crushed cloves of garlic.
Mix in your pickling spices. You can use the recipe of your choice, but a good mix is 1 tbsp. (6.9g) of whole peppercorns, 1.5 inches of cinnamon sticks, 1 tbsp. (6.3g) of dill seeds, 1/2 tbsp. (2.7g) of hot red pepper flakes, 1/2 tbsp. (3g) of mustard seeds, 1/2 tbsp. (2.7g) of coriander seeds, 1/2 tbsp. (3g) of celery seeds, 1/2 tbsp. (2.7g) of ground ginger and 1/1 tbsp. (2.1g) of dried thyme leaves, 1 tbsp. (5g) of whole allspice berries and 1/2 tsp. (3g) of whole cloves.

,, Fill it with ice to cool it before brining the meat.

,, Try to remove excess air. Seal it well.

,, Allow it to come to room temperature.

,, Put the brined beef inside.

,,, Pour the salty water out. Repeat the process of placing the beef inside the stock pot and covering it with water.


This step is only necessary when you have brined the beef for a very long time. It reduces the saltiness of the corned beef, making it more palatable.

,, Cover the pot with a lid.

,


If a lot of steam is escaping, you may need to add warm water during the cooking process. The brisket should remain submerged the entire time.

, Chop a head of cabbage coarsely. Slice 2 onions.

,, Simmer for 30 minutes.

Rub a seasoning over the meat in place of salt and pepper.,
Soak the sirloin in a wet marinade to get moist, delicious flavor.,
Brush a pat of butter on top of the sirloin for steakhouse richness.,
Top your steak.",How to Grill Sirloin Steak2," Dry rubs add flavor to meat without ruining their tenderness, and are often sold as ""seasoned salts"" or ""steak seasonings."" You can also, however, make your own. Mix the following spices with 1/2 tablespoon salt and crushed black pepper, then massage the rub into both sides of the sirloin. Use equal parts of each spice, roughly 1-1/2 tablespoons, and don't be afraid to mix and match.


Onion powder, paprika, chili powder, and garlic powder.
Dried rosemary, thyme, and oregano, garlic powder.
Cayenne, chili powder, paprika, Mexican oregano, garlic powder.Brown sugar, chili pepper, paprika, garlic powder, and ground coffee, Wet marinades are only effective overnight, so don't make one at the last minute and expect a lot of taste changes. The acid in wet marinades (vinegar, lemon juice, etc.) breaks down some of the meat tissue, making the meat more tender.Too much acid, however, can ruin the texture and make a crispy grilled exterior impossible. Place the steaks in a bag with the marinade and leave them in the fridge overnight to get the best results.


1/3 cups of soy sauce, olive oil, lemon juice, Worcestershire sauce, plus 1-2 tablespoons garlic powder, dried basil, parsley, rosemary, and crushed black pepper.1/3 cup red wine vinegar, 1/2 cup soy sauce, 1 cup vegetable oil, 3 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce, 2 tablespoons Dijon mustard, 2-3 cloves minced garlic, 1 tablespoon ground black pepper.

, There is a reason that most steakhouse steaks come with a pat of butter on top. Butter seeps into the cuts of the meat and elevates it into the perfect entree. You can try making compound butter with spices and herbs as well to get a extra flavor. To make compound butter, mix 6 tablespoons butter with herbs in a food processor, then freeze the mixture until it is time to put on your steak. You can also heat it on low on the stove top and brush the melted butter and herbs on the steak when it is done.


1 teaspoon thyme, sage, rosemary, chopped.
2-3 cloves minced garlic
1 teaspoon chili powder, cilantro, and cayenne pepper.

, Most steaks can stand by themselves as delicious meals, but a well-chosen topping can make them even better. Things to try on top include:


Caramelized onions, peppers, or mushrooms.
Fried onions.
Blue cheese crumbles.
Sour cream.

",How to Cook Corned Beef," If you see it, buy it (and, optionally, trim the fat when you get it home) and skip ahead to cook it. It will typically come with a seasoning packet, which is typically very good, so all you'll need to add is vegetables! If you don't, and don't want to wait for St. Patrick's Day (or whenever, if at all, it may be ""in season"" locally), buy raw material to make your own.;
,, This section is usually not sold in supermarkets but it is more tender.

, Choose a large brisket, but keep in mind how big your roasting pan and pot are.


Briskets can weigh up to 18 lbs. (8kg). However, most people cook a brisket between 6 and 10 lbs. (2.7 to 1.5kg).

, It is good to have a little fat on the side, but large amounts of fat will turn to gelatin in the cooking process.


Excess fatty tissue will be soft and flakes off easily when cooked - much less unappealing than typical with beef.

, Everything that touches the salted meat should be either porcelain, stainless steel or glass.

,, You may use pink curing salt, which will give your corned beef a pink color, but it is artificially dyed and contains the chemical sodium nitrite. If you use a different type of coarse salt, the corned beef will be tan or brown.

, You can find your own recipe on the Internet or try the following spices:


Use 2 tbsp. (13.8g) whole peppercorns, 2 tbsp. (12.6g) of dill seeds, 1 tbsp. (5.4g) of hot red pepper flakes, 1 tbsp. (6g) of mustard seeds, 1 tbsp. (5.4g) of coriander seeds, 1 tbsp. (6g) of celery seeds, 1 tbsp. (5.4g) of ground ginger and 1 tbsp. (4.2g) of dried thyme leaves. Next, add 3 inches of cinnamon sticks, 4 bay leaves, 2 tbsp. (10g) of whole allspice berries and 1 tsp. (6g) of whole cloves.
You can also include spices like anise, cardamom, juniper berries or mace.

, Put your pot on a large burner. Place all of the following in 1 quart (0.9l) of very hot water inside the pot.


Start with 1 cup (189g) of brown sugar and 5 tbsp. (approx. 75g) of mixed pickling spices.
Add your salts. Use 4 tbsp. (20g) of curing salt #1 and 8 oz. (28g) of kosher salt.
Add 4 cloves of crushed garlic.

,, Place a bowl on top of it to weigh it down. It should be submerged by at least 1 inch (2.5cm).

,, It is curing during this time, so the longer you leave it in, the richer the flavor will be.

,, Your corned beef will be too salty if you don't rinse the brine away thoroughly. And the briny dripping beef will be messy.

, You will need to use it again to cook the beef.


Flush everything that comes in contact with brine very well with water to prevent corrosion over time. This includes the garbage disposal, if you poured the brine down the drain.
Do not allow brine to contact dissimilar metals for any length of time. They will corrode rapidly.

, This is most easily done in a clean sink. Flush the brine it had been in away.


If you corned your own, it should be rinsed by now, too.

, You can try to brown the fat side, too. Do not put the scorched bits on the pan in your stew: if you browned the meat in the cooking pot, set it aside to clean it out.


Corned beef's own distinctive cured ""hot-dog in steak form"" flavor will come out very well whether or not the surface is browned for that familiar additional flavor.

, If you'll cooking vegetables with it, a stew pot of at least 8 quarts' (liters') volume is best; bigger is better.


Big, inexpensive, thin pot bottoms don't spread heat well and tend to scorch a little spot. If you have to use one, use just a little heat to gradually bring it to a simmer, and keep it covered to stay hot with as weak a hot spot as possible. Use enough liquid that water can carry heat all around the meat, rather than the meat laying on the bottom under its own weight and scorching, and stir if you can. Or heat the pot evenly in an oven - at 300 degrees F (about 150 degrees C) until bubbling, then just around boiling to keep it cooking.

, Cover it with water. It should be submerged by 1 inch (2.5cm).


Place the lid on the pot. Turn the burner onto medium heat. Once it starts to simmer (make little bubbles here and there), let it do so for 30 minutes.
Do not allow it to boil, or it will get tough. It should remain at a simmer. Turn it down if it is boiling.
Remove the brisket from the pot. Pour out the water.

, Put the purchased and rinsed or homemade and pre-simmered beef in the pot and add sufficient water to have about an inch above and below it. Add the seasoning packet that typically comes with pre-corned beef, or herbs and spices of your own choosing (the typical flavor is like pastrami; search online for suggestions). Bring it back to a low simmer. Keep it at a simmer for a total of 3 to 4 hours.


A longer, slower cooking process can keep the beef even moister, firmer, and less friable as it tenderizes. Try several hours at 170 degrees F (not much cooler, to ensure bacteria are killed), as calibrated with a thermometer., Vegetables complement the meat - or rather, it should complement them for a healthy and environment-friendly diet as well as a tasty one. And a traditional one, as meat used to be very expensive!


Vegetables need not cook nearly as long as the beef. Add them toward the end of the cooking time to soften and absorb flavor without turning to mush. You can cut them while the beef simmers.
Vegetables contain a lot of water - add them and push down on the contents of the stew pot after it's returned to a boil for a while to see if more water is really needed before adding it, as it can dilute the flavors.
Suggested vegetables:

Cabbage. Cut one or two typical heads of cabbage into eight wedges each to complement a typical brisket with leaves that come apart into manageable bites. Add about 30 minutes before cooking is complete.
Carrots. Cut into little disks. Add about 1 hour before cooking is complete.
Onions. Dice. Optionally, sauté until translucent and lightly browned in spots but not mushy to develop flavor. Add about 30 minutes before cooking is complete - they don't need to soften much, but they contribute flavor to the broth as they soak.
Potatoes. Cut into largish bite-size chunks and add about 30 minutes before cooking is complete. Optionally, sauté them to brown the surface slightly (not enough to cook them through, which will toughen the surface) to enhance the stew's flavor.



, Turn the burner off. You can allow the vegetables to sit in the broth until you are ready to serve them.

, Cover the meat with aluminum foil. Let it rest for 10 minutes.

,, Ladle some of the broth onto the vegetables and meat.

, Corned beef is itself salty.
Black pepper. Goes well with delicate savory flavors.
Optionally, strong ""deli"" mustard or pungent horseradish to the meat.
Optionally, sour cream to the whole stew (popular with borscht).

Trim the fat.,
Consider marinading the meat.,
Sear the meat in a pan.,
Cook the bottom round roast in a large cooking pot, Dutch oven or slow cooker.,
Cook on a low heat for several hours.,
Add the vegetables.,
Remove the meat and prepare the pan juices.,
Serve the bottom round roast.",How to Cook Bottom Round Roast," Trim any excess fat from the outside of the bottom round roast. Some people prefer to leave the fat for flavoring, which is fine, but you will usually be adding enough seasoning that you will not miss the fat's contribution. Make several incisions in the roast with a sharp paring knife.;
, Marinading the meat for several hours before cooking will help to break down the tough meat fibers, leaving your roast more tender. However, this step is completely optional and can be skipped if you're short on time.


A marinade typically contains a fat, such as olive oil, an acidic substance, such as balsamic vinegar or lemon juice and a blend of herbs and spices. You can make your own marinade or buy one at the supermarket.
The roast should be placed in a plastic freezer bag and the marinade poured over, before the bag is sealed and left to sit in the fridge overnight, or for several hours before cooking.

, Season the meat well with salt and pepper, then heat some oil in a Dutch oven or large pan and brown the bottom round roast on all sides.


Before searing, you can also rub the surface of the meat with things like crushed garlic, fresh, chopped herbs and ground spices to add flavor -- what combination you use is a matter of personal preference.
Searing the meat is an important step for giving an attractive brown color to the meat, in addition to adding flavor, as natural sugars in the herbs and spices will caramelize on the surface of the meat.

, Any of these methods can produce a perfectly tender roast, so choose whichever method is convenient for you.


Regardless of which cooking vessel you choose, place a layer of chopped onions on the bottom and sit the meat on top.
Add liquid to the pot until it reaches 1/3 of the way up the side meat. This can be water, beef broth, vegetable stock, alcohol (wine, beer, whiskey or cider) or a combination of these.

, The most important point to remember when cooking bottom round roast is that you should cook it on a low heat for a long period of time — this melts the fat and breaks down the connective tissue inside the meat, leaving it flavorsome and fork tender. Cooking it on a high heat for a shorter period of time would result in a much tougher, drier piece of meat.



Oven: If you're cooking the roast in a Dutch oven, preheat the oven to 300 °F (149 °C) and slow roast the meat for 3 to 4 hours, depending on the weight. A 3 to 4 pound roast will typically take about 4 hours to cook — you'll know it's done when it reaches an internal temperature of 165 to 170 °F (74 to 77 °C).

Slow Cooker: If you're cooking the roast in a slow cooker, it will usually take about 7 hours on the ""low"" heat setting. Although you may prefer your beef cooked medium-rare, this doesn't allow enough time for the meat's connective tissues to break down and for the meat to become tender, so it's always better to cook round bottom roast until well-done.

Stove top: If you're cooking the roast on the stove top, you should use a heavy-bottomed saucepan and slowly simmer the meat over a low heat. Make sure to cover the saucepan to keep the meat nice and moist.

, Some people add vegetables to pot at the beginning of cooking, but this can result in mushy, overdone veg. Therefore, it's best to add any vegetables at the end of cooking time, to ensure that they are perfectly cooked.


Vegetables like potatoes, carrots, parsnips, turnips and beets all go well with bottom round roast, as they tend to soak up the flavor of the cooking liquid. However, you can also add more delicate vegetables such as mushrooms, green beans, beans or peas (though these require less cooking time).
Add the vegetables to the pot when the meat is almost done. You can test for this by sticking a skewer or the tines of a fork into the meat — when the meat is fully cooked, there should very little to no resistance.

, Once the meat is braised to perfection, it should have an internal temperature of 160 °F (71 °C) and be ready to fall apart with a little pressure from a fork.


Remove the meat from the cooking dish and set it aside to rest for 10 to 15 minutes, covered with foil. Use a slotted spoon to remove the vegetables from the dish, put them in a bowl and set them aside.
Pour the pan juices into a small saucepan — some bottom round roasts will produce a lot of liquid, others will just have enough for drizzling. Simmer the pan juices over a low heat. If you want to thicken the sauce, add some cornstarch; if you want to thin the sauce, add some beef broth, wine or water.

, Cut the roast by slicing it, or pulling it apart with a fork. Serve with the vegetables on the side and the pan juices/gravy drizzled over the top.


You can serve the beef with your favorite side dishes, such as mashed potato, turnip, hash browns or mustard greens.
To finish the dish, sprinkle with some fresh, chopped herbs such as flat leaf parsley, rosemary or thyme.

Consider buying a whole tenderloin or tenderloin in bulk.,
Purchase beef tenderloin labeled ""prime"" or ""choice"" for the best quality and flavor.,
Choose your cut of tenderloin with respect to how much extra trimming you'd expect to do before cooking.",How to Cook Beef Tenderloin1," Beef tenderloin is expensive, meaning the more that you buy, the better bang for your buck you'll get. Plus, beef tenderloin stores extremely well in the freezer, meaning any meat that you don't plan on using will keep until you next decide to treat yourself.


Try storing your tenderloin in a freezer-safe vacuum pack for ideal freshness. When you're ready to defrost your tenderloin, simply remove it from the freezer and let it thaw slowly overnight in your refrigerator.;
, The USDA grades some cuts of meat, in part to ensure certain safety standards are met, and in part to ensure that the customer knows what they're buying. While the grades depend on numerous factors — including marbling (the amount of fat interspersed in the muscle), maturity, and skeletal ossification — what's important to know is that beef labeled prime or choice are the two highest grades a cut of meat can get.From highest quality to lowest, the USDA beef grades go as follows: Prime, Choice, Select, Standard, Commercial, Utility, Cutter, Canner. Utility, Cutter, and Canner, while available, are rarely sold at retail and are mostly used as processed meat.

, Beef tenderloin comes either ""peeled,"" ""unpeeled,"" or as ""PSMO."" Each varietal requires different amounts of labor in order to prep the meat before cooking.


Peeled tenderloin comes with the fat removed, but the silver skin remaining. Silver skin is the rubbery, white connective tissue that's often on red meat.
Unpeeled tenderloin contains both fat and silver skin on the cut of meat. This is the least expensive cut of tenderloin, but also the hardest and most time-intensive to prepare.
PSMOs stand for ""peeled, silver skin removed, and side muscle on.""Because the butcher has already done most of the work for the chef, there's very little prep work involved on these cuts, although they do tend to be more expensive than the rest.

Inspect the tripe for cleanliness.,
Clean if necessary.,
Cut the tripe into a uniform thickness.,
Cut tripe into strips and parboil.,
Prepare a broth.,
Simmer one to three hours or until the tripe is tender.,
Save the stock.,
Make menudo.,
Add tripe to pho.,
Make a tripe-enhanced pasta dish.,
Incorporate the tripe into your own dish.",How to Cook Beef Tripe," Because tripe is made from the stomach of the cow, it can contain remnants of the cow's last meal, which you do not want to eat. Tripe is sold at butchers' shops in multiple varieties - ""green,"" ""cleaned,"" and, most commonly in North America, ""bleached.""Each variety of tripe requires different cleaning procedures, so it's important to know which of the following types of tripe you are working with before you start:










Green tripe is the stomach lining basically unchanged from the way it came out of the cow. As its name implies, it has a greenish or grayish color. It needs to be thoroughly emptied and cleaned before cooking (see below).

Cleaned tripe is tripe that has been rinsed and cleaned to remove the stomach contents. It's lighter in color and requires less preparation on your part in terms of cleaning and rinsing.

Bleached (or ""Blanched"") tripe is tripe that has been cleaned, then soaked in chlorine to kill germs, giving it a very pale color. It's the cleanest type of tripe you can buy, but, unfortunately, it must be rinsed several times to remove the strong chlorine odor and taste.;
, Depending on the condition of your tripe (see above), the precise cleaning process of your tripe will vary. Tripe from most butcher's shops should already be cleaned, but if yours isn’t or you've opted for organic, untouched tripe, you can clean the tripe in your kitchen with a few household ingredients:









Rub the tripe with rock salt, loosening any small undigested bits (or ""grit""). Rinse thoroughly with cold water. If necessary, use a clean toothbrush for hard-to-reach places. By doing this, you empty the stomach lining of any remnant pieces of partially-digested food. Repeat until you see no more grit.
Soak the tripe for one hour in a dilute solution made by mixing a tablespoon or two of hydrogen peroxide with enough water to cover the tripe (turning and squeezing the tripe occasionally). Hydrogen peroxide is a disinfectant and a bleaching agent.Discard the hydrogen peroxide solution and rinse the tripe thoroughly several times with water (squeezing as you do so). Trim edges that still appear unclean. The resulting tripe should be free from any obnoxious odor.
After soaking, scrape the interior of the tripe with a knife to remove the inner membrane. Stomach lining is a complex tissue - parts of it are good to eat, but other parts aren't. The interior membrane should be removed if it hasn't.

, Raw tripe can vary significantly in thickness across its length. Unfortunately, varying thickness in a piece of tripe can cause it to cook unevenly. Lay your piece of tripe flat and carefully look it over - if you see any sections that are particularly thick, use a sharp knife to make a ""butterfly"" cut, halving the thickness.








, Parboiling is process where a food is first boiled by itself to prepare it for cooking in another dish. Use a sharp knife to divide the tripe into thin strips or squares. Gather the strips and toss them into a pot of boiling salted water (2 Tbsp / 34g of salt per litre of water). Boil for 15-30 minutes. When you’re done, discard the water and rinse the tripe. After boiling, tripe should be noticeably softer - it's now ready to cook in a variety of dishes. Read on for standard instructions on flavoring.










Be sure to wash your hands after handling raw tripe, even if you've already cleaned it meticulously.

, Place the tripe in a pot and add herbs and vegetables to season (e.g. onion, carrot, celery, bay leaf, parsley, cloves, peppercorns). Cover with water and add a generous amount of salt. Bring the broth to a boil.










Here's your chance - let your creativity shine! The final flavor of your tripe depends on the contents of the broth you cook it in. Spice things up however you see fit - a few added peppers, for instance, can give your tripe a real ""kick,"" while some slices of ginger will give the dish an Asian influence.
Note that as long as there are enough ingredients to impart a substantial flavor, the proportions of stock are very flexible; feel free to add, modify, and remove ingredients to suit your own taste.

, When the broth reaches a boil, reduce the heat to a slow simmer. As the tripe cooks in its broth, it will gradually soften and absorb the broth's flavor. After about 90 minutes, start checking the consistency of your tripe every 10-15 minutes. Your tripe is ""done"" when it reaches your desired consistency.









Individual tastes vary on tripe's ideal consistency - some recipes will, for instance, recommend cooking for over four hours to give the tripe a very mushy consistency., The flavorful, aromatic stock leftover from simmering the tripe is perfect for adding that distinctive tripe flavor to another recipe. Alternatively, it can be used as a companion soup for your tripe dish. The two dishes will have similar flavors, so the soup will complement the tripe nicely.









If the tripe is tender but the stock is still thin, you can either continue cooking them together or remove the tripe and allow the stock to continue simmering on its own. By continuing to boil the stock, the water will slowly leave, concentrating the flavorful ingredients.

, Menudo is a hearty Mexican stew that incorporates tripe along with a variety of spices and, optionally, pigs feet! Incorporate Mexican spices into your broth - cilantro, lime, oregano, and plenty of red chili pepper, for starters - and serve with bread or tortillas so your guests can soak up the delicious, concentrated flavor.








, Pho is style of Vietnamese soup that's become hugely popular across North America in recent years. Pho dishes come in countless varieties, but tripe is a common ingredient. Add bean sprouts, ginger, fish sauce, basil, noodles, and any of your other favorite pho ingredients to your tripe broth!








, Tripe has a long history in European cuisine. To make a delicious pasta dish, prepare a big pot of richly seasoned tomato-based pasta sauce, then add your prepared tripe and simmer for several hours. Simply add this sauce to your al dente pasta - the softness of the tripe compliments the pasta's firmness perfectly.








, Tripe is very versatile, so once you're confident preparing and cooking tripe, test your new skills by crafting your own recipe. Possible dishes include tripe soup (made from the tripe stock you saved), tripe stew, as well as other dishes that veer away from the ""soupier"" recipes for tripe we've discussed, like breaded and fried tripe, and even tripe stir fry. Experiment to your heart's content!

Trim away excess fat and the silverskin from the tenderloin.,
Locate the membrane that holds the side meat (also called the ""chain"").,
Cut off the large section attached to the main keel, also called the chateaubriand.,
Cut the tenderloin in half with a chef's knife for easier handling (optional).",How to Cook Beef Tenderloin2," Again, if you want to make your life easier or you've never trimmed meat before, stick with PSMOs instead of buying your tenderloin unpeeled. The process of trimming can be quite tricky if you don't know what you're doing.


On a PSMO tenderloin, simply cut into the fat and/or silver skin. Lift up a piece with your hands and safely begin cutting away more as you continue to lift up the flaps of fat and silver skin with your fingers. Continue until all noticeable fat and silver skin has been removed.

, Cut the chain, which is fattier and tougher, off from the rest of the loin. Freeze and save for later.

, Wrap and save for later. The chateaubriand is a great piece of meat and can be used it any number of dishes.

, Do this especially if you've never cooked tenderloin before, or if you're only serving a few people. A whole beef tenderloin is about 6 pounds (2.72 kg), or enough for about 10 people.


Place one cut portion of tenderloin in the freezer or refrigerator to cook later. Again, tenderloin keeps very well as long as you thaw it slowly in the refrigerator.

Start with a long piece of butcher's twine.,
Bring your string under one side of the roast and drape the string over the top of the meat.

,
Tie a butcher's knot.,
With the remaining string, make a large loop with your hand.,
Wrap the loop under the tenderloin and tighten about an inch from the last loop.,
Make another loop with your hand and continue the process of looping and tying off.,
Flip the tenderloin over once the entire top side is trussed.

,
Going the opposite direction with your twine you went on the top side, start feeding the twine under and then over each loop.,
Wrap the twine under, then over and under again, until each loop has been tied off.

,
Finish with a butcher's knot on the top side of the tenderloin.",How to Cook Beef Tenderloin3," Butcher's twine is the best, easiest way to truss the tenderloin, although some heavy cotton cord — as used for kites — will do in a pinch.

,, Bring both pieces of string together and loop one string under the other twice. Tighten the string, then twist the pieces of string and tie a simple overhand knot.


Make sure that when you tie the butcher's knot, you leave enough rope at the end of your knot. You'll need a little bit of rope at the very end of the trussing process to tie both ends of the rope together.

, Do this by taking the string around your hand and then twisting your hand. A simple loop should form.

, Tighten the loop by tugging on the free line while holding the loop knot in place with one hand. Make sure that the loop knots are lined up in a relatively straight line.

, Loop and tie off in the same manner, separating each loop by about an inch, until you reach the end of the roast.

,, Wrap the string under one loop, then over and under again, working down the roast in a straight line.

,, Bring both ends of the rope together, loop one end underneath the other twice, and finish off with a simple overhead knot. Your roast is now officially trussed!

"
"
Salt your tenderloin generously, at least 40 minutes to an hour in advance of cooking.,
Allow the tenderloin to come to room temperature.,
Right before it's ready to start cooking, season your tenderloin with herbs and spices.,
Preheat your oven to 425° F (218° C).

,
While the oven is preheating, place a large skillet over medium-high heat on your stove.,
Sear each side of the roast until brown, approximately four minutes.,
Lay the tenderloin in a roasting pan and insert a cooking thermometer into the tenderloin.,
Cook the tenderloin in the preheated oven until the thermometer reads 125° F Fahrenheit (51.1° Celsius).,
Take the beef tenderloin out of the oven and let it sit for about 15 minutes before carving.,
Enjoy.

",How to Cook Beef Tenderloin4," Salting your meat brings moisture out to the surface, which is why you should never salt immediately before cooking, unless dry meat is your sort of thing.Salting far enough in advance fixed this problem:


When you salt far enough in advance, the salt gets a chance to enter back into the cut of meat. This process is called osmosis.This process, however, takes a while, which is why you should prepare enough in advance.

, If you've just bought the tenderloin, allow it to sit in a cool place on your counter. Meat that has been chilling in the refrigerator generally takes 30 minutes to an hour in order to come to room temperature. Meat that has come to room temperature takes less time to cook and generally turns out easier to cook, as the meat on the outside doesn't dry out before the meat on the inside gets a chance to cook through., What you do with your tenderloin is completely up to you. Suffice it to say that simple is often better than elaborate. Here are some different herb combinations that you can try out:


Chopped garlic, fresh thyme, fresh rosemary, crushed black pepper.
Coriander, cumin, clove, and nutmeg.
Curry powder, dry mustard, cayenne pepper, chopped garlic.

,, Pour a thin layer of vegetable oil in the heated skillet and wait for the oil to just start smoking.

, You're not trying to fully cook the tenderloin here, just give it a nice color and begin to develop some flavors on the outside. Remove the tenderloin from the skillet when searing is finished.

, The thermometer tip should be in the innermost portion of the meat.

, This process should take a little under an hour, depending on the thickness of the tenderloin. This temperature produces a medium rare tenderloin. If you prefer your meat less well done or more well done, consult this guide:


120° F (48.8° C) = Rare
130° F (54.4° C) = Medium rare
140° F (60° C) = Medium
150° F (65.5° C) = Medium well
160° F (71.1° C) = Well done

, The meat will continue to cook even after taken out of the oven. But most importantly, letting the meat rest will ensure a juicier tenderloin when you finally do cut into it.


Cooking meat causes its muscles to contract. This sends the juices toward the center of the meat. If you cut into the meat right after it's been removed from the oven, the juices will all run out because they're localized in one place. If you give the meat time to rest, however, the muscles relax and the juices disperse back into the whole cut of meat. Give your tenderloin at least 10 minutes of R & R for a much juicer experience.

For the most part, most roast recipes are very similar, only the spices and seasonings vary.;
, Before the meat begins the long process of slow cooking, it is best if you brown it first. The chemical process of meat browning is known as the ""Maillard Reaction"". If your slow cooker has a high heat function that can sear and brown brown meat, use that. Otherwise use a large pan or pot.


Put a few tablespoons of oil in the cooker or pot.
When the oil is hot it will look like it is shimmering.
Try to avoid splashing water in the oil to see if it is hot. This causes splatter.

, If your recipe calls for the meat to be seasoned before it is browned, you will want to do that. Even if seasoning isn't called for, you will also want to make sure that the meat is dry. Patting it with a paper towel will accomplish this.The surface of the meat being dry will help facilitate the Maillard Reaction and will lead to better browning.


If you recipe doesn't call for seasoning, you can still use a light dusting of salt and sugar.
A dusting of salt and sugar will also help a brown crust to form.

, Sear the meat in the hot slow cooker. You'll want to make sure that each side is browned.Browning each side of a large roast should take 15-20 minutes.If you seared the meat in a separate pot or pan, it is time to put the browned meat in the slow cooker.

, Review your recipe for the cooking time and temperature required. Set your slow cooker to these specifications. If your slow cooker doesn't allow you to set an end time, simply create a phone alarm for yourself so that you know when to turn it off.

If you were cooking a pot roast, all you need to do now is cut it and serve. If you were cooking a dish such as slow cooker tacos, you will now need to shred the beef with forks or other utensils.It should be soft and tender at this point.If you are formally carving a roast, you will want to let it sit at least 10 minutes before you cut into it.This keeps the meat juicy. You can cover it while you wait."

Make burgers.,
Grill steaks.,
Try grilling Kebabs.",How to Cook Beef1," Cooking burgers on a grill or barbeque is a great way to give your burger a little extra flavor. Be sure to choose a ground beef with your desired fat content, add your desired ingredients and spices, and form your patties before placing them on a hot grill. Depending on how thick your patties are, grilling burgers can be relatively quick. Grilling burgers will also allow you to cook at a higher volume than you would on a stovetop or oven.


Burgers can be cooked to any temperature, but they shouldn’t take more than 10 minutes per side no matter how done they are.
The more fat in your ground beef, the more flavor. Try starting with 80/20 fat to lean meat ratio.
You can even grind your own beef for burgers. Some butchers will even grind specific cuts for you.;
, Grilling steaks can be a great addition to a barbeque or cookout. Almost any cut of beef can be grilled on a barbeque and cooked to perfection. Choose whichever cut you prefer, from bone-in ribeyes to skirt steaks, season them with your desired spices and herbs, and place them on a hot grill.Cooking times on grill vary, especially between gas grills and charcoal grills. Use a meat thermometer in order to be certain of what temperature your steaks are.
Steaks will be medium rare at 145F, medium at 160F, and well done at 170F., Kebabs are great dishes to be served at parties. Kebabs generally consist of cubed meat and a series of vegetables all skewered and grilled. You can use wood or metal skewers when making kebabs, although metal skewers will retain heat and wooden skewers may burn. Choose a cut of meat or purchase beef that is already cubed. Cubed beef is often top sirloin cut into small pieces, but feel free to experiment and use any cut you like. Simply place the meat on the skewer, add vegetables if you wish, and season with your desired spices before placing them on a hot grill.


Kebabs will cook relatively quickly due to their size. Be sure to keep an eye on them so they don’t overcook or burn. You’ll generally only need to cook kebab meat around 2 minutes per side on a hot grill.

, Your hard work is pretty much over. Now you just need to wait for the duration of the cook time while the delicious smell of beef flows out of your slow cooker and through your house. If the recipe called for adding additional ingredients midway through the cook time, be sure to do that.


Some recipes call for occasional stirring. If so, be sure to do so., When the cook time is elapsed, you are almost ready to enjoy. If you were cooking a stew, all you need to do now is ladle it into bowls. If you were cooking a dish like a stroganoff, you will now need to serve the slow-cooked beef chunks and sauce over your noodles or rice.,"

Cook ground beef.,
Cook steaks and finish them in the oven.,
Try making burgers.",How to Cook Beef2," Ground beef is one of the most versatile cuts of beef. It can be used in a wide variety of styles and dishes. Knowing which dish you will be frying beef for will help determine the exact seasoning you will need. Place the beef and seasoning into the bowl and mix with your hands until the seasoning is fully incorporated. Place a skillet with oil over medium-high heat. Once the oil has heated place your ground beef in the skillet and stir it with a utensil, like a wooden spoon, spatula, or fork until brown. Break up any clumps of meat to ensure that all of the ground beef is cooked to the same temperature, will most likely be well-done.


Use seasonings like thyme, fresh garlic, rosemary, salt, and pepper for more European style dishes, like lasagna, shepherd's pie, bolognese.
Try adding spices like paprika, cayenne, chili powder, or fresh cilantro for latin style dishes, like tacos, Picadilo, or chillis.

, Preheat your oven to 350F and let it cycle for about 45 minutes. Season your steaks with your desired spices and begin to heat oil in a pan over medium-high heat. Once the oil is hot place one side of the steak down in the pan and sear for 2-3 minutes. Searing locks in the flavor of the steak as well as creates a “caramelized” or heavily flavored crust. If your steak is large or thick you may need to finish it in the oven. Some thinner steaks, like flank steak or skirt steak, can be cooked quickly just by searing.


Steak that come thicker or with edges that need to seared are T-bones, Porterhouses, New York strips, and Ribeyes.Let the steak rest on a cooling rack, cutting board, or plate for about 10 to fifteen minutes to let the steak finish cooking and reabsorb its juices.

, Burgers can be made on a stovetop as easily as they can be grilled. Choose a ground beef with your desired fat content, season well with spices and herbs, and form your patties. Heat a skillet with oil over medium-high heat and place the patties in once the oil is hot. Your cooking time will vary depending on what your desired temperature is and how thick the patties are.


A general rule is that patties that are 1 inch thick will take around 4-6 minutes a side to cook.
Make a stir fry. Stir frys can be an excellent source of protein and vegetables, and they are relatively simple and easy to cook. Many butchers already have beef cut to stir fry size, which can be anywhere from small cubes to thin slices. You’ll need to heat a walled skillet or wok with oil over a medium-high heat, then add your beef to brown quickly, followed by your vegetables and an accompanying sauce.
Add sauces like soy sauce and oyster sauce to give your stir fry even more flavor.
Beef in stir fries cook very quickly. Don’t worry about over cooking the beef as they will likely be well done regardless.

Place the beef in a walled roasting pan and place the pan in the oven.,
Calculate the roasting time by weight and temperatures.,
Check the temperature of the beef with a meat thermometer.,
Remove the beef from the pan and let it rest for 20 minutes.",How to Cook Beef3," Roasting is a classic and simple way to cook and prepare beef. However, not all cuts of beef will be ideal for roasting. Speak to your butcher or grocery employee about which cuts they have that would be good for roasting.


Rib roasts, rumps, and large chucks all make for great roasts.
Roast beef also makes great leftovers and can be used in sandwiches, so don’t be afraid of purchasing too much.

, Most roasts will need to cook at a steady temperature for a long period of time. Turn your oven to 350F and let cycle a few times. Cycling your oven, which is when the oven comes to temperature and then cools, will help you maintain a consistent temperature. The longer you let your oven preheat the more consistent the temperature will be.

, Take the beef and rub it with olive oil. Then sprinkle salt and pepper all over the cut of beef. You might even add fresh herbs to your seasoning, like fresh rosemary and thyme.

, Walled roasting pans will be slightly easier to handle and will also distribute the heat conducted in the oven more evenly. Place your roast in the middle of the pan, with the fat side up if applicable.

, Beef, unlike poultry or pork, can be safely eaten in a range of cooking temperatures. Each temperature will depend on weight and whether or not the cut is “bone-on,” or has the bone attached. A general rule for cooking beef to a temperature of medium rare, the most common temperature, is 30 minutes per pound of meat. For example, a 5.5 pound rib roast would take approximately 2 hours and 45 minutes in an oven at 350F to be medium rare.


Cooking temperatures for beef are as follows: Rare (130F), Medium Rare (145F), Medium (160F), and Well Done (170F).There are also many meat timers available online where you can calculate roasting times based on weight and cut of meat, like at BBC Good Food., Meat thermometers are useful tools to have when roasting beef as their probe allows you to take the internal temperature of the beef. Measure the internal temperature of the roast once you are getting closer to its calculated cook time. Simply take the probe of the thermometer and stick it in the center of the roast. Push the thermometer approximately half way into the roast and wait until you get a reading.


Medium rare reads at 145F, medium at 160F, and well done at 170F.If your beef is undercooked, place it back into the oven and check the temperature every 10 to 15 minutes to avoid overcooking it.

, Remove the beef and place it on a cooling rack, cutting board, or serving platter to let rest. Cover the roast in foil and wait 20 minutes before uncovering and serving. Letting the roast rest will allow the roast to finish cooking and reabsorb the juices it lost from the heat of the oven.

",How to Cook Beef4," A general rule with slow cooking is to cook a cut that is too tough to be grilled or cooked on a stovetop. Most of these cuts tend to be cheaper and often come in larger portions. The more popular slow cooking cuts are brisket and chuck pot roasts. Braised and slow cooked meats also keep and reheat well, so don’t be worried about purchasing more than you can eat in one sitting.Ask your butcher for slow cooking beef recommendations. Some other popular cuts are beef shoulder, short ribs, and bottom round steaks., Preheat your oven to 325F and let it cycle for around 45 minutes. Cycling will give your oven a consistent temperature. You want a relatively low temperature so that the fat and sinew in the beef can breakdown and become tender., Slow cooking can also call for using other spices, herbs, and liquids than are normally used when grilling or searing. A classic combination when braising beef is to use salt and pepper, fresh rosemary, thyme, and sage, and a little red wine and beef stock. Place these ingredients in a high walled pot, preferably a dutch oven. If you don’t have a dutch oven or a high-walled pot with a lid, you can purchase cheap aluminum roasting pans from most supermarkets., The only draw back about braising and slow cooking is in its name, its slow. However, the one benefit to slow cooking is that you don’t have to worry about over cooking the meat. Instead, let the beef cook for around 3 hours, checking on it occasionally. Press the prongs of a fork into the meat and gently pull. If the meat is fork tender the beef should be able to fall apart with minimal effort. If the meat is still tough, leave it to cook for another hour or so.,"

Identifying the best cuts of meat for roasting is integral to a successful roasting. Roasts that have connective tissue or little marbling don't generally roast well. Look for cuts of beef that come from the rib, short loin or sirloin section of the steer. These parts of the animal are found between the front and hind legs along the top portion of the animal. Cuts of roast from these areas are more tender and flavorful than other cuts and tend to roast well.
Rib, top sirloin, tri-tip roasts and the tenderloin all make excellent roast choices. Beef tenderloin comes from directly under the spine and so is the least worked muscle on the animal's body, resulting in the tenderest beef. Most people choose this cut of beef over any other but it pales in flavor compared to a rib roast.;
,


More beef choices are available to consumers in terms of how the cattle were raised. If labeled ""natural"" there can be no artificial ingredients in the beef and it must be minimally processed. ""Organic"" beef comes from cattle that has been raised as per government organic certification standards. Organic cattle must have been raised without hormones or antibiotics and must have been fed a 100 percent organic diet. Conventional supermarket beef is neither labeled as organic or natural and comes from mass-raised cattle, which may have been injected with hormones and antibiotics.

,


In the United States there are 3 grades of beef available to consumers; prime, choice and select. Beef is inspected and labeled accordingly depending on the amount of marbling in each cut. Only about 3 percent of beef is labeled as ""prime,"" 57 percent is labeled as ""choice"" and the rest is labeled as ""select."" ""Select"" is what is most commonly found in supermarkets; the higher the grade of beef, the higher the price.

,


Roasts can come in a variety of sizes. You want to select the roast size that will produce your required number of servings. A good rule of thumb is boneless roasts will yield 2 6 oz. (170 g) servings per 1 lb. (450 g) of cooked meat. A bone-in roast will yield between 1 and 1 1/2 6 oz (170 g) servings per 1 lb. (450 g) of cooked roast, so select your roast size accordingly.

,


Once you've determined which cut of meat you want, whether it is natural, organic or standard, the grade of meat and the size of the roast then you're ready to purchase it and take it home to roast.

When your beef joint is 5 degrees away from the desired temperature of doneness, remove it from the oven.,
Let it rest.",How to Cook Beef Joint," Tender cuts of meat, like sirloin and fore rib, are better for roasting, while leaner cuts of meat, like topside and silverside, are better for braising.;
, When purchasing beef, make sure the meat is a deep, dark red. Look for beef containing little streaks of fat throughout leaner muscle, and with an outside layer of firm, creamy-white fat.It should also be slightly sticky with a little resistance when pressed.

, Fat is essential to a moist and flavorful beef joint. You want to buy a beef joint that has a thick layer of fat on it. The fat will melt during the cooking process, infusing your beef joint with moisture and lots of flavor.


If your beef joint does not have a layer of fat on top, which is likely with a joint of silverside, ask the butcher to secure fat to the meat.
Like beef fat, beef bones will also impart rich flavor to your meat. If you purchase a boneless beef joint from a butcher, you can ask for beef bones to tuck under the beef joint when cooking.

, Topside is a boneless, tender cut of meat that comes from the inner thigh muscle of a cow.It’s a lean cut of meat, which means it doesn’t have much fat inside; but it does have a layer of fat on one side that melts during cooking, keeping the meat moist. It’s ideal for roasting, but also cooks well braised as a pot roast, and in stews, casseroles and pies.

, It’s similar to the topside, except leaner. It’s more affordable than other cuts of meat; however, cheaper cuts of meat are not as tender once cooked. To keep this from happening to your silverside, it needs to be braised in liquid. You can also have it “barded,” if buying from a butcher, which means thin layers of beef fat are placed on top of the silverside to keep it moist while cooking., It can easily be split into rib-eye steaks after cooking to serve several people. It’s great for roasting on the bone, which imparts great flavor; and it has a thick layer of fat to keep it moist while cooking., It is just as tender as rib of beef, but leaner and costlier. Bone-in sirloin will impart more flavor, so look for a sirloin joint on the bone, or sirloin with undercut, which is the same as the sirloin joint, but with the tender fillet attached.If you’d prefer your sirloin boneless, look for a striploin, rolled sirloin, or rolled sirloin with undercut., Take your beef joint out of the refrigerator thirty minutes before cooking. It needs to be room temperature before cooking in order to cook evenly. A general consensus for the amount of beef you should prepare to make sure you have enough (and even some leftovers) is about 5-6lbs per 6-8 people., Season your beef joint simply with salt and pepper. Don’t season with too much salt because salt can draw out the juices and dry out your meat.


If your beef joint is a leaner cut, like topside or silverside, rub it with olive oil before seasoning. If it already has a layer of fat on top, you don’t need to drizzle it with olive oil at all.
Some people remove the layer of fat after roasting. But if you like the taste of beef fat, and plan on eating it, sprinkle it with a teaspoon each of English mustard powder and plain flour. This will give it a nice crispy texture.

, The amount of vegetables you add to your dish depends on taste preferences. For roasting, adding an assortment of vegetables is optional. But they should be included when braising, since the vegetables will lend additional flavor to your beef joint during the slow cooking process.


If you’re roasting your beef joint and prefer to let the taste of the beef shine, simply cut a small onion in half to tuck under the meat.
For an added depth of flavor, wash and chop 2 medium onions, 2 carrots, 2 sticks of celery, and a small bunch of herbs, such as fresh thyme, rosemary, bay or sage. Break apart 1 bulb of garlic into cloves. Don’t worry about peeling them.You’ll place the vegetables in the bottom of your cooking dish, and then sit the beef joint on top.

, Use this time to also prep your roasting pan and find a timer.

, Fill the bottom of a roasting pan with either one small onion cut in half, or an assortment of chopped vegetables, garlic and herbs. If you do the assorted vegetables and herbs, drizzle them with olive oil. Then set the beef joint (fat side up) on top.

, Insert an oven-safe meat thermometer into the middle of your beef joint, making sure the thermometer is not touching bone. Set the pan of beef in the oven just above the center, and allow it to cook at the initial temperature of 475°F. Set your timer for 20 minutes. When your timer goes off, turn down the temperature of the oven to 375°F.

, The temperature it reaches and the amount of time you let it cook depends on how well done you prefer your meat.


If you’d prefer your meat rare, with a bright red center, allow it to continue roasting for an additional 20 minutes per pound. Add an additional 15 minutes for medium rare, or an additional 30 minutes for well-done, to the total cooking time calculated for a rare roast.
For rare, it must reach a temperature of 120 to 125°F. For medium rare it must reach 130 to 135°F. For medium, 140 to 145°F. For medium well, 150 to 155°F. For well done, 160°F and up.Because the temperature of meat can rise 5 to 10 degrees during rest time, take it out of the oven 5 degrees before it reaches the desired temperature of doneness.

, At least three times during the cooking process take the meat out of the oven to baste. Make sure to close the oven door each time you do so to keep the oven hot. To baste the beef joint use a baster, which is a large plastic suction, to suck up the juices of the beef. Carefully squirt the hot liquid all over the beef. If you don’t have a baster, you can use a large spoon. You may have to tip the roasting pan a little to scoop up the juices.

, Lightly cover your roasted beef with foil paper and let it rest for at least 15 minutes and up to an hour before serving. As the meat relaxes, it will reabsorb its juices, ensuring your meat is juicy and full of flavor when served.

, Take out a large casserole pot and warm it over medium high heat.

, When the meat is room temperature and your large casserole pot is hot, add a teaspoon of oil to the pot and brown your beef joint for about 3 to 4 minutes per side. Remove it from the pot once all sides are browned.

, Sprinkle with salt and pepper to draw out the onion’s juices, and stir to keep the onions from sticking to the bottom of the pan. Then add the rest of your vegetables, garlic and herbs. Sprinkle with salt and pepper, and let the vegetables cook for 4-5 minutes.

, Add 3 cups of either chicken or beef broth to the pot and stir. Taste the liquid to see if it needs additional salt and pepper. You’ll want to make sure your broth has enough salt because without it your roast will lose flavor. The broth will keep your beef joint moist while cooking.

, To ensure your meat is cooked to your desired level of doneness, insert a meat thermometer directly into the center. Don’t let the thermometer touch bone. Then cover with a top.

, After 30 minutes reduce the oven heat to 300 °F (149 °C), and set a timer to allow the beef joint to cook for an hour and a half.

, Check your thermometer to see if your beef joint is close to the temperature of your desired level of doneness. For rare, it must reach a temperature of 120 to 125°F. For medium rare, 130 to 135°F. For medium, 140 to 145°F. For medium well, 150 to 155°F. And for well done, 160°F and up.

, As your beef joint rests, its temperature will increase 5 to 10 degrees. Cover it loosely with foil paper, and allow it to rest for at least 15 minutes before slicing and serving.

Preheat your oven.,
Place your meat in a roasting pan.,
Roast the meat in the oven.,
Check the roast’s temperature.,
Take the roast out of the oven.",How to Cook a Roast in the Oven1," For smaller and more tender cuts of meat, set your oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit (204 Celsius) or higher to cook it through more quickly. For bigger cuts, stick to moderate temperatures (around 375 degrees F, or 191 C) or even lower to ensure that the interior cooks evenly without burning the outside.If you have a lot of patience, stick to temps around 250 F (121 C) for even juicier meats.The ideal temperature may vary by oven, meat, and size, but use the following as a flexible guideline:325 degrees F (163 degrees C): Beef: round tip; rump; bottom round; eye round; brisket. Poultry: whole turkey. Pork: loin; crown; shoulder/butt; back ribs; spare ribs; ham; fresh leg. Veal: loin; rib. Lamb: leg; shoulder; shank.

350 degrees F (177 degrees C): Beef: rib eye. Poultry: whole duck; whole goose; whole pheasant; game hen; turkey breast. Pork: country-style ribs.

375 degrees F (191 degrees C): Poultry: whole chicken.

400 degrees F (204 degrees C): Poultry: chicken breast.

425 degrees F (218 degrees C): Beef: tenderloin; tri-tip. Pork: tenderloin.;
, Use a pan that is specifically designed for roasting. Cook your meat more evenly by using a pan with sides that are low enough to expose more meat to direct heat. However, make sure the sides are high enough to prevent drippings from spilling upon removal or during roasting.You can also place a roasting rack or wire cooling rack inside the pan to hang fattier meats that drip excessively during roasting.

, Wait until the oven reaches the set temperature. Transfer the pan to the oven. Let it sit for the recommended cooking time. Open the oven door as seldom as possible to prevent heat from escaping, which will prolong cooking.Exact cooking times may vary according to temperature and the amount of meat, but use the following as a guideline (note that 1 lb. = 0.45 kg):Beef: Bottom round (3 to 4 lbs); medium-rare, 1.5 to 2 hours. Brisket (2.5 to 3.5 lbs) well-done, 2.5 to 3 hours. Eye round (2 to 3 lbs); medium-rare, 1.5 to 1.75 hours. Rib eye (3 to 4 lbs); medium-rare, 1.5 to 2 hours; medium, 1.75 to 2 hours. Round tip (3 to 4 lbs); medium-rare, 1.75 to 2 hours; medium, 2.25 to 2.5 hours. Rump (3 to 4 lbs); medium-rare, 1.5 to 2 hours. Tenderloin (2 to 3 lbs); medium-rare, 35 to 40 minutes; medium 45 to 50 minutes. Tri-tip (1.5 to 2 lbs); medium-rare, 30 to 40 minutes; medium, 40-45 minutes.

Lamb: Leg (5 to 7 lbs); medium-rare, 20 to 25 minutes per pound; medium, 25 to 30 minutes per pound (plus 5 minutes for boneless cuts). Shoulder and shank leg (3 to 4 lbs); medium-rare, 30 to 35 minutes per pound; medium, 40 to 45 minutes per pound.

Pork: Ribs: 1.25 hours covered, 0.75 hours uncovered. Tenderloin: 0.75 to 1 hour. All other cuts: roughly 20 minutes per pound.

Poultry: Chicken breast (2 lbs); 35 to 45 minutes. Game hen (1 to 1.5 lbs); 1 to 1.5 hours. Turkey breast (2 to 4 lbs); 2.5 to 3 hours. Whole chicken (3 to 4 lbs); 1.5 to 2 hours. Whole duck (3.5 to 4 lbs); 2 hours. Whole goose: (7 to 9 lbs); 2.5 to 3 hours. Whole pheasant (2 to 3 lbs); 1 to 1.25 hours. Whole turkey (8 to 12 lbs); 2.75 to 3 hours.

Veal: Loin (3 to 4 lbs); 1.75 to 2.25 hours. Rib (4 to 5 lbs); 1.5 to 2.25 hours.

, Once the roast has cooked for the minimum amount of recommended time, use an oven mitt to pull the rack partially out of the oven so you don’t have to reach inside. Stick a meat thermometer into the roast to read its internal temperature.If the thermometer reads lower than the ideal temperature for your specific meat, push the rack back in, shut the door, and allow more cooking time before repeating.


Pierce the roast with your thermometer where the meat is thickest to make sure that the densest part of your roast has cooked thoroughly. Avoid piercing fat and bone.
With whole birds, check the meat’s temperature in fives places: the deepest part of the breast, thighs, and wings. With the thighs and wings, center your thermometer close to where they meet the body.
Recommended temperatures are 165 degrees Fahrenheit (74 degrees C) for poultry and 145 degrees Fahrenheit (63 degrees C) for beef, lamb, pork, and veal., First, make sure you have a clear path from the oven to the surface area where you plan to set the hot pan. If the stovetop is occupied by other cookware, use the nearest countertop possible to place your trivet so you have the shortest distance to cover. Put on some oven mitts, open the oven, and pull the rack out until you can safely grip the pan with both hands. Carefully transfer the pan to the stovetop or trivet. Move slowly and cautiously to avoid spilling hot juices over the sides of the pan.

Know about regional certifications for food.,
Find venues for natural beef.,
Look for additional specific labeling on foods from your selected venues.,
Verify labeling.,
Assess logistics for buying and using natural beef products.",How to Buy Natural Beef," One of the first steps in buying natural beef is knowing what the labels on your food mean. These labels, and the meanings behind them, vary from country to country. Understand how your country labels food in order to buy the best and most natural products on the commercial market.


In the end, food that is sold in commercial markets is only as good as the actual regulations enforced by the countries in which they are sold. That means when you go to your local supermarket, a label doesn't mean anything unless your country's leadership has effectively regulated the food according to the label. In order to know how this works, you'll need to research the applicable governmental departments that deal with food safety in your country of residence.;
, Some smaller commercial shops may sell natural beef products, and other noncommercial markets often sell local, unprocessed natural beef cuts. Find a selection of markets near you that sell natural beef products.


Often, small open markets around the world facilitate the buying of natural, local beef and other foods from local farmers to bypass the commercial process and sell their products directly to consumers. Look for these small open markets in your area for a chance of finding the freshest, most natural food products locally on market.

, No matter where food is sold, whether it is a quality shop or an open market, there is no guarantee that it will be natural. In order to buy natural beef, look for specific labels that will prove its lack of processing or alteration.


Look for non-antibiotic labeling. Beef that has not been treated with antibiotics will clearly display this fact on the packaging, in many cases.
Look for proof of the animal being fed a natural diet. For beef cattle, this means grass. Grass is the natural diet for cows and steers, but many farmers choose to feed corn, which lessens the natural quality of the meat. Look for proof of grass-fed beef products.

, Do additional research to make sure that farmers are telling the truth about their products. In some cases, the consumer may be able to visit the farm to make sure that the labels on food are correct.

, One of the things that buyers don't often think about is that without effective logistics, the products they buy are useless. Make sure that you have a strategic plan for purchasing and using perishable beef products.


Provide for transportation of meat products. This is especially important if you are buying natural beef in bulk. Many people buy in bulk as part of food co-ops, and for these kinds of purchases, transportation is a very essential factor.
Consider long-term storage for natural beef products. Usually, this consists of freezing the meat for later use. Assuring that you have freezer space is another important part of providing logistics for these purchases.

Choose your ribs.,
Remove the membrane.,
Dry brine the meat.,
Choose your spice rub.,
Rub spice rub into the ribs.,
Prepare your grill.,
Cook the ribs.,
Add barbecue sauce.,
Remove ribs from the grill.",How to Cook Ribs1," There are two different kinds of ribs: baby back (or loin-back) and spare ribs. Baby back ribs are smaller, usually 2-2.5 pounds per rack, more tender, and more expensive. Spare ribs are larger, usually 4-5 pounds per rack, less expensive, meatier, fattier, and more flavorful.When choosing a spare rib, look for evenly spaced fat. Don't choose a spare rib that has a large fat deposit in one place. Even marbling yields better flavor. For baby back ribs, it should be the same size along the bone with a even marbling of fat.Most people prepare St. Louis style spare ribs, which are just spare ribs with the ends and other gristly bits chopped off.When you buy spare ribs, you can ask your butcher to make them St. Louis style for you.;
, Rinse the ribs first, getting rid of any extra meat, fat, or bone particles. Then, turn the ribs over. Slide a dull knife or your fingers under the membrane and pull it back where it connects to the bone. Lift and loosen it until it tears. Pull the membrane away from the bones until it is completely removed. Trim the fat away from both sides.Removing the membrane will allow the ribs to tenderize.Some people, however, claim that the membrane doesn't make the ribs less tender and even prefer the ribs cooked with the membrane still in tact.Try cooking both ways to choose for yourself.

, Salt is important when making perfect ribs. The salt amplifies the flavors, helps the meat retain moisture, and helps you gain the crust on the top of ribs (called bark).Use 1/4 teaspoon of salt per pound of meat. Leave the salt on the meat for at least 1-2 hours.

, Most spice rubs are a mixture of spicy and sweet flavors.Traditional southern spice rubs include smoked paprika, chili powder, brown sugar, black pepper and salt. Mix the spices together in a small bowl.


Spice rubs are extremely versatile. Choose flavors that suit your palette. You can add paprika, chili powder, brown sugar, cumin, dry mustard, garlic powder, onion powder, cayenne pepper, red chili pepper flakes, premade Cajun seasonings, cinnamon, nutmeg - just about anything you prefer. Decide if you want a sweet or spicy rub, and adjust the amounts of spices accordingly.
You may prefer a marinade instead of a spice rub. These marinades can include mustard, liquid smoke, apple juice, hot sauce, or ketchup. Most traditional recipes tend to favor spice rubs over marinades.

, Make sure to coat both sides of the ribs, pressing the spices into the meat with your fingers. Don't coat the ribs so thickly that you can't see the meat through the spices. When you've coated your ribs, wrap the ribs in plastic wrap. Place them on a cookie sheet, then refrigerate for 12 hours.


Try brushing on a layer of vegetable oil before you rub in the spice rub. This helps the spices absorb into the meat better, and it helps the meat crisp into that desired ""bark"" on the outside of the ribs.

, The next day, get the grill ready about an hour before you plan on cooking the ribs. Allow the grill to heat before you begin, aiming for a temperature of 225 degrees Fahrenheit.


The secret to grilling ribs is indirect cooking. If you have a charcoal grill, place the charcoal on one half of the pit, so that your ribs can be cooked by indirect heat on the portion without the briquettes. Place a water pan directly above the heat source; this helps the smoking process by keeping the meat tenderized. Cook your ribs under the exhaust vent, which should be open.If you have a gas grill, turn on only the outside burners; this leaves the center burner or two unlit so the ribs can cook indirectly. If you have two burners, only light one. You will cook the meat on the side of the grill that does not have the burners on. Your dial will probably be set at 175 degrees. Use a cooking thermometer to monitor your temperature to ensure a steady 225 degrees. Let the grill warm up slowly; never turn the grill on high heat. You can place the ribs on a cooking rack and place a pan of water underneath the ribs to help keep them moist.

, When your grill has heated to 225 degrees, place the ribs on the side of the grill that is not directly above the coals. Allow them to cook for 2 to 4.5 hours, depending on how big your ribs are. Baby back ribs will need less time than spare ribs.


There are different ways you can cook ribs. You can stack ribs, placing two slabs on top of one another. You need to rotate the ribs at least twice, switching the placement of the ribs. This should be done every 40 minutes or so.You can also use a rib rack. When using a rib rack, add at least 30 minutes to your cook time due to how close the ribs are when cooking. You can also cook them by laying them out flat. If you only lay one slab of ribs on the grill, there is no need to flip them. Just switch the placement of the slabs, moving the one closest to the coals or burner farther away while moving the one that was far away closer.Add pre-soaked wood chips to the barbecue pit along with the charcoal if desired. Hickory, mesquite and other chips will create a smokier flavor in the meat.
To get the smoky wood chip flavor with a gas grill, place wood chips in a smoker box. If you don't have a smoker box, make a smoker pouch out of aluminum foil and place it on top of one of the burners. Turn that burner on maximum heat and close the lid before you place the ribs on the grill. When the chips start smoking, turn the burner down and place the ribs on the grill. Make sure the temperature is 225 degrees.If you don't want to add a pan of water under the ribs, spritz the ribs with apple juice or apple vinegar with every half hour to help retain moisture.

, Slather barbecue sauce on them using a brush. Opinions vary on when you should add the sauce. Some suggest adding sauce after an hour of cooking,while others say do it during the last fifteen minutes. If you do it during the last fifteen minutes, move it over directly over the coals so the sauce can caramelize.Don't over-sauce. You want to enhance the flavor, not cover up the taste of the pork and the spice rub. If you want more sauce, add it at the table. Use one or two coats of sauce, no more.

, Allow them to set for 15 minutes. Separate the ribs with a knife and serve.

Choose which meat to roast.,
Check the meat’s grade.,
Season your meat.,
Let the meat cool before carving.,
Store meat safely.",How to Cook a Roast in the Oven2," Decide on one of the three most common meats to roast: ham, prime rib, or turkey. Or, break away from the norm and choose either beef, lamb, poultry, pork, or veal. Available cuts of meat include:Beef: bottom round; brisket; eye round; rib eye roast (with or without bone); round tip; rump; tenderloin; tri-tip.

Lamb: leg (with or without bone); shank leg; shoulder.

Pork: crown; ham; loin; ribs; shoulder/butt; tenderloin.

Poultry: chicken breast; rock cornish game hen; turkey breast; whole chicken; whole duck; whole goose; whole pheasant; whole turkey.

Veal: loin; rib.

, Once you have chosen which type of meat to roast, decide which grade of meat to purchase. Choose “prime” for the highest quality, which includes more fat marbling within the meat and thus more flavor. Go with “choice” for a less expensive cut that still has a fair amount of fat throughout the meat. Pick “select” to save money and/or reduce your fat intake., Keep it simple and rub your roast evenly with salt and pepper. Or, create a more diverse seasoning mix for more complex flavors. To season the inside as well as the outside, marinate your meat for two days before roasting. Flip the meat over at regular intervals to make sure it is evenly marinated. Choose one of the following recipes or pick one of the many, many others to be found online:



Beef seasonings: 1 teaspoon salt, ¼ teaspoon pepper, ⅛ teaspoon garlic powder for each pound of meat.Chicken seasonings: 1 ounce melted butter, ⅓ teaspoon minced garlic, 1 teaspoon salt, ¼ teaspoon pepper, ⅛ teaspoon garlic powder, rosemary and/or thyme to taste, for each pound of meat.Lamb marinade: ¼ cup fresh rosemary, 2 tablespoons dijon mustard, 2 tablespoons olive oil, 1 teaspoon soy sauce, 1 cup beef broth, 1 chopped garlic head, 1 chopped onion for 6 to 10 pounds of meat.Pork seasonings: 1 teaspoon garlic salt and ¼ teaspoon of black pepper for each pound of meat., After you remove the meat from the oven, let it rest before carving. Give the meat time to reabsorb the juices inside so they don’t spill out when you carve it open. Allow thinner cuts at least 10 minutes to cool. Give thicker cuts a minimum of 20 minutes, since their core may still be hot enough to continue cooking the meat from the inside out. After that, transfer the meat to a carving board to slice it up. , Refrigerate or freeze your leftovers no more than two hours after it has finished roasting. Halve that time to one hour if the room temperature exceeds 90 degrees Fahrenheit. If you have a lot of meat left, distribute it into multiple small, airtight containers so that the contents cool off more quickly.Roasted meat will last three to four days in the refrigerator and two to six months in the freezer.

Finished.

",How to Cook a Roast in the Oven3," If necessary, bundle your meat with twine to maintain its shape during roasting. This is most commonly needed for whole birds. Either ask your butcher to truss your meat for you, or buy butcher’s twine, which is safe to use with food products and available at grocery and cookware stores, as well as online.Use square knots or slip knots to tie a separate length of twine into a knot every inch along the entire length of the meat., Prevent the outside surface of your roast from drying out while the interior finishes cooking. Collect the juices and drippings that have pooled at the bottom of the pan, using a basting brush, bulb, or spoon. Pour the liquid over the meat the top of the meat to rehydrate its exterior. Repeat every 15 to 30 minutes., If frozen or refrigerated, allow your meat to defrost to room temperature before beginning. Season it as desired and give its surface time to dry. Line a skillet with just enough cooking oil to cover its surface and preheat it over medium-high heat until the first signs of smoke appear. Place the meat into the skillet. Let each side of it to sear until it has browned to a crust. Avoid moving the meat repeatedly or unnecessarily., Line your roasting tray with a light amount of cooking oil to prevent your vegetables from sticking. Then add your favorite veggies to the tray. Spray them lightly with cooking oil. Place your meat on top of them. Check your veggies periodically during the roast to make sure they aren’t sticking or burning to the pan. Moisten them with the meat’s drippings or add just enough water to the pan to slick its surface., Place your meat in an oven roasting bag to trap heat for quicker roasting times. First, pour roughly a tablespoon of flour inside, twist the opening shut, and give the bag a few shakes so the flour lines all of the inside. Insert the meat and seal the bag with a twist-tie. Poke a few holes in the bag so steam can vent as the meat roasts.Only use bags that are specifically designed for roasting. Do not use any plastic bags that haven’t been approved by the FDA.,"

Broil the ribs.,
Preheat the oven to 300 degrees Fahrenheit.,
Remove the ribs from the oven.",How to Cook Ribs2," Cooking ribs in the oven is very similar to a grill. The oven allows for the slow-cooking environment needed for juicy, tender ribs. Either kind of ribs work well for the oven, so this is up to you. You can adapt just about any recipe for the grill into the oven; just be aware that the ribs will not have the smoky flavor they do from the grill.


There are two different kinds of ribs: baby back (or loin-back) and spare ribs. Baby back ribs are smaller, usually 2-2.5 pounds per rack, more tender, and more expensive. Spare ribs are larger, usually 4-5 pounds per rack, less expensive, meatier, fattier, and more flavorful.When choosing a spare rib, look for evenly spaced fat. Don't choose a spare rib that has a large fat deposit in one place. Even marbling yields better flavor. For baby back ribs, it should be the same size along the bone with a even marbling of fat.Some people prefer the taste of baby back ribs, especially since they are more tender. You can also buy boneless baby back ribs. For spare ribs, most people prepare them St. Louis, which are just spare ribs with the ends and other gristly bits chopped off.When you buy spare ribs, you can ask your butcher to make them St. Louis style for you.

, Before you begin cooking, turn the ribs over. Slide a dull knife or your fingers under the membrane and pull it back where it connects to the bone. Lift and loosen it until it tears. Pull the membrane away from the bones until it is completely removed. Trim the fat away from both sides.Removing the membrane will allow the ribs to tenderize., Use your hands to press the spice rub into the meat on both sides. Cover in a generous layer, but make sure you can still see the meat through the spice rub. Wrap the ribs in plastic wrap, and place them in the refrigerator on a cookie sheet overnight.


Spice rubs contain a mixture of flavors that are easily adapted for your tastes. Make spice rubs using paprika, chili powder, red pepper flakes, brown sugar, cinnamon, cumin, garlic powder, onion powder, black pepper, salt, or any other spice you'd like. Mix your desired spices together in a small bowl beforehand.
Make sure you use some brown sugar to get a caramelized flavor.
If you'd like to get a bit of the smoky flavor, add smoked pimentón, chipotle pepper, cloves, cinnamon and vanilla to the spice rub. These flavors are used in hardwood smoked flavors., Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Place a cooling rack on top of them. Remove the ribs from the refrigerator and place them on top of the cooling rack with meaty side up. Place the baking sheet on the middle rack. Broil for 5 minutes, until the outside starts to brown.Allow the broiler to pre-heat for a few minutes before placing the ribs underneath.

, Remove the ribs while the oven heats. When the oven has reached the temperature, place the ribs back in the oven. Allow them to cook for 1.5 to 2 hours if they are baby back ribs and 2.5 to 3 hours if they are spare ribs.


Place a layer of aluminum foil over the top of the baking sheet halfway through the cooking time. This will keep them from burning.
Some cooks suggest wrapping the ribs in foil the entire time they cook. This is an optional way of cooking that you can try.Another way to cook ribs in the oven is to place them in a baking dish, meat side down. Thirty minutes before they should be taken out of the oven, flip them over and apply barbecue sauce, then place back into the oven.Slather the ribs with barbecue sauce 30 minutes before they are done cooking, if you desire. Recover with aluminum foil.

, Let them set for 10 minute before serving. Take a knife and separate the meat between the bones. Serve immediately.

Spread on a glaze.",How to Cook Pork Tenderloin in the Oven," Combine the lemon juice, olive oil, garlic, rosemary, thyme, and salt in a small bowl and whisk until thoroughly combined. Transfer to a 1-gallon (4-liter) resealable plastic bag.








You can alter the marinade as desired, adding other seasonings, condiments, and flavors according to your own tastes. You can even exchange this marinade for a different one. Just keep in mind that a basic marinade should include an acid, an oil, and flavoring elements.;
, Add the tenderloin to the marinade bag, seal, and turn several times to coat all sides of the meat.









Squeeze excess air out of the bag by opening a small segment and gently pushing the air out with your hands. Reseal immediately.

, Place the bag with the tenderloin and marinade in the refrigerator. Allow it to marinate for 3 hours to overnight.









Flip and turn the bag over several times during the marinating process to stir the ingredients and re-coat the pork.
The longer you allow the pork tenderloin to marinate, the more flavorful, moist, and tender it will be after cooking. Avoid marinating it past 12 hours or so, however, since over-marinated meat can actually become tougher.

, Allow the excess marinade to drip off by holding the pork above the bag or above the sink. Do not brush off the herbs or marinade clinging to the surface, though.








, Heat the oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit (218 degrees Celsius) and heat 2 Tbsp (30 ml) of oil or butter in an ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat.









If you do not have an ovenproof skillet, you can use a non-ovenproof skillet to sear the meat. You will simply need to prepare a separate baking or roasting pan by spraying it with nonstick cooking spray. Transfer the seared roast from the skillet to the pan when ready for the oven.

, Transfer the pork tenderloin to the hot skillet and cook until brown on all sides.








, Cook until the juices run clear and the meat is no longer pink, roughly 20 minutes.








, The tenderloin will cool slightly but still be warm.









Carve the pork tenderloin by cutting it into 1/2-inch (1.25-cm) slices.
Season with salt and pepper, if desired. Drizzle the juices from the skillet over the carved meat.

, Take out a broiler pan with a built-in rack.









Nowadays, many broilers have “high” and “low” settings. If your broiler has both settings, use the “high” setting. If your broiler does not have two settings, it likely only has an “on” setting.
Make sure to use a broiler pan with a rack rather than a baking or roasting pan. The rack allows the fat to drip off the meat as it melts, thereby preventing it from getting too hot.
Do not grease the pan or cover it with aluminum foil.

, Position the tenderloin in the center of the rack, and place the pan on the top shelf of the oven.









The tenderloin should be about 4 inches (10 cm) away from the heating element at the top of the oven.

, Once the meat looks well-browned on top, carefully remove the pan from the oven and flip the tenderloin so that the bottom becomes the top. Return to the oven and continue broiling.









The entire cooking time should take between 16 and 24 minutes.

, Allow the pork tenderloin to cool slightly before serving it.









Cut the tenderloin into 1/2-inch (1.25-cm) slices.
Serve with salt and pepper to taste, if desired.

, Most marinades consist of an oil, acid, and various flavoring ingredients, but they can be as simple or complex as you want.









Try a simple marinade made with garlic, olive oil, and vinegar.
To save time, use prepared marinades or vinaigrette dressings.
Create a sauce from any leftover marinade by bringing it to boil in a small saucepan. Reduce the heat and let simmer, low and slow, until it thickens and reduces down to a volume of about 2 Tbsp (30 ml).

, A dry rub consists of various ground herbs and spices.









Common seasonings for a pork tenderloin dry rub include parsley, basil, and cilantro.
You can rub the seasoning onto the meat several hours before so that the meat will absorb some of the flavor, or you could apply it immediately before you cook the tenderloin.

, Using a brine is especially useful in creating a juicy pork tenderloin.









Soak the meat in salted water for 30 minutes. Keep the pork tenderloin refrigerated as it sits in the brine.
Flavor the brine with spices and herbs, like parsley or garlic powder, to enhance the flavor.

, Brush the glaze onto the meat after you sear it but before you finish cooking it.









A glaze should have a syrupy consistency. Barbecue sauce, fruit jam, or fruit juice mixed with sugar are standard options.

You'll need about 1/2 cup (48 g) of dry rub for every pound of pork tenderloin.
Simply spoon the rub over the tenderloin and use your hands to spread it so it covers the entire cut of meat.
Consider making a spicy chili rub with chili powder, garlic powder, cumin and pepper. Or do an Italian herb rub with dried oregano, parsley, thyme and coriander. Just make sure the spices add up to 1/2 cup (48 g), and top it off with a few pinches of salt.;
, Brining meat tenderizes it and distributes flavors through to the middle. Make a brine using 1 quart (.9 liters) of water and 1/4 salt as the base.


Put the brine in a pot, add the tenderloin, place in the fridge, covered, overnight.
When you're ready to cook the tenderloin, remove it from the brine and pat it dry.
Flavor the brine with additional spices like cumin, red pepper flakes, or even maple syrup. Add as much or as little of each flavor as you like.

, A marinade is similar to a brine, but instead of water you soak the pork in a mixture of vinegar, oil and spices. Make a marinade with 1/2 cup olive oil (118 ml) and 1/2 cup (118 ml) vinegar. Mix in a teaspoon of each of your favorite spices.


Place the pork loin in a sealable food storage bag. Pour in the marinade. Seal the bag and allow it to sit in the refrigerator overnight.
When you're ready to cook the tenderloin, remove it from the food storage bag and pat it dry.

,


Butterfly the tenderloin by cutting it in half lengthwise, stopping about an inch from the edge. Lay it open so you have one long pieces of tenderloin.
Cover with a piece of plastic wrap and use a meat mallet to pound it flat.
Spread on your favorite rub, seasoning, or a stuffing made from a few cups of cheese and breadcrumbs.
Starting from one end, roll the tenderloin into a log. Hold the rolled tenderloin together using toothpicks.
Cook the tenderloin using one of the following methods.

Pull the membrane off of the ribs.,
Decide how to season your ribs.",How to Cook Pork Ribs1," Ribs come with a whitish membrane, usually located on the underside of the cage, that can get hard and chewy if you leave it on. It's easy to pull off; just place your fingers underneath and tug it off. Use a knife if you need help getting it loose.






;
, You can start with a simple seasoning of salt and pepper and add sauce later, or use a dry spice mix that you rub over the ribs to season them overnight before cooking. Either method produces delicious, flavorful ribs, so it's completely up to you.









If you want to use a dry rub mix, you'll have to plan ahead a bit because the rub needs to seep into the meat overnight. Wrap the rubbed meat in aluminum foil and place it in the refrigerator the night before you want to cook the ribs.Here's a simple dry rub mix that will result in spicy, flavorful meat. Just blend the spices together and rub them on the rack:

2 Tablespoons salt
1 Tablespoon chili powder
1 teaspoon black pepper
1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder

Purchase a pork shoulder roast.,
Trim the roast.,
Tie the roast with twine.,
Apply rub to the roast.,
Refrigerate the roast overnight.",How to Cook Pulled Pork1," Choose a bone-in or boneless option. Either is acceptable for pulled pork. The benefit to a boneless roast is that you don't have to work around and remove the bone, but bone-in roasts are very flavorful and often less expensive. The meat shouldn't be too lean; some fat is required for flavoring and tenderness.









Pick a roast that is 4 to 5 lbs. (1.8 to 2.3 kg). Roasts this size offer adequate surface areas to create crusty textures and add to the pulled pork.
If you have a large crowd, select several similar sized roasts, rather than one 8 pound roast, for example. This ensures that all of the meat will have the right ratio of fat to meat.;
, Trim the fat from the outside of the roast. Remove large fat pieces, leaving a little less than 1/8 inch (0.3 cm) of fat on the surface area. The inside of the roast will still have plenty of fat, so don't worry about trimming away the flavor. When you're finished, rinse the roast and pat it dry.









Use a sharp knife to trim the fat. It can be slippery, so using a dull knife is dangerous.
A kitchen scissors is also handy to use for trimming the meat.

, Bind it with twine twice around each side (top to bottom and side to side). This helps the meat roast evenly.








, Baste the roast with oil, so the rub will stick to it. Rub a pork spice rub (available at most grocery stores) onto the roast's surface. Make sure the layer is thick and covers the entire roast evenly.









You can make your own pork rub with salt, pepper, garlic and other herbs.
Don't skimp with the rub - this is where a lot of the pork's great flavor will come from.

, Place it in a baking dish, cover it with plastic wrap, and set it in the refrigerator so the salt and spices can meld with the pork overnight.

Let the pork shoulder sit.,
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (177 degrees Celsius).,
Set the pork on a rack in a roasting pan.,
Score the pork.,
Coat the pork with your favorite seasonings, marinade or rub.,
Roast the pork shoulder for approximately 1 hour per pound.,
Let the pork rest for 10 to 15 minutes before carving.",How to Cook Pork Shoulder1," A piece of pork shoulder should be at roughly room temperature before cooking. If refrigerated, let the pork sit for roughly half an hour prior to cooking. If frozen, you may need to let the pork defrost overnight.;
, While waiting for your pork shoulder to warm, it's a good idea to let the oven warm up (especially if yours is slow to heat). If your pork is frozen and defrosting, you may need to wait until the end of the defrosting process to turn on your oven.

, Use a cooking rack to ensure the pork does not sit in its own juices as it cooks. An oven-safe pan can collect the pork's juices as they drain during cooking - you can dispose of these after cooking or use them for gravy, etc.


Place the pork on the rack fat side up. As the pork cooks, the fat will render and liquefy, running down the pork. Essentially, this allows the pork to baste itself.

, Use a sharp knife to cut a criss-cross pattern of slices into the top of your pork shoulder. This serves multiple purposes, allowing the pork's juices to spill out and baste the meat during cooking and allowing your seasonings to penetrate deeper into the meat.

, Be very generous with your seasonings - much of the roast pork shoulder's flavor comes from its delicious outer crust, the flavor of which is determined by the seasonings you choose. There are a very wide variety of rubs and seasonings suitable for pork shoulders. Some can be store-bought, while others can be recreated at home.


When in doubt, a simple rub of salt, pepper, garlic, and a few basic spices of your choosing (especially thyme and coriander) works great. If you can't get the seasoning to ""stick"", try rubbing the pork shoulder with a light coating of olive oil first.
To marinate your pork, you'll want to submerge the pork in a solution that usually contains oil, one or more acidic ingredients, and the seasonings of your choice. The acidic ingredients ""cut"" the oil in the marinade, providing flavor and keeping the finished product from becoming too greasy. Let the pork sit in the marinade for at least 4 hours and as long as a day or more.

Additionally, you may want to consider using the sample dry rub and marinade recipes above.



, Pork shoulder is best when it's cooked long and slow. Roast uncovered in the oven for about 1 hour per pound of meat. You may reduce the heat as needed if the pork appears to be cooking too quickly - many recipes call for 325 degrees Fahrenheit (163 degrees Celsius) rather than 350 (177 C).


As a general rule, when pork shoulder is done, the skin should be crispy, the meat should reach an internal temperature of 160-185 degrees (70-85 degrees Celsius), and any bone in the meat should ""wiggle"" easily when grabbed and shaken.

, Like many cuts of meat, pork is best if it's given a ""rest"" after being taken out of the oven. Letting the meat rests allows it to continue to cook off of its internal heat and also allows it to re-absorb moisture that might otherwise be lost if the meat is cut immediately after removing from the oven.


After the brief rest, you're done. Enjoy your delicious roast pork shoulder!

Cover the pan with aluminum foil to form a tent.,
Place the pan in the oven and cook for 2 1/2 hours.",How to Cook Pork Ribs2,", When you're ready to cook the ribs, get the pan ready. Choose a large pan with 2-inch sides that can comfortably hold all of the ribs in a single layer. Stacking the ribs will result in unevenly cooked meat. Cover the pan in a sheet of aluminum foil with the ends hanging off the short sides.









It's important to make sure the pan you use is deep. Ribs produce a lot of juices, and you don't want them to run out of the pan.
You can use a glass or metal pan.

, This will keep the meat moist as it cooks and prevent the bottom of the meat from burning. Pour it directly over the aluminum foil.








, The arch of the ribs should face up, and the bones should be against the foil. Make sure the ribs aren't overlapping.








, First bend in the ends of the first sheet of foil, then add a second sheet to form a tent. Scrunch the foil around the handles of the pan to keep it in place. Make sure there are no holes.








, Keep the ribs covered during this first hour. The ribs are ready for finishing when the meat falls easily from the bone when it is poked with a fork.

Set out flavorful garnishes.",How to Cook Wagyu Beef," Remove the Wagyu beef from the refrigerator 20 minutes to 1 hour before you plan on cooking it. This will take the chill off of the meat and make it cook evenly., Sprinkle one side of the steak with salt and coarsely ground pepper. Avoid pushing the salt and pepper into the steak since you want to avoid over handling the beef., Pour 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of extra-virgin sesame seed oil into a cast iron or large skillet. Turn the heat on to medium-high and heat the oil for about 30 seconds. Slice 2 large cloves of garlic and add them to the oil. Heat the garlic in the oil for about 30 seconds.The garlic will flavor the neutral-tasting sesame oil. Avoid using toasted sesame oil because it will have a strong nutty flavor.

, While you may be tempted to marinate your Wagyu steak, the meat really doesn't need it. Marinating the Wagyu beef in acidic ingredients can toughen the meat and hide its rich flavor.Remember that you can always season the Wagyu beef steaks once they've finished cooking.

, Hold one end of the Wagyu beef with one hand and use chopsticks to lift the other end. Carefully lay the beef seasoned side down in the heated skillet.Avoid over handling or stretching the steak because it will make the meat tough.

, Sprinkle more salt and coarsely ground pepper over the top of the steak in the skillet. This should be the side that you didn't season earlier., Leave the beef in the skillet over medium-high heat for 1 minute. This will give it a chance to brown a bit. If your steak is over 1/2 to 3/4-inch (12 to 19 mm) thick, you may need to cook it another minute.You should see liquid appear on the top of the steak after it's seared for a minute.

, Use a wooden spatula and chopsticks to gently flip the steak over. Cook the steak for another minute or two. You should see both sides become browned, but the inside will be pink., Once the Wagyu beef has reached medium-rare, carefully lift it out of the skillet using a wooden spatula. Avoid using tongs to pull the steak out of the skillet since this could stretch the beef., Let the beef rest for 5 minutes. The steak will continue to cook a little as it rests. Insert an instant read thermometer into the thickest part of the steak. For medium-rare, the beef should reach 145 degrees F (60 degrees C).To keep the delicate flavor and texture of the Wagyu beef, don't cook the steak past medium-rare.

, Use a spoon or ladle to scoop up any pan juices left in the skillet. Pour these over the Wagyu beef to give it extra flavor. Sprinkle a little extra salt and pepper over the beef and slice it into strips., While you can serve the Wagyu beef as simple strips, consider making white rice to go with the meat.

, Whether you use charcoal (preferred) or gas, set your grill to use 2-zone cooking: one side very hot (about 450°F/230°C), one side medium (about 250°F/120°C).

, Place the tri-tip on the cool side of the grill, with the thickest part of the steak facing the hot side of the grill, and cook with the lid closed. Turn the steak occasionally, about every 20 minutes, until it reaches 110° (43°C) in the center of the thickest part. This will take about 30 to 40 minutes, depending on the thickness of your steak and the temperature of your grill.

, Once the temperature reaches 110° (43°C), move the steak to the hot side of the grill, and sear it for about 5 minutes per side.

, Remove the steak from the grill, tent with aluminum foil, and let rest for 5 to 10 minutes. This will help the steak retain the juices better.

Keep the lid closed. Refrain from opening the lid and checking the meat multiple times through the cooking process. Opening the lid allows heat to escape from the grill or smoker, which increases cooking time.
Add wood or charcoal to the smoker or grill, if necessary, to maintain the heat level.

, Keep it on the grill or smoker for at least 1 and 1/2 hours per pound (1/2 kg) of meat. Keep the meat on the grill or smoker until the outside of the roast is dark brown.









Wiggle the bone for bone-in roasts to determine if it's thoroughly cooked. If the bone wiggles, the meat is done.

When the first side is brown, flip the pork over and brown it on the other side.









Don't cook the roast for too long at this stage; the point is just to brown the roast to bring out the flavor.
Use a large pair of tongs to flip the roast carefully, so it doesn't splatter.

, Put a lid on the dutch oven and place the roast in the oven. Cook the roast for about 3 1/2 hours, until the meat falls apart easily when it's poked with a fork. Remove the lid from the dutch oven and put the roast back in the oven to cook for another 1/2 hour.

Cover the pork (and other ingredients) with the liquids of your choice.,
Cook at a low heat for 8 to 10 hours.,
For pulled pork dishes, use forks to pull pork apart before serving.",How to Cook Pork Shoulder2," As directed above, remove the pork from the refrigerator or freezer and allow it to warm naturally. If the meat is frozen, allow it to defrost overnight.

, As you wait for your pork shoulder to warm, set a frying pan or skillet on the stove top. When it's hot enough that beads of water flicked into the pan boil up instantly, add a few tablespoons of oil.

, Add your cut of pork shoulder to the skillet. Cook in oil over high heat until brown on all sides (this can require several minutes for each side). Slow cookers like crock pots use moist heat and therefore can't give the pork a delicious ""crust"" on their own, which makes it necessary to crisp the exterior of the pork in a pan before slow cooking.

, Delicious as a cut of pork shoulder can be on its own, if you're using a slow cooker to braise your pork to moist, delicious perfection, you'll want to make sure it's not alone in the pot. Vegetables and seasonings add their flavor to the pork (and vice versa), increasing the complexity of the flavor in the dish. In addition, slow cooked ""stew""-style vegetables make a great side dish for pork.


Feel free to add any vegetables you like. Chopped onions, garlic, carrots, and potatoes all work well.
Additionally, any seasonings are fair game. For Latin-flavored carnitas, you might try cumin, garlic powder, and pepper, while for a more European flavor, you might try sage, rosemary, and thyme.

, Place the pork shoulder into the crock pot on top of the other desired ingredients. Sprinkle any seasonings you're using over the pile of ingredients. Then, cover 1/2 to 3/4 of the pork shoulder with liquid. This can be a variety of things - water, unsweetened apple juice, beer, or, commonly, stock are all frequent choices. Make your choice based on what pairs well with the ingredients and seasonings in your pork dish - there's no one ""right"" answer. Feel free to mix and match!


As an example, if you're making the carnitas described above, you might try slow cooking your pork in Mexican beer for a delicious, complex taste.
Also, when you're picking liquids for slow cooking, it's important to remember that the leftover liquid can be used as a sauce or gravy for the finished pork.

, Place the cover on the crock pot and begin the lengthy slow cooking process. Slow cooking allows plenty of leeway in terms of cooking time, but, generally, you'll want to cook for roughly 2 hours per pound of meat. Check several times during cooking, adding more liquid if needed.


The pork shoulder is done when it is very tender and pulls apart with little effort.

, Many slow cooked pork shoulder dishes (like carnitas, etc.) are eaten as ""pulled"" pork - meat torn into shredded bits. To make pulled pork, open the slow cooker when the meat is done and use two forks or kitchen tongs to pull the pork apart. Continue ""pulling"" as needed to achieve a satisfactory shredded texture.

Grill the pork shoulder for approximately 90 minutes per pound.,
Let the pork shoulder rest for 10 to 15 minutes before carving.,
For an optional smokey flavor, smoke the meat with wood chips.,
Finished.

",How to Cook Pork Shoulder3," As directed above, allow the pork to warm gradually. When the pork reaches room temperature, season generously with a ""rub"" of your choice. This dry, flavorful exterior translates into a crisp, delicious crust after grilling.


You have many options when it comes to dry rubs. For instance, for a BBQ-inspired rub, try rubbing the pork down with a mix of white and brown sugar, salt, pepper, and other spices of your choice (like cinnamon and cumin).

, Use a sharp knife to make fairly shallow cuts in a criss-cross pattern across the surface of the pork. As noted above, this allows the juices to escape, basting the pork, and allows both the heat of the grill and the flavor of the seasonings to penetrate deeper.

, Regardless of the type of grill you have, your goal is to cook the pork at a steady temperature of roughly 225 degrees Fahrenheit (107 degrees Celsius). A grill thermometer can help you keep track of the temperature in the grill as it warms up. Keep the grill lid closed to speed the heating process. Paint olive oil or nonstick cooking spray on the grill grates to prevent the meat from sticking during cooking.


If you have a gas grill, it's relatively simple to set the grill to a medium-high heat. If you have a charcoal grill, however, it's a little more difficult. Light your charcoal and allow the flames to die down before cooking your pork. The charcoal is ready when it is mostly or entirely grey and glows with a red-orange heat.

, To help regulate the temperature inside the grill and prevent the pork from drying out, place an oven-safe pan or metal pie tin full of water in the grill if you have room to do so. If you have a two-level grill, a good place for this tray is on the upper cooking rack.

, Add your pork to the grill and close the lid. Allow the pork to cook, checking occasionally to test for done-ness. When done, the pork should have a crisp brown and black exterior, a tender texture, and the internal temperature should reach 160 degrees Fahrenheit (70 degrees Celsius).


Because pork cooked in this way can take a very long time to cook, you may want to begin the grilling process in the morning to have the roast ready in time for dinner.

, As with the methods of cooking described above, grilled pork is best if it's allowed to ""rest"" away from its heat source before eating. Be sure to cover the pork as it rests to protect it from insects, etc.

, The coveted rich, smokey flavor sought by so many home grillers can be made with special electrical smoking equipment, but can also be recreated in a home grill with little effort. To smoke your pork shoulder on the grill, soak a handful of wood chips (hickory, oak, and apple work well) in water the night before cooking. Place these wet wood chips in an aluminum foil ""boat"" (a folded pouch open on the top) and place these directly on the burner of a gas grill or on the coals of a charcoal grill. As the wood smokes and burns during the grilling process, it will impart its smokey flavor into the meat (with delicious results).


Alternatively, to learn how to smoke your pork shoulder with an actual smoker machine, see wikiHow's guide on How to Use an Electric Smoker

Choose a thick cut of meat.,
Resist the temptation to outfit your filet with additional rubs or smother it in marinades.,
Decide whether to salt the filet before or after grilling.,
Wait for the filet to come to room temperature.,
If possible, use lump charcoal over briquettes and try to stay away from gas grills.,
Position your coals to form a hot side and a cool side in your grill.,
Brush your filet with a little bit of oil.,
Decide whether to cook your filet primarily over high heat or low heat.,
Cook your filet over indirect, ""cool"" heat until the filet is about 15° - 20° F from your ideal temperature.,
For a medium-rare filet, transfer it over to the direct, ""hot"" side of the grill when its temperature reaches 110° to 115° F. Sear the meat on both sides, using tongs to flip the filet when necessary.








,
Remove the filet when its internal temperature is 5° F away from its ideal temperature.,
Make sure to let the steak rest for 5 to 10 minutes before cutting into it.,
Pepper your steak generously.,
Serve and enjoy your perfectly cooked king of steaks.",How to Grill Filet Mignon," The thicker cut of meat you get, the better. That's because with a thicker cut it's easier to get a nice, crispy crust on the outside without overcooking the inside. The best thickness for filet mignon is anywhere from 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6 cm) thick.That may seem like a very thick cut, but remember that the steak will shrink a bit as it cooks.









Go to your local butcher and ask him to cut the filet from the tenderloin. This ensures both a fresher cut and the ability to specify how thick you want your filet to be. Oh, and you get to support your local butcher instead of a supermarket conglomerate.
What if you have a thin cut of filet mignon? Don't fret, but adjust your cooking accordingly. Instead of slow-cooking your filet, you'll need to sear it over extremely high heat for a short period of time to get a crispy outside and a juicy, medium-rare inside.;
, Beware of recipes that call for rubs or marinades when it comes to filet mignon. All you need is salt and pepper. Using rubs or marinades on filet mignon is likely to make the meat less tasty, not more.








, Some cooks choose to salt the steak after cooking it, and that's perfectly acceptable. Most cooks, however, salt the filet before grilling, although many of them make the mistake of salting too soon before cooking. Salt at least 40 minutes to an hour before grilling.








Salt brings moisture out to the surface of the steak. Wouldn't that be bad news for a moist, juicy steak? you ask. It is, if you don't salt far enough in advance.

For the first 30 minutes of salting, moisture comes out to the surface of the steak, accumulating in small puddles. At this point, cooking the steak would be ill-advised.
After 30 minutes, some of the moisture drawn out by the salt seeps back into the meat. The process is called osmosis, and it also makes for more tender meat.The longer you leave your steaks out after 40 minutes, the more of the salty water travels back into the steak, flavoring and tenderizing it.



, Most cooks do this while they're waiting for the salt to do its thing. Meat that has come to room temperature before cooking cooks faster and more evenly.Gone are the days of charred outsides and cold insides.








, Gas grills aren't horrible, but they don't burn hot and can impart a gasoline smell to your precious steaks. (Ew.) Stick to charcoal instead. Funny as it might seem, using charcoal instead of gas gives you greater control over the cooking process.








That's because charcoal is a really solid heat source. It burns hot — much hotter than gas — and burns steadily. If you know how to master charcoal, it gives you a better final product.
Briquettes are fine, but they're nothing special. Many of them have unwanted additives that give off a faint aroma, so if used, they should be white all over before you start grilling.Lump charcoal burns hotter, is easier to adjust the temperature, and is all-natural.

, Move all your coals over to one half of the grill; that will be your ""hot"" half. The half without any coals will be your ""cool"" side.








, Many choose to use a neutral oil, like groundnut oil, because it doesn't have much of a taste. Olive oil is perfectly acceptable for a more distinct taste. Remember that a little oil goes a long way. Use no more than a tablespoon for each filet.








, There are pretty much two camps when it comes to how to cook meat: the high heat camp and the low heat camp.









The high heat camp is straightforward: Cook the filet for 2-5 minutes per side over high heat, searing it to seal in the juices. While this method can certainly produce a fine filet mignon, the ""searing to seal in the juices"" idea has been debunked.In fact, the temperature to which you cook the meat is the most important factor in keeping meat juicy. Placing it over high heat will accelerate the loss of juices.
The low heat camp uses this fact — the hotter the temperature, the more juices lost — to champion a different approach. Instead of searing first, the meat is cooked over indirect, ""cool"" heat until it's just below its ideal temperature. It's then seared to develop a crust and depth of flavor.

, Placing over indirect heat will slow the loss of juices, cooking the steak while keeping it moist. Don't be afraid to stick a meat thermometer into your filet. It's a myth and old wives' tale that piercing your filet with a thermometer one time will cause all its juices to run out.(If you don't have a thermometer, you can always use the finger test, although it's less reliable.)









120° F (48.8° C) = Rare
130° F (54.4° C) = Medium rare
140° F (60° C) = Medium
150° F (65.5° C) = Medium well
160° F (71.1° C) = Well done

,, The steak will continue cooking even after it has been removed from the heat.







, Cover the steak with aluminum foil and let rest for a while, even if the temptation is killing you. A steak that is cut into immediately after cooking will lose more of its juices than a steak that is allowed to rest for 10 minutes.








When a steak is cooked, its muscles tighten up on the outside. This pushes all the juices to the inside of the meat, where the muscles aren't as tight because they're not as hot. If you cut into the center of your filet immediately after cooking, the juices accumulated there will simply run out, leaving you with a drier steak.
If you let your filet rest, however, the muscles begin to relax and the juices move from the center of the steak back out, dispersing more evenly. You'll hold on to 7% more weight in juices by waiting an extra 10 minutes after cooking has finished., Many chefs hold off on peppering the steak until after it's been grilled because they don't want the pepper to be burned while grilling. If you're the type of chef who doesn't mind burned pepper mingling with your filet mignon, go ahead and pepper when you salt the filet. If not, pepper now, right before serving.

Rub the steak with salt and pepper, massaging it gently into the meat.,
Pre-heat the grill on medium-high heat.",How to Grill a Perfect Steak1," A great steak speaks for itself -- it needs little seasoning other than some salt and pepper and is packed with flavor. The right grill will help accentuate this flavor. That said, any grilled steak will be perfect if handled correctly, so there is no ""wrong"" choice.



Propane: Gas grills add little flavor to the meat, letting the steak stand on its own. They are the fastest and easiest to control for cooking, making them perfect for larger meals or last-minute grills.

Charcoal: The ""classic"" BBQ flavor, these hard little bricks heat up relatively quickly and give rich, smoky tones to the meat. Make sure they are all white-hot before cooking on them.

Wood-fire: The hardest to light and manage but the choice of top barbecuers around the world, wood chips have the best flavor. Can be combined with charcoal to get the best of both worlds.;
, The best meat should still be a bright, vibrant red color. Marbling, or the white streaks of fat, also indicate a more flavorful and juicy steak. If the steak is maroon or brown colored, skip it for something fresher.Just ask if your butcher will slice off a fresh cut for you. Some ideas for good steak cuts include:



High-End Cuts Ribeye, Strip, Tenderloin, T-Bone, DelmonicoIncredible Budget Cuts: Hanger, Skirt, Tri-tip, Ranch, Sirloin, or Flank, This prevents you from throwing a cold steak on a hot grill, which greatly alters cook times and makes it harder to get a well-seared outside and completely cooked middle. Bigger steaks, those thicker than 1-1/2"", may need 15 minutes or so.

, While some chefs love seasoning, most steakhouses won't touch a piece of good meat with anything more than simple salt and pepper. Use the largest grains of salt you can -- kosher or course-grained is best -- and liberally cover the meat. Then touch it up with pepper, adding as much as you personally enjoy (but nowhere near as much as the salt).


Think of the salt as light snow on a dark road. You can still see the asphalt, but the ""snow"" (salt) covers the majority of it.
Be sure to get both sides and the edges of the steak as well.

, If you're using a charcoal or wood grill, you'll need to get it started roughly 30-40 minutes before eating. A propane grill likely only needs 5-10 minutes if you leave the cover on.The thinner the steak the hotter the grill should be, and keeping track of this temperature is important. However, you can check temperature even if you don't have a thermometer with a simple trick:



1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) thick: Heat up to 425–450 °F (218–232 °C), so that you can't keep your hand over the grill for more than 3 seconds.

3⁄4 to 1 inch (1.9 to 2.5 cm) thick: Get the grill to 360-400°F. You shouldn't be able to keep your hand over the grill 4-5 seconds.

1 to 1 −1⁄2 inch (2.5 to 1.3 cm) thick: Get the grill to 325-360°F, as you don't want to overcook the outsides before the center finishes. Your hand could only take about 5-6 seconds above the grill.

Thicker than 1 1⁄2 inch (3.8 cm): Stick to 325°F, and know that you'll likely need to flip the steak once more than you would otherwise to avoid burning the outsides.

Choose a cut that's large enough for your meal. Plan to serve 1/4 to 1/2 pound per of steak per person.
Choose steaks that are at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) thick, and preferably 2 inches (5.1 cm). Thinner steaks will dry out easily when you cook them.
Fresh sirloin steak is deep red in color, with a generous marbling of fat. This marbling is what makes steak succulent.
There should be a band of white fat around the outside of the steak.;
, Run the steak under cool water on both sides, then pat dry thoroughly using paper towels.

, Good steak doesn't require much seasoning. Salt and pepper sprinkled liberally on both sides is sufficient.


Add garlic powder, cayenne pepper, chili powder, or Italian spices for variations.

, Top sirloin steak is a great meat to marinate, since it pairs well with many flavors.


Choose your favorite marinade from the store, or mix up your own with equal parts oil, vinegar and spices.
Place the steak in a sealable plastic bag and add the marinade. Seal the bag and allow the steak to marinate for 4 hours or overnight.
When you're ready to cook the steak, remove it from the bag, pat it dry with paper towels, and proceed to the next step.

, Cooking a cold steak will make it more difficult to achieve the ""doneness"" you desire. Room temperature steaks are easier to bring to rare, medium rare, medium well, and well done specifications.

Let your steaks rest.",How to Cook Tomahawk Ribeye Steak," The Tomahawk Ribeye is a special type of cut steak which you may not be able to find in every local market. When purchasing this steak, you have to ask your butcher to cut it for you. The butcher will french-trim the meat, which is usually about 2 inches thick, and leave it attached to the rib bone. If you cannot find the steak at your local market, you could order it from specialty meat retailers online instead.;
, Tomahawk steaks are such high quality flavorful steaks that you don't need to marinade them, but seasoning them slightly will help enhance the flavor. Brush the steak with a light coat of olive oil, then rub steak seasoning onto both sides of the meat. Alternatively, you could mix up some garlic, salt, and a little black pepper and rub this on top of the steak instead of using the steak seasoning. After you're done seasoning the meat, let it rest for approximately half an hour at room temperature before grilling it.

, A reverse-sear involves cooking your steaks at a low temperature until they're almost done, then elevating the temperature to seal in the juices and flavors. To start your reverse-sear, bring your grill up to 250 degrees, then let the steaks cook until they reach an internal temperature of 110-115 degrees. This should take approximately 45 minutes.

, Remove your steaks from the grill, then turn up your grill to 600 degrees. Let your steaks rest while your grill is heating up.

, Once your grill has reached 600 degrees, put your steaks back on the grill for approximately 5 minutes per side to sear them and seal in the juices. When you've reached the 2.5 minute mark on each side, give your steaks a quarter-turn in order to create beautiful grill marks. Once your steaks have reached an internal temperature of 135 degrees, remove them from the grill.

, Once your steaks are cooked, let them rest for 10 minutes. After the time is up, you can enjoy your delicious Tomahawk ribeyes.

Once the grill is heated up, slap the meat directly above the heat source.,
Cook each side of the steak for 3-7 minutes, depending on the desired doneness and how thick the steak is.,
Learn the ""palm test"" to check your steaks internal temperature without cutting into it.,
Let the steaks finish cooking on indirect heat if the outside is done but the center needs some time.,
Let the steak sit for at least 5-10 minutes before serving.",How to Grill a Perfect Steak2," If you're using propane, lay the steak on the grate so that it is right above the flames. Once you've set it down, try not to move it much. If you want nice charred grill lines you'll need to leave the steak place.


If you want the classic criss-cross grill lines, turn the steak 45-degrees with a pair of tongs halfway through cooking.

, For a thinner steak, flip around the low end of the following times. For a thicker steak, turn at the higher end. If the steak is pink when you turn it then the grill is not hot enough -- raise the heat and leave it flipped over.



Rare: grilled for roughly 3 minutes a side (raise the heat 25-50 degrees before beginning)Medium rare: grilled for roughly 5 minutes a side.

Medium steaks: grilled for roughly 7 minutes a side.

Well done steaks: grilled for 10 minutes each side, then removed to indirect heat to finish cooking.

, You shouldn't cut a steak until 4-5 minutes after it comes off the heat, as the juices inside re-absorb in the meat as it cools, leading to a juicier cut. So how do you test the insides? The trick is literally in the palm of your hand. Hold your hand open, then touch the tip of your thumb to the tip of your index finger. With your other hand, touch the fleshy part of your palm under your thumb -- this feels just like a medium rare steak. Each finger combination mimics a certain cook temperature:



Rare: Don't touch any fingers -- it feels just like the fleshy part under your thumb. (Internal Temp: 130-135°F)

Medium Rare: Touch your index finger to your thumb. (Internal Temp: 130-135°F)

Medium: Touch your middle finger to your thumb. (Internal Temp: 140°F)

Medium Well: Touch your ring finger to your thumb. (Internal Temp: 155°F)

Well Done: Touch your pinky to your thumb. (Internal Temp: 165°F°), Move the steaks away from the flame, burner, or hot coals. If you have a higher rack on your grill, place the meat up here. Cover the grill and let the heat slowly cook the steak without allowing the outsides to burn.


You shouldn't have to leave the steak for more than 1-2 more minutes unless you want it well done.
Be sure to flip the steak halfway through cooking, even when cooking indirectly., This is called letting the meat ""stand."" As it cooks, steak releases juices that keep it tender and delicious. As it cools, the meat reabsorbs these juices. However, if you cut the meat right after it comes off the grill the juices will spill out, lost forever. Instead, cover lightly with aluminum foil and let the beef sit.


When you do cut the steak, try to cut with the grain. This means along with the small, strands of meat you can see running up and down the steak.

Chili powder, cayenne, Mexican oregano, paprika, garlic powder/saltBrown sugar, paprika, chili pepper, garlic, and ground coffee., You'll need to get this started the night before, but all it requires is mixing the steaks with the following ingredients in a freezer bag and refrigerating overnight (at the very most). The acidic ingredients in each marinade will break down some of the meat proteins for a more tender cut.


1/3 cups of soy sauce, lemon juice, olive oil, Worcestershire sauce. Then add 1–2 tablespoons (14.8–29.6 ml) garlic powder, dried basil, parsley, rosemary, and crushed black pepper.1/3 cup red wine vinegar, 1 cup vegetable oil, 1/2 cup soy sauce, 3 tablespoons (44.4 ml) Worcestershire, 2 tablespoons Dijon mustard. Then add 2-3 cloves minced garlic and 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) ground black pepper.

, Rich golden butter will seep into the meat to help keep it juicy, tender, and flavorful. For an even better finish, try to make a simple compound butter by mixing 5 tablespoons (73.9 ml) of room-temperature butter with one of the following ingredients. Then, before serving, re-chill the butter in the fridge so that it is hard.

Consider buying locally, where you may be able to get higher quality meat for a bit cheaper.Also, be sure to look for marbling. Marbling is fat throughout the meat, which gives the meat flavor. The steak should also have fat around the edge.
Look for steaks that are about 1 inch thick.
Defrost the steak overnight in the refrigerator if it's frozen.;
, Moisture is the enemy of searing, so if you want a nice, seared steak, you need to blot the outside dry. Just open up the package, and use paper towels to blot off the moisture. Be sure to get both sides, as well as the edges, so that everything sears nicely., A steak at room-temperature steak cooks in a more even fashion, as the center doesn't stay as cold.

Strip steaks are naturally tender, and only need to be seared on the outside to remain flavorful and juicy. Depending on your grill, you can get very different flavors from your steak:



Propane: Gas grills impart little flavor on the meat, but are very easy to control. You can adjust the temperatures with a simple knob, allowing you to perfect the cooking process. They also heat up much faster than wood or charcoal.

Charcoal: Briquettes light up quickly and get hot quickly, and they impart a rich, smoky flavor on the meat.

Wood-fire: Wood chips, like hickory or oak, often give the best natural flavor to the meat, but they are harder to maintain and light. Many people use a mixture of charcoal and wood instead of just wood-chops.;
, If you are using charcoal and/or wood this might take 30-40 minutes (most of the briquettes should be covered in gray ash), but propane grills will only take a few minutes. If you have a thermometer, aim to have the inside of the grill around 400°F. The thinner the steak, the hotter you want the grill, since you don't want to completely cook the inside of the steak before the outside is nice and browned:



1/2 inch thick: 425-450°F. You shouldn't be able to hold your hand over the grill for more than 3 seconds.

3/4-1 inch thick: 360-400°F You shouldn't be able to hold your hand over the grill for more than 4-5 seconds.

1-1 1/2 inch thick: 325-360°F You shouldn't be able to hold your hand over the grill for more than 5-6 seconds., There is an expression that goes, ""salt and pepper are the little black dress of the steak world."" Odd connotations aside, the fact is that most steaks are best with only a little bit of seasoning. Rub 1/2 tablespoon of both salt and crushed black pepper on both sides of the steak and let it sit at room temperature for 15-20 minutes while the grill heats.To determine the amount of salt, think of it as a light snow on an asphalt road -- you can see the road, but the snow (salt) is covering most of it.Bigger kernels of salt, like course sea salt or kosher salt, will help the outside caramelize better, so avoid using fine table salt if you can., You want to sear the outside, caramelizing it for perfect texture and flavor. Slap the steak over the flame and then leave it alone. Resist the urge to poke, prod, or move it as it cooks.

, They should be browned when you flip them over. If they are black, the grill was too hot. Remember this when you flip the steak and lower the heat, or cook it for half the time. If they are pink, the grill was not hot enough, so try and raise the heat or leave them over the flame for another 2-3 minutes. For reference:



Medium rare steaks should be grilled for roughly 7 minutes a side.

Medium steaks should be grilled for roughly 10 minutes a side.

Well done steaks should be cooked for ten minutes on each side, then left on indirect heat to keep cooking.
Use tongs to turn the steak, as piercing it with a fork causes the juices to leak out., Move the steak to another side of the grill, one without direct flame, and let it keep cooking until the inside is done to your liking. On a charcoal grill, open or close the top vent to control the smokiness -- the tighter it is shut, the smokier the meat will get. You can use a meat thermometer to gauge the meat, or just estimate with time.



Rare: 130-135°F. Remove immediately after flipping each side.

Medium-Rare: 140°F. Sear each side for an extra minute longer than you would for a rare steak.

Medium: 155°F. Let it continue cooking for an extra 1-2 minutes off of direct heat. Flip halfway through.

Well Done: 165°F Let the steak cook on indirect heat for 3-4 minutes, flipping halfway through., This locks in the juices and flavors, which will escape if you cut it immediately. Tent a piece of aluminum foil over the steak and let it sit before slicing into it."

Turn the sirloin tips and finish cooking them for another 30 seconds.,
Rest the sirloin tip bites.",How to Cook Sirloin Tips1," Get out 1 pound (453 g) of sirloin steak and use a sharp knife to carefully trim away any visible fat. Cut the trimmed steak into strips that are less than 1-inch (2.5 cm) wide. Turn the strips about 90 degrees and cut the strips into bite-sized cubes.If you find more fat or silver membrane as you're cutting, trim it away.
You may be able to buy pre-cut beef tips at the meat counter.;
, Sprinkle the sirloin tip bites with lots of kosher salt and ground pepper. Use your fingers to stir the meat around so it's all coated. Set the meat aside and place a skillet on the stove. Turn the skillet on to medium-high heat and turn on the stove's ventilation fan.If you don't have a ventilation fan, try to open a window in your kitchen because the sirloin tips will smoke a lot when they begin to cook.

, Place 2 tablespoons (28 g) of butter into the skillet. Let the butter melt and become a golden brown color. You may want to hold the handle of the skillet with an oven mitt and gently swirl the butter to keep it from burning., Put about half of the seasoned steak bites into the hot skillet. They should be in a single layer. Let the meat cook for 30 to 45 seconds before you stir it around.Don't worry when the meat sizzles loudly in the pan. This just means that the skillet is hot and browning the meat.

, Use a spatula to scoop up and flip over the sirloin tips in the pan. Ensure that the tips are in a single layer so they cook evenly. Saute the sirloin tips for another 30 to 45 seconds.The outside of the bites should be browned and crispy while the inside will be slightly pink and tender.

, Transfer the steak bites to a serving plate and saute the rest of the seasoned steak bites. Carefully pour any browned butter that's left in the skillet over the sauteed sirloin tip bites. Let them rest for a few minutes and then serve them.The bites will finish cooking as they rest. This is why it's important to avoid overcooking them in the skillet.

Before you begin cooking, set the steak out in your kitchen. Leave it out between 30 minutes and an hour., You will need a pan big enough to hold your whole steak. You should also use a heavy-duty pan, preferably one with a non-stick coating. A griddle pan or skillet can also be used to cook a steak. A pan needs to get very hot to comfortably cook a steak.If you're cooking multiple steaks, and don't have a pan big enough to hold them all, do not squeeze all the steaks on the pan. Instead cook them one at a time.

, Steaks need a layer of salt to help the meat moisten prior to cooking. Use kosher salt instead of regular table salt, as the bigger grains help the steak get juicier.








If you salt the steak too soon before cooking, the salt will actually result in it ending up dryer. Salt the steak at least 40 minutes before you cook it, if not longer.
If you have time, salting the steak a few days before you decide to cook it can give it a nice, juicy flavor.

, Steak should be cooked in a light coating of oil, such as olive oil or canola oil. If you use butter at all, it should only be used at the end of the cooking process to give your steak a creamy taste. Some people apply a coating of oil to the steak before cooking it. Other people prefer to add oil to the pan, heat it up, and then add the steak.
Either method can effectively cook your steak. Choose whichever one you prefer. Just make sure the oil is coated evenly throughout the pan or steak.

, Steaks should be cooked on high or moderate heat. If you want a slightly charred flavor, opt for a higher heat setting. If you dislike a charred flavor, use a medium heat setting. Allow your pan to heat up for a few minutes and then place the steak on the pan.







, Steaks will come out juicier if flipped often. After adding the steak to the pan, stand by it and flip it frequently. Keep doing so until each side of the steak has browned.








Strive to flip your steak once every 15 seconds. In addition to creating a juicier steak, this will give your steak a nice crust., After the steak browns, flip it every 60 seconds. How long it takes a steak to cook depends on its size, so track time according to the steak you're using.A 3.5 centimeter steak takes between 3 and 9 minutes to cook. Rarer steaks should fall on the lower end, while more well done steaks should fall on the higher end.
A thinner steak, around 2 centimeters, takes between 1 to 5 minutes to cook, depending on whether you want to rarer or more well done.

, Steaks should be seasoned about halfway through the cooking process. Once the steak has browned, add your desired seasonings. Then, continue to flip the steak, basting it in the seasonings, until it's finished., You should not go by timing alone to make sure a steak is ready. Check to make sure it is done before removing it from the heat. You do not want to eat a steak that's not cooked through.








If you want your steak rare, make a circle using your thumb and index finger. Press on the bulge made by your thumb. A rare steak should have roughly the same firmness.
For a medium-rare steak, make a ball with your middle finger and thumb. A medium-rare steak should have the same feel as the ball made by your thumb.
For a medium steak, make a ball with your thumb and ring finer. A medium steak should have the same firmness as the bulge made by your thumb.
For a well-done steak, use your little finger and thumb. The steak should have the same firmness as the ball made by your thumb.

, Fillets are small steaks that are 6 to 8 ounces in weight. A fillet has slightly less flavor than other steaks. However, it's good for a single serving. It also tends to come out more tender than other varieties. However, fillets do best cooked rare or medium-rare. If you want a well-done steak, don't go for a fillet., A New York strip is a larger steak which is tender and has a lot of flavor. They do best with dry rubs for seasoning rather than wetter marinades. They also cook well if you want a rare or medium-rare steak., A ribeye can be cooked and seasoned in a variety of different ways. If you use a ribeye, buy a thicker cut as they tend to cook better. If you buy a ribeye that has a bone in it, it will have more flavor."

Turn the broiler on to heat up the oven.,
Season the steak liberally.,
Set up your pan.,
Cook the steaks for 6 minutes.,
Check the temperature again.",How to Cook Steaks in the Oven2," The oven needs to heat up a bit before you stick the steaks in. Turn the broiler on to preheat the oven while you complete the other steps. You need the broiler because the high heat helps brown the outside of the steak without overcooking the steak., You can really use any seasonings you want, but a good steak seasoning should do the trick.Coarse salt, or salt of any kind, is always a good choice, as is freshly ground pepper and a bit of garlic powder. Make sure to season both sides of the steak with a heavy douse of seasoning., Place a cookie cooling rack on top of a sheet pan. A cooling rack is just what you use to put cookies on when they come out of the oven. The rack helps elevate the steak so it cooks more evenly. Put the steak or steaks on top of the rack., Place the steaks in the oven. Set a timer for 6 minutes. When it dings, take the steaks out so you can check them with a thermometer. They should be at about 100 degrees Fahrenheit, and they'll need about 3 more minutes. Flip them over, and place them back in the oven.Use tongs when flipping the steak, so you're not piercing it over and over with a fork.
Always push the thermometer into the side of the steak to get a more accurate reading.

, Pull the steaks out of the oven after 3 minutes, and use the thermometer to check the temperature again. See if it's at your desired doneness. If it's not, you'll need to stick the steaks back in the oven for another couple of minutes. Remember, the steak temperature may rise 5 degrees Fahrenheit or a bit more (up to 10 degrees) in the resting period after the oven, so aim for the lower end of your desired doneness.A rare steak is 120 degrees Fahrenheit to 125 degrees. Rare is 125 to 130 degrees, while medium rare is 130 to 135 degrees. Medium is 140 to 145, and medium well is 150 to 155. Well done is 160 or higher.
Let the steak rest. Once your steak is at the desired temperature, you need to let it rest outside the oven for 5 minutes or so with aluminum foil loosely over it. The resting period is important because it lets the steak continue cooking, and it helps the steak retain its juices. If you cut it too soon, you'll release much of the juice onto the plate."

Rub and season the steaks.,
Sear the steaks on the stove.,
Finish cooking the steaks in the oven.,
Let the steak rest.,
Finished.

",How to Cook Steaks in the Oven3," A cast iron skillet works best for this process because it is essentially nonstick. However, you can use any oven-safe skillet, such as a stainless steel skillet. Let the skillet heat under the broiler for about 20 minutes while you finish prepping the steaks.Make sure you don't use a nonstick skillet with a coating, as those are not usually oven safe.

, Coat the steaks in oil. Olive oil is a good choice (as long as it's not extra virgin),but vegetable or canola oil is also fine. Make sure to get the whole steak coated well. Season the steaks liberally with salt and pepper, preferably coarse ground. Make sure to coat both sides.You can also add a bit of garlic powder if you would like.

, After 20 minutes, place a burner on high heat. Using an oven mitt, take the skillet out of the oven, and put it on the burner. Sear the steaks on one side for half a minute, then flip them over. The pan should create a nice, brown sear on both sides.You can also sear them in the oven. Place the steaks in the pan, and stick them back in the oven. In that case, sear each side for 3 minutes, flipping in between.
Be careful of the grease splatter because the pan will be very hot. Also, use tongs to flip the steak, as they won't puncture the steak.

, Place the steaks back in the oven to finish cooking internally. Cook for 2 minutes on each side under the broiler, flipping in between. Check the temperature of your steak. It should be at about medium rare (130-135 degrees Fahrenheit). If you want it more done, put it back in the oven.If you seared your steaks in the oven, turn the heat to 500 degrees Fahrenheit, and continue cooking the steaks. For a 1-inch steak, you'll need to cook it another 1 minute or so for rare, 2-3 minutes for medium, and 4-5 minutes for medium well. Be sure to check the steak with your thermometer to get it at the right doneness.
Remember, the temperatures are rare (120-130), medium rare (130-135), medium (140-145), medium well (150-155), and well (160+).
Your steak will increase by about 5 to 10 degrees after leaving the oven., The steak needs to sit outside the oven for about 5 minutes with aluminum foil loosely over it. This resting period helps the steak finish cooking. It also maintains its juiciness, as cutting into it will let the juices seep out onto the plate. Once the 5 minutes are up, serve up the steak.,"

Choose a thinner steak if you are cooking on a stovetop.,
Take the steak out of the fridge 20-30 minutes in advance.,
Season the steaks generously with salt and pepper.,
Heat a large cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat.,
Add steaks to pan and cook for 3-4 minutes on each side, or until browned.,
Reduce the heat and cook to your desired doneness.,
Let the steak stand for 10 minutes before cutting into it.",How to Cook Strip Steak2," In order to cook the best steak on the stove, you should aim for a piece of meat that is roughly 1 inch thick. This allows you to sear the outsides quickly why still getting the insides well done.If your steak is thicker, you'll need to cook the steak on low for a longer period of time after searing both sides.

, Let steaks stand 30 minutes at room temperature so they are not cool and the outsides can cook quickly., Rub both sides of the steak with salt and pepper so that it is well encrusted. The bigger the salt you can get (kosher, coarse sea-salt, etc.) the better: bigger pieces of salt stay crunchy and take less time to dissolve into the meat.


You want a fair amount of salt on the meat-- it shouldn't be all white, but there should be salt on every part of the steak.

, Add 1/2 tablespoon olive oil to the pan and swirl to coat. The oil should be smoking just a little, so faint wisps of smoke are coming off the surface.


Some cooks swear by coconut oil, which has a mild flavor but a high smoking point, allowing you to really cook the outside of the steak.If you do not have a cast-iron skillet you can use a normal frying pan instead, but you may need more oil.

, You want a nice, caramelized exterior on both sides -- brown but not black. If you flip the steak and it is still pink, turn it back over and leave it until it is nice and crispy on one side.

, Lower the heat to medium-low and cook the steak until the inside is your preferred level of done. If you have a meat thermometer you can use this to get your steak perfect every time:



Rare: 130-135°F. Remove immediately after flipping each side.

Medium-Rare: 140°F. Cook for an additional 1-3 minutes on each side.

Medium: 155°F. Cook for an additional 3-5 minutes on each side.

Well Done: 165°F Cook the steak for an additional 5-7 minutes on each side., You don't want to eat your steak right after it comes off. Waiting locks in juices and flavor as they soak into the meat. Tent a piece of aluminum foil over the steak and let it rest before slicing."

Try rubbing a dry seasoning over the meat 30 minutes before cooking.,
Use a wet marinade to get moist, delicious flavor into your steaks.,
Add a pat of butter to the top of the steak for an extra richness.,
Top your steak with something extra to make a perfect entree.",How to Cook Strip Steak3," Dry rubs add flavor to meat without ruining their tenderness, letting you customize your meat to fit the meal. Mix the following spices together with 1/2 tablespoon salt and crushed black pepper before massaging the rub into both sides of the meat. Use equal parts of each spice, roughly 1-1/2 tablespoons, and don't be afraid to mix and match. These rubs are enough for 2-3 steaks.


Onion powder, paprika, chili powder, and garlic powder.
Dried rosemary, thyme, and oregano, garlic powder.
Cayenne, chili powder, paprika, Mexican oregano, garlic powder.Brown sugar, chili pepper, paprika, garlic powder, and ground coffee (adventurous cooks only!), Wet marinades are usually effective overnight, so don't try do make one at the last minute and expect a lot of flavor. The acid in wet marinades (vinegar, lemon juice, etc.) also breaks down some of the tissue, making the meat more tender.Be careful though, too much acid can ruin the texture of a steak and make a crispy exterior impossible. Place the steaks in a bag with the marinade and leave them in the fridge overnight to get the best results. Experiment with additional spices or different combinations to find the marinade you love.


1/3 cups of soy sauce, olive oil, lemon juice, Worcestershire sauce, plus 1-2 tablespoons garlic powder, dried basil, parsley, rosemary, and crushed black pepper.1/3 cup red wine vinegar, 1/2 cup soy sauce, 1 cup vegetable oil, 3 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce, 2 tablespoons Dijon mustard, 2-3 cloves minced garlic, 1 tablespoon ground black pepper.

, There is a reason that most steakhouse steaks come with a pat of butter on top. Butter can seep into the cuts of the meat and elevate it with a delicious, moist flavor. You can even make ""compound butter"" (butter mixed with spices and herbs) to get a little extra flavor. To make compound butter, mix 6 tablespoons butter with the following herbs in a food processor, then freeze the mixture until it is time to put on your steak:


1 teaspoon thyme, sage, rosemary, chopped.
2-3 cloves minced garlic
1 teaspoon chili powder, cilantro, and cayenne pepper.

, Most steaks can stand by themselves as delicious meals, but a little something extra can make them even better. Things to try on top include:


Caramelized onions, peppers, or mushrooms.
Fried onions.
Blue cheese crumbles.

Sprinkle 1 teaspoon of salt over the sirloin and use your fingertips to rub the salt evenly into the meat. Wrap the sirloin in plastic wrap and put it in the fridge for the day or up to overnight.While you can skip this step if you're short on time, it will improve the flavor and texture of the sirloin tip.

, Remove the sirloin from the fridge and let it sit at room temperature for at least an hour. Unwrap the roast and pat it dry with paper towels. Turn on the oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C).Bringing the sirloin tip to room temperature will prevent it from cooking too quickly on the outside while the inside remains underdone.

, Pour 1 tablespoon (14 g) of olive oil into a cast-iron or heavy skillet. Heat the oil on medium-high so it begins to smoke a little. Lower the sirloin tip into the hot skillet and brown it for 3 minutes. Carefully turn it over and brown the other side for 3 minutes.The sirloin won't be finished cooking, but searing will give the sirloin a rich, caramelized flavor.

, Measure all of your spices and place them in a small bowl. Stir them together until they're combined and rub them evenly over the seared sirloin. You'll need:1 teaspoon of pepper
2 teaspoons of dried oregano
2 teaspoons of dried basil
1½ teaspoons of crushed red pepper or chili pepper flakes
3 larges cloves of minced garlic

, Stick an oven-safe meat thermometer into the seasoned sirloin and put the meat in a roasting pan or tray. Put the sirloin in the preheated oven and bake it for 1 hour and 20 minutes. The temperature of the roast should be between 120 degrees F (50 degrees C) for rare or 130 degrees F (55 degrees C) for medium.If the sirloin is larger, you might need to add more time.

, Turn off the oven and leave the sirloin in the oven to finish cooking as it rests. Leave the roast for 30 to 40 minutes so the temperature of the sirloin increases by about 10 to 20 degrees.Avoid opening the oven door because this will let too much of the heat out and the steak won't finish cooking.

, Remove the sirloin from the oven once it's done to your liking. Let it sit at room temperature for 10 to 15 minutes before you slice it. Slice the sirloin tips into thin strips before you serve them.Consider serving the roast sirloin tip with green beans, rice, or steamed vegetables.

If your grill or pan is large enough to accommodate the whole piece, you can leave it whole. Otherwise, cut it into a few smaller pieces.;
, Skirt steak can be a little tough, and some cooks like to tenderize it with a meat tenderizer.


Cover the skirt steak with plastic wrap or place in a plastic bag.
Use a meat tenderizer, hammer, frying pan or equivalent to pound the steak to about 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) thick.

, Skirt steak is often marinated or rubbed to enhance the flavor and make the meat more tender. Choose a marinade or rub with flavors that work with the dish you're concocting. If you don't want to use a marinade or rub, good old salt and pepper will work just fine.

Common marinades are citrus, vinegar, mustard or olive oil based. Any marinade made for beef will be delicious.Common rubs range from simple salt and pepper to more pungent spices such as cayenne pepper, cumin, lemon or garlic.







, Place it in a covered plastic food storage container. Refrigerate the steak for 1 to 24 hours to let the flavors enhance the meat.

, This is the most common method for cooking skirt steak, and it produces meat that tastes just right every time.Here's how to do it:

Preheat your grill on high heat.






Place your steak on the grill.
Cook your steak for 3 minutes on the first side, then flip it to the other side and cook for 3 more minutes for a medium steak. If you like your steak more rare, grill for 2 minutes per side. If you like your steak well done, grill for 4 minutes on each side.






Remove the steak from the grill and let it rest for 5 minutes before serving. This allows the juices to seep back into the steak, making it more tender.

, If you don't have time to light up your grill, this is a convenient method that produces tasty steak:

Heat 2 teaspoons of cooking oil in a cast iron skillet or frying pan on the stove.






Lay the skirt steak in the pan in one layer.
Cook steak for 3 to 4 minutes on each side.






Brush with extra marinade or the oil from the pan as the steak is cooking.






Remove the steak from the pan and let it rest for 5 minutes before serving.

, For a grilled taste without the trouble of lighting your grill, this is a great option:

Move your oven rack so that the steak will be about 5 inches (12.7 cm) from the flame.






Turn the oven to broil and let it preheat.






Place the skirt steak on a lightly greased broiler pan or equivalent.






Let the steak broil for 3 to 4 minutes, then flip it and broil it on the other side.






Remove the steak from the oven and let it rest for 5 minutes before serving.

, Skirt steak is usually sliced into strips, since it's a relatively tough cut of steak. Place the steak on a cutting board. Use a sharp knife to cut the meat against the grain into bite-sized strips.


Look carefully at the steak to identify what directions the fibers are running through the steak.
Cut the skirt steak in the opposite direction of the fibers.

, Consider serving your steak in the following ways:



Make a Philly Cheese Steak.

Make steak fajitas.

Melt 1 Tbsp (15 ml) butter in a large skillet.,
Season the steak with salt and pepper.,
Brown the steaks in the butter.,
Melt the remaining butter in your skillet.,
Cook the onion and garlic in the butter.,
Stir in the sauce ingredients.,
Return the steaks to the skillet.,
Cook until tender.,
Serve warm.",How to Cook Round Steak1," Heat the butter over medium-high heat, long enough for it to melt.


For a stronger flavor, consider using tallow, which is a rendered form of beef fat, or lard, which is a rendered form of pig fat. Vegetable oils can also be used.;
, Make sure to sprinkle both sides evenly to distribute the flavor throughout the meat.

, Add the steaks to the hot, melted butter and cook for roughly 3 minutes per side or until both sides are brown.


Once brown, remove the steaks from the skillet and put them on a plate with a shallow rim. This rim is necessary since it prevents any juices from running off the side of the plate.

, Add the remaining 2 Tbsp (30 ml) of butter to the skillet and heat over medium-high until the butter melts.


As before, consider using tallow or lard instead of butter to enhance the flavor. For a healthier alternative, replace the butter with a vegetable oil.

, Add the onion to the skillet and sauté it in the hot butter, stirring frequently, for about 5 minutes. Add the minced garlic and sauté for another 1 minute, again stirring frequently.


The onions should be tender and fragrant when done.
The garlic should be toasted and fragrant when ready.
Garlic cooks faster than onion, so the two should not be added simultaneously. Moreover, garlic burns easily, so you will need to keep a close eye on it to prevent that from happening.

, Add the tomato sauce, maple syrup, soy sauce, apple cider vinegar, and red pepper flakes (if desired) to the skillet. Stir well, then add the beef broth, and stir again.


It is a good idea to combine the sauce ingredients before returning the steak pieces to the skillet. If the steak remained in the skillet, they would create an obstruction, and you would have a harder time blending the sauce ingredients together.

, Bring the mixture to a boil before dropping the heat to low or medium-low, letting the mixture reach a steady simmer.


Make sure that you also return to the skillet any juices from the steak that seeped out onto the plate. These juices are valuable, both in terms of moisture and flavor.

, Cover the skillet and cook for 60 to 90 minutes. During the last 20 minutes, uncover the skillet.


Stir the contents of the skillet occasionally as the steaks cook.
Uncovering the skillet during the final part of the cooking process will allow the sauce to reduce and become thicker.
Slow braising is an ideal cooking method for round steaks, which tend to be fairly lean and not very tender. The slow cooking process helps the meat break down more, and the liquid involved in braising prevents the beef from drying out.

, Transfer the steak to individual serving platters and ladle the thickened sauce on top.

Serve the steak immediately.",How to Cook Medium Rare Steak," Never defrost a steak in the microwave. It should be slowly defrosted in a refrigerator overnight.;
, This will help the spices cling to the surface evenly.

, Salt will create a crust, but putting it on too early will make the juice run out of it. Use up to 1 tsp. (6g) of salt per side for a large steak.


Ultimately, the amount of salt and pepper you use will be to taste. Use what you feel is a generous amount.
Freshly cracked pepper and flaked sea salt will produce the best flavor.

, This will help in determining cooking time later on. A one-inch (2.5-cm) cut will need less time than a 2-inch (5-cm) cut and so on. Steaks that tend to be best at medium rare doneness are usually on the thicker side.

, A grill will give you a charred finish to the steak, while a sturdy frying pan will provide the most even cooking surface.


Many chefs suggest either a non-stick pan or a cast-iron pan. The non-stick will allow you to use less oil, while the cast-iron pan has the most even cooking temperature.

, (15ml) of oil into the pan. Use olive oil or groundnut oil. When the oil starts to separate or a drop of water sizzles on the surface, it is ready for your meat.

, You should hear a loud sizzle immediately. If you don’t, your pan or grill is not hot enough.


Feel the steak’s surface as you lift it. It should be very soft with plenty of give to it when it’s raw.

, A medium rare steak should only be flipped once.

, Cook a 2-inch cut for four minutes on each side., Avoid using a fork, since it will puncture the meat, letting the juices escape.

,, Use the tongs to judge how soft the steak has become. A medium rare steak should be bouncy. A medium to well done steak will be firmer.

, Cover it with aluminum foil to rest for half the time you cooked it. It will reabsorb the juices. Don’t wait more than 10 minutes before serving.


The steak continues to cook for a few minutes while it rests, so wait patiently for the steak to come to the right internal temperature of 135 degrees Fahrenheit (57 degrees Celsius)., Use a steak knife to cut across the grain. Once cut, the center should be reddish pink, with lighter shades of pink radiating toward the golden brown crust.

Grill the steak.,
Test for readiness.,
Remove and rest.,
Serve.",How to Cook Rib Eye Steak1," Begin by placing the grill pan over a high heat and allow it to become very hot. While you're waiting, take your steak out of the fridge and let it warm to room temperature.









Another option is to put the pan in the oven and turn the oven to 500°F (260° C). When the oven reaches that temperature, take it out and place the pan on high heat on the stovetop.;
, Brush both sides of the steak with a light coating of oil (preferably olive) and season both sides with salt and pepper to taste. It's always a good idea to season your steak just before cooking it. Otherwise, the salt will draw all the moisture out of the meat and it will affect the taste.









If you're wondering just how much salt to use, a ""generous pinch"" is about right. Though it's ultimately up to you and your taste buds.

, Now that the grill pan is really hot, place the Rib eye onto it. If you are using a regular frying pan, pour a little oil on it (not too much!) before you add the steak. Then cook the meat until the bottom is brown and crispy. Check to see if it's ready to flip by turning one end up -- if a crust has built, it's time.









Brush once more with oil and turn it over to the other side. Don't ever turn the meat more than once; over-flipping it makes it very tough. Now reduce the heat to medium. The cooking time will depend on the type of pan you use, the steak's thickness, and how well done you like your steak.

For 3/4"" (2 cm) thickness, about 5 minutes for the first side and 3 minutes for the second side is medium., Seasoned restaurateurs use a handy little trick to tell when a steak is done. Try this test to tell when your steak is ready:









Hold open your hand in front of you in a relaxed manner. Push on the fleshy part just under your thumb. For a rare steak, your meat should have that same consistency. For medium rare, push a little under the rare spot. For medium, push halfway down the fleshy part of your thumb. For medium well, move down towards the wrist and gently push just before the bone. And for well done, push on the bone. To make the comparison, prod the steak with tongs.

, When ready, remove the Rib eye from the pan with your tongs and place it immediately onto a rack. A tray will do, with a spoon inverted to act as a rack, if you don't have one. This will stop the meat from steaming (which cooks it further) and will keep it at your desired level of doneness. It is important to let the steak rest a minute or two before serving. This will give the juices time to flow throughout the steak, enhancing its flavor.









If available, wrap it up loosely in aluminum foil. This preserves all the juices, heightening the flavor and improving the steak's texture.

, Your juicy steak is now ready for serving and eating. Try it with French fries, vegetables, or even roasted potatoes. Serve whole or slice thin and fan on a plate.

Heat the pan.",How to Cook Ribeye Steak in the Oven1," Thicker cuts are easier to cook at home than thinner cuts. If you can't eat a whole thick-cut steak by yourself, divide it up once it's cooked. Also, picking one with a bone adds more flavor to the final dish.Better cuts of ribeye will have fat marbled throughout the steaks in thin ribbons and small dots.;
, To sear a steak properly, the outside needs to be dry. Pat it off thoroughly with paper towels. The dry surface will lead to better cooking.In fact, you can salt the steak then leave it uncovered in the fridge overnight, which will slightly dry out the surface., Going from the refrigerator to the pan with a ribeye can lead to uneven cooking, particularly if you have a thick-cut ribeye. It's best to let it come to room temperature, which means leaving it out for at least 30 minutes before cooking., Once you've got it dried off properly, you can season the steak to your tastes. Many chefs recommend staying simple when it comes to a good cut of meat like a ribeye. Start off with salt and pepper, and go from there. A bit of paprika or garlic powder may be a good addition.After you salt, you should start cooking the steak right away for the best sear. Otherwise, moisture will start to form on the surface. However, you can also salt and leave the steak out for 40 to 50 minutes, so the moisture has time to reabsorb into the steak., Even in a cast-iron skillet, which is essentially nonstick, you still need to add a bit of oil to the pan to keep it from sticking. Choose a neutral oil that has a high smoke point, such as canola or refined peanut oil.Rub it into the steak.

You can add the oil to skillet instead if you prefer.

, A cast-iron skillet is best for this method, as it will help build a crust on the steak. Turn the oven on broil, and place the pan in the oven. Once the oven is hot, give it 15 minutes or so to heat up the pan. After the skillet is heated, take it out, but be ready for the next step."

, Add the oil to the skillet and heat over medium-high until it becomes notably smooth and glossy. This can take a minute or so.

, Sandwich the cut steak in between two layers of wax paper or parchment paper. Use a meat tenderizer to pound the steak until it reaches a thickness of about 1/4 inch (6.35 mm).


Tenderizing and flattening the beef helps the final product to have a less chewy, less tough texture.

, Mix the flour and salt in a large resealable plastic bag. Place the ingredients in the bag, zip closed, and shake quickly to distribute the salt evenly throughout the flour.


Alternatively, you could combine the flour and salt in a wide bowl with shallow sides. Make sure that the bowl is shallow enough and wide enough for you to place a piece of steak in. Sift the ingredients together to ensure that they are well-combined.

, Add the steak to the flour and salt in the plastic bag and seal the bag closed. Give it a good shake so that all sides of the beef are coated in flour.


If using a bowl instead of a bag, add the steak pieces to the seasoned flour in the bowl and turn them over a few times, dredging all the sides completely.

, Add the coated steaks to the hot oil and cook for roughly 3 minutes on each side, or until each side turn brown.


Remove the steak from the skillet once brown. Place it on a plate with a slight rim, to collect any juices it loses, and keep warm.

, Add the three vegetables to the pan drippings and cook for about 3 to 4 minutes, stirring frequently.


When done, the vegetables should be tender-crisp. They should be soft enough to bite into but should still have a little crunch.

, Pour the ingredients in the pan and bring to a boil. After the contents reach a boil, drop the heat to medium-low and let simmer for 5 minutes.


After this addition, you should stir the contents of the pan to loosen any browned bits and pieces stuck to the bottom. These bits are valuable because they contain a lot of flavor.
As the mixture simmers, keep the skillet uncovered.

, Place the steak in a single layer in your prepared baking dish and pour the contents of your skillet on top.


If using your skillet for the oven portion of this dish, as well, simply return the steak to the skillet and ladle some of the vegetable mixture on top of it.

, Cover with aluminum foil and bake for 60 minutes in your preheated oven.


Slow baking in liquid is another ideal cooking method for round steaks, which tend to be fairly lean and not very tender. The slow cooking process helps the meat break down more, and the liquid prevents the beef from drying out.

, Uncover the dish and sprinkle the beef with the cheese. Return it to the oven and bake for another 5 minutes, or until the cheese is completely melted.


You could add more cheese than the recipe calls for, if desired, but adding more cheese may increase the amount of cooking time since a thicker layer will require more time to melt.

, Pull the finished steak out of the oven and transfer to individual serving plates. Spoon the vegetable mixture on top.

Brown the steak in the hot, melted butter.,
Add the sauce ingredients to the skillet.,
Pour the sauce over the steak in the slow cooker.,
Cover and cook on low for 7 hours.,
Serve warm.",How to Cook Round Steak3," Add the butter to the skillet and heat over medium-high until fully melted.


You may also want to prepare your slow cooker by coating the bottom and sides with nonstick cooking spray or by inserting a special slow cooker liner. This is not strictly necessary, but without taking either precaution, the steak pieces may end up burning and sticking to the slow cooker, making cleanup a mess.

, Place the four ingredients in a large resealable plastic bag and zip closed. Give the bag a good shake to thoroughly blend the seasonings with the flour.


Alternatively, you could combine the flour and seasonings in a wide bowl with shallow sides. Make sure that the bowl is shallow enough and wide enough for you to place a piece of steak in. Sift the ingredients together to ensure that they are well-combined.

, Add the steak to the flour in your bag and close the bag again. Give the bag another good shake so that all sides of each piece get coated in flour and seasonings.


If using a bowl instead of a bag, add the steak pieces to the seasoned flour in the bowl and turn them over a few times, dredging all the sides completely.

, Add the steak to the hot butter and cook for about 3 minutes on both sides, or until both sides of the steak turn brown on both sides.


You could skip the skillet steps from a technical standpoint, but they are strongly recommended. Browning the steak before cooking it in a slow cooker enhances the flavor.
Once brown, remove the steak from the skillet and place the pieces directly in the slow cooker.

, Add the beef broth, onion slices, onion soup mix, brown sugar, allspice, ginger, mushrooms, and bay leaf to the skillet. Add any remaining flour, as well. Bring to a slow boil, stirring continuously with a whisk, for about 5 minutes.


Cooking the sauce in a skillet beforehand is not strictly necessary, but it is a good idea. Adding the liquid ingredients to the pan and stirring the contents allows you to deglaze the bottom and pick up all the brown, flavorful bits previously stuck to the pan. The flour can also cause the sauce to thicken once it boils.

, Make sure that each of the steak pieces is evenly submerged in the sauce.

, Once done, the steak should be very tender.


Slow cooking round steak in liquid is another great cooking method to use. Round steaks tend to be fairly lean and not very tender, and the ultra slow cooking provided by a slow cooker helps the meat break down more, making it very tender when done. The liquid it cooks in prevents the beef from drying out, as well.

, Remove the steak from the slow cooker and transfer to individual serving plates. Ladle some of the sauce over each piece of meat before enjoying.


Note that you should remove the bay leaf before dishing out the steaks and sauce.

Choose your beef.,
Preheat your grill to high heat.,
Rub your steak with olive oil and coat it with salt and ground black pepper.,
Place the Ribeye on the hottest part of the grill (or your sear burner).,
Continue to grill with the lid open for about 4 – 6 minutes.,
Grill the steak for an additional 4 – 6 minutes on the other side.,
Remove the steak from the grill and allow to rest for 5 minutes before serving.,
Serve.",How to Cook Rib Eye Steak2," When buying Rib eyes, shoot past the shelves and make a beeline for the butcher’s counter. Purchase a steak that is an inch to an inch and a half thick (2.5 cm to 4 cm). Thicker steaks allow for a great crust on the outside while still cooking to a perfect medium-rare on the inside.







, If you have a burner just for searing, get that going too. If you have a sear burner and a steak that is thick (over an inch), get one side of the grill (away from the sear burner) going at medium-high in case you should need to cook it a little more after the sear.









Before grilling, always clean and lubricate your grill grates with some cooking oil on a paper towel (using your tongs, of course). If you don't, you risk the steak sticking.

, How much you use is up to you, but don't scrimp on flavor. The olive oil has just the right body to make the salt and pepper create a savory, caramelized crust.








, Don't go anywhere! Stand at the ready with your tongs. At this point, you are on flare-up watch. The fat dripping off of those beautiful slabs is bound to create a flare-up. This is normal.









If a flare-up does happen and sticks around (more than a couple seconds is not okay), use your tongs to slide the steak away from the flame until it dies down and then move it back over the main source of heat.

, After this duration of time passes (depending on how you like your steak of course), flip the steak over onto the other side, still over the hottest part of the grill.









Remember: You can always throw it back on the grill if it isn't done enough; however, you can’t undo an over-cooked steak. So err on the side of rare if you find yourself unsure.

, Keep the lid open. Note: this time is for a medium-rare steak. If you like yours a little more done, wait a minute or two longer.








, Be patient -- the resting period is important. The juices need time to stabilize; you don't want them running out when you cut into the meat.








, A juicy Rib eye as the centerpiece of your meal can be served with virtually anything. Grill up some corn, toss a salad, open that bottle of red wine, and you'll be good to go.

Set the skillet on the burner to ready it for the steak., Let it sear for 30 seconds on one side. Flip the steak, and sear it for 30 seconds on the other side.If the steak is especially thick, make sure to turn it on an edge with tongues for 30 seconds, too, so you sear the extra fat there., Once you've seared both sides, the steak goes back in the oven. Turn the oven to 500 degrees Fahrenheit (260 degrees Celsius). For a thick steak, you'll need about 2 minutes on each side for medium rare.Cook it for an extra minute on each side of you want medium. You're aiming for 110 degrees Fahrenheit (43 degrees Celsius) for rare or 130 degrees Fahrenheit (54 degrees Celsius) for medium, which you can check using a meat thermometer., After you pull the steak out of the oven, take it out of the pan.

Reverse-sear the steak to add flavor at the end.",How to Cook Ribeye Steak in the Oven4," Make a mixture of fresh rosemary leaves, fresh thyme leaves, minced garlic, and lemon zest. Dry the steak off, and spread a layer of salt on it. Rub the herb mixture into the steak, and place the steak in the fridge overnight (or at least for 4 hours). Take the steak out before cooking, and rub the mixture off with your fingers. Let it come to room temperature. Rub it with oil, and cook as usual., When flipping the steak in the oven, you can add a pat of butter on top of the steak. The butter will melt over the steak, adding additional flavor, but the butter won't have a chance to burn.You can also use an herbed butter at this point instead of plain butter.

, A reverse sear is when you start the steak in the oven on a baking sheet at 250 degrees Fahrenheit (120 degrees Celsius), then finish it over high heat in the skillet. This process allows you to add more delicate flavoring at the end.For a 1 1/2-inch ribeye, you'll cook it in the oven for about 20 to 25 minutes for rare. Add 5 minutes for every level up you want to go in doneness (so 25 to 30 for medium rare, 30 to 35 for medium, and 35 to 40 for medium well). Have the skillet heating on the stove near the end with oil in it, and sear each side of the steak for about 30 to 45 seconds, including the edges.
Before searing, you can add items like garlic cloves, thyme, and shallots to the oil for extra flavor."

Designate a separate dry aging refrigerator or freezer.,

Choose a high quality, large cut of meat.,
Examine the color of the meat prior to storing.,

Shave off the dry exterior.,
Consume the beef soon after aging.",How to Age Beef," To dry age your meat safely and properly, you'll need to take steps to limit changes in temperature and humidity. It is especially important to keep your meat at the right temperature during the aging process. Designating a separate dry aging refrigerator or freezer is the easiest way of doing this.


Meat will spoil above 40°F (4°C) but will freeze below 32°F (0°C). The ideal temperature for aging is 36°F (2.2°C) throughout the entire aging process.Using your everyday refrigerator is not recommended. The more you open and close your refrigerator/freezer, the more the temperature and humidity will change.
You might use a small, temperature adjustable ""dorm"" refrigerator or a storage freezer for your dry aging.;
, Meats will absorb other strong flavors and odors. Items like cheese, fish, and garlic will likely influence the taste of your meat while it ages. A thorough cleaning before dry aging will help protect the natural flavor profile of your meat.


The best way to ensure that there are no subtle contaminants in your refrigerator/freezer is to defrost and clean your freezer with a suitable general purpose cleaner.
If smells linger after cleaning, sprinkle a layer of baking soda on the inner surfaces of your refrigerator/freezer and thoroughly wipe it with a rag., Home refrigerators and freezers sometimes do not have as fine an internal thermometer as commercial grade ones. In some cases, your refrigerator might not have an internal temperature gauge, and you'll need to buy one so you ensure a consistent temperature throughout the aging process.


A normal thermometer might not stand up to the cold temperatures as well as a specifically intended cold temperature/freezer thermometer. These will likely be available at your local hardware store.
You might want to choose a thermometer that has a humidity gauge, as well. For consistent results, a humidity of 60% should be maintained, though many at home dry-agers have found a wider range has little effect on the end product., Air circulation is important for the dry aging process. Limited circulation can lead to your meat failing to dehydrate at the optimal level. Adding a small desk fan to the inside of your meat refrigerator/freezer can solve this problem.


You may need to cut a notch in the seal of your refrigerator/freezer for the cord of the fan. After fitting the cord into the notch, you may want to pack any open gaps with some kind of insulation., You'll also want your meat to be a kind that uses quick cooking methods, like New York strips, rib steak, and porterhouse cuts. Small cuts of meat should be avoided, as the loss of moisture during aging can make these seem too small to be the main course of a meal. Larger pieces, on the other hand, can be trimmed down.


Individually cut steaks will not work for the dry aging process. You'll need a whole cut, like rib sections 103, 107, 109A, and 109 Export.
Boneless beef rib or loin roast rated as ""choice"" or ""prime"" are also good options for your dry aging.When buying one of these cuts from a butcher, you should ask him not to trim your cut of meat at all.
Do not trim your meat before storing it for dry aging., The color is directly related to the tenderness of the beef and how long the aging process should last. If your beef is darker, it does not need to be aged more than a week. Beef that is lighter in color should be aged more than 7 days, but no longer than 30 days.If you have difficulty discerning the color of your meat at a glance, you might want to compare it side by side with a fresh cut of meat.

, Remove your meat from the packaging it came wrapped in. Then, with cool water, thoroughly rinse all parts of the meat exposed to the open air. After you have finished rinsing, pat the meat dry with paper towels. Once your meat is dry, it's ready to be wrapped., The cheesecloth will form a protective barrier around your meat and will prevent the meat from dehydrating too suddenly. Wrap your cut of meat loosely in the cheesecloth so that all exposed portions of it are covered by three layers of the cloth.


You can also protect your meat from sudden dehydration with a triple thick layer of paper towel., You can place your meat directly onto a clean rack of your refrigerator/freezer, or you can first put your meat onto a suitable tray, like a rimmed baking sheet. Set your refrigerator fan to low, and double check the temperature to make sure it is at 36°F (2.2°C)., As the meat ages, sometimes your covering can get stuck to the meat, leaving fibers behind. After the first day, remove your cheesecloth or paper towel covering, and then loosely rewrap the meat using the same covering.


As your paper cheesecloth/paper towel will have already absorbed some moisture from the meat, it'll be less likely to leave fibers behind when the aging process is finished., You'll want to dry age your meat for the length of time you determined it would need from its coloring. You may not notice a difference in your meat when aging it for periods of time shorter than two weeks.It's common for your meat to start developing an unpleasant smell during the aging process. This could affect other meat in your fridge, which is another reason why it's good to use a separate, designated fridge/freezer for aging., The outer parts of the meat will be the most dehydrated. These parts won't likely be edible, but under this crusty surface you'll find the tender, flavorful meat that aged beef is known for. Use a sharp knife to shave free the outer layer.If you notice any fat that has dried, shave this from your meat as well. Good fat that still looks moist, however, should be kept.

, Now that the aging is complete, you can cut your meat into portions, like steaks. Shortly after that, your meat should be eaten to prevent an unhealthy amount of post-aging breakdown.


If you are unable to eat the meat the day it is done aging, you can leave it in a refrigerator for 1 to 2 days without damaging the meat."

Put the remaining meat in the last bag, weigh it, label the bag, and pop it into the freezer with the others.",How to Repackage Bulk Ground Beef," For example, if you had 6+ lbs of meat you probably want to label five with ""1 lb 85% lean Ground Beef"". (The last one can be labeled after it's weighed.) Date the bags as well, if you want. Label the bags prior to filling. Sharpies and other markers won't write on cold or wet bags.;

Pick the right cut.,

Pick a side, any side.",How to Tenderize Beef1," Good candidates for tenderizing are:


Round steak
Flank steak
Various cuts of round (such as eye of round).
Skirt steak;
, Leave some on for flavor, but get rid of the excess.

, After you've trimmed it, pop it in the freezer for about a half an hour, so it's good and cold, but not yet frozen. This will help the mallet do its job.

, This is important—you're about to start whacking away with a 1 lb steel mallet, and if you slip and whack your tile counter, you can add a repair bill to the cost of your dinner.

, Pounding a steak with a mallet is a great way to tenderize. It will certainly be more tender than when you started. If you're preparing multiple cuts with this method, you can also form the cuts so they are of a uniform thickness, which makes cooking a little more manageable.









Using a mallet to tenderize works by breaking down the fibers of tough cuts, making it much easier on the jaw. You'll notice there are two sides of the typical meat mallet: one side had teeth, the other, flat. For tenderizing, use the toothy side: it breaks through and softens the muscle. The flat side is for flattening.

, Pound away, moving around the cut to give each part of the cut the attention it needs. Spend a little longer on the thick parts, a little less time on the thin parts.


When you've given one side a good once-over, flip it and repeat on the other side.
Be careful not to be overly enthusiastic with your tenderizing efforts: you don't want to break all the way through the meat. The goal here is to tenderize, not mash.

Consult your local butcher.,
Check with local farmers and farmer's markets.,
Look for local coops, or cooperatives, of grass-fed beef farmers.,
Research available grass-fed beef producers online.,
Look for certifications for cattle growers.",How to Buy Grass Fed Beef," Many butchers carry grass-fed beef for purchase, and typically carry local beef. Be sure to contact the butcher directly before you buy to ask what is available and how he sells his beef. Some butchers only sell grass-fed beef seasonally, and others may require that you purchase in bulk.;
, A farmer who is selling his grass-fed beef will be able to tell you how he has raised his cattle and if it has been 100 percent grass fed. Many farmers sell grass-fed beef at local farmer's markets that has already been butchered. This allows the farmer to make the public aware of his beef, and it allows you to purchase the quantity and cut of meat you want.

, Coops allow different local cattle producers to rotate their cattle feeding and collectively produce the best quality beef.


Check in your local phone book for farming coops.
Look online for coop directories, such as LocalHarvest.org or CoopDirectory.org. These organizations will provide lists of coops in your general area.

, Many farms provide grass-fed beef that can be shipped to you. LocalHarvest.org and EatWild.com provide extensive lists of pasture-based farms that provide grass-fed beef in the United States, Canada and even Asia. Sites have information on the type of farms and whether farmers are certified to sell grass-fed beef.

, While it is not necessary that a farmer be certified, quality farmers of true grass-fed beef will have some kind of certification.


Look for the USDA organic certification in the Unites States. This ensures that the cattle has been largely grass fed, but it does allow a certain amount of grain to be included in the cows' diets.
Ask about the American Grass-fed Association's certification. In the United States, this certification is the only one that dictates that the cattle is 100 percent grass fed.
