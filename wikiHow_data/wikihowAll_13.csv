Consider giving your diary a specific purpose.,
Be detailed.,
Write about thoughts and feelings, not just events.,
Be honest.,
Use your diary for creative writing.,
Add visuals.",How to Write a Diary Every Day for a Year and Make It Interesting2," During some times of your life, you may not feel like there's much interesting going on. This can make it harder to write something interesting every day. One possibility for getting around this is to devote your diary to a specific purpose, and write about that every day. For example, you can try:A project diary, in which you chronicle your progress on some on-going project, either personal or professional.
A gratitude diary, in which you write every day about something you are grateful for.
A nature diary, in which you write about plants, animals, weather, or other natural things you see each day.
A dream diary, in which you write about your dreams each morning when you wake up (if you can't remember your dreams, you can just note that you can't recall them).

, Getting in the habit of writing about events in detail will make for more interesting entries. It will also make your diary more useful for remembering things later.Even something very interesting can seem bland when described without much detail. For example, you could write: ""I saw my favorite band play a concert tonight."" That's not particularly compelling.
On the other hand, describing the wild applause of the crowd, the guitar player's amazing solo, and the moment when the singer bent down and kissed someone in the front row on the cheek makes this memory come alive. That will make it more interesting to write, and to read later on.

, By the same token, your writing will be more interesting if you describe your personal reflections about events that happened to you, not just the events themselves, or just your emotional responses.Following the previous example, you could describe the anticipation you felt in the moments before your favorite band walked onto the stage, how the sound of the bass made your whole body feel like it is shaking, how excited and happy you were when they played your favorite song, and so on.
This can also help you use your diary to process your feelings during difficult times.

, Remember, this writing is just for you. Filling your diary with your honest reflections will make the experience more beneficial for you. It will also probably make it more interesting.Suppressing your feelings in your journal entries will make the experience of writing less satisfying. Since you are writing for yourself alone, you should feel free to explore your thoughts and feelings in a deep and substantial way, without fear of judgement.

, Most people think of a diary as a personal story, and indeed, a lot of diary writing is just that. Don't be afraid, however, to use your diary to write more creatively, especially if you don't feel like you have much to say about your own life.Some people use their diaries to write short stories or other works of fiction.
You can jot down poems you read or song lyrics that inspire you,or better yet, use this as a venue to try writing your own poems or songs.
This material can become a first draft for something you develop more fully later, or it can just be a piece of personal writing that stays in your diary.

, Yet another way to keep your diary interesting is to use it for things other than just writing. Liven it up with some visuals!This can be anything from a fully developed scrapbook spread, to some simple drawings or doodles you add in the margin.
You can use your diary as a means of hanging onto small mementos from the events you describe.For example, after going to see your favorite band, you could tape the ticket stub on the page you've used to write about the concert.

Find a diary that is appealing to you.,
Experiment with different pens.,
Consider online journaling.",How to Write a Diary Every Day for a Year and Make It Interesting3," Some people feel that what you use to keep your diary in isn't important. For some, this may be true. For many people, however, having a diary that feels right makes it easier to write.Go shopping for diaries at a store so you can pick up and examine different choices, holding them in your hand to get the feel for each.
Choose something that is appealing to you, but not so pretty you'll be afraid to write in it or get it messy. Writing in a diary isn't all bout being neat and orderly. The best diaries are often messy and jumbled.
Consider the size of your diary. Many people like to carry their diaries with them. If you anticipate this, a smaller choice might be right for you.On the other hand, if you plan on doing artistic, scrapbook style layouts, you'll probably need something a little bigger.

, Similarly, some people find it easier to write with some particular type of pen. If a cheap disposable feels fine to you, don't worry about it, but if you prefer a nicer pen, pay a little extra for something you'll feel good writing with.


Again, visit a store such as an art supply shop and try out different pens. See what feels best for you. The idea here is to make you want to write, so you can keep up the habit daily., Not everyone who keeps a diary does so on paper. While many people find they are more creative and focused writing in a physical book, others are content to keep a diary online.An online diary avoids the risk of loss. On the other hand, there is always the risk that it could be hacked or the server might crash. Consider the pros and cons and decide what's right for you.If you opt for an online diary, there are numerous options available such as Livejournal, Penzu, or Diary.com. Some of these websites allow you to make some of your writing public while keeping other material private."

Write about how you became a mermaid.,
Write about your home.,
Talk about your family with fondness.,
Mention what type of mermaid you are.,
Talk about your powers.",How to Write a Mermaid Diary to Trick Your Friends1," There are many possibilities for how this happened. Were you born one? Was a spell cast upon you? Did you fall into a secret moon pool? Use your imagination, and do some research if you wish to be as accurate as possible.;
, Be creative, and come up with a believable, magical place. You could come from a secret planet, or you could live in a palace in the ocean.


An example would be, ""I was born on the Planet Corasoa, the Realm of the Wind.""

, Explain who your ancestors are and whether you are of royal blood or not. You could claim that your father was a sea god (ex: Poseidon). Make it as interesting as possible, but be careful about exaggerating too much. Don't forget to include siblings and close relatives, such as aunts, uncles, or cousins.

, There are many different types, so do your research and choose the one that appeals to you the most. Common mermaids are:


Sirens
Encantados
Naiads

, Mermaids have many different abilities. Some can charm humans with their singing, and others have the ability to communicate with animals. Certain types can control nature (ex: the wind, moon, waves, weather, etc.).


Limit your powers. Make sure you choose only three or four. If you have too many, it could seem unrealistic.

Describe your present moment.,
Start a daily gratitude list.,
Create self-portraits.,
Maintain a success log.,
Use your diary to work out your anger.",How to Write a Diary Without Getting Bored1," The most common way to write in a diary is to talk about your day. But don’t feel like you need to start at the beginning and discuss every single aspect of your day. Try simply describing your present moment in as much detail as possible. Staying present is a great way to keep from getting bored.What is the weather like? Is it warm or cold?
Where are you? What people do you see?
How are you feeling? Are you daydreaming about anything?;
, You can use your journal to work on generating gratitude in your life, and building a positive outlook. Create a list of things you are grateful for each day (aim for five). Your list can be a simple set of phrases, or you can expand on any item in more detail. Gratitude can give you new things to contemplate and write about. Stay grateful and keep boredom at bay.You might be grateful for your friends and family.
You might be grateful for your health and abilities.
You might be grateful for a new opportunity.

, A fun way to record your life and keep it interesting is to create daily (or weekly) self-portraits. You can generate a portrait of yourself using a photograph, drawing, or even using words. By creating an artistic snapshot of yourself, you can capture your life at this moment. This fun activity will keep you interested in your diary and stave off feelings of tedium.You can take a selfie with your phone, print it out, and glue it into your diary.
You can look in the mirror and use colored pencils to draw your face.
You can draw a simple picture of the outfit you are wearing. Include arrows to different clothing pieces and talk about where you got them.

, Another way to cultivate a positive outlook and keep yourself interested in your diary is to create a success log. We often make lists of all the things we need to do, but rarely do we make them for what we’ve done. Use your diary to create a list of your accomplishments, both big and small, and maintain your enthusiasm for journaling. These can be anything from going to the gym five times in one week to winning an important scholarship.
This may be a cohesive list on the inside cover of your diary, or you can create an individual post for each success.

, A diary is an excellent place to work out negative emotions. If you feel anger, frustration, shame, or disappointment, writing in your diary is a private way to process what you are going through. It may also be a good way to plan what you will say to someone else, so that you can talk to them calmly. Plus, this is never boring!


You might say, ""I am burning up with rage right now. Jennifer is supposed to be my friend, but she doesn't act like it.""
You might say, ""I am really disappointing. I thought I would get an A on my essay, but I actually got a B-. I did my best, but it wasn't good enough.""

Be protective of your diary, and make your friends think you keep a lot of secrets in it.,
""Accidentally"" leave your diary at your friend's house.,
Pretend you have to rush off somewhere.",How to Write a Mermaid Diary to Trick Your Friends2," Write in front of them every day while making sure they can't see the pages. One day, leave your diary in an obvious place (ex: your desk). While you're gone, your friends will most likely peek in it and see your secrets. After a minute or so, return to grab your diary, and quickly walk away.

, When he/she discovers it, he/she will most likely read it. The next time you see your friend, worriedly ask if he/she knows where your diary is.

, Entrust your friend with your diary without telling him/her not to read it. While you're gone, he/she will most likely take a peek.

Write in the third person.,
Write with your subdominant hand.,
Use stream of consciousness writing.,
Skip days.,
Make lists.",How to Write a Diary Without Getting Bored2," If you are looking to spice things up for yourself, you may try writing about yourself and your life in the third person. This means to describe what is happening as if you were an outside narrator. This activity can stimulate creativity, and may help you get a different perspective on your life for a moment. Best of all, it can push away feeling of tedium or boredom.For example, instead of saying “I woke around 8 and went for a walk,” you would say, “Kelly woke up around 8 and went for a walk. She was pleased to start her day with the sun.”

, Another interesting writing activity is to write with the hand that you don't normally write with (your subdominant hand). This slowed way of communicating can help generate unique thoughts, and boost your enthusiasm for writing in your diary..You may try having a conversation with yourself by asking questions with your dominant hand, and answering them with your other hand.

, One of the best ways to beat a writing rut is to use stream of consciousness writing. Set a timer for ten minutes (to start), sit down, and start writing. Do not allow yourself to stop, edit, or even think. Just let the words flow for ten full minutes. This is a great way to clear out the clutter, and keep you from getting bored. Plus, you may be surprised by what you create.An activity called “morning pages” advocates for writing 3 hand-written pages every morning to de-clutter your thoughts and open up your creative pathways.

, Some people may benefit from a daily writing schedule, while for others this will surely generate boredom. So give yourself a break. Perhaps aim to create 3 diary entries per week. Or just let yourself off the hook when you need to. A diary works best if you commit to it, but you should not make it a chore.

, List-making is a fun writing strategy to get your creative juices flowing. Beyond making lists of what you are grateful for, or what you’ve accomplished, you can expand this to create lists about almost anything. This a fun way to keep writing without feeling dull. Looking back, you will be surprised how well these lists describe you and capture a moment in your life.


List everything you ate that day.
List your ten favorite activities.
List five things you like about yourself and five things you don’t like.
List you five favorite songs or albums.
List every time you’ve been on an airplane.
List five hopes you have for the future.

Find a diary you like.,
Use nice writing utensils.,
Personalize your diary.,
Use mixed materials.",How to Write a Diary Without Getting Bored3," If you want to commit to a diary practice and avoid getting bored, then you need to start with a diary you like. For some people this might be a simple composition notebook, for others a nice leather-bound journal is what you need. Look for a diary, notebook, or journal that you connect with, and start writing.Diaries and journals are often sold at bookstores and greeting card stores.
Various styles of notebooks can be found at office supply stores.
Try checking out unlined sketchbooks. You can find these at art supply stores.

, In addition to finding a diary that you like, you need to figure out which writing materials work best for you. Maybe you are happy with a ballpoint pen, or maybe you like gel pens. Perhaps you need to use lots of colors so a set of nice colored pens, or even colored pencils is more your speed. Try out different writing utensils until you find your perfect fit, and keep yourself interested.

, Another way to connect with your diary (and keep the boredom away) is to personalize it! Glue images or stickers to the outside or write inspirational quotes on the inside. Find a way to make it your own! If you don’t want to spend a lot of money on a fancy journal, pick up a cheap notebook and make it beautiful., A great way to keep yourself from getting bored with your diary is to use mixed materials. This can mean using crayon, colored pencils, or paints. Or this can mean attaching mementoes from your life to some of the pages (like a scrapbook). Using a variety of materials is a fun way to document your life that can keep you from getting bored."

Exercise daily and take up a sport like Judo or Soccer.,
Eat a healthy meal every day.,
Cultivate your own style.,
Make up your own designs.,
Be creative.,
Dress to the occasion.","How to Act Like a Charming, Suave, Classy Lady"," Most people think that to be classy you have to be snobby, wear the latest fashions, and generally act like Miss Priggish. The truth is, people don't like or respect somebody who is intolerably stuck-up. Instead, most people like those who are kind, generous, and lady-like. You want to be a classy woman? Act like it!;
, Otherwise the populace will think that you are a hard-hearted woman and that you are coarse and unrefined. Not even the word 'sucks' should be whispered. Instead, use sophisticated language that conveys dignity and politeness.

, You can allow yourself to consume a little wine or soft beer every now and then, but don't expect that means that you can go to the bar every night or have a pack of beer every week. You do know about the things that can happen if you're drunk now, do you? *wink wink*

, Do not listen to those people who say that 100 brushes a day will keep your hair clean! Brushing actually spreads the oil throughout your hair, making it either shiny or greasy, depending on how often you wash your hair. Use a good shampoo and conditioner for your hair. Good brands are Pantene and Dove(my favorite!).

, Wash your hands before and after using the toilet and eating or preparing food. If you find that your hands are getting dry, rub a little scented hand lotion or cream into your cuticles and hands.

, When you bathe, be sure to get all the private parts and easy to forget places, like behind the ears and the area just behind your armpit. Use a good-smelling body-wash or soap. And sing while you're at it!, You probably think want to have a nice, lean, feminine body to be classy. But even if you are out of shape, that doesn't mean you can't be charming! Rather than making it about how you look, make fitness a mindset and a lifestyle. Have a healthy meal plan and stay off the sweets!

, Play with your kids or jog around the block. Anything! Just keep moving.

, Don't listen to the work-fast-diet that stars use. Go s-l-o-w-l-y. Research your meal and exercise plans online to figure out what will work best for you.

, Use your clothing to express yourself, especially the most charming and classy aspects of yourself. Have fun and be creative when defining your style, but make sure you always look good.

, Most classy women are independent and unique in their clothing decisions.

, Mix things that are not usually put together, like a neon pink top with a long skirt underneath.

, Wear sharp dresses with halter backs for a night out, but wear something a little more businesslike to work.

Use white paper.,
Write your message exactly how you want it to appear.,
Have the recipient color over the message.",How to Write an Invisible Message1," If you use a colored piece of paper, the white crayon writing will be visible instantly. If you use regular white paper, you can write your message and it will be invisible against the white background. You can vary this method by using any color crayon with the same color paper, e.g. black crayon and black paper.If you use other colors, make sure the crayon color and the paper color match exactly. For example, a dark orange crayon will not be completely invisible against a light orange paper.
This method is just for fun and is most suitable for young children. Most adults could find this message simply by holding the paper at a different angle.;
, It might take a couple of tries to get your message right. You will not be able to see as you are writing, so the first few tries might be a little messy. If you need to get it right the first time, you could use a stencil to guide you as you write in your message., Instruct the person receiving your message to color the paper with water soluble paint. As they apply the paint, the waxy layer of crayon will protect only the paper directly underneath it. This will result in your message standing out in white against the color of the paint around it.You can also color lightly over the message with another colored crayon, but you have to be gentle not to displace the white crayon.

"
"
Mix a solution of water and sugar.,
Use a cotton swab to write your message.,
Heat the paper.",How to Write an Invisible Message2," Add one cup of sugar to one cup of hot water. This will allow the sugar to dissolve into the water. Let the mixture sit until it is cool enough not to burn the skin.

, Dip the cotton into the sugar water and use it to write the message. You may need to dip several times depending on the length of your message. Try to avoid dripping or lingering with the cotton swab on the paper for too long. This will cause the paper to absorb more sugar water in that area and result in a large “spot” on the paper when you show your message., You can do this well with a toaster. Turn the toaster on and hold the paper overtop of the toaster. As the paper gets hot, the sugar will begin to caramelize and form long chains of sugar molecules. These chains absorb light differently than the smaller sugar molecules, and will have brownish color. This browning of the sugar reveals the message you wrote.Do not put the paper in the toaster. It will start a fire.
Children should have adult supervision when using this method.

"
"
Choose an acid or base.,
Write your message with a cotton swab.,
Dab the paper with pH indicator solution.",How to Write an Invisible Message3," Something dilute, such as vinegar (acid) or baking soda in water (base) is fine. Avoid using concentrated solutions. Wash your hands after handling an acid or base before touching your eyes or other sensitive areas.Mix juice from half of a lemon with some water to make an acidic solution.Mix a two table spoons of baking soda into a cup of water to make a basic solution.

, Dip the cotton swab into your acid or base solution, and proceed to write on the paper with it. After you finish your message, allow it to dry. Be sure to keep the rest of the paper clean of acid or base., A pH indicator solution is a solution that changes color when it touches an acid or a base. You can buy these solutions from any chemical supply company, or make your own solution at home. One of the easiest pH indicators to make is a red cabbage solution.Alternatively, you can heat the paper and watch closely. The parts of the paper covered in acid or base will begin to brown slightly sooner than the rest of the paper.To make a red cabbage indicator solution, chop your cabbage finely and put it in a pot of water. Bring the water to a boil, and then turn the heat off. Let the solution cool and pour it through a strainer to remove the cabbage. The purple liquid remaining will be your indicator solution."

Tell funny stories.,
Laugh at yourself.,
Ask questions.,
Help people find a common bond.,
Let other people talk.,
Dance.,
Get their attention.,
If all else fails, go out and do stuff.",How to Entertain People1," It can be tricky to tell a story that can entertain a crowd and make people laugh. Some stories are hilarious if you tell them to one person in private, while others really can win over a diverse group of people. Do not tell a story that would embarrass your friend or family members. The key is to keep the story short enough to hold interest, but long enough to have entertaining details that leave people wanting more. Tell the story with charm and confidence, and, if you can pull it off, you can even reenact parts of the story of do impressions of the people involved. While you shouldn’t spend all night trying to tell stories to entertain people, one or two stories per night can really do the trick. Here are some things to keep in mind:


A story that lightly and playfully makes fun of someone you all know, whether it’s a friend or a teacher, can crack people up, especially if you know how to do impressions. However, if your story is mean-spirited in nature, people will be naturally turned off.
Read the audience as you’re telling the story. If they’re making eye contact, not whispering to each other or playing with their phones, or even gently nodding as you talk, then they’re engaged and want more. But if they’re shifting on their feet, looking at each other, or act like they’re in a dentist’s chair, then you should probably wrap up your story sooner than expected.
Be animated as you tell your stories. While you don’t have to walk back and forth across the room and gesture wildly like Dane Cook, you should stand upright, maintain positive body language, and gesture occasionally as you tell your story.
Build suspense when you talk. People need a reason to get to the end of the story. If they feel like they already know what happened, then they won’t want to hear the end. Instead of saying, “Let me tell you the story about the crazy ex-girlfriend who painted my car pink,” you can say, “You’ll never believe what my ex did to get revenge on me…” Then, the audience will want to keep listening because they’ll want to know what happened next.;
, One important part of being entertaining is to be able to laugh at yourself. People who are natural entertainers can laugh at themselves because they have the confidence to know they’re funny and don’t take themselves too seriously. If you show that you’re comfortable with having a joke at your own expense and that you’re not too proud to know when a joke has fallen flat, then people will feel more open and at ease around you. And hey, one of the ways to entertain people is to make fun of yourself in a goofy, silly, or offbeat way.


You can show off your dancing skills while knowing that you have two left feet. As long as you’re laughing, other people will think it’s funny.
Having people laugh at you is also can also cause them to bond and to be brought closer together. This works especially well if you’re trying to entertain two groups of friends that don’t really know each other. They may not think they have a lot to talk about, at first, but they’ll feel more at ease once they all tease you about how much you love your cat.
This doesn’t mean you have to be self-deprecating or down on yourself to entertain people. However, if you’re comfortable enough with yourself to laugh at yourself, then it can help you keep people entertained.

, You may not think that asking questions is very entertaining, but if you know which questions to ask and can keep a person engaged, then you can keep people interested because they’ll be talking about their favorite topics – themselves. As long as you act genuinely interested, and not like you're interrogating people, they'll be happy to open up about themselves. Here are some things you can ask them about:


Their pets
Their hobbies
Their favorite bands
Their favorite movies
Their least favorite TV shows
Their favorite thing to do to relax

, Another way to entertain people is to help them find a common bond. You may think that standing around with the people you’re with is about as entertaining as watching paint dry – until you find out that they are all avid fans of The Bachelor. You can try talking about movies, books, places you’ve lived or visited, favorite sports teams, or other subjects that are likely to start a lively discussion and see what people think about those subjects. Soon enough, people will have a more engaging, fun conversation because you’ve provided the topic.


Sports teams are a good thing to talk about, because people are likely to have an opinion about them without feeling so maniacally devoted that they’ll fight each other if they don’t like the same teams.
Avoid bringing up any controversial topics, such as abortion or gun control, or you’re likely to start a lively discussion, but not one that will be very entertaining.

, You may think that the best way to be entertaining is to tell jokes, juggle oranges, do the moonwalk, or just do a million things to keep your audience engaged, but in reality, you have to take a break every once in a while to let someone else get a word in. If you’re trying too hard or talking 90% of the time, then it’s likely that people won’t really be entertained. Your best bet is to try not to completely dominate any conversation, but to make a strong, entertaining impression when you do have a chance to talk.


Make sure you’re not dominating more than 50% of the conversation when you’re talking to one person, and that you’re not taking more than 1/3 of the time when you’re with a group. You don’t want to put too much pressure on yourself, and you don’t want to wear on people, either.

, Another way to entertain people is to show off some dance moves. Whether you’re a pro or a total amateur, if you’re willing to make a fool of yourself, then you can definitely be very entertaining when it comes to busting out the dance moves. The most important thing is that you have confidence and that you don’t worry about looking like a goofball. People will be relieved and happy that you’re putting yourself out there, not expecting you to be perfect. Here are some dance moves that you can practice before your big debut:


The moonwalk
The helicopter
The robot
The worm
Body pop
Twerking

, If you want to be entertaining, then you have to know how to command attention. Though commanding attention is a skill that can take time to develop, there are a few things that you can do to make sure that the people you’re trying to entertain are, well, actually entertained by you. Here’s what you can do:


Speak in a well-modulated voice
Make eye contact when you speak
Project confidence by standing tall and not fidgeting
Be respectful to people so they listen to you

, If you feel as if there's nothing more to talk about, then finding an activity to do can help keep people entertained. Take your friends to an ice-skating rink, the movies, or to a cafe. Being in a new environment where interesting things are happening stimulates the brain, which provokes thoughts and images that are entertaining to your friends. If you get the sense that people are getting bored or restless, sometimes the best thing you can do is to suggest that you switch locations.


Go bowling, play LIFE, or do something you haven't done since you were a kid. This can get people laughing and will keep them from taking themselves too seriously.
Play a light game of basketball or volleyball. This will keep people entertained and active.
Go out into nature. Taking a light hike or even walking around a lake at a local park can keep people engaged.
Who says you're too old to go to the playground? Have a retro day on the swings, monkey bars, and merry-go-round with your friends.

Make sure you don’t run out of drinks.,
Have enough food ready.,
Put out a few conversational pieces.,
Create mingling activities.,
Be a friendly host.,
Introduce people to each other.,
Don’t clean up until people leave.,
Consider having a theme.",How to Entertain People2," If you’re throwing a party for grown ups, then this is the #1 most important rule to keep in mind as you plan to entertain people. Nothing makes a good party go south faster than when the guests realize that the beer and wine supply has run out. Alcohol is a social lubricant, and without it, guests are likely to feel a bit uncomfortable, or sometimes, even a little bored. Alcohol running out is also a sign that the party is over and that it’s time to head home, and you don’t want to give your guests that impression.


When you’re planning on how much booze to get, you should always get a little extra in case you have some unexpected last-minute guests or people stay later than you planned. If cost is really a factor, you can get booze at Costco or another place that lets you return it if you don’t think you’ll end up drinking it later.

, When it comes to entertaining guests, you don’t need to have the fanciest food available, unless you’re throwing a dinner party. In most cases, just having enough pizza, snacks, burgers, or whatever the event calls for will more than do. You can have a potluck so everyone contributes something and so you don’t have to worry about cooking or buying everything. In fact, the easier the food is to choose from, the better, because it won’t distract your guests.


Even if you’re just throwing a party and there’s no dinner component, it’s nice to have a few snacks ready. You don’t want your guests to go hungry and plus, that food will help absorb the alcohol you’re serving.

, One way to get your guests talking is to have a few conversational pieces out so your guests can have something to talk about. It can be a goofy photo of you dressed up as a zebra so your guests can ask about it, a flower arrangement so exotic that people will have to ask where it came from, a new gadget you’re excited about, or heck, even your pet kitty, Dexter, who is always the life of the party. Though this isn’t mandatory to entertaining guests, having something around that will get the guests talking, laughing, or asking questions will definitely help keep people entertained.


You can even leave some gossip magazines lying around. Though you want your guests talking instead of reading, someone can pick up a magazine and it can lead to the guests laughing (or swooning) over Justin Beiber together, and who doesn’t want that?

, It can be fun to have a few activities out that can help entertain your guests and keep the party from growing stale. Though many parties only need a few people who want to talk to each other and have fun, having a few games or activities can help people get into a fun-loving spirit and get to know each other a bit better. Here are some things that you can put out to help entertain your guests:


Jenga
Cards against humanity
An old photo album
Video games
A record player
Dominoes

, Make sure that your guests know where to put their shoes, where to hang their coats, where to put the drinks they brought, and generally where everything in the house is located. You don’t want a newcomer to feel lost or uncertain at your party. When a new guest comes in, ask if you can get him or her a drink, show him or her where the bathroom is, and just be friendly and helpful so your guest feels at home.


You don’t want to be pushy, but you should ask your guest if he wants a snack, water, or another beverage pretty soon after he walks in the door.
Make sure you don’t seem stressed out or worried about throwing a party. This vibe can ruin an evening, and you want your guests to feel like you want them to be there, not like they’re causing a huge inconvenience.

, A big part of entertaining people is making sure that they all like each other and really get along. You want your guests to feel comfortable with each other, not like they don’t know who the guy who has been standing near them is or where he’s from. You can quickly introduce people and even say a few words about them so everyone knows how the guests are connected. If you’re having a small party, with less than ten people or so, then introducing everyone to each other can really help make the environment feel friendly and intimate.


You can even take it a step further and help people start a conversation by pointing out that they have similar interests. You can say something like, “Jackie, have you met Eliza? She’s a gymnast, too…”
You can also tell people how you’re connected to the people you’re introducing them to so they’re oriented a bit better. You can say, “Mary, this is John, my friend from college. John, this is Mary. I’ve known her since fifth grade summer camp…”

, One entertaining must is to make the guests feel welcome until the moment they step out the door. If you start putting away dishes or garbage or scrubbing counters in the middle of a party, then this will be telling your guests that you want them to leave and that they’re causing a nuisance. Even if you’re a neat freak or are just trying to save a bit of time, it’s important to let the party happen and to clean later so your guests don’t feel like they’re causing a burden.


Okay, so if it’s really the end of the night and everyone is leaving and a few people offer to help clean up, then that’s fine. You may not want to deal with that mess on your own. But the important thing is that you don’t make people feel unwelcome by cleaning up every little empty beer glass half an hour after the party as started.

, Though a theme is not mandatory to throwing a party or entertaining guests, it can help get people talking, laughing, and generally having a good time. If there’s a natural holiday or occasion for a party, such as New Year’s Eve, 4th of July, or Halloween, then you’re all set, but you can also throw a party that is animal themed, sports themed, based on your favorite movie or TV, vampire themed, or which really has whatever theme you think will get people talking, laughing, or even dressing up.


Having a “dress up” element to the night can make people naturally more inclined to talk to each other because they can talk about their outfits or what made them dress up a certain way. It can also lead to fun music or props around your place, which will also get the guests talking and laughing.

Be a good host.,
Make sure their needs are met.,
Take them to the “go to” spots.,
Don’t forget to give them their privacy.,
Don’t be too pushy.,
Give them plans for stuff to do alone.,
Fill your home with things that can keep them entertained without your help.",How to Entertain People3," Being a good host is not a skill that comes naturally to everyone. A good host is able to be attentive to the needs of his or her guests without overwhelming them. You want to be able to anticipate your guests’ needs without stepping on their toes too much. You should be friendly, welcoming, and helpful and to make sure that your guests feel literally at home (without crowding you too much, of course!). Here are some things you can do to be a good host:


Take your guests’ coats when they walk in and tell them where to put their shoes.
Carry their luggage.
Give your guests a quick tour so they know where the kitchen, bathroom, and everything else is located.
Be accommodating. Give your guests a place to sleep, pillows, blankets, towels, or anything else they may need to comfortably stay at your home. While you don’t want them to walk all over you, you also have elected to open up your home to them.

, A big aspect of being a good host to guests at your home is to making sure their needs are met. Many guests may be too shy about telling you what they really want and need, and it’s up to you to ask them so that they feel comfortable. While you don’t want to constantly annoy them, you don’t want to be so aloof that they’re afraid of asking, either. Here are some things you can ask your guests to make sure their needs are met:


Offer your guests a glass of water or a beverage. They may be too shy to ask for what they really need.
If an old friend is coming to town and you both like splitting a bottle of wine now and again, then have one ready to go when your guest arrives.
Make sure they don’t go hungry. While you don’t want to be pushy, you also should make sure that your guests are well fed. They may not admit that they are hungry at first, so make sure you have a few food options available for any mealtime.
Keep a plate of snacks, such as trail mix, crackers, fruit, or anything else that isn’t perishable out so your guests have something to munch on.
Ask if they need towels, shampoo, or anything else for showering. Let them know what they can and can not use.
Prepare the right foods in advance. It never hurts to ask your guests what they like for breakfast, if they have any allergies, or if there’s any snack they absolutely love before they stay with you, so you’re prepared with something they like and don’t get stuck running any grocery errands.

, If guests have come out of town to visit you, then you should probably show them around the neighborhood. You may not be a fan of the touristy spots in your hometown, or don’t think there’s much worth seeing, but if your guests came all the way out to visit you, then you should at least make an effort to show them around. Take a minute to think about the top destinations that people should see in your hometown, whether it’s the Statue of Liberty or the famous little jazz café on the other side of town. Make sure your guests see at least a few of these places so you can put your good hosting into practice.


Okay, so if you live in Manhattan and don’t feel like waiting in line for three hours to go up the Empire State Building, then you can at least guide your guests there and wait it out at a Starbucks next door until the deed is done. You don’t want to leave them completely hanging, especially not at first.
The top spots could be famous or quirky restaurants, landmarks, statues, unique stores, ocean views, or really anything your hometown is known for.
Of course, the “go to” spots don’t just have to be tourist traps. Take your guests to your favorite parts of your home, even if you just go to your favorite bar or restaurant. Show them what you love about living where you live.

, Though it’s important to be a good host, to offer up your home, and to ask your guests questions to get a sense of how they’re feeling, it’s also important to give them some space, especially if they are staying with you for a few days. You shouldn’t barge in on their rooms or into the area where they’re sleeping without knocking or announcing yourself, and you shouldn’t plan to be around your guest 24/7, unless that’s really what the other person wants. It can be a little claustrophobic to be a guest in another person’s home, and you should be understanding of the fact that your guest may want to be left alone, at times.


Many people need time to unwind, especially after a long day of travel or a long trip to look at landmarks or tourist sites. You should give your guests some time to decompress, even if you are really excited that they’re with you.

, This goes along with giving your guests their space. You don’t want to be the person who asks a question so many times that the person you’re asking is forced to say yes. If your guest insists that he’s really not hungry more than once, you can leave him alone and say that there’s a lasagna waiting in the fridge if he wants it. You don’t want your guests to feel like they have to say yes when they’re not up for something just to please you.


Your guests may have a certain idea about how they want to spend their visit with you. If you ask them to do something, like going to the pool or a waterpark, and they really don’t seem into it, you shouldn’t push it unless you really think it’s what they do want and that they’re saying no just because it’s too much trouble.

, If you want to entertain your guests, then you should also plan for taking a break from, well, entertaining. Unless your guests expect you to be around 24/7 – provided that’s what you want to do – you should come up with a list of things for them to do while you’re at work, resting, or just doing your own thing. This could include places to grab lunch solo or a list of tourist attractions, such as museums or gardens, if you live in a place that’s full of them.


Being prepared for this in advance would save you from feeling like you have to be there every second of the day. If you can’t come up with anything for your guest to do without you, you may have to hang out with him or her instead of getting some down time.

, It can also help a lot to keep your home full of activities that your guests can do without you so you don’t feel compelled to entertain every waking second. If there are kids involved, you can have some video games, markers and paper for drawing, or action figures available for them. If your guests are adults, you can have some gossip or more highbrow magazines around, a boxed set of a TV show, or an album of photos for your guests to look through. Having something that will do the entertaining for you can help you in a pinch when you need thirty minutes to fold laundry and can’t think of anything for your guests to do.


Having board games or other activities such as Twister or Monopoly around can also help you find something fun to do with your guests.

Live in the moment.,
Don't be needy.,
Stay confident.,
Be positive.",How to Meet New People1," If you want to meet new people without being creepy, the first thing you have to do is stop worrying about how you come off and to enjoy the present moment of the new conversation. Let go of your expectations, ego, and fears, all of which can prevent a conversation from unfolding organically. Learn to focus on the other person so that you can drown out your inner nag and stop being distracted from interesting points of discussion and exploration.


When you approach a new person, don't ask yourself, ""How do I look?"" or ""How do I sound?"" Instead, ask, ""What would this person like to talk about?"" ""What matters to this person?""
You can keep the momentum going by being one step ahead of the person you're talking to by thinking about what to say next, instead of falling behind and obsessing over something you said or did five minutes ago that might have come off the wrong way.;
, Neediness is a precursor to obsessiveness, and obsessiveness is creepy. Needy people are imbalanced and unstable because their happiness hinges too greatly on someone else. If you're projecting a vibe that you'll be devastated if a person doesn't want to be your friend or romantic partner, it's time to slow down, be patient, and examine yourself.


If you really click with someone you meet, don't be too quick to say, ""I like you!"" or ""You're really awesome!"" unless you're getting a really positive vibe from the other person.
Whether you're meeting a potential friend or romantic partner, don't ask for the person's number in the middle or the conversation or as soon as you think you click. Instead, wait until the end to ask -- it's a more natural time to ask.
If you meet someone who you think will be a great friend, you can casually say, ""We should check out that new movie together,"" or ""I'd love to check out that yoga class you're talking about"" -- don't invite the person to do anything too intense at first. Don't ask the person to go out on a long hike with you, go to a family dinner with you, or to help you go underwear shopping. Keep it casual at first, or you'll look too eager.
Avoid sounding creepy or desperate by not saying things like, ""I don't have many friends -- it would be great to hang out with you!""

, You may be doubting yourself, but you'll be much more likely to come off as not creepy if you keep up your confidence and make other people feel that you're a person who is worth talking to. You should be confident before you walk into a room with new people in it and build your confidence as the conversation goes along. Just smile, talk about the things that you love, and show everyone that you love who you are, where you are, and what you do.


Body language can help you stay confident. Stand tall, maintain eye contact, and don't fidget with your hands or look at the floor.
Don't check your reflection in your mirror or in reflective surfaces, or people will see that you're doubting yourself.
When you introduce yourself, speak clearly and loudly enough that you'll be heard.

, Maintaining a positive attitude -- without seeming too excited -- will make people want to talk to you. You should smile or laugh from time to time without keeping a creepy grin plastered on your face or laughing at things that aren't funny. Talk about the things you love, the things that make you happy, and your interests (as long as they aren't too off-putting at first -- avoid mentioning taxidermy or Facebook stalking on your first go-around) to keep people engaged.


If you talk about your long-standing hatred for a certain teacher, classmate, or celebrity, then yeah, you will come off as creepy.
Don't nod and agree with what the person is saying every five seconds like a little lap dog -- that will definitely be creepy. The occasional, ""That's so true!"" or ""I know exactly what you mean!"" will be far more positive and far less creepy.

"
"
Master the art of small talk.,
Stick to the right amount of detail.,
Find common ground.,
Give appropriate compliments.",How to Meet New People2," There's nothing small about small talk. Small talk is what helps you get to know people and open up to having a more serious conversation and a more personal relationship. Talking about the weather or what classes you're taking can lead to a more serious discussion about your favorite interests, or your favorite memories from a certain time of year.


To make small talk, you should work on being interested in the other person instead of obsessing over being interested.
Ask the person some basic questions like what classes he or she is taking, if he or she has any pets or siblings, or ask anything about his or her summer vacation or upcoming plans.
Learn to build off a simple comment. If the person says he hates the rainy weather you're having, you can ask what activities he likes to do when the sun is out.
Listen carefully. If the person mentions that he's from San Francisco, when sports teams come up later, you can casually ask if he's a 49ers or a Giants fan.

, Awkward silences can very easily turn into creepiness, but so can your babbling on and on about your mother, your cat, or your collection of bugs. A good conversationalist keeps finding things they have in common in a casual, non-intrusive way. For example, there's a difference between asking someone ""Have you ever held a tarantula?"" and saying ""Have you ever felt the tiny hairs of a tarantula's legs brush up against the palm of your hand?"" The latter is more poetic, but way too intimate for a first conversation.


Learn to start a conversation and keep it flowing in a fun, positive, and casual way.
It's worth repeating that you should not go on and on about unique hobbies or interests unless the person shares them or asks a lot of questions. If they only ask a few questions, that doesn't necessarily mean they're interested; it probably means they're just being polite, so don't dominate the conversation with your enthusiasm.
When first meeting someone, it's more important to listen to what they have to say than to talk about yourself.

, Work to find something that you and the person have in common -- even if it's a bit of a stretch. If you're both from Jersey, talk about your favorite summer time destinations in your state or ask if you played on any competing sports teams; if you found out you both went to the same college, then talk about any extra curricular activities or Greek life activities you both might have been involved in.


Don't make it too obvious that you're trying to do this -- asking the person to list his ten favorite TV shows or bands will make it sound too obvious.
It can be very simple. One thing you may have in common can be that you both think the bar you're in has an amazing beer selection.
Though it's advisable to stick to having a positive interest in common, you can always find common ground over your mutual hatred of Justin Bieber or your history teacher too.

, To keep a conversation flowing, you can occasionally complement the person you're talking to. Saying something like, ""Wow, it sounds like you're really managing to keep a lot on your plate with work and school"" or ""I love those shell earrings"" can help make the person feel appreciated. Saying, ""You have the most beautiful eyes I have ever seen"" or ""I've never met anyone with such incredible legs before"" will send the wrong message.


Be sparing with complements when meeting a new person. Just complementing one personal item or one personality trait throughout the course of a conversation will make you sound polite, but not creepy.

Start off slow.,
Avoid staring.,
Avoid asking too many personal questions.,
Avoid offering inappropriate invitations.,
Maintain respectful body language.,
Learn to deal with rejection (if necessary).",How to Meet New People3," Think of any kind of relationship as a video game. You start off at the easiest level, and as time goes on and you improve, you go to more difficult levels and achieve a greater sense of satisfaction. When you first meet someone, you're on level 1, and you're not supposed to proceed to level 2 until you get past level 1, and so on. People who come off as creepy tend to accidentally skip to level 15.


You can build your way up to talking about more personal topics, but start with the simple and inoffensive stuff, such as your college major, or your favorite band.
Don't talk about your loneliness, depression, or past mental breakdowns, if you've had any -- this will definitely come off as creepy.

, Extended, direct eye contact is something lovers usually do. It's something you can do if the person you're talking to is noticeably romantically interested, but even then it's risky because the creep factor is high if you're mistaken. Look someone in the eye while they're talking, but also be sure to pull your gaze away periodically and shift your interest to other things.


And check to make sure you don't have a tendency of staring at someone's body (chest, hands, shoes, whatever), even if in admiration or curiosity. In general, you don't want to make someone feel like they're under a microscope.

, What's too personal? It depends. Your best bet is to pay attention to other people's conversations. Notice what people feel comfortable talking about when they first meet. Know which topics to steer clear of: romantic experiences, politics, religion, illness or disease, and anything dark like murder or death (this is not the time to explain how the sword you have on your wall was designed to pierce someone's intestines in a particular way).


Asking, ""Are you dating anyone?"" can be appropriate if you're having a conversation about being single. Asking, ""Have you met the love of your life yet?"" or ""Have you ever dealt with a traumatic breakup?"" is not.
Keep up a fair balance of questions. Asking too many questions when the other person is asking none can come off as creepy too, even if none of them are too personal on their own.

, Don't invite someone you’ve just met into your home or any other private area any more than you would your basement, a cabin in the woods, an abandoned warehouse, or another setting where horror movies take place. This kind of invitation shows that you expect someone to trust you completely, which someone you’ve just met shouldn't (unless they, too, are creepy).


If you're going to extend an invitation, make it to a public place where there are plenty of other people.
Your invitation may also come off as inappropriate if it's to an intimate event. You wouldn't ask a girl to be your date to a wedding as a first date, for example.

, Ultimately, everybody has different standards for creepiness. The only way you can figure this out on a case-by-case basis is by paying attention to signals that a person's ready to go to the next level, or you're making them feel uncomfortable. Still, there are a few basic rules to follow when it comes to not having creepy body language.


For example, if someone is looking away a lot, or toward an exit, or they appear to be turning or edging away from you, it's probably a sign that they want to end the conversation. It'll take some practice and attentiveness, but once you get a grip on body language, you'll start to account for it subconsciously.
You can scare another person away if your own body language is awkward or uncomfortable, like if you lean in way too close, or talk while spitting in the person's face.
Don't touch a person you've just met unless you're feeling really comfortable. Avoid reaching out to touch the person's hair or touching his/her hand when you laugh unless you're really sure you've made an intimate connection.

, If people continue to rebuff you despite your best efforts, you might need to take a different approach. To start, it helps to pinpoint why someone is treating you poorly. If the “problem” seems to lie with you, you might need to commit to really changing your behavior. People who get classified as creeps are often just unapologetically unique. It's easy to feel resentful towards people for labeling you as creepy just because you're not acting like everyone else. And this feeling might make you resistant towards changing your behavior.


Accept that people judge each other – and sometimes they're off, but that's the way it goes. It’s all you have to work with, so don't assume that changing the way you act in order to change people's perception of you is somehow violating your pledge to be yourself.
If anything, it increases the likelihood that people can get to know your true self, making your uniqueness shine all the brighter.
Be okay with being rejected. Regardless of how expertly you approach others, some people simply won’t give you the reaction you were hoping for.
Your conversation can't always go as expected. Maybe you’re trying to strike up a conversation with someone who is having a terrible day, is nervous, would prefer to be alone, or is simply rude. Take it in stride, turn around, and try again with someone else.

Point out the issue you’re seeing.,
Use humor to diffuse the situation.,
Use the complaint sandwich technique.",How to React when a Companion Spends the Entire Time on Their Phone1," Identify what your friend or partner is doing and let them know how it makes you feel. It is easy to feel snubbed if your companion checks their phone rather than engaging with you. That said, they may not even realize they are doing it. Give your companion an opportunity to realize their mistake.You could say, “I noticed you’re scrolling through your phone. That makes me feel like you’d rather not be at lunch right now.”
Expressing concern can also be a subtle way to do this: “You’ve been looking at your email for a while. Is everything okay?”;
, Shooting your companion a text message or giving them a phone call lets them know in a direct but funny way that you’d like their attention. It brings into sharp focus that the purpose of a phone is to contact people who are not present. With luck, you’ll both laugh and your friend will put their phone away.Send a text message saying, “Hey, I’m right here!” or “Want to hang out?” with a winky emoji.
Call them and say, “Oh, hi. Do you come here often?”

, People are usually more receptive to negative feedback if you deliver your complaint between two positive statements (a “complaint sandwich”).Start with a positive statement that will encourage your friend or partner to listen to you. Deliver your complaint in an earnest way. And then close with another positive or empathetic statement.To complain about your partner’s usage you might say, “I really appreciate how hard you work at the hospital. Sometimes all the calls from your resident at night really interrupt our alone time together, though. I love you so much. Can we make a plan to meet your needs at work and mine at home?”
To complain about your friend’s usage you might say, “I know it’s been a really difficult break up with John. But your checking his Facebook page while I’m trying to have lunch with you is making me feel ignored. Can we enjoy our sandwiches without our phones, and then talk through any difficult feelings you’re having?”

"
"
Pick a designated moment to check your phones.,
Choose phone-free activities.,
Select a date where there won’t be disturbances.",How to React when a Companion Spends the Entire Time on Their Phone2," Ahead of time, plan 5 minutes during your date or outing when you and your companion will check your phones. It can be helpful to select a moment of transition form one activity to another. Doing this allows your companion to know they will have time set aside to address any important communications that come up, putting them at ease for the rest of the outing.


To a romantic partner you might say, “I really want to focus on each other tonight. Can we leave our phones in the car during dinner? We can check them before we drive to the movies to make sure work hasn’t called you.”
To a coworker you might say, “Can we sideline our phones for the meeting? Let’s give each other our undivided attention to discuss the proposal. We can check for new messages on the way to the client luncheon.”

, Certain activities are not conducive to checking phones because you need both hands to do them. If your partner or friend has a consistent problem with checking their phone, try mobile-unfriendly activities, such as rock climbing or canoeing, to get more quality time when you hang out. You may even get extra enjoyment doing something out of the ordinary together.

, If your partner or friend’s phone interruptions are largely tied to a specific work schedule, try scheduling your hangouts on other days. This will help you have a more productive friendship or relationship.


For example, if your partner or friend is a social worker who is always on call on Tuesdays, let’s say, schedule outings on other days so your companion can better balance their work needs with your social ones.

Agree to leave your phones out of reach for an activity or meal.,
Keep track of patterns to address recurrent issues.,
Get help if the issue is constant.",How to React when a Companion Spends the Entire Time on Their Phone3," If your partner or friend has intermittent issues with phone checking, agree ahead of time not to use your phones for a lunch or date you’ve agreed to. This sets up clear expectations about what kind of time you want to have together. It’s important that you, too, adhere to any requests you make with regards to electronics, so your companion feels equally respected.To a friend, you might say, “I’ve really been looking forward to hearing about your trip. Can we put our phones away while we catch up? I’d love to see your photos once we’re finished with our lunch.”

, If your partner or friend has a consistent phone issue, casually keep track of their usage patterns over a given week. Note the time of day, day of the week, and the type of activity or communication that distracts your partner. Find a good time to let your companion know what you’ve observed. Suggest that you’d like to set some boundaries for phone use in your relationship because the current arrangement is not working for you.


You might say to a boyfriend, “I love hanging out with you, but your phone usage when we’re together has really become a problem for me. I’d love to continue seeing you, but only if we don’t use our phones when we’re on dates. If that’s not possible, I’ll have to move on.”
To a friend, you might say, “I love running together, but it’s really distracting to my training when you’re texting on the phone. I’d love to continue our regimen, but only if we agree not to use our phones while we work out. If that doesn’t work, I’ll have to train with Sue from now on.”

, If a good friend or spouse exhibits troubling symptoms with their phone use, it may be helpful to consult a professional therapist. Symptoms to look for include excessive phone use that has caused them to jeopardize their job or relationship; withdrawal symptoms when they cannot use their phone; or persistent failed attempts to use their cellphone less often.A therapist can help you sort out phone use in your relationship or provide support to your companion who is struggling with an addiction to their phone.

Rise above labels such as being “shy” or “different.” Being shy or different is no reason to feel lonely in a crowd.",How to Overcome Loneliness When Surrounded by People," Being lonely is a feeling that transcends your outward environment and current social activities. While someone can be surrounded by people in a crowd and still feel lonely, someone else might be all alone and not feel lonely at all.


Loneliness is a feeling of disconnectedness you have inside.
Being alone is when no one is around you.
You can be surrounded by people and still feel lonely.;
, Think about your likes, dislikes, and where you feel comfortable. You might feel lonely in certain crowds, but you might feel deep connections with people at small gatherings. The only way to move forward is to find out exactly what situations you are uncomfortable in. Consider the special circumstances of your unease and loneliness.


Do you like small gatherings of friends?
How do you feel in bars, clubs, or other social events where you’re out in a public establishment?
Do you feel okay in large gatherings if you know everyone?, There might be hurtful experiences in your past that contribute to why you feel so lonely. One of the first places you should start is by examining yourself to figure out if this is true. If so, you’ll have a better idea of why you feel this way and you’ll be able to move forward.


Maybe you were abused or neglected by the people who were supposed to take care of you.
Maybe you were bullied or left out by your classmates.
Maybe you are feeling inadequate because of physical or mental disabilities, your gender, race or social background., Find a mental health professional to talk about your feelings. A psychiatrist, counselor, social worker, or psychologist can help you examine your past and determine what might be causing your loneliness and discomfort. This might be one of the last things you want to do, but if loneliness is crippling you emotionally and detracting from your quality of life, you should consider seeking help.Through therapy, you can acquire new tools, skills, and outlets to help you feel better. Counseling can also provide you with some much needed support.

, Don’t let the urge to conform to other people’s expectations make you into a different person. Focus on your inner-self rather than on outer stimuli and influences. Be proud of the person you are, and more people will want to connect with you.


Tell yourself that your own opinions are important.
Constantly reinforce your own uniqueness and personality.
Don’t fear being different just so others approve of you., Pick a really close friend or relative and talk to them about your problem. You’ll find that people who care about you will go out of their way to make you feel better, feel supported, and feel more connected. After all, having a solid support system is one of the most important things in feeling connected to the people around you.


Your friend or relative will know how you feel and might be more understanding if you’re in a situation where you feel lonely.
They might offer advice or perspective on how you feel.
They’ll try to make you feel loved and supported., One reason you might be lonely in a crowd is that you’re surrounded by people who are extroverts, much more social than you, or even share drastically different worldviews or interests. A good way to overcome this is to find others like yourself with whom you can relate and socialize. Try to:


Talk to many different people briefly in order to find people more like yourself.
Master the art of the quick interview. Try asking people about where they grew up, where they live, where they went to school, or what they do for a living. These are easy ways of finding people you share something in common with.
Don’t trap yourself in the idea that no one is like you., Sometimes our loneliness is compounded by the fact that we feel too stressed and too drained talking and entertaining others. Instead, try to listen to others. Many people who are extroverts and like to socialize also like to talk about themselves. View this as an opportunity. They’ll enjoy you listening to them, and you’ll create your own niche as someone who listens to others., Practice conversing with different people and getting yourself used to socializing. This way, when you’re in a crowd, you’ll be more at ease when it comes to talking to people and forming connections.


Talk to people about things you have in common, like where you grew up, schools you went to, or friends you share in common.
Talk to people about current events like the weather, sports, or things happening in your community.
Avoid steering a conversation toward your own interests at the expense of others., You might be lonely in a crowd because you’re not used to socializing in large groups. One way to overcome this is to make yourself socialize. Practice makes perfect. The more you socialize, the easier it’ll be, and the more comfortable you’ll be talking to other people and making friends.


Focus on deep conversations, rather than chit-chat and superficial discussion. If appropriate, ask people what they think about something you are interested in.
Socialize with people you know and care about.
Start in environments you feel comfortable in., Remember that just because you have a lot of friends or are in a crowd, doesn’t mean that lots of people will cure your feeling of loneliness. Use being in a crowd to meet different people and identify people you can form quality relationships with., Sometimes we feel lonely or alienated from a group because of the people we’re around – sometimes we view them as friends – are mean to us, make fun of us, or are not supportive of us. Don’t spend time with these people. Leave the group and find another group of people (or individuals) who do appreciate you for being you, who are positive, and who are supportive., Identifying good friends and enjoying their company in a crowd or at a party is important to not being lonely in a crowd. Your friends will not only offer you support and make you feel connected to the crowd, but they can act as a bridge to meeting new people., If you don’t connect with one individual or group, look for others. Don’t give up. There are a lot of different people out there. You might find that you feel completely out of place with one group, but totally connect with another group., Sometimes you might not be able to find others who are like you. Instead of withdrawing into yourself, try to view this as a good thing and try to get to know people who are much different from yourself.


You’ll potentially grow as a person.
You might discover that people you share much in common with people you thought are different than you.
You’ll come to appreciate and enjoy diversity and differing opinions much more., If you embrace these labels and use them as an excuse for your loneliness, chances are, nothing will ever change. Studies have shown that people often avoid socializing with people who seem to be shy or withdrawn. Instead:


Try to see yourself as a social person.
View being shy as something that you can overcome.
Realize that there are people like you out there, too."

Arriving early. You can get a chance to talk to people before groups have coalesced, leaving more openings for you. There are also fewer people, which isn't as intimidating. When more people do come, you can walk up to the people you've introduced yourself to.
Arriving late. Everyone's already there, meaning there are also conversations you can just jump into, taking the pressure off of you. You can often blend into a conversation easily and unnoticed. And you can pick whichever one looks the most interesting! You can say or ask questions like: Hey! What's up? or What are you guys talking about?;
, Even the biggest of extroverts sometimes have problems initiating. It's just plain scary -- we're all afraid of getting rejected. So sometimes you'll have to bite the bullet. And you know what you'll find? That most people are at the very least polite. You may not get a red carpet rolled out for you, but it definitely won't be as bad as what's brewing in your head.


How to initiate? Well, for starters eye contact, smiling and body language (which we'll get to next). Then it's just a matter of making a situational comment and jumping off the platform from there. What's a situational comment? Glad you asked.

, This is the kind of comment where you know you two both have it in common. The bus is late, your boss is wearing a dreadful tie, or that chip dip is downright transcendent. It only takes one little sentence to get a conversation brewing. When they give you a response, you simply smile back, tell them your name and ask theirs. Conversation? Initiated. Here's an example of two people in line for coffee:



Jim: ""I cannot believe they've upped the prices again -- better be liquid gold in my latte!""Karen: ""Ugh, I know. I keep on telling myself I'll stop and I never do.""Jim: ""Ha, same here. I'm Jim by the way.""Karen: ""I'm Karen. What's your drink of choice, Jim?""

, Take this in two ways: small comments and small situations. Here's what that means:


Start out with small comments -- in other words, don't wait to make profound, earth-shattering statements to bust into the party with. If you do, you'll be that silent guy that busts into the conversation, taking it to the next level the party was not ready for. Instead, get your foot in the door with an ""I agree,"" ""totally,"" or even an ""I'm not so sure about that."" As with anything, ease into it.
Start out with small situations -- like in line at the cafe. If socializing stresses you out, it's best to do it in places where it will end almost immediately. Think of little opportunities that you could take -- talking to your cashier at the supermarket, people you see on the street or at the bus stop, or whoever you're next to in any line. 5 minutes and it'll all be over with, which is way less scary than an entire night.

, Because if you don't, you'll bore yourself with your own stories. The reason other people have interesting things to talk about is because they open up about their lives and the things they do. It doesn't have to be anything monumental, either. Things as simple as cooking, working out, and reading can spark fascinating conversations. Also don't be afraid to show your personality when in a conversation. If you are silly, show your silly side. Your actions shows the other person how you really feel about a certain situation.


When someone says, ""What did you do today?"" you probably want to respond with something other than, ""Sat at home."" That's fine if you did, but you did so much more than that. When you were surfing the net, did you read anything interesting? Did you cook a meal? Did you see anything remarkable? How can you turn this simple question around?

You really don't even have to answer it, per se. You could easily respond with, ""Oh, man, today was the start of the Olympics! Do you follow it at all?"" Boom -- conversation started with no spotlight on you. The other person won't even notice.



, A large part of making conversation with strangers, acquaintances, even good friends is about staying current with news and trends. These are topics that all parties have at least heard of, so it makes for easier conversation. So take 10 minutes out of your day to read the biggest news stories. Catch a little bit of John Stewart, Tosh.O, the Bachelor, go see the latest hyped-up film, read what's topping the New York Times' Bestseller list, or whatever would get you talking in your social circle.


You don't even have to have well thought-out opinions. People, in general, love being asked questions and talking, so let them do it. When you find out even the littlest bit about them, find an opinion. They like working out? What did they think about that Biggest Loser contestant being so thin? They like pop music? Surely they have an opinion on Miley Cyrus.

, If you do, you'll never put any effort into your social interactions. You'll shut down before they even get started, never giving them a chance. And the truth of the matter is that no one is just like they seem. You could label people by the clothes that they wear or a comment they make, but you'll be wrong about some part of them. Instead, give them a chance to surprise you. You'll learn something in no time.


The more people you meet, initiate with, and get to know, the more fruitful your entire life will be. You'll have more experiences, learn more things, and be more experienced in the world. People are here to make it richer; the more people you invite in, the better off you'll be.

, All this talk will be rendered null and void if you don't use it. You gotta make opportunities to be social. If you don't have parties to crash, sign up for a club. Take an academic class or a class at your gym. Work in cafes. Just get around people. It's the only way to start.


You never know what will lead to bigger and better things. So when you first join that softball league, you'll be making chitchat with your teammates. But eventually you'll be going to team parties and using your social skills on a larger platform. So take these small chances now -- you'll be a social butterfly in time.

, Would you ever approach someone who was grimacing in the corner? Probably not. If you want people to warm up to you, smiling should be your number one priority. It shows people you see them, you're welcoming them, and you're happy to interact with them. Everyone needs a little reassurance, and smiling is just that!


The best thing about smiling? You can do it from across the room. So if you're ever standing in that corner, watching the room, start observing. When you make eye contact with someone, don't quickly avert your gaze. Instead, smile. Who knew the first steps were so easy?

, You've got your face down, now it's time to work on your body. Be aware of keeping it open -- arms uncrossed, legs uncrossed, body positioned toward the people you want to interact with. This is a subtle sign to everyone present that you're open to conversation and looking to interact.


That means putting your phone down, too. The next time you're in a group of strangers, fight the urge to put in your headphones and start playing Angry Birds. There's no way you'll ever meet anyone if you go about your world hearing and seeing only what's right in front of you.

, If you're nervous to do so, you're being too self-consumed. Seriously. The other person is too busy thinking about what they're going to say and how they're coming off to even register insightful thoughts about you, so cut it out! If they're talking to you, be polite and look at them. If you don't, it's like you're ignoring them. You don't intend to come off rudely, so don't!


A good rule of thumb is to look at them when they're saying something that seems important -- at least to them. If you're making comments or if they're just offhand remarks about something, let your gaze wander, but always come back to them. You want to let them know you care about what they're saying. You'd want the same, right?

, Loads of people think socializing is about saying the right things. Turns out that's a very, very small part of it. Once you get good at this social jiujitsu stuff, you might even be able to have conversations without talking a word about yourself. It's more about listening, asking the right questions, and seeming so interested the other person never gets a cue to stop. Where's the pressure in that?!


All you need do is ask a question. Preferably something open-ended, like ""What's a normal day on the job like for you?"" Then when they stumble on something interesting, keep the chain going. Keep asking open-ended, related questions. Show enthusiasm in your face, your tone of voice (even if you're bored out of your mind) and they'll practically sop up the attention. Here's an example:


Karen: ""What's a normal day on the job like you for, Jim?""Jim: ""Oh you know, the paper-selling business isn't super eventful, but my boss keeps it interesting. He's constantly wandering around, checking up on us, so I've gotten my fake phone call voice down pat when I'm actually playing Candy Crush.""Karen: ""No way! That's terrible! ...But I do the exact same thing. He's never once caught you?!""



, Because people luh-uh-uh-ve to hear them. Hearing ""How are you?"" is good, but hearing, ""How are you, Karen?"" (...if your name is Karen, that is) feels so much more personal. Insert them whenever you can. It'll help you remember them, too!


When you're first meeting people, this is doubly important. You can make someone feel like the only person in the entire world by using their name. When you find out their name, say it. Insert it into the conversation once or twice, and then make sure you say it at the end, too. ""It was lovely to meet you, Jim. Let's chat again soon!"" just sounds more genuine and not at all trite. You'll be sure to leave a lasting, good, impression.

, All this really is is observation -- a skill you're definitely capable of if you're reading this. Think of yourself as a layman's Sherlock Holmes. What can you gather about a person without really talking to them? There are two facets to consider:


What is their body saying? Are they tired? Anxious? Facing the door? Glancing around the room? Bored? You can gain a lot from their facial expressions and how their body is positioned and where they're positioned in the room.
What can you gauge about their dress? Nice watch, nice shoes? Unkempt hair? Wedding ring? Scars? Headphones, coffee cup, piercings? There are often tells that we don't even notice. Use these to your advantage!

, This one comes last because it matters, but it's not a huge deal. If Barack Obama walked into a party in a clown suit, he would still be charismatic and a people person, you know? But if you're meeting strangers for the first time, it's best to dress like you fit in. Not necessarily nice, just to fit in. Whatever that means for where you are.


The only consistency between circumstances, really, is being hygienic. In some scenarios a t-shirt and jeans is all that's required; in others, it's a suit and tie. But wherever you are, for God's sake, shower. You could be the next Einstein and no one would give you the time of day if you smelled bad.

, For most of us that suck at socializing, it's because it's just plain awkward. The awkwardness can get so bad we'd rather be gnawing through our right arm than deal with it any longer. You'd swear it walked in the door right behind you. But in reality (or whatever exists outside your imagination), that's your nerves. That's all it is. If your nerves were to go away, so would the awkwardness.


Yeah, yeah, yeah, knowing nerves breed awkwardness won't get you anywhere. But it can open up your mind to seeing how it works. We all know that guy who can rock an awkwardly-placed mustard stain, we all know that chick who makes bedhead look like a thing. How is that possible? They roll with it. They don't let it bother them. That's all.
How do you stop these things from bothering you? A good rule of thumb is: If you know in advance that something is ""off"" and will bother or distract you, fix it. For example, if you are going to a job interview or a party and you think your shirt is a bit short, wear a different one if you think you'll be pulling on it all the time. Fidgeting with clothes only draws attention to what is (in your mind) wrong with them, or to the fact that you're uncomfortable and nervous. If something happens spontaneously that you were not prepared for (like the mustard stain mentioned earlier), and you can't fix it completely, pretend it doesn't exist. Seriously. If you don't look at it, touch it, rub it, or constantly try to hide it, chances are your conversation partner will not even notice it. They will be looking at your face and your hands while you talk and listening to you.

, Actual get-rid-of-nerves material. If you go in with positive expectations, it's a lot harder to get nervous. Say you walk into a group of people that you're pretty confident you'll mesh with. They're awesome, you're awesome and it will be awesome. When you get an awkwardly-placed mustard stain on your pants, it's no biggie. Why? Because you don't let it.


Life is more like a self-fulfilling prophecy than we realize. Seriously. Studies show that those who think they'll be more successful are.If you get in a good place, you'll be more likely to evoke positive interactions. And negativity is just plain repelling.

, Because happy, fun people are the types that others naturally gravitate to. If you can enjoy your own company, there's no reason others can't, won't, or shouldn't. If you already enjoy your own company (you are pretty great and all), this should just give you ammo, solidifying the belief that this not-able-to-socialize thing is just in your head.


Though no one can really tell you how to do this, the easiest way to get started on that path is by doing things you enjoy. The more you can be pleased with yourself and the life you're cultivating, the happier you'll be with who you are.

, Odds are you either suck at socializing or you just plain don't like it. Or you're on this page for kicks, wondering what it could possible have to say. Let's ignore that last part and delve into why you suck or why you don't like it. Tackling the reason is the quickest way to get results. Here's a few potential causes:


You literally don't know how. If this is your problem, awesome. There are pretty standard patterns you can follow to fake it effectively.
You don't like small talk. Good news! This is pretty easy to circumvent. You just have to be willing to steer the conversation.
It stresses you out. For this one, it's important to force yourself to relax. Luckily you have control over your body and how it feels, so you can make efforts to change this.
You just don't like people. Well, for starters, let's get to finding better ones! But since we're making do with what's available, we'll concentrate on focusing on the good. It's there somewhere.

, You know yourself better than everyone else. When you've pinpointed what's keeping you from being successful socially, you can combat it. Let's take those four scenarios:


You don't know how. What you'll need to concentrate on is the patterns and habits we'll be discussing further on down this page. Practice makes habit, after all. You'll just need to practice.
You don't like small talk. You don't have to do a dang thing you don't want to do, which is the beauty of it. In fact, most people hate small talk. It's just that no one is willing to steer a conversation to deeper more meaningful topics. You gotta take the leap.
It stresses you out. You'll need to concentrate on bodily factors -- deep, slow breathing, focusing on something external, smiling, and taking it one bit at a time. It's also a good idea to relax when you're alone, just to get in the zen zone.
You just don't like people. Hate to break it to you, Holden Caulfield, but there are people out there who don't suck -- you just need to give them the time of day. It'll be a conscious effort to not write people off because of the shoes they're wearing or the comment they made on how unique Whole Foods is. And yes, it is totally doable.

They worry about whether or not people like them, whether they're making a good impression, or whether people are bored by them.


You may think that some people around you just naturally exude confidence and never have to worry about how they come off, but every person is insecure about some aspect of social interaction. We all want to be liked and have friends.;
, For many people who experience social awkwardness, the feelings stem from anxiety, fear, insecurity, or low self-confidence. Each of these sources can be tackled if you're willing to push your boundaries a little at a time and to find ways to build your confidence. In each case, try to identify the root cause of what's making you feel awkward so that you can address it directly. The sooner you know the real source, the sooner you can get to tackling it.


There are many other reasons for feeling self-conscious, such as having had a bad past experience, feeling that you're not understood, feeling pressure to interact in situations (such as work, peers, or parental pressure, etc.), or feeling confused about the motivations and actions of those around you.

, Being shy can really inhibit your social interactions. Shyness can vary from feeling shy around all people, or just certain groups. You may be reluctant to interact for fear of embarrassment.You can work on feeling more relaxed during social interactions and coming out of your shell a bit more.


If you are shy, you may want to participate in social events but feel afraid of being embarrassed or left out.
See How to Overcome Shyness for more information and realize that shyness is something that can be managed.

, Though it may sound easier said than done, one major way to avoid social awkwardness is to stop caring about how others perceive you. Most people are worrying what others think of them, which is something worth reminding yourself when you start to worry about what other people think of you.If you're too busy worrying about what the person you're talking to really thinks of you, then you'll never be able to relax or to enjoy a social interaction. Once you let go of this worry, you'll find it easier to be yourself and to speak calmly and naturally.


Remind yourself which opinions matter. Maybe one person didn’t like you, but will you see this person again? As for your friends, real friends will stick with you, even if you mess up here and there.

, Social anxiety is a disorder in which a person is not able to function in daily life, including at school, work, or social events. A person suffering from social anxiety tends to keep close to family and trusted friends and avoid all public interpersonal relationships. Social anxiety stems from a constant fear that other people are scrutinizing the sufferer in order to humiliate or embarrass them.For more information about social anxiety and how to treat it, check out How to Overcome Social Anxiety.

, Be conscious about when you feel awkward. By being more aware of your own bodily sensations when you're feeling awkward and anxious, you can consciously recognize that your adrenaline is flooding you and causing you to want to run or hide.


Be aware if you feel unusually warm, sweaty, jumpy, uneasy, or overly aware of your body. Watch your thoughts and see if they are overly critical of your social performance. Also watch your emotions, whether you feel helpless or ineffective. Get in tune with these feelings so you can learn to identify them.

, Self talk will help you to shift the focus from worrying about what others are thinking of you and back onto calming yourself so that you can project a sense of ease with yourself.Some of the things that can be helpful in overcoming moments of social anxiety include:


""I’m going to be okay. My feelings are not always rational, so I can relax and calm myself.""
""I am paying too much attention to my bad feelings in my body.""
""People are nice and I'm having fun being around them.""
""I am here to enjoy myself.""

, Learning to relax should begin at home, where you're most comfortable. Relaxing before you go into a social situation can help you open up more, be honest with people, and to let your guard down when you're in a social setting. If you're not feeling tense, you'll also be more likely to embrace social situations instead of fearing them. Plus, relaxation will help calm any anxiety you may be feeling.Practice deep breathing to overcome moments of anxiety.

, Random unpleasant and downright embarrassing things happen. Lighten up and see the funnier side of awkward moments. Not only will doing so help you to place such occurrences into better perspective but humor will often break tension, allowing people to laugh with you, not at you. One of the best things you can do to avoid being socially awkward is to stop taking yourself so seriously. This will take the pressure off and will help you relax.


Often we don't have control over awkward situations, such as the long silent gap in a conversation, the inelegant and noisy passing of wind when we least expect it, and the trip over the edge of the rug as we walk up to accept an award. Choose to laugh it off.

, While socially awkward moments can tend to make us focus on everything that is going wrong at that time, it is helpful to deliberately make yourself focus on the positives. What is going well around you right now? Pinpointing some positives can help restore your perspective about how minimal the awkward occurrence is in the greater scheme of things.Be careful not to heighten the relevance of one bad occasion and apply it to your general impression of social interactions; focus as much as possible on all of the social interactions that you have enjoyed, that have worked out just fine.

, Even if you don't feel confident, you can either fake it until you make it or you can remind yourself to be friendly as much as possible. It is definitely hard to find confidence in situations that bring up fears, anxiety, panic and a desire to hide or run away.Asking yourself, ""What's the worst that could happen?"" and trying to do at least one thing to engage with others around you is a good start. Chances are, the worst thing won’t happen!
Read How to Build Your Self Confidence for suggestions on improving your personal confidence.

, Being socially awkward is not a state of being, it's a temporary phase. You will move through any particular incident and you will experience many more positive experiences in its place. Everyone makes mistakes and everyone has at least one mortifying experience they can recount. It's a sign of self-kindness that you can look back on such occasions with a smile and realize that it didn't break you but is now a rather entertaining dinner table tale.

, If you don't feel ready to jump into a conversation with a witty anecdote, there are still other ways to connect with others: become an active listener. This relieves some of the pressure of social interactions, because you don't have to worry about sounding smart or interesting; you just need to listen carefully and ask questions. Remember, people love talking about themselves, especially if the other person appears to be really taking an interest.When actively listening, show the other person that you are engaged by paraphrasing their message and repeating it back. You can say something like: ""So, it sounds like what you're saying is...""
Ask follow-up questions. You don't want to get inappropriate or too personal, but continue asking the person questions or their opinions.
Show the person you are listening by nodding, making good eye contact, an making sounds or saying words that affirm you are listening (like ""Uh-huh"" or ""Sure"").

, Don’t look closed off, but instead, invite people in by showing that you are open and welcoming. The body communicates this easily. By crossing your arms or legs, it appears as if you are disinterested in social interactions. If you avoid eye contact, this also makes you appear disinterested. Be careful not to cross your body, slouch, or keep your head down, and instead engage in eye contact and maintain an open body posture., Making small talk is what can help you get people to open up, and to have short conversations with people you have just met.Ask people how they are or how their day is going.
Search for common ground. Find casual ways to find out if you and the person root for the same sports teams, watch the same shows, or have the same pets.
Use your environment to help you. If you run into the person in a coffee shop, ask if she's tried the amazing baked goods. If you're outside and it's a gorgeous day, ask the person if he's going to take advantage of the beautiful weather to do something fun outdoors.

, Assuming that someone wants to connect with you allows you to be more open and friendly toward other people. While it's true that no matter how friendly you are, some people will respond as if their mouth and mind are perpetually soured, this isn't a reason to scuttle off or blame yourself. After all, you are not responsible for the behavior of other people. They could have a difficult background or they might be having a bad day. Either way, it's not a reflection of how you are as a person. By being friendly you will put others at ease, find ways to break the ice, and give others the freedom to be more open and vulnerable around you.

, Telling a joke at the wrong time can blow your ""social cred"" right out of the water and leave you looking awkward. Yet, telling one at just the right time, with just the right tone can smooth over even the most tense moment.


Get a feel for the situation. If things are a little heavy, the perfect joke can lighten the mood. But if people are having a really serious discussion like discussing the deaths of their grandparents, then you should back off with the humor until the tone of the conversation changes a bit.

, When it comes to giving compliments, the most important thing is to keep them sincere and drop them at the right moments. If you're not genuine, don't compliment. I you're a beginner in complimenting, watch others for timing of compliments and follow suit. You can compliment a person's jewellery, sweater, or new haircut, and move on to give deeper compliments as you get to know the person better.


Complimenting an aspect of a person's personality, such as telling your friend that he has a great sense of humor or that he's good at talking to new people, can make a person feel more special than a compliment about physical appearance.
If you're complimenting something physical, make sure it doesn't come off the wrong way. If you're complimenting somebody's appearance, stick to their face or hair and avoid complimenting their body or your comment may come off sounding more forward than you intended.

, Though every social situation is different, there are a few key things that you may want to avoid when it comes to being socially savvy. There are certain comments or actions that tend to come off as socially awkward and are worth avoiding if you want to feel comfortable around other people. Here are some things to watch out for:


Avoid saying that you're so awkward. You can guess the outcome.
Avoid asking people overly personal questions if you don't know them very well, like why they're not dating anyone or if they've gained weight.
While you don't have to stand miles apart from other people, give people space.

, If you don't know the social norms for the group you're spending time with, make the effort to learn them. Not knowing social norms can leave you feeling socially awkward. This is especially relevant when visiting a different part of your country or going to a different country. Use good manners and don’t forget to say “please” and “thank you.”, Staying at home, behind your computer screen, hidden behind your cubicle barrier, or dodging lunch dates won't help you to avoid socially awkward moments.If you spend most of your time at home or in front of the computer for fear of interacting with people, then you'll never be able to work on your social skills.


Realize that some people are snobby or standoffish. They are not the norm, nor do they represent a reason for hiding away. For such people, learn a simple way of detaching yourself with dignity, such as a quick nod and an ""It was nice to meet you"" before swiftly turning your back on them.
Learn How to End a Conversation as well as how to have one. For many people, it is ending a conversation that is going nowhere or that is excruciatingly boring that leaves a sense of awkwardness, out of fear of appearing rude or uncaring.

, Groom yourself well, and put on the best clothes you have. First impressions are often formed from the way you look, and first impressions can be hard to break, so be sure to use it to your advantage.

,, When walking into the room, have a look around. Scan the room and see who you want to go up and talk to. Make sure you get moving straight away as the longer you stand still, the harder it is to get going, and the less time you have to mingle.

, No matter where you are (but hopefully always near people) send out signals that you're friendly, and you want to talk.

, To show the person who is speaking that you are listening, use eye contact and nod as they talk, pacing it in time with their speech. Don't look away as this gives the impression that you are getting bored or distracted. Face them front on and make sure your gestures are in pace with theirs. Also, mirror their gestures and this will make you look like a good listener. See also How to Build Rapport.

, Look for the biggest gap in the group, stand in this gap and look at the people either side of you. Then direct your active listening signals to the speaker. Don't interrupt, but join in with the pace of the group, copying the rest of the group, which will create bonding. Wait until the speaker has finished, then talk about something they have just said, so you tag their conversation. Then start speaking, but introduce yourself quickly to the other people first.

, Don't keep standing there. Wait a few seconds, and if the conversation goes in a direction that excludes you, pretend to wave to someone across the room and make a quick exit from the group.

, Even though it's the most primitive sign of introduction, it's easy to forget to do it. A good, genuine looking smile will make you look more positive and approachable. Smile with your eyes as well as your mouth.

, If it's a big party, this might not help. See also How to Remember Peoples' Names.

, Tell them it was nice meeting them and, depending on the nature of the party, get phone numbers or business cards.

, It is helpful to mention something you discussed with them during the party.

Use your breath.,
Relax.",How to Be Comfortable Around Strangers," Sometimes the hardest part is breaking the ice; then the rest is smooth sailing. For example, attempt to shake someone’s hand first, say hello to someone first, or go up to someone and introduce yourself.


It’s normal to fear approaching someone you don’t know because you may bother him or her. However, people tend to enjoy talking with strangers, both the person initiating conversations and the person being approached.You may make someone’s day!;
, Smiling helps break any tension between you and the person you're talking to. Smiling with a twinkle in your eye allows you to appear open and welcoming.When you feel tense or nervous, smile and tell yourself it’ll be okay.


Don't forget, the person you’re speaking with may be nervous like you. Smiling can make both you and the person you’re talking to feel more at ease.

, While going up to someone on the subway and introducing yourself may be a bit odd, introducing yourself to someone at a party, business or networking event is completely appropriate. When you introduce yourself, give a little information about yourself that is context-appropriate. For instance, if you’re at a party, introduce yourself and say who you know. If you’re at a business or networking event, introduce yourself and say what company/specialty you are associated.


To strangers or friends of friends at a social function, say, “Hi, I’m Ana. I’m friends with Svetlana. Did she invite you, too?”
To business colleagues, say, “Hello, I’m Pedro. I work in marketing. What department do you work at?”

, Generally, people love to receive compliments. If you want to break the ice and make someone feel good, pay a compliment. Keep compliments sincere and not fake for the sake of trying to impress someone. If you want to start a conversation, you can follow up on your compliment, such as, “I really like your jacket, where did you get it?” or “That’s a great painting, did you paint it?”


While compliments can be nice, they can also reach a creepy level when pursued heavily, overly-repeated, or overly-given. Stick with one compliment.

, Asking a question is a great way to an “in” with conversation. If you’re new to a gym, ask where the locker room is, or where you can find a towel, or what exercise class is best. If you’re buying a gift for someone, ask a stranger her opinion on an item. Even asking small questions to people you don’t know can help you boost your confidence in being around strangers. You can ask questions to get to know someone, too.


Some standard questions to say when you first meet someone are, “Where are you from?” or “What do you do for a living/what do you study in school?” or “What do you do for fun?”
For more help in asking questions, check out How to Ask Open Ended Questions.

, There are lots of things that can unite strangers, from working at the same company, sharing a vegetarian diet, having a dog or cat, and living in the same neighborhood. Capitalize on these similarities and strike up a conversation. It feels good to connect with someone you share similarities with, and who knows, maybe you’ll make a new friend.


If you see someone else with a dog while you’re outside with your own dog, you can stop and ask about the dog. Often people who love animals love to talk about their pets and relate with other people who have a pet.
You may notice someone’s shirt that’s from the same university you attended, or see someone wearing a sweatshirt that supports the same sports team you love. Ask “When did you go to university?”, “What did you study? and “What activities did you participated in while at school?” There’s plenty to connect you!

, You don’t have to become a copycat, but notice the visual cues the people provide as to how they feel. Read their body language to determine if they feel nervous, scared, stressed, or calm.You’ll most likely find that many feel people feel uncomfortable around strangers, much like yourself.


Once you start paying attention to other people’s body language, you can start responding in an appropriate way that matches their feeling state.

, While it’s important to read other people’s visual cues, be aware of your own, too. If you stand in a corner looking down with your arms crossed, it’s unlikely anyone will approach you in conversation. However, if you smile, keep your head up, and have approachable body language, people may feel more at ease with you and welcome a conversation.


Keep your hands loosely in your lap (if sitting) or comfortably by your sides while standing.Fidgeting with your hands may make you appear nervous or bored. If you feel uncomfortable with your hands or arms, hold a drink or food if it is offered.
If you’re sitting, don’t tightly cross your legs, yet don’t keep them overly splayed. You want to find the “happy medium” of appearing approachable yet not sloppy or disinterested.If your legs start to shake, gently cross your legs at the ankles.

, Practice monitoring socially acceptable boundaries. Avoid standing overly close to people and making people feel physically uncomfortable. Also, monitor the give and take of conversations. Don’t overshare personal details or monopolize the conversation. Take turns talking and listening.If you notice yourself doing more talking than listening, start to ask open-ended questions to allow the other person an opportunity to speak.
Don’t share overly personal details about your life. While this may be fine (and funny) around friends, keep the personal things about wart removal, your “crazy” sister, and all of your life’s hardships for a more appropriate conversation.

, Sometimes admitting that you feel nervous can break the ice. If you’re on a blind date and it’s not flowing, say, “I’m sorry I’ve been acting weird, it’s just that I feel really nervous right now.” Sometimes this can relieve both you and the other person. They may say, “Whew! Good, I’m glad it’s not just me who’s nervous!”


Admitting your own feelings can make you and the other person more comfortable, and he or she may see that you are relatable.

, When you feel uncomfortable, it’s common to put all of your attention on your feelings of discomfort, your awkwardness, and get wrapped up in your own experience. When you notice yourself absorbed in discomfort, turn your attention outward into your surroundings. Notice the setting, observe the people around you, and listen to other people’s conversations. By putting your focus outside of yourself, it’ll help you disengage from negative thoughts., If someone strikes up a conversation with you, try imagining that he or she is one of your friends. Give the interaction a chance by engaging the other person, asking questions, and showing interest. If you feel really uncomfortable, end the conversation in as inoffensive way as possible.


If you need to end a conversation, say, “Thanks for talking. I’m about to leave, but perhaps we will see each other later.” or “I appreciate your time. Goodbye.”

, Feeling comfortable around others means feeling comfortable with yourself, too. If you feel insecure in who you are, other people will pick up on that in social interactions.Find activities that boost your self-confidence or allow you to develop self-confidence, and know that you can transfer those feelings to your social interactions.


Maybe you’re an excellent water skier, ballet dancer, or model car builder. If you feel anxious or uncomfortable, tap into the feelings of confidence that other activities give you to help put yourself at ease.

, You can say, “I may really enjoy myself, and I give myself permission to have a good time” or “I can work on feeling awkward by practicing new skills.”


Don’t talk yourself out of going to social events just because you feel uncomfortable. Anytime you are on the fence about going, use positive self-talk to encourage you to go. Think of it as an adventure to push yourself beyond your comfort zone.
Remember that you’re practicing social ‘’skills’’, not social talents. Give yourself time to adjust to more positive self-talk.
You may find yourself catastrophizing (“This will be so horrible” or “I bet no one will be there, and I’ll be alone and feel so out of place”) but learn to ignore these thoughts and return your focus to more positive thoughts.

, Sometimes you get along great with people, and other times you may just not click. If you find yourself not clicking with someone, remember that this is an isolated circumstance, and it doesn’t mean you’re socially awkward, that you’re bad at conversation, or that people don’t like you. If you’re worried about how people will respond to you or if you’ll be judged, remind yourself not to assign heavy value to the opinion’s of others.Say to yourself, “People’s opinions of me don’t define my identity. They are entitled to their opinions as I am to my own.”

, If you start feeling anxious around new people, tune into your body, especially your breath. You may notice your breathing quicken or feel more restricted. Calm your mind by calming your breath.Take a deep inhale, hold it for a few seconds, then let the breath leave your body slowly. Repeat as necessary.

, Learn to identify your stressful triggers and use relaxation techniques to calm yourself. This is especially helpful before you approach a social situation. Techniques such as meditation and yoga can help calm you down before you meet new people.When you notice your body tensing up before a social event or meeting, take note of the feelings and learn to relax your body. Notice the tension (perhaps in your shoulders or neck) and consciously release it.
Have specific techniques you use before you go out to meet new people. If you have to attend a work function, spend a little time before the event in meditation, or go to a yoga class beforehand. Plan out your day so that you can approach the situation in the best possible mindset.

Think of a character.,
Make your character interesting.,
Get inside their head.,
Write.",How to Create a Compelling Character," The first thing that you obviously must do is to think of a character that you would like to write about. Now, this may sound easy- i.e. George was 5’10 and average weight, worked in an office from nine to five, had a wife named Martha with three kids, and likes to eat Papa John’s and watch NFL. Yes, this a character, but do we really want to read about George? Most of us would agree that no, we would not. So how do you make someone a little more interesting than Ol’ George? One word: complexity. A character must be complex in order for that character to make an impression on the reader, and that’s what the ultimate goal is. There are several ways in which to make a character complex, which will be discussed in the next step.;
, Where do you most often see a homeless person eating dinner? You’re probably thinking maybe McDonald’s, out of a can, or not eating at all. But what if you saw a homeless person dining at a five-star restaurant, and dabbing his scratchy beard with a silk napkin? And what if that homeless person drove a Bentley to his box behind the King Soopers? This hobo has just gotten a great deal more interesting. This means that when the character’s appearance is conflicting with his thought’s or actions. This means that it makes the reader wonder how or why this is happening. This can be applied to all sorts of characters: alter boys who deal cocaine, gangsters who volunteer at kitten shelters, or Grandmothers who drop ecstasy. You should read about these people instead of their stereotypes.

, Now that you have your character and you know what makes them interesting, you must now actually have to start to write about them. To make this character three-dimensional, though, you must know how that character would function in difference sorts of situations. One technique to use to get to know your character is to map out a typical day in their life. The ecstasy-dropping grandmother will be used as an example- Nana wakes up at 5:30 A.M. every morning right next to her orange tabby, Simon. She feeds Simon and gives him his flea medicine before taking her own heart, bladder, kidney, liver, and arthritis medication. She has a small meal of a boiled egg and toast and then teeters her way downstairs to check the mail. She makes French Breakfast tea in an iron kettle and reads Jane Eyre until the late afternoon where she goes upstairs to change her clothes. She puts on a tie-dye shirt with pink fishnet leggings and spandex gloves that go all the way up her arms. She breaks some glow sticks around her neck and then goes outside to hop in the Mustang owned by her twenty-three year old boyfriend, Blane. They drop two pills of ecstasy each while doing ninety on the freeway on the way to Coachella. They party until 4 A.M. when Blane drops her back off at her house. She changes into her nightgown and slips into bed, while Simon snuggles next to her. She then wakes up at 5:30 A.M. to start it all over again. Having this basic foundation of what your character would do on an average day will help you determine how they would act if the situation they were in changed.

, Now that you know your character like you know yourself, you can finally do what you have wanted to all along, and that is to write!

Think of the topic you want to write your article about.,
Always remember proper grammar, punctuation, and spelling.,
Use elevated diction.,
Describe it for them.,
Don't write an article if you don't know what you're doing.,
Keep opinions personal.,
Keep the introduction short and to the point.",How to Create a Good Article," Writing about topics that are relevant to your interests is always a good start, and makes the article more accurate. Write about something that inspires you, or that you like to do.;
, The mechanics are very important when it comes to writing an article that people want to read. Please, for the sake of the sanity of Grammar Nazis everywhere, write carefully.

, ""What's that?"" you may ask. Elevated diction means, simply put, the ""big words."" Flaunting a wide vocabulary is acceptable in most articles and topics.

, Use descriptive terms and phrases to further explain what you're instructing them to do. Your audience can't read your mind, so when you say, ""put the thingy in the metal hot box,"" they have no idea what you mean. Instead, say, ""carefully place the bread in the toaster,"" or something to that effect.

, Writing articles about something you're totally unfamiliar with is pointless. Why would you tell someone how to solve a Rubik's cube if you don't even know what that is? Likewise, don't write an article on how to crochet a model of the Eiffel tower if you can't figure out how to tie your shoes.

, Don't make the article about how much you hate cats, or what kind of personalities you can't stand. Make it an honest instructional article about how to complete a task.

, Less is more- nobody will read the introduction if it's longer than the constitution, so keep it minimal. Inform the reader of what topics the article covers, and be done with it. Keep it down to about five sentences or less.

Calm yourself.,
Ask your teacher what you did that got you accused of plagiarism.,
Apologize.,
Recognize that the fault is your own.,
Try to ask your teacher for leniency.,
Do a thorough read-up on plagiarism.,
Cite all future assignments properly.",How to Cope with Having Accidentally Plagiarized," At this stage, you will inevitably feel not only shocked, but also confused and bewildered.  You know yourself as an honest student who would never dream of taking another's work and passing it off as your own.  However, if your teacher is claiming you did in fact do this, there's almost certainly some subtle way in which you did that you weren't aware of.  You can take a few deep breaths or ask your teacher for a minute or so of silence to calm yourself and reflect on your feelings.;
, Your teacher may have indicated on your paper what constituted plagiarism, but if not, be sure to ask your teacher what went wrong:Did you forget to cite a source?
Did you cite a source, or all your sources, improperly or inadequately?
Did you forget to write quotation marks around a direct quote?
Was your paraphrasing too close to the original?
 Did you leave something un-cited because you thought it was common knowledge, but your teacher didn't think it was?
These are common pitfalls of accidental plagiarism that all students should learn to avoid.  In addition to clarifying with your teacher how you plagiarized in this particular incident, also ask your teacher to go over with you the complete definition of what constitutes plagiarism so that you don't plagiarize again in the future.  The punishment for a second bout of plagiarism is often much more severe than the first, and the second time around, you may be given an automatic F in the course, not the assignment.

, Tell your teacher (and also mean it) that you are sorry you plagiarized your paper, albeit unintentionally.  Inform your teacher that you know that plagiarism is wrong, that you are really an honest student, and that you didn't mean to plagiarize.  If this is the case, and your teacher believes you are being sincere, (s)he may deal with your case more leniently, such as allowing you to redo the paper, letting you off with a warning, or taking a certain percentage of marks off.

 

However, do not hope or expect your teacher to be lenient on you.  Your teacher still has authority over you, and your school probably has a strict set of rules on how to deal with cases (even accidental ones) of plagiarism.

, Do not blame your teacher for being ""uptight"" or blame your school for having ""overly strict rules.""  Recognize that you, and only you, are to blame for this incident.  You did plagiarize.  You were expected to know better, but you ended up plagiarizing anyway.  Don't stay mad at yourself forever over this incident, or go on kicking yourself, but be prepared to take the blame and admit that you are in the wrong.

, Emphasis on ""try"" and do not beg your teacher either.  Simply ask your teacher if, just this once, you might be allowed to redo the paper in a fully non-plagiarized way, now that you've clarified where you went wrong.  If your teacher says 'no' you must accept that.  Ultimately, you must accept whatever position your teacher gives.  If your teacher insists that you must receive a '0' or an 'F' on this paper for the plagiarism, you must accept that.  Try to improve your overall grade at the end of the course by doing well on assignments and tests in the future to make up for the '0'.

, Either ask your teacher for a complete, thorough analysis of what constitutes plagiarism and how to avoid it, or ask for any book or online resources on the subject.  The more knowledge you have, the more readily you will be able to write original work, and cite what needs to be cited, and the less likely you will be to accidentally plagiarize in the future.

, Use your new knowledge whenever you do an assignment or paper in the future to not plagiarize again.

Address the audience's needs and objectives.",How to Conduct Audience Analysis," In other words, who will be reading this document? You probably won't be able to provide a detailed answer to this question yet; that's why you're doing an audience analysis. You should, however, be able to answer the question in general terms.For example, will your document be read by someone trying to install some shelves? Employees of a certain company? Computer programmers trying to work out a bug in some new software?
Consider why this audience will be reading your document. What task will it help them perform, or what do they need to know?

, Depending on who you're writing for, there are different types of information that it will be helpful for you as you work to make your document as useful and/or persuasive as possible.


You will almost always want to ascertain your audience's levels of knowledge about and interest in the topic.Depending on the audience, the situation, and the type of document you are preparing, there are many other pieces of information that might be valuable, such as where the audience is likely to read your document, and a variety of demographic factors such as age, gender, education, professional background, cultural background, and so on., Your audience analysis can be formal (i.e. using a survey or other questionnaire, structured interviews, etc.) or informal (i.e. based on more casual conversations with members of the audience). The best method will depend on the audience you are trying to reach, how much information you need about them, and what resources you have available for conducting your analysis.Sometimes, you may be able to find information that someone else has already collected in the form of surveys or marketing research that can stand in for collecting your own data.

, Your analytical tool is the instrument you'll use to gather your information, e.g. your actual questionnaire or interview questions. The content should be driven by your brainstorming in step two.


Try to avoid creating questions that lead your participants toward a given answer, even if you think it is correct. For example: ""Now that we've shown you how effective our product can be, how likely are you to buy it?"" or ""How do you feel about the president's oppressive tax policies?""
Avoid ""double barreled"" questions. Questions that ask about more than one thing at a time may confuse your participants or result in unreliable data.For example, you shouldn't ask: ""How often do you read articles about science and share them with other people?"" Instead, break this into two questions: ""How often do you read articles about science?"" and ""How often do you share articles about science with other people?""
If you use a survey, keep it as simple and short as possible. , Once you've decided which questions to ask, it's time to decide who you should ask them to. If you can't include everyone in the audience in your analysis, try to select a group of individuals who you think are representative of the audience you hope to understand.


For example, if you think your audience is mostly women, try to select a sample that reflects that.
Other characteristics that might be useful in selecting participants could be their occupation or employer (especially if you are writing something for people in a particular field), their ethnic backgrounds, the city or neighborhood in which they live, or their membership in a particular organization.
Which characteristics are most important will vary based on the type of document you are producing and the audience you are hoping to reach.

, Conduct your survey, interviews, or conversations with potential audience members.


If you are using a survey, you may want to let your participants remain anonymous, especially if you are asking them about anything sensitive or personal. This can lead to more honest responses.If you are interviewing participants in person, you may find it useful to ask clarifying questions or probe for more information by saying things like ""can you tell me more about that?"" or ""tell me why you feel that way."" At the same time, how you conduct the interviews can affect how people answer your questions, so you'll need to work hard not to show your own biases or make your participants feel like they should answer in a particular way.For interviews or informal conversations, it's often a good idea to record the conversation for later reference, if your participants agree to this. Never record anyone without their permission, as this may be a violation of state law., Now it's time to have a look at the information you've collected and see what it tells you about your audience. How knowledgeable or interested are they about the topic you'll be writing about? How old is the average person in your sample? What proportion of them subscribe to the publication you are writing for?


If you need to conduct in-depth statistical analyses of your data, there are software programs that can help you, such as Stata or SPSS. These programs are costly though, and for most purposes, calculating simple percentages is more than adequate. Common applications like Excel can help you with organizing and analyzing your data. Putting your questions across the top row in a data sheet and then placing each participant's responses in the rows below will allow you to quickly summarize the range of responses you got for each question.
If your analytical tool used open-ended questions, i.e. questions that do not specify a limited range of possible answers (for example ""How do you feel about Company X?""), you will probably want to classify people's responses into categories (for example: ""skeptical,"" ""hostile,"" ""uncertain,"" or ""positive"") so that you can summarize how large numbers of your participants responded (e.g. ""the majority had a negative impression of Company X"").

, Once you've analyzed your data, collect your findings into a single document that summarizes who your audience is and what their needs are. Putting this together will help you organize your thoughts and create a coherent picture in your mind of who your audience is.The sample document at the top of this article is a good example of an audience profile.

, Depending on your audience, some formats might be more effective than others. If this decision hasn't already been made for you by your employer, pick a format you think will be appropriate for your audience.


If your audience will be reading your document while carrying out a task, a technical manual or instruction sheet made up of bullet points and possibly diagrams may be most effective.On the other hand, if you are hoping to inform professionals about new research in their field, an article or newsletter format might be best., Before you actually write your document, create an outline to organize and plan your content. This will not only make writing easier, it's also a good way to ensure that the information you have deemed most important will all be present, and that it will be organized in a way that will make sense to your audience.Outlines are also a good way of developing headings for the different sections in your document, which will be useful in helping readers identify the key pieces of information they are looking for., One of the most valuable things about audience analysis is that it allows you to select a writing voice that will be compelling and effective for reaching your audience. The right choice of words and sentence structure can make a big difference in getting your message across to your audience.


For example, if your audience is highly educated and/or well versed in the topic you are writing about, the use of highly specific and technical vocabulary may be acceptable or even helpful. If your audience is not well informed about your topic, such language should be avoided.
Likewise, if your audience is likely to be reading your work while carrying out a specific task or in a work environment with many distractions, the use of short, simple sentences is advisable. If they'll be reading your work at home and giving it their undivided attention, varying sentence length and structure will make your writing more compelling and enjoyable., Most importantly, knowing what your audience hopes to learn from the document you are crafting will allow you to make sure that the information they need most is presented in a way that is easy for them to locate and understand."

Use other senses.,
Begin writing the prompt.,

Experiment with writing prompts for all kinds of writing.",How to Come Up with a Writing Prompt," First, take some time to brainstorm. Write down anything that comes to mind. Anything can lead to a writing prompt, so just start writing down ideas. Some ideas to help you start generating random ideas include:


What’s something funny that’s happened to you in recent memory? Maybe you saw a dog ride down the street on a skateboard.
What’s a unique story you have from childhood? Maybe you stuck tweezers in an electrical socket and lived to tell the tale.
What’s a weird situation you’ve found yourself in? Maybe you literally ran into the CEO of a company and both bumped your head, while you were walking to your interview with that person.;
, Alternatively, you can create something not based on your experience. Try to come up with an odd or interesting situation or simply a “What if?” question, such as


“What if dolls came to life when you left the room?”
”What if people had tails?”
”What if the sky was electric purple?”

, When you come up with an idea that you like, develop it a bit. If you think the weird situation you found yourself in could be a good prompt, start branching off from that idea. Write down all the details you can. Ask yourself:


What about it made it weird?
Would other people find it weird?
How did the situation turn out?

, Writing prompts don’t have to be stories. Try using a quote as a writing prompt. For instance, you could use a funny quote, like this one from Yogi Berra: ""Half the lies they tell about me aren't true."" You could also use a piece of someone else’s writing, such as this one from Jane Austen’s Mansfield Park:


""There will be little rubs and disappointments everywhere, and we are all apt to expect too much; but then, if one scheme of happiness fails, human nature turns to another; if the first calculation is wrong, we make a second better: we find comfort somewhere.""

, They can place them all on a table at the front of the room, and then the writers can choose what object they want to create a story around.


Also, try using something visual. You could use a piece of art or an interesting photograph.

, Try using a distinctive smell to see what memories it dredges up for the writer, which can then be used to start a story.

, Now that you have a general idea of what you want to focus your prompt on, you should try to write it out. Begin by writing out the story. Use all the details you can think of in order to start figuring out what is necessary to the story, and what is not.

, Next, think about what’s most important to the story. For instance, is mentioning your shoes important? Unless they caused you to fall in front of the president of your company, they’re probably not as important as other details so you should take that info out. In fact, take out any information that isn’t completely necessary to the story.

, You don’t have to stay true to the original story because this is simply a way for other people to start generating their own stories. You can change up things to make it more interesting. Add aliens if that’s your thing; it’s all up to you.

, This tip may seem counter-intuitive. After all, the ending makes the story. But that’s exactly the idea. You want to leave the writer hanging, so they are inspired to come up with a story of their own based on your prompt.


Where you cut the story is up to you. Give enough details to intrigue the writer but not enough to discourage them from being creative.

, Writing prompts can be used for any kind of writing. However, some are more appropriate for nonfiction writing than others. This is because nonfiction prompts have to be true and fact-based.


Most of the prompts listed in this article would work well with fiction or poetry; for nonfiction, use a question to spark an idea based on something that happened in the writer’s life, such as “What’s the most interesting thing that ever happened to you?”

Making it easier for your participants to share their papers also gives you a chance to see where they are as writers and adjust the focus of your workshop accordingly.

, Good critiques are more than ""I liked it"" or ""I didn't like it."" They offer analysis and present examples of what the critic did or didn't like. By modelling the form of critique you want participants to use, you in turn encourage them to model it.

, Although you're leading the workshop, you're also teaching the participants how to think critically for themselves about their writing, not doing their thinking for them. If they haven't caught on to how to critique from the examples you've shown, give them time to write notes or chat with fellow participants before sharing their critiques with the entire workshop. You can ask them to expand on points they raise, but not make points for them.

, Just as you shouldn't control the discussion yourself, you shouldn't let any one of the participants control it, either. If someone starts to dominate the discussion with repeated questions, tell that participant to write down his or her questions and you'll discuss them later.

, When you're addressing the workshop participants, you may want to either take questions as they come or set aside time after you finish speaking to take questions. Questions that come up as someone presents a critique may be best saved until the critic finishes if the participant is doing so for the first time or appears nervous when speaking.


Regardless of which method you find easiest during the workshop session itself, you may still want to allow time after the session for further questions from participants who aren't comfortable with speaking in class.

, Participants are usually more willing to accept and improve the weak points of their writing if they first are told what they did right.

, Model the kind of behavior you want to see when presenting your own critique of someone's work, showing criticism of a writer's work where it's warranted without being critical of the writer.

, As long as the disagreements are about the writing and not the writers, it's fine to have heated discussions on style and technique. No two writers have exactly the same ear for the language, and sometimes a given technique may not be the right technique for a given story or scene.

, Suggestions should be as specific as possible, without coming across as the only way to improve the work. Encourage suggestions from the participant giving the critique and from the other participants as well.

, Although participants may take notes, more often they may miss points they wanted to remember. Providing them with supplemental material touching on these points will help them remember and let them refer to it as often as necessary between sessions and after the workshop is over.

Prepare well.,
Throw away your inner editor.,
Use Week One wisely.,
Don't give up during Week Two!,
Hang in there for Week Three.,
Write, write, write in Week Four!",How to Complete the NaNoWriMo Challenge," In order to get those words onto the page, you're going to need to do a lot of planning beforehand.


Do character sketches or outlines. In order to write about them, you need to know your characters - what are their back stories, their motivations? Get inside their heads!
Outline each chapter or section your book. Write down what happens, and make a list of scenes, conversations, and plot points you'd like to include. If you have a lot of time to prepare, make it very detailed - it can be helpful to have a ""to do list"" for every day that you'll be writing. That way there's no staring at the screen, wondering what to say when the time comes to write!;
, NaNoWriMo isn't about producing polished, final-draft quality writing  - instead, focus on getting the words (50,000 of them!) on the page. Think big picture, not little details. Editing will only slow you down and discourage you - save that for December!

, The first week is usually the best - you'll be excited about writing and you might find it easy to meet the 1,667 words-per-day goals because you've got a lot of ideas driving you. If you can, use that momentum to get ahead on your word count - you'll thank yourself later in the month when you inevitably hit a slump.

, You might feel like giving up, you might start doubting yourself, and you might be tempted to start editing - don't! Remember that this is only a draft, your only goal for this month is to keep writing and pushing forward, and you can edit later. After all, it's easier to edit something that's not so great than it is to start something from scratch that doesn't exist at all! Connect with the NaNoWriMo community by using the forums on the website or following the hashtag on Twitter - you're in good company! Many famous novels, including ""Water for Elephants"", were born during NaNoWriMo.

, Week three is tough because the deadline is looming, as are distractions like the holidays, and you may find yourself behind on word count. Just keep writing! Use a ""plot ninja"" (an unexpected twist thrown in when you're at a loss or you feel the story stagnating), do some word sprints, and just let the words flow - make your inner editor shut up and let yourself be free to write without censorship.

, You're coming down the home stretch and you just need to keep writing, keep writing, keep writing! You may be on track or you may feel hopelessly behind - set aside dedicated writing time, eliminate all distractions (log out of social media accounts, or even turn off the internet!), and get down to business. Nothing worth doing comes easy, and you might be in for a few late nights as you near that 50k finish line.

Decide which clients you want to attract.,
Decide what kind of projects you want to work on for your clients.,
Define your selling point to your clients.,
Determine your best work in your specialty.,
Impress with size and scope.,
Know what to exclude.,
Update your portfolio regularly.",How to Build a Successful Writing Portfolio1," What kind of freelance writing business do you want to specialize in? A technical writer generally produces different kinds of writing (help files, user manuals) than a copywriter (sales and marketing letters, advertising copy), and a ghostwriter usually writes something still different (memoirs or works of fiction). Your writing portfolio needs to be built around the kind of writing you want to market.


If you write in more than 1 area, you'll need to build a separate portfolio around each type of client you want to sell your services to. If some of your sample clips can be targeted to more than 1 type of client, you can include them in each relevant portfolio.;
, If you want to improve the quality of your intended client's Web copy, look through your past work for instances where you've done the same for previous clients and make them part of your portfolio. If you're negotiating to write a white paper, have examples of previous white papers you've done.

, What skills, experience or personal qualities do you offer that set you apart from other freelance writers? How did your previous clients benefit from these traits? Your portfolio can reflect these skills and qualities in several ways:


Through a 2- or 3-paragraph mission statement that defines your abilities and relates them to your goals for your business
Through a selection of clips of previous writing that highlight these traits, along with quantifiable results they achieved for past clients.
Through copies of relevant diplomas, certificates, licenses and letters of reference

, How you define your ""best"" work is up to you. Get opinions from friends and colleagues as to what impressed them, look at any formal honors you may have received, or look at your own opinion of where you went above and beyond the call of duty. You'll want to build your portfolio as a showcase of your best work.


Remember to temper your admiration of your own work with an understanding of what your prospective clients' needs are. Often, your definition of your ""best"" work is not ""best-suited"" to what your client needs from you.

, This doesn't mean to overload your portfolio with a large number of clips, even if they all represent the skill set you're trying to sell. Instead, it means to consider whom you've worked for in the past and what you've done for them.


Previous work for a large, well-known client can reassure prospective clients that you can meet their needs as effectively as you did for the larger client.
Displaying an impressive scope of work shows that you can meet a client's immediate need and what that client might need in the future.

, Building a successful portfolio means knowing what not to include in it. Here's a partial list of what to exclude:


Proprietary documents of a previous client
Items that are critical of your work
Writing that depicts you as overly critical of others
News clips not relevant to your work or where you and your past work are not the focus of the story
Affiliations (e.g., club memberships) not relevant to the work you're seeking
Irrelevant personal information

, Keeping your portfolio updated shows clients that you're continuing to do good work and that it keeps getting better. Not updating may make them think your best days are behind you.

"
"
Make it easy for clients to contact you.,
Make it clear you're looking for work.,
Avoid irrelevant hyperlinks.,
Be SEO friendly.",How to Build a Successful Writing Portfolio2," Put your contact information on your About page as well as a separate Contact page of your portfolio Web site.

, Your About page or separate ""Hire Me"" page should identify you professionally, represent you as trustworthy, display your qualifications and show off your best work as described in the General Advice section. You can include a ""Hire Me"" button that either links to this information from another page or to an e-mail contact application.

, Linking to the Web sites of clients you've worked for or to your LinkedIn profile is valid; linking to your personal Web site or to your pictures on Facebook generally is not.

, Include keywords that people looking for your services are likely to use, such as the type of writing you specialize in and where you're located. If you write copy in Denver, use ""Denver copywriter"" or ""Denver copywriter"" as keywords.


Place keywords in your Web page title bars and in the page text in a natural, readable way. Overuse of keywords in text will turn clients off, and many search engines will now reject sites with overused keywords.
If you have keywords that people are likely to misspell (e.g., ""writter"" for ""writer""), you may want to include those misspellings as keywords - just not as keywords that are visible on the text of any of your Web pages.

Start building your portfolio while you're working for someone else.,
Partner with someone starting a related service business.,
Look for pro bono projects.,
Write for local publications.,
Create your own samples.",How to Build a Successful Writing Portfolio3," Use your free time to make contacts, design your Web site and take on smaller projects. When you start freelancing full-time, you'll have a collection of work to select from to put in your portfolio.

, If you're starting out as a copywriter, for example, find someone starting a graphic design or photography business and work on joint projects with them.

, You won't make money, but you will create something to show later to someone who has it to spend on you. The best places to look are non-profit organizations (charities) and startup businesses.

, Many local publications, particularly those published on a weekly or monthly basis, depend heavily on freelance content. If you have an area of expertise or interest that they can use, pitch them a story idea.

, If you think you can write better copy than what a prospective client has now, create an example to show him. You can use the actual company or several made-up similar companies in your sample copy.

Respond to a writing prompt.,
Do a freewrite.,
Try a cubing exercise.,
Make a list of potential novel ideas.,
Do a mapping exercise.",How to Brainstorm Ideas for a Novel1," One way to get your brain ready for writing is to respond to a writing prompt. You may come up with your own writing prompt or use an existing writing prompt. Writing prompts are a good way to develop plot or character in your novel. You may try responding to the prompt using the voice of a character or use the prompt to explore a plot point in your novel.Sometimes it can help you get inspired by putting on a certain style of music while you write. You may try putting on music in the background as you respond to the prompt to encourage your creativity.
You can find lists of writing prompts on the Writing Prompts tumblr and the Daily Writing Prompts tumblr.;
, You can get your creative juices flowing by doing a freewrite, which is an exercise where you sit down and write down whatever comes to mind. Freewrites are ideal if you are struggling to organize your thoughts and are not sure how to get started.You should have a quantitative goal for your freewrite, such as writing five pages in five minutes or writing continuously for ten minutes without stopping or pausing. Try not to read over what you are writing during the freewrite or edit it in any way. Instead, focus on writing your thoughts down and letting them run free on the page.
Limit distractions. Try writing the freewrite on a piece of paper with a pen or pencil instead of on your computer. If you decide to do the freewrite on your computer, you should turn off your Internet connection and any other windows or tabs. This will help you focus on just the freewrite for the set amount of time.

, You can also try doing a cubing writing exercise, where you look at one idea or topic from six different viewpoints. You should first think of a topic or subject and then approach it in six ways. You may use a broad topic like “wealth” or a specific subject like “millennial frustration.”Describe the topic. What is it? How would I describe the topic to someone who has never heard of it before?
Compare the topic. What is the topic most like? What is it most unlike?
Associate the topic. What does the topic make me think of? What is the first thing or things that pop into my mind when I think of the topic?
Analyze the topic. What is made of? How is it made? Where is it made?
Apply the topic. How is it used? Who uses and where do they use it?
Argue for or against the topic. How can you support the topic? How can you oppose the topic? Why would you support or oppose it?

, Listing ideas can help you identify possible story ideas and get you to think about how you might approach these ideas. Sit down and try to write out a list of potential novel ideas on a piece of paper.Make sure you list all of your ideas, even ones that sound ridiculous or silly. You may come up with an idea so absurd, you have to try to write a novel about it.
You may then read over the list of ideas and highlight or star ideas that seem worth pursuing. You may then list more ideas under the ones you have highlighted or starred. You could then choose the idea that has the most notes and terms associated with it, as you clearly have a lot to say about it.

, You can also try doing a mapping exercise, where you put down a key term on a piece of paper. Then, you write down other terms around it and draw lines connecting certain terms to each other. You can use different colored pens to connect the terms, circles, highlighters, or lines.Once you have a complete map of terms, you may look it over and see if any patterns or relationships between the terms emerge. You may then be able to use these connections as the basis for your novel idea.

Use a real life person as inspiration.,
Start with a unique character voice.,
Research an interesting time period.,
Spend the day in a setting.",How to Brainstorm Ideas for a Novel2," You can draw on the people you encounter in real life to help you get ideas for your novel, using real life people as the basis for characters. Perhaps you have a friend, a family member, or a colleague that you find interesting, strange, or intriguing. You may then use them as the basis for a character in your novel or combine several of their qualities and traits to create a character.You may also take some time to people watch on a busy city street or in a public park. You may then notice details about the people around you and incorporate them into a character in your novel.

, Some writers find inspiration by focusing on the voice of their narrator or main character. The character may have a certain way of narrating or a certain style and language that they use to express themselves. You may start by writing in the voice of the character and then see where the character takes you in terms of plot and setting.For example, maybe you get inspired to write a paragraph in the voice of a child narrator who is describing the death of a family member. You may then continue to write as this narrator and see where the voice takes you. You may be able to use this voice as a key narrative in your novel and have the death of the family member be the plot of the novel.

, You may find yourself inspired by an interesting time period in history. Do some research on this time period and look for any interesting historical figures or settings that could be the basis of your novel.

You may need to spend time at your local library, research the time period online, and talk to historical experts about the time period. Collecting information on the time period can help you get inspired and ensure the setting feels authentic in your novel.

, You could also get some novel material by spending the day in a particular setting or environment. Take notes while you are in the setting and focus on details of the setting that could serve as the backdrop for a novel.You may have a setting in mind that you think might help to stimulate your thoughts and ideas, such as the city aquarium, the zoo, a local theme park, or even a neighborhood park. Try to choose a unique setting, as they often contain sights and details that can be inspiring.

"
Choose a specific genre to focus on.,
Blend several genres together.,
Start with the main situation or conflict.,
Create a plot outline.",How to Brainstorm Ideas for a Novel3," Sometimes it can help to limit yourself by choosing a specific genre of writing to focus on in your novel. Once you choose a genre, try to stick to the genre so you have limitations on your writing and are able to lean on the rules of the genre to start writing.You may decide to try writing a historical fiction novel, a science fiction novel, a fantasy novel, or a romance novel. You could also try your hand at writing a horror novel, a humorous novel, or a young adult novel.

, Many writers are also experimenting with blending several genres together to create “cross-genre” novels and stories. You may be more inspired by combining several genres together so you have more options in your novel and can play around with several different genres in your novel.For example, you may try blending together fantasy and romance to create a fantasy-romance novel, or blending science fiction and horror together to create a sci-fi-horror novel. Often, readers respond well to interesting cross-genre novels as they offer several elements of different genres in one story.

, Some writers begin their stories by creating the core conflict. The core conflict is the situation or premise of the story. It should contain a challenge or a struggle for the protagonist or main character of your novel. Having the core conflict in place might help you then determine the plot of your novel and how you are going to put your characters in a scene.Your core conflict should have an external element. This is a problem or issue the protagonist is dealing with externally, in the outside world. This problem should be resolved or at least addressed by the end of the novel.
There should also be an internal element to the core conflict. This is a problem or issue your protagonist is dealing with internally, within themselves. Giving your main character an internal struggle will add to the tension of the novel and help to build the plot.

, It may help to nail down your story idea by trying to create an outline of the plot of your novel. This can help you get a general sense of where your characters are heading in the story. The plot outline can act as a map or guide for your story, though you may end up deviating from the outline if inspiration strikes as you write your novel.

You may use a plot diagram to create the outline. The plot diagram will have six distinct sections, forming the shape of a triangle, with the climax at the top of the triangle. The six sections are: the set up, the inciting incident, the rising action, the climax, the falling action, and the resolution.
You can also use the snowflake method to create the outline. You will do this by creating a one sentence summary of the plot, followed by a one paragraph summary of the plot, and then a spreadsheet of scenes.

Get an internship.,
Get a job.,
Look for opportunities to volunteer.,
Study abroad.",How to Build Up a Resume in College1," This is the best thing you can do for your resume. Employers in every sector are looking for students with interning experience. Internships teach you what it is like to work in your field. You will learn everything from how to dress to what an average day is like.Network and work hard during your internship. If you show you’re good at the job, you can get a letter of reference from your supervisor. Also, if you impress the people where you intern, they may offer you a job in the future.
Connect with the staff at your campus' career center and internship office on campus. Employers often ask for direct referrals from these offices. If the staff members know you, they can refer you.
Speak with your professors about possible internships for students in your department or school and ask their advice about interning. They might offer you helpful contacts.;

You will make good contacts, learn about working in a professional environment, and develop specific skills you can list on your resume.Talk to your professors. They often know about jobs students get on campus. Many also hire editorial, research and lab assistants.
It’s a good idea to get a job related to your studies, for example as a tutor or lab assistant.

, Volunteering is a great way to learn new skills that you can list on your resume. Look for opportunities that will relate to your studies or career interests. Like interning, volunteering can show you what working in your field is really like.Many non-profit organizations have volunteer positions that require professional skills, like accounting, translating, or working in environmental sciences.
Network with different people in the organization where you volunteer and demonstrate that you are a good worker - your volunteer position might lead to an internship or job.

, Studying abroad can help your resume stand out to employers. Look for opportunities that relate to your studies or career goals.

These will look very impressive on your resume and you will learn important proposal writing skills."

Take interesting courses.,
Learn a new language.,
Get involved in extracurricular activities.",How to Build Up a Resume in College2," You can learn relevant career skills in college courses. Find out which specific skills might be required in jobs that interest you and look for related classes. For example, if you want to become a lawyer, you might want to take classes in rhetoric., Language skills look very impressive on a resume. In an increasingly globalized world, learning a foreign language will help you stand out to potential employers. Employers know that workers who can speak a foreign language have an advantage when working with global partners.If you are interested in working in international business or banking, consider studying Mandarin, Japanese, or German.
If you want to work in foreign relations, you could study one of the official United Nations languages, like Russian, Arabic, or Spanish.

, Extracurricular activities will help you build your leadership and team building skills, learn time management, and hone your work ethic. Employers look for students who have leadership skills and who can demonstrate that they work well on a team. These activities are also a good way to learn more about your campus community and find other job, interning, and volunteering opportunities.If you are athletic, you can join a team or play intramural sports. If you have a special talent, use it: act in a play, write for the school newspaper, or illustrate the yearbook.
Look for clubs that fit your major. For example, join the Biology Club if you are a Biology major.
Start your own club if you have a good idea. This level of initiative and leadership will look great on your resume.

Consult with career services.,
Do some research.,
Organize your resume.,
Use a professional format.",How to Build Up a Resume in College3," Career center counselors are dedicated to helping you prepare resumes. They have multiple templates and can guide you in how to write a resume for specific fields and industries. They will give you feedback and advice as you are writing different drafts of your resume.


College career centers often offer resume-writing workshops.

, Before you write your resume, look at job postings to see how employers are describing positions that interest you. Find their key-words and lists of qualifications. Use those key-words and qualifications when they are relevant to your experience.For example, if you see that many employers are looking for “a highly resourceful team player,” you could use that in your summary section. You could also use phrases like “demonstrated high level of resourcefulness” or “successfully collaborated on a team” to describe one of your experiences.
Include specific job responsibilities that you have done, like “compiles and analyzes financial information to prepare general ledger entries"" on your resume.
Use this information to tailor your resume to whatever jobs you are applying to.

, Find a template that will help you emphasize your education, skills, and experiences. There are online templates available from many university career centers. Start with the most important information at the top so employers can’t miss it. Keep reader interest by describing your skills and experiences with action verbs.Some sections that appear in student resumes are: summary or objective, education, related experience, related coursework, activities/leadership, honors and awards, skills.

, Employers will appreciate a clean, professional-looking resume. Keep your resume to one page and use 1 inch (2.5 cm) margins so it is easy to read. Highlight important information and section headings by using italics or boldface. Make it easy to skim by organizing information with bullet points instead paragraphs.Keep it concise because you only have one page.
Proofread it very carefully. You can also ask a professor or someone in career services to do a final review.
Use a standard font.

Do piece work.",How to Begin Writing," Writing is a process and the first part of the writing process is the invention stage. Invention helps you to generate ideas for your paper, book, poem, novel, article or whatever you are writing. Some people tend to skip this step even though it is one of the more important parts of the writing process, but that is a mistake. Not taking the time to explore your ideas can result in a low quality piece of writing.If you are having trouble getting started, then make sure that you complete at least one invention exercise before you begin a draft. However, completing more than one exercise is even more beneficial.
Try starting with something to help you generate ideas, such as freewriting or listing and then move to something that will help you explore those ideas in more depth, such as clustering, questioning, or outlining.
As you consider possible topics, make sure that you select something that is interesting to you. It is much easier to write about topics that interest you than topics that bore you.;
, Get out a pen and a piece of paper or open a new document on your computer. Set a timer for 15 minutes and start writing! Write about anything that comes to mind and do not censor or correct yourself.


Even if your mind is blank, write, “My mind is blank” over and over again until you think of something else to write. The most important thing is to keep writing for 15 minutes.
When you are finished, look over what you have written to see what you have written. You can then take the most useful sections and expand on these in another timed freewrite.
Keep in mind that a freewriting exercise should not be used as a first draft for a paper.Freewriting is a way to generate ideas and the results are often disorganized and chaotic, so submitting a free write as a first draft may result in a bad grade.

, Listing can help you to explore possible topics for writing.To use listing, take out a pen and paper or open a new document on your computer and list as many different topic ideas as you can. As with freewriting, do not censor or correct yourself. Add whatever comes to your mind to the list.


For example, for a research paper assignment in a composition class, you might write down things like, vertical farming, farm animal welfare, crop rotation, etc.
After you have finished your list, identify a few topics that stand out to you and explore these as possible topics for your writing project. Consider how well the topic matches the assignment guidelines, how interested you are in the topic, and how you might refine the topic to suit your needs.
When you have chosen a topic, you may also want to do a freewrite on the topic to help you generate ideas and figure out what you already know about the topic.

, Clustering or mind mapping can help you to explore a topic in more depth, draw connections, and begin to decide how to organize your ideas.Your completed cluster web will look like lots of circles connected by lines.


To create a cluster, take out a piece of paper and draw a circle in the center. Then, write your topic in the center of this circle.
Next, draw a line extending out from the circle and draw another circle at the end of it. In this circle, write down a sub-topic of your main topic.
Continue adding lines extending from your central circle as well as from smaller circles connected to the center circle to build connections among these ideas.

, Questioning is another good invention strategy that can also help you to test your topic. Try using “Who? What? When? Where? Why? How?” to determine if your topic idea is worth writing about and to develop ideas on your topic. Consider your topic and then respond in writing to the following questions:Who is affected by this topic?
What are the key issues associated with this topic?
When did this issue start?
Where is the issue occurring?
Why is this happening?
How can we fix the problem?

, Talking about your topic ideas with someone can also help you to test them out and explore what you already know. Talking about your ideas with a friend or teacher can also help you to come up with perspectives or ways of approaching the topic that you had not considered.If you are writing a paper for a course, schedule an appointment with your teacher or professor. You can say something like, ""I have some ideas for the next paper and I was hoping to run them by you and see what you think. Are you available to meet before or after class sometime?""

, Once you have some ideas, you can begin organizing them with an outline. For short papers, you can outline each paragraph individually. For longer works, write out short descriptions of events and organize them according to when they will come in your story. Draw character maps that show how people in the story interact with or feel about each other.


Keep in mind that an outline can be as detailed or as scant as you want it to be. For example, you can include a bullet point with a topic sentence for every paragraph with sub-bullets for ideas that you will discuss in the paragraphs, or you can just list the ideas you will discuss in the order that you will discuss them.

, Drafting can be a difficult part of the process, even if you have lots of ideas. The best thing to do is to set aside some quiet time to do nothing but write. For example, you might plan to do nothing but work on your draft between 8pm to 10pm on Thursday evening.


Make sure that you give yourself at least two hours to sit and write your draft. Turn off your cell phone, ask your parents or roommates not to disturb you, and eliminate any other potential distractions.
Gather all of your notes from your invention exercises before you begin writing. If you have completed a couple of invention exercises, then you should have a good idea of where to begin and how to organize your thoughts. If not, then you may want to spend some time outlining before you get started.

, Introductions can be difficult to write, so it is a good idea to spend some extra time thinking about what you want to include in your introduction. You should also make sure that you avoid some of the most common pitfalls with introductions.


Try to write an introduction that will draw your readers into the story and help them connect with your topic. You might begin by asking a question, giving an illustrative example, or explaining a difficult concept.
Avoid giving broad history in your intro. Introductions sometimes go too wide and this can be confusing for readers.Avoid starting your paper with phrases like, ""Since the dawn of time..."" or ""Everyone in the history of mankind..."" or ""
Avoid providing dictionary definitions. Intros that include a definition are often dull and the definition is not usually necessary at all. Avoid starting your paper with phrases like, ""The dictionary defines friendship as..."" or ""According to Webster's dictionary..."", Some people prefer to write a draft while others need to do it in small chunks. Decide what works best for you, but make sure to give yourself breaks about every two hours. It is hard to concentrate for more than two hours at a time, so get up stretch, take a quick walk, or grab a snack after you have been working on your draft for a while.

, After you have completed your first draft, find someone to give you feedback on what you have written. You can ask a teacher, friend, or parent to read your work. If the reader is not familiar with your assignment or other purpose for writing, let him or her know what it is.


For example, if you ask a friend to read your paper, tell him or her what class the paper is for, what the assignment requirements are, and what (if any) particular concerns you have about what you have written.
Most universities have writing centers where students can drop in or schedule an appointment to meet with a writing tutor for free. A writing tutor can read your paper and help you identify ways to improve your work.

, After you receive feedback, set aside some time to revise you work. As with drafting, you should set aside about two hours to revise your work.


Keep in mind that revising is not the same as proofreading. Proofreading is the final step in the writing process where you identify minor errors and make your paper look polished. Revising is when you look at your paper with a fresh perspective and consider how you can make it better.To revise, you may have to delete, add, reorder, reorganize, or expand existing paragraphs in your draft.
As you revise, make sure that you address any areas for improvement that your readers have identified for you. You should also read over your work yourself and look for areas that would benefit from more details, better sources, or a tighter focus.
Remember that writing is a process and it is often cyclical. Sometimes revision may require you to add a significant amount of text to fully explain a concept or to strengthen an argument. To do this, you may need to return to the invention stage.
If possible, take a break between drafting your paper and revising it. Taking at least a few hours or a few days between drafting and revising will help you to see your paper with fresh eyes. This will make it easier to identify problems and their solutions.

, The poet William Stafford once wrote that “there is no such thing as writer’s block for writers whose standards are low enough.”While this might sound awful, the idea that you should be able to sit down as a 5th grader and compose the great American novel is unrealistic. But it is exactly this sort of expectation that leaves people so dissatisfied with their wring that they give up.


Great writers compose multiple drafts of their work and have the text reviewed by professional editors. No one expects a first draft to be good. But sitting down and finishing it will give you the chance to see what fits and what does not. From there it will be much easier to improve your ideas.
Writing also takes practice. It might take a few failed manuscripts to get it right.

, To make writing a natural habit, try to sit down at the beginning of every day to write a few pages. If you don't know what to write, start a dream journal. Write about what you dreamed the prior night. This will help you keep in touch with your creative side.

, People who exercise regularly have been shown to exhibit more creative thinking.If you are struck by writer’s block, a little bit of exercise can distract you from any anxieties that you might have and get your ideas flowing again.


Consider going on a walk to clear your head.For more energy, try a short jog.
Alternatively, stretch for a couple of minutes to relax yourself., Caffeine increases the effect of chemicals in your brain that naturally produce energy. Consuming caffeine will give you energy and increase your concentration. Thus, it will help you overcome several of the psychological conditions that create writers block, including self-doubt and lack of commitment.Caffeine has other properties that can improve your writing, like increased short term memory and cognitive abilities.
The positive effects of caffeine, however, can be negated if it impairs your sleep. Moderate your consumption and drink it early in the day, Music can increase concentration. It can also inspire emotions that you can spill back onto the page. Depending upon your tastes, loud music might be a distraction. In that case, consider ambient music, possibly without any lyrics.Jazz and classical music are often good ambient music choices for writing. , If you are having trouble focusing in your environment or find it uninspiring, try some place new. A university library has a lot of resources that you can turn to for information. Cafes have coffee and a vibrant atmosphere that can make you feel more comfortable than your own cramped space., Doing a quick read of some inspirational writing can get you in the mood to do your own. Anyway, a good writer should be reading all the time. It is important to use other writers as point of inspiration and as models for how to write. You also need to read to get a sense for how you can fit your work into existing literature or innovate within a genre of writing., If TV distracts you, be sure to turn it off. If you live with a bunch of people or along a busy street, do your best to find a place that is less noisy. Consider downloading programs that will remove distractions from your computer.


One of the difficulties with writing today is that the best media for composition—your computer—is also rife with distractions of its own. There is, however, specialized software that can change this. Some programs will ration the time you can spend on social media. Writing programs can limit your access to other functions of the computer, so that you can focus exclusively on writing., Great writers have very different routines. One thing that is almost always true, however, is that they have some sort of routine. You will want to pick a routine that fits your energy level and schedule throughout the day. Once you have a routine, your mind will naturally turn to writing when it is time to sit down and work.For example, Simone de Beauvoir would always begin his days with a cup of tea, review what he had written the previous day, write for several hours, take some time off, and then return to work after dinner.Try to have a designated place and time to work. This sort of routine can create a cue for your brain when it is time to begin work.
Perhaps you should always have a cup of coffee or tea before work. Maybe you should always have music on. Perhaps you could eat breakfast directly before writing. Create as many atmospheric cues as possible to tell your brain to get to work.

, A blog can be a great place to put out your writing in a place where it will get read. People’s responses can help you learn and grow as a writer. You might even get some name recognition.


Try doing an interview. Ask a prominent person if they are willing to talk to you. You might be surprised who would be willing to talk to you for a bit of additional publicity. Such a big name can bring in new readers., Review a book and send the review off to local newspapers or websites that are interested in the subject. These will give you an opportunity to get your name in print. Furthermore, engaging in a deep way with the work of a great writer will give you some perspective on your own creative endeavors., Writing short pieces for magazines, websites, and newspapers might not be what you want to do with your life. However, it will give you some name recognition and a bit of money to help you live the life of a writer. Most importantly, working on a time table under experienced editors will get you accustomed to the pace and style of professional writing."
"
Ask people about their perspective.,
Put yourself in their shoes.One of the simplest ways to avoid hurting feelings is to imagine how they will respond to your statements.,
Control your words and body language.,
Be polite in your responses.,
Express your perspective as opinion, not fact.,
Don't take the disagreement personally.",How to Be Honest Without Hurting People's Feelings1," Before being honest about how you feel its important to know their perspective. This gives you a chance to show genuine interest and have a conversation. This may also give you opportunities to speak up and be honest. They may even end their explanation with a request to hear your perspective.;
, If they said that to you, would you be upset? Practice imagining how they view their own opinion and yours. Just because their perspective is different doesn't mean its wrong.

, Be careful with your honesty. You want to speak the truth in kindness. That means avoiding overtly disapproving behaviorssuch as grimacing or making fun of their ideas.


Sometimes you may not know your tone of voice is broadcasting disapproval. This can be difficult to change. Your vocal tone is often subconsciously created. Try to speak in a neutral tone resisting the urge to let your feelings and emotions show true in your voice. You may think this disingenuous but once you speak your opinion, its not necessary to convey disapproval non-verbally too.

, Whenever you try to avoid hurting others it is best to speak with kindness. Common gestures of kindness (i.e., politeness) go a long way. They convey respect and show you value the other person. This situation isn't all about you speaking your mind. Its about them feeling valued.

, Even if you know the facts back you up, this shows you value their perspective. If they have an open mind, facts will change their perspective. If they do not have an open mind, facts will feel like personal attacks. They have a right to be incorrect. Let them come to the truth on their own terms, not yours. Forcing your perspective is an easy way to hurt feelings.


Don't criticize or condemn.This may seem difficult but is important. Speak your truth in a way that doesn't put their perspective down. Statements like ""You're wrong there"" and ""I can't believe you think that"" are to be avoided. Instead, agree with them when their perspective is consistent with their justifications (e.g., ""I can see how that follows""). Follow with your perspective (e.g., ""I read that..."" or ""I think..."") such that your statement is not directly antagonistic towards theirs.
Avoid hyperbole. Very, very rarely are things ""always"" and ""never."" Avoid words and idioms that exaggerate the truth. Your goal is to be honest and hyperbole rarely is honest. Instead, use facts and try to avoid letting your emotions run high.

, Keep in mind being honest is not the same as being right. You can be honest and factually wrong at the same time. You can also be honest, factually right, and still hurt feelings.Be humble with your perspective. Listen to others' justifications for their perspectives and resist the urge to convert them to your perspective.


Place value in your own perspective.You are entitled to your perspective and opinion. Even if you chose to be quiet, remember your perspective is just as valid as theirs. Just as they have a right to be honest, so do you.
Just as you have a right to your opinion, they have a right to theirs. Even if their opinion is factually wrong or inconsistent with their own beliefs. If you speak your honest perspective and they do not hear you, forcing the issue will lead to hurt feelings. They aren't ready for it. If they disagree with you, that's ok. Resist the temptation to get them to agree with you.
If it is important, you may have to let them make their own mistakes. But that doesn't mean you are wrong either when they vehemently disagree with you. This also doesn't mean they don't care about you. It just means they have a different perspective.

Decide if you need to say anything at all.,
Begin a discussion with an sincere invitation to listen to their opinion.They may give you the whole story or they may express they do not want to discuss it.,
Identify the source of the difference of opinion.Try to understand what your opinion is based on.,
Wait for them to either ask your opinion or finish giving theirs.,
Discuss your perspective as a matter of opinion.,
Pay attention to verbal and bodily cues.If the discussion is turning heated, stop.,
Thank them for sharing and listening.",How to Be Honest Without Hurting People's Feelings2," Sometimes being honest means being silent. You may find an honest expression of your desire for peace (i.e., remaining silent) outweighs the desire to speak your mind.People feel compelled to express their strong opinions. Sometimes people do so to provoke a debate or change someone else's mind. This usually leads to a confrontation and unavoidable hurt feelings.

, Pay attention to their reaction and what they say. This will help you gauge how they will receive even your honest opinion.


If they decide not to discuss the issue, honor their wish. Perhaps it is the wrong time or place. Try asking again later. If they repeatedly rebuff you, you may need to express your opinion unsolicited or avoid it altogether.

, Then try to understand what their opinion is based on. Some disagreements are based on fundamental political, religious, and moral beliefs. Knowing those bases you can be respectful of the opinion and avoid hurt feelings.

, Be patient, kind, and attentive throughout their story. This shows you respect them and are genuinely interested in them.

, If you want to avoid hurting feelings, you must allow for the possibility that they are right and you are wrong. You can say ""I've thought that..."" instead of ""You are wrong.""

, Chances are that you are about to hurt their feelings if you haven't already. Let them know you respect and value them.


Apologize if you accidentally said something that hurt their feelings.Apologies are a signal that your respect the other person.Doing this early you can move on easily. Wait too late and the hurt may take much longer to repair.
Do not overuse apologies. Saying ""I'm sorry"" too much--especially when you did nothing wrong--can lower the value of an apology.The goal is to identify when you've done something wrong and be sincere about your apology.

, This gives you an opportunity to end the difference of opinion on a positive note. Be sure to comment that you understand where they are coming from and hope they understand your perspective too.

"
Delay your response.,
Check your calendar for conflicts.,
Avoid admitting your schedule is open.,
Identify exactly why you want to decline.,
Decide if you would accept under different circumstances.,
Remember to respond.,
Thank them for including you.",How to Be Honest Without Hurting People's Feelings3," Avoid responding immediately to a request you believe you will turn down. A quick ""No"" will rob you of time to formulate a kind decline. A simple ""Let me check my calendar and get back to you"" will often work. This gives you time to create a response in your head.

, If you are lucky you will have a scheduling conflict. You can honestly decline due to the conflict. If the conflict is the only reason for declining, let them know so that they will know to include you later.If the person is persistent, they may ask you for a better time. Be prepared to respond with a more direct decline. When you see your calendar is busy, take a little extra time in advance to think about a kind decline if they ask for a better time.

, This is like saying you are free for anything a manipulative person is waiting to ask of you. Some people will ask about your schedule before making an offer or request. This way you have little excuse to turn them down without being mean. More importantly, you sacrifice the ""Let me check my calendar"" time to formulate a polite decline.If someone starts asking about your schedule, you can simply reply, ""I don't know, why do you ask?"" and remain polite. This is a good practice even if you intend to accept.

, If you know you want to decline before checking your calender you have a reason in mind. Do you dislike the task? Were you planning to go to that event with someone else? Think about reasons you can decline that focus on aspects of the offer or request and not aspects of the person offering or requesting.

, Once you know exactly why you are declining you'll be able to imagine how circumstances might be different. Maybe if they asked you to do something different or offered more money. Keep these in mind if the other party asks why you are declining.


Be cautious about reasons for declining a request.If it is obvious that the exhaustive answer would hurt their feelings consider a vague response. If necessary, you may be able to get by with ""I'd rather not say.""

, You may have made up your mind already but you must turn down a request to be polite. Ignoring the request may hurt their feelings or put you on a list of ""have not replied."" If you do not respond, they may assume you feel they are not important. Reply to requests promptly. Emphasize non-personal reasons for declining. Avoid disparaging the offer or person making the request or offer.

, Consider how fortunate you are that the other person values you. They may be disappointed but not hurt. Be polite and you can decline their offer or request without long-term hurt feelings.

"
"
Smile genuinely to show appreciation.If someone is asking for your opinion it means they value you.,
Ask them what they like about the outfit or style.,
Focus on the outfit or style rather than the person.,
Avoid agreeing with a negative self-image.Expressing any disagreement may prompt self-deprecating statements (e.g., ""I'm just too fat for this outfit..."").,
Discuss how other styles or outfits work better as alternatives.",How to Be Honest Without Hurting People's Feelings4," Use that knowledge to produce a genuine smile. This will make the sting of disapproval seem less personal.

, This gives you an opportunity to hear their point of view. It also gives you time to carefully word your comments. This will also give you a measurement of how much they like, or dislike the outfit or style. They may even discuss their own reservations.

, Assume that the person under the outfit is beautiful. The outfit or style is just hiding that fact. Try to critique the outfit or style apart from any negative characteristics of the person.


Appeal to any mutually-agreed-upon standard of dressto back up your opinion if you can. For example, use business dress standards if a new haircut, tattoo, or nail polish could cause them trouble at work. Use goodness of fit to highlight how the outfit would look better if it were better tailored.

, Do not agree with them. Even if you believe they are correct, some things do not need to be said. Be honest with yourself--you aren't trying to hurt their feelings, right?


In situations like this, you might want to disagree outright with the negative statement. ""You aren't fat, this dress just fails to highlight how beautiful you are.""
Unfortunately, if you fail to disagree with a negative statement the speaker may take that as an admission of your agreement. Be quick to disagree when you know this to be true.

, This allows you to be productive in two ways. First you offer alternatives for them to try. Second it provides avenues for you to shower them with complements. This shows them you value them in spite of the negative feedback you just offered.


At this stage, always be sure to include references to their positive characteristics. Although you avoided referencing personal characteristics before, highlight positive aspects now.

Avoid unnecessary drama.,
Be serene.,
Don't show your pain.",How to Be Aloof1," Steer clear of anything that's not your business. This will ensure that you won't get caught up in others' emotional turmoil. That's extremely detrimental to maintaining an aloof demeanor. State boldly, if you have to, that you won't get caught up in xyz. People may be surprised -- even angry at times -- but they will respect your unwillingness to take sides in a conflict you care nothing about.;
, Don't let anything ruffle your feathers. Always be prepared for anything that comes your way. This tranquility will permeate your mannerisms and translate ""cool"" to the general public. It signals to others that you have a certain detachment which allows you to weave in and out of life's tangled webs without losing your vital cool.

, Who cares about what everyone supposedly heard or what rumors are going around or what people saw with their own eyes? If you want to be aloof, you must handle pain with as much dignity and grace as possible. If you're going to fall apart, do it in the privacy of your own home. Don't have a breakdown in public.

"
"
Believe in yourself., But always remember that arrogance will make people hate you.,
Smile at random times.",How to Be Aloof2," A quiet confidence (humble, yet proud of yourself) will endear people to you. Imagine a scale of 0 to 10, 0 being downtrodden and 10 being cocky arrogance. A 5, smack in the middle, is a safe bet. But even then, don't be shy about projecting toward a 7 or 8 to keep people from taking you for granted.

, Smiling is a great mood enhancer. You'll feel better and everyone around you will feel better too. It's also a great way to show the world that you are good natured and indefatigable. A smile tells people that nothing can get you down.

"
"
Keep people in the dark.,
Don't talk a lot.,
Be enigmatic.",How to Be Aloof3," Nobody needs to know what you're up to, where you're going, or what time you'll show up at a party. You don't have to be sneaky. Simply keep your business to yourself, and keep your body language relatively reserved.

, Remember: less is more. Answer questions that people ask, but don't volunteer anything more. Don't speak when you have nothing to say. And don't fill space when there's a lull in conversation. Let a nod suffice. When you do speak in greater detail, you'll find that people are more apt to listen than if you were to go shooting your mouth off like there's no tomorrow.

, If you're hard to figure out, you'll seem more interesting. By all means, be open, empathize and be generous around your close friends. But maintain a cloak of mystery around casual acquaintances.

"
"
Always treat others with respect.",How to Be Aloof4," You can be kind, empathetic and aloof at the same time. Don't make fun of anyone else's style, speech, culture, or whatever. Treat other as equals and you'll gain the respect of everyone you meet.

Practice your quick-response abilities.,
Work on your listening skills.,
Revisit past situations.,
Quickly deflect any insults flung your way.,
Be ready and willing to pick apart what someone says.,
Use sarcasm if you can pull it off well.,
Don't belabor the point.,
Stay calm above all else.,
Don’t try to be witty if you’re not ready for it.",How to Think of Quick Witted Comebacks1," Not everyone is comfortable with thinking on their feet, so the art of quick-witted comebacks may depend on memorizing some standard comebacks as a last resort. Don't try to be quick witted if you simply aren't wired that way; you risk looking foolish and being so frustrated with yourself that the attempt isn't worth it.


Memorization and practice can help you get the most out of the abilities you have, and may get you through some good verbal exchanges here and there. Like artists in other fields, though, the masters of witty comebacks seem to have an innate gift to pair with their demeanor and preparation.;
, There is no magic formula for developing a quicker wit, but improving your listening skills can help immensely. Look at the other person, and focus on their words and what they mean by them. The wittiest comebacks are created in direct response to what has been said, not pulled out of a stockpile of witticisms that sort of fit the situation.Practice focusing on what is being said instead of letting your mind wander off trying to formulate comebacks. Try practice activities like ""verbal volleyball,"" in which you and a partner take turns inventing a story one word at a time -- they say a word, you listen closely and come up with the next word as quickly as you can, and so on., Try writing your own version of a conversation that you wished you'd been witty in. Replace that past attempt with a better script and work from this point to guide your future wittiness.However, remember that the best comebacks are created in the moment, not rehashed from similar circumstances in the past. Use this exercise for inspiration and practice, not as a source for specific comebacks.

, If you think about the insult, you'll dwell on it, letting it get to you personally. Instead, don't focus on the insult but on responding quickly.The trick behind witty comebacks is speed. Don't analyze the ramifications of what has just been said; instead treat it like the game it is and the insult merely becomes a shuttle to be hit back.
For instance, if someone ends an insult with “and you smell, too,"" don’t mull over your hygiene routine while formulating a response. Focus strictly on the words and come back with something like “Yes, but at least my stink will shower off, unlike your rancid personality.""

, Enter the fray and enjoy the spirit of the confrontation instead of fearing it or downplaying it. See confrontation as an invitation to play rather than a reason to feel insulted. If you simply can’t make yourself see things this way, you may be better off avoiding witty comeback attempts in favor of another approach.Seize the opportunity to point out any contradictions the other person makes while trying to show off their wit. Doing so usually devalues an insult in the eyes of the insulter.
However, don't pick something apart for longer than you need to. If you get into a long-winded reply, they might interrupt you with another comeback, thereby making what you were saying irrelevant.
For example, if they say you're not worth their time to insult, reply ""Well, I'm glad to hear you weren't actually trying to insult me the past five minutes.""

, Sarcasm has its place if it’s treated with cleverness and is not overdone. If someone tries to insult you with a nonsensical comment, feel free to drawl sarcastically, ""Well, there's an intelligent answer."" Brevity is helpful here as well; a sarcastic but rambling monologue will not have the same impact.


Remember that sarcasm also involves good timing and proper tone of voice. Think of Severus Snape in the Harry Potter series or Oscar Wilde, both good practitioners of sarcasm that is pulled off succinctly and effectively.
Use sarcasm playfully, not to cut someone to the core. Consider your opponent and whether they’re equipped to see sarcasm for what it is and not take it too personally.For instance: ""Oh, that last insult was so close to making sense. Please keep trying.""

, The most famous examples of witty retorts are invariably short and sweet, finishing the job all at once.In most cases, your witty comeback should be sufficient to end the matter there and then. Continuing to discuss, argue, or toss points around will likely weaken the impact of what you've said.


It's up to you whether you change the topic, walk away to resume conversing with this person another time, or pretend they're not even there anymore. The key thing is to have the upper hand before you move on.
Don't just walk away in the middle of being insulted, because it suggests you can't take it. However, you can stand up for yourself if necessary by saying: ""I'll come back when your tantrum is over so we can get back to trading insults."" That puts the onus on your opponent to behave more appropriately and gives you a dignified exit.

, Don't get angry, or even a little annoyed. Bear in mind that your opponent's insults are not worth your time or anger. Detach yourself from personal dislike of a person and focus on what's been said in a calm, objective manner instead. Focus on being witty and stick with your resolve to stay calm.Think of it like stepping to the plate against the other team’s ace pitcher. Don’t focus on whether or not he’s a jerk; calmly focus on the ball and driving it into the gap for the game-winning hit.
Practice looking perfectly calm, even amused or bemused, in front of a mirror. Even if you're extremely angry on the inside, on the outside, you are calm – tell yourself this and your thoughts will respond in kind.

, While you're learning to be witty, be tactful and diplomatic in the meantime. If wittiness never comes to you, at least people will be unaware of all your striving to be witty and will just presume you're polite!

Learn from the masters.,
Find witticisms online.,
Keep context in mind as you collect witty examples.,
Allow the other side's words and actions to speak for themselves.",How to Think of Quick Witted Comebacks2," While there is no doubt that the best witty comebacks are original witty comebacks, you can get plenty of good ideas by studying some of history’s most famous wits and witticisms. Spend some time amassing a collection of effective comebacks. Eventually, as your skills develop, you’ll be better able to create comebacks “off the cuff.”


Have a look at the masters of quick-witted comebacks, such as Dorothy Parker, Winston Churchill, Mark Twain, Mae West, George Bernard Shaw, Groucho Marx, Oscar Wilde, Margaret Thatcher, and so forth.Read the witty exchanges between such people as Ernest Hemingway and William Faulkner, or George Bernard Shaw and Winston Churchill. Even the exchanges between Han and Leia in Star Wars will do it.
Here is a handy example from one of the best sources, Groucho Marx: ""I've had a great evening but this wasn't it.""

, There are countless witty comebacks available for the avid internet surfer. Indeed, there are websites dedicated specifically to comebacks, providing example after example (some good, some not so good).Keep a list of your favorites and learn them by heart. At the very least, they may come in handy when all other words fail you! Here are just a few:


""Thank you for proving my point.""
""Light travels faster than sound; that's why you appeared bright until you spoke.""
Lean against something, close your eyes and wait a few seconds, then suddenly open your eyes and say ""Oh! Sorry! Were you saying anything important just then? I must have dozed off"".
""You and I have so much in common at times, don't we?"" Use this for an insult about your weight, appearance, intelligence, etc.
""Pardon? Sorry I didn't quite catch that. Would you care to repeat it?"" (An insult is never as effective the second time around.)
""Takes one to know one."" This one might seem “played out” by now, but it can still be used in a pinch when you're out of ideas.
If someone is repeating the same insult over and over, use this: ""Still clinging to the same idea? Try something more... original."" Then do a little smile, and walk away.

, A witticism that hits the mark in one situation can miss badly in another. Read and collect comebacks that are more potentially insulting or hurtful, but don’t assume that they’re right to use on just any person in any semi-relevant situation.


For instance: ""Next time you speak, use actual words"" can be pretty innocuous in many situations, but may also be more hurtful to some people. A witty comeback should have some “bite,” but it shouldn’t leave a lasting mark.
Or: ""I won't waste my breath burning you; I might not even waste my breath if you were actually burning."" This one might work with someone who knows you well, but could also get you in hot water. Even vague jokes about violence are not taken lightly by many.

, Sometimes there isn't even a need for a witty comeback. If a person persists in saying something ridiculous, insulting, thoughtless, or groundless, let them do all the talking and simply use a dismissive gesture to express your distaste or deflection. Other people will likely see that the person unable to control their temper, needling, or whining is not in need of a witty retort.Practice raising an eyebrow, smirking, rolling your eyes, or using some other gesture that displays a lack of being impressed.

Yawn and look at your watch hungrily.
Admittedly, this one’s a bit on the childish side: repeat exactly what has been said, but in a funny voice. To avoid coming off like a cranky kindergartener, you might want to practice with a willing friend.

Retort in a composed, serene, and confident manner.,
Avoid swearing (or at least minimize it).,
Tone down the name-calling.,
Steer clear of being snobby.,
Be considerate of people who take things personally.,
Don't hold grudges.,
Respect yourself and the other person.",How to Think of Quick Witted Comebacks3," While the content of your retort matters, so too does the style with which you deliver it. Avoid condescension or superiority in tone of voice. Also avoid sounding hurt or insulted, as if your comeback has been forged in the fire of your burning rage.Speak your witty comeback clearly, quickly, and with confidence. Include a slight smile in your voice and eyes, because you need to veer to the funnier, humorous side of what is happening to be a successful wit.

, Swearing isn't typically considered witty, but rather a visceral expression of emotions. It might make you feel better as tension is released, but mostly it makes you seem immature. It's also not going to hit the target of undoing their argument or statements.However, your opponent's swearing can definitely be used as a target of your wit, such as making a biting comment or saying in a monotone: ""Oh, you're swearing now? How mature,"" and leaving it at that.

, Closely related to swearing, name-calling simply makes you look envious, lost, and overly emotional. Name-calling might again seem like a great outlet for your anger and frustration, but it works to your opponent's advantage all too easily and isn't that witty.If you must name-call, stick to their argument rather than them. For example, say ""That's a very odd way to see the situation,"" rather than ""You're an idiot."" Or try ""Well, I'm now thoroughly convinced of your ignorance in the matter"" instead of “You’re so ignorant.”

, A witty comeback that seeks to assert your superiority or greater status will usually backfire, because it will turn into a matter of the other person insisting that ""you think you're too good for me,"" and so forth. Once you're in this type of argument, things usually spiral ever more out of control.


Responding along the lines of ""Yes, I used to have that same problem in school ... preschool, that is"" can take on more or less of a snobby air depending upon the context and your delivery.
It is hard to walk the fine line between being witty and snobby but the key factor is to retain your sense of humor and see the triviality of the situation.

, Sure, they shouldn't keep playing victim and acting as if their whole world will fall apart if you so much as poke them, but you have to take people as you find them. In some cases, it's plain unfair, unkind, and uncaring to provoke a weak arguer with witty comebacks.Perhaps it's your intent to teach such a person a lesson. But at least do consider the consequences of demolishing a verbal opponent who is likely to fly into a sulk, funk, or rage as a result.
On the other hand, if they're being a complete jerk, then perhaps it is the lesson they need regardless of their weak armor.

, Be aware that dismissing someone verbally removes your validation from them. Don't do it too often, as putting them down is direct and alienating; be sure there is a real need for it. Once done, it's done, and if you wish to open dialog with someone you've put down, be the first to offer the olive branch and to make it clear that you bear no grudges.


Say something like ""I really like the way you kicked the ball the other day but I didn't appreciate your attitude following the game. I felt I had no choice but to put your bad mood in its place. I hope you'll forgive my direct approach.""

, Despite the whole “sticks and stones” saying, words have the ability to hurt. So, be sure that your words are still considerate of the dignity of the other person. In turn, don't let their words get to you; if you choose to be wounded, then you will find yourself struggling to overcome the verbal barbs.Refuse to permit their words to become any more than just words, and get on with your day in the knowledge that you have maintained your dignity, spoken with integrity and intelligence, and respected yourself and the other person.

Watch for crying.,
Look for signs of anger and/or threat.,
Look for signals of anxiety.,
Look for expressions of embarrassment.,
Notice any manifestations of pride.",How to Read Body Language1," Crying is considered to be caused by an explosion of emotion in most cultures. Oftentimes crying is considered a sign of sadness or grief, but crying can also be an expression of happiness. Crying can also come about through laughter and humor. Thus, when assessing crying, you'll need to look for other signals to determine the appropriate context of the crying.Crying can also be forced or manipulated in order to gain sympathy or to deceive others. This practice is known as ""crocodile tears"", a colloquial expression that draws on the myth that crocodiles 'cry' when catching prey.;
, Signs of threat include v-shaped brows, wide eyes, and an open or down-turned mouth.Arms tightly crossed over the other is a common sign that the person is angry and is closing himself off to you., When people exhibit anxiety, they display increased blinking and facial movements, and their mouth stretches into a thin line.Individuals who are anxious may also fidget and fiddle with their hands, unable to keep them in one spot.Anxiety can also be conveyed when people seemingly unconsciously tap their feet or have jittery legs., Embarrassment can be signaled by averting the eyes or shifting them away, turning of the head, and controlled or even tense smiles.If someone looks down at the floor a lot, they are probably shy, timid, or embarrassed. People also tend to look down when they are upset, or trying to hide something emotional. People are often thinking and feeling unpleasant emotions when they are in the process of staring at the ground.

, People show pride by displaying a small smile, tilting their head backward, and putting their hands on their hips."

Enlist the help of a friend.,
Identify your triggers and learn to avoid them.,
Use a swear jar.The swear jar is a tried-and-tested method which has helped many people to kick their swearing habit.,
Ping your wrist with a rubber band.This method is the human equivalent of putting an electric shock collar on a dog to eliminate bad behaviors - unsavory but effective.,
Pretend your grandmother is always within earshot.Another way to train yourself to bite your tongue whenever you feel a swear word coming on is to imagine that someone is listening.,
Avoid explicit music and other swear-happy media.",How to Stop Swearing1," Sharing a difficult experience or task with a friend or partner will make the whole experience more tolerable, even enjoyable. Enlisting a friend to help you in your endeavor to stop swearing can work in one of two ways:


You can either rope in a friend who also has a swearing problem and work towards cutting out the bad language together, or you can ask a clean-mouthed comrade to monitor your language and give you a gentle reminder whenever you slip up.
Either way, having someone to hold you accountable for your swearing slip-ups will force you to stick to your guns and kick this bad habit once and for all.;
, Everyone has their own individual triggers which set them off, leading to the intense desire to swear. For some people it's traffic, for others it's the queue at the grocery store and for others still, it's when yet another character dies on ""Game of Thrones"". If you can pinpoint what your exact triggers are, you may be able to avoid them - by leaving work 30 minutes later to avoid rush hour, by shopping online, or by watching reruns of ""Friends"" instead.


Remove yourself from any situations which cause negative emotions to rise and you'll be better able to control what comes out of your mouth.

, It usually involves taking a large jar or money box (something you can't easily break into) to which you will add a dollar (or some other arbitrary amount of money) every time you utter a swear word. You can view the swear jar in two ways, as a punishment or as a delayed reward:


It's a punishment because you have to say goodbye to a dollar every time you slip up. But it's also a reward, because once the jar is full (or you've successfully stopped swearing - whichever comes first) you get to spend the money on whatever you like - whether you want to buy yourself some new threads, or donate the money to charity.
Keeping the swear jar in your office is a good idea if you have roped several people into giving up swearing. Everyone will hold each other accountable and make sure that nobody tries to sneakily avoid sacrificing their dollar. Once the jar is full, you can celebrate by buying a new coffee machine for your entire floor.

, Basically, all you need to do is wear a rubber band or a hair tie around your wrist and give it a firm snap every time you catch yourself swearing.


The thinking behind this is that your brain will come to associate swearing with pain and, over time, will cause you to mentally shy away from using bad words.
If you're really serious about this method, you could give permission to a friend (preferably one prone to a little schadenfreude) to snap the band for you. Just try to remember that you agreed to it.

, All the time. It could be your grandmother, your boss or your innocent little son or daughter, just as long as it's someone you'd be ashamed to swear in front of.


Whenever you swear, visualize them standing beside you with a shocked or horrified expression on their face. That should help deter you.

, Many people's swearing habits, especially those of teenagers, are influenced by the explicit content of much of their favorite music, movies or T.V. shows. If you feel like this is the case, and you're swearing to sound like your favorite rapper, you may need a reality check to remind yourself that this is not how people speak in the real world. Try switching your radio station to squeaky-clean pop music, or at least download the clean versions of your favorite songs instead.

Don't overcrowd.,

Don't make assumptions.",How to Not Be Annoying," Sometimes someone will find you annoying because you happen to do something that they associate with a negative trait, such as anxiety, stereotypes, or slovenliness. You shouldn't have to change something about yourself just because someone interprets your behavior inaccurately. But other times, we can be annoying because we're insecure or we're trying too hard. In such cases, you can examine why you do certain things and perhaps realize that the only reason you're doing them is to make a good impression, and it's backfiring on you!;
, Let's say you've found that you laugh loudly at everyone's jokes, even if they're not all that funny, or perhaps you've gotten in the habit of laughing at inappropriate times. Maybe you started doing it because you thought being loud may get you noticed, but now all it's doing is annoying everyone you spend time with. Try a different approach - be genuine and be yourself. If people find you annoying when you're being true to yourself, then you need to find new, more accepting people to be around.

, Everybody has boundaries - you need to learn what they are and try to avoid crossing them. Boundaries vary widely from culture to culture and even from individual to individual.


Do not go around poking people constantly. In fact, don't touch them at all if they don't like it. Of course if they are a good friend of yours and they don't mind, then by all means have fun. Otherwise, keep your hands to yourself.
Don't talk about people behind their backs; especially if you have not stated your issue with the person in the first place. This is especially true of those who are related to you, or are your friends or significant other.
Do not impose, or appear uninvited. Try to control your emotions and not be too pushy. Give people space when they need it. Don't call every single day. Remember, the greatest form of annoyance is repetition.
Do not go through people's stuff. Even if their things are not private, they may still feel violated if you touch things that are in their personal space. If you wish to borrow something, ask for permission first and allow the person to give the item to you.
Mind your own business. Avoid butting into a conversation by (for example) saying, ""What are you talking about?"" If you hear someone talking about something with another person, and you only catch the last sentence, leave it be.

, Just because you're confident doesn't mean you have to act like you're better than anyone else. Don't do or say things that might let you appear to be arrogant, like bragging about your wealth or success.


Don't correct bad grammar/spelling or inaccuracies of others because most people don't like being corrected.
Don't tell people that their beliefs are wrong. Gently and nicely mention that you disagree. Have a clear moral line and stand by it. For instance, all is fair until you cause harm to another person. Yours may vary, but try to make sure it's used across the board.
Don't complain all the time. Remember the world does not revolve around you. If you complain too much, others will avoid you. This also goes for constantly insulting yourself, which is not humble - it's another form of self-absorption. It's normal to feel bad once in a while, and to express your discontent. But, you also need to know when to get over it and move on. Read up on how to be optimistic.
Be mindful of how the things you say are perceived by others. Even if your words are thoughtful and important, your tone of voice may indicate frustration, crankiness, or a condescending attitude, or flippancy or arrogance or any number of things which give folks the wrong impression and cause them to hate your guts.

, Conversation is a two way street. If you're talking constantly, others will get frustrated and quit trying to communicate with you. As a general rule, always listen more than you speak. Think about what you say before you say it. Avoid interrupting someone in the middle of a thought, even if it just jogged your memory of something to say. Remember the famous quotation, ""It is better to remain silent and be thought a fool, than to speak and remove all doubt"".

, Be aware if you are standing in doorways while having a conversation, standing in the middle of an area where people are trying to walk (in stores, malls, or the airport), or if your children are being obnoxious in a public place. Also, do not loudly sing or play music which others are likely to find irritating. Consider how your actions are likely to affect the people around you, and you will gain their respect.

, Don't peek down people's shirts for instance, don't pass gas, don’t talk about biological functions in public. Cover your nose and mouth with your elbow when you sneeze or cough. Take care to brush and/or floss after meals so as not to inflict your breath on others. Take a shower every day and put on clean clothes every day.

, Pay attention to the facial expressions and body language of those around you and work to immediately identify and stop whatever you're doing that is annoying others.

, When someone's having a bad day, don't try to hang around them to make them feel better (unless of course they ask). If you were having a bad day, you wouldn't want someone else bugging you with failing attempts at pick-me-ups. Ask if they would like your reassurance, but remember that ""no"" means ""no"". Only talk about what is bugging them if they bring it up.

, Constantly repeating the same action over and over again (such as making inappropriate sounds or pulling someone's hair, etc.), isn't the right way of 'getting attention'. If a person says 'stop', that means 'stop'. If you continue without stopping, you might lose a friend.


Don't copy people. If you copy someone they just get annoyed and walk away. You shouldn't copy your friends either because you could risk losing them.
Say it once. Don't say the thing you said twice because they would say, ""I heard you"" or ""Okay"" or something like that. It can get annoying to them. They heard it already; they don't want to hear it again.
Don't make repetitive noises. If you find yourself tapping your pencil on the table, chewing ice with your mouth open, tapping your foot against something, or any other repetitive noise, please stop.
Don't argue. Most people dislike arguing. Simply state that you disagree and refrain from setting yourself up as an expert on the subject. A ""know-it-all"" stance grates on peoples' nerves. Of course, you can have intelligent debates/discussions with a person/people provided the circumstances are appropriate and the other person is willing to engage. Never force someone into a debate. If someone tells you that they would rather not discuss a topic, drop it.

, When you assume you know why someone else does something without bothering to find out the real reasons, you're saying that you have access to secret knowledge or insights that no human being actually has. In other words, you're being arrogant and judgmental. Try to observe behaviors and, if necessary, ask the person about them in a non-confrontational way: ""I've noticed that you move around a lot when you're sitting. Is there a reason you do that?"".
Accept the answer without questioning it to the person. If the answer they give is, ""Yes, I have ADHD and I try to control it as much as I can, but sometimes I can't,"" then don't give them a skeptical look, or say, ""Whatever"" in a dismissive way. No one made you their judge, or their doctor, for that matter.


Don't give advice unless you share the same problem and can really empathize. ""Well, have you tried Ritalin for that?"" would be a truly annoying thing to say to the person with ADHD. Even worse would be, ""Maybe you just need to try harder to control that."" Or ""My second cousin had that, but he stood on his head every other Tuesday for a year while inhaling blueberries though a straw, and now he's completely cured.""

Keep its definition in mind.,
Recognize that ""mentally retarded"" is no longer an accepted diagnostic term.,
Do not call something you don't like ""retarded"".,
Never attack someone you don't like by calling them ""retarded"" or a ""tard"".,
Never use the word retarded to refer to a disabled person.,
Apologize when you use the word.,
Tell others you won't be using the r-word anymore.,
Stop thinking of disabled people as lesser.,
Know that people with disabilities are people.,
Do not assume people have cognitive disabilities based on their physical capabilities.,
Use terminology preferred by the individual with the disability.,
Use general terms to describe disabilities.","How to Avoid Using the Word ""Retarded"""," The word ""retarded"" literally means something that is delayed or held back in progress. It has been used as a clinical term (in ""mental retardation"") to refer to people with intellectual disabilities. By calling someone or something retarded or ""a retard"", it creates the message that having disabilities means you're dumb or stupid. People who really have disabilities (cognitive or physical) should always be treated with respect and sensitivity.


Recognize that the word ""retarded"" is considered hate speech, and can be alienating and frightening to disabled people.;
, The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) has replaced the word ""mental retardation"" with ""intellectual disability"". The use of the term has outgrown its clinical routes, and is generally considered inappropriate and offensive in all mainstream uses now.


The historical context of the word is important to know. People with disabilities have been treated poorly, discriminated against, abused, and neglected in the past and even today. Just changing the way you speak and avoiding using the term can make a difference for people with disabilities today and in the future.

, By calling something ""retarded"", you are essentially saying an undesirable object or event is the same as someone with intellectual, developmental, or physical disabilities. This invalidates feelings and the identities of people with disabilities and puts them in a position where they are used to describe something that is considered to be flawed, useless, or stupid. It also makes YOU look flawed, useless and stupid by using such an uncool term. There are a ton of great words you can use instead to describe things, people, and situations that anger or annoy you.For example:


If something is a bad idea, you can use words such as dense, useless, obtuse, pathetic, or vapid. Don't forget terms like jackass or bonehead. Or make up snappy new insults. Swearing may be okay, but might make you look less impressive.
If someone or something angers you, use words like contemptible, enraging, evil, infuriating, horrible, irrational, rage-inducing.
If someone or something is disgusting, try using nasty, gross, foul, nauseating, skeevy, repellent, repulsive, vomitous or terrible instead.

, By calling someone you don't like ""retarded"", you are equating all negative attributes about this person towards people with real disabilities. Come up with alternative words or phrases. For example:


If a person does something they shouldn't do, you can say, ""What you did didn't even make sense!"" or ""That was careless/foolish!"". ""Where's your head?!"" ""What the hell were you thinking?"" Or from baseball, ""That was a bonehead play.""

If a person does something that angers you, you can say, ""You're unbelievable!"" or ""You make me so furious!"". ""He makes me so mad I could explode!"" ""That just galls me.""

If someone does something that irritates you, tell them ""That is so annoying/irritating/immature"". ""You have no idea how ridiculous you look."" ""You're acting like a jackass."" ""Don't be a twit.""

If someone does something dense or is not listening to reason or logic, try saying ""You're being ignorant"" or ""That is irrational"" or ""Your idea is ridiculous"". ""You're not using your head."" ""There is so much wrong with that idea I don't even know where to start.""


, This includes people with intellectual disabilities, developmental disabilities, and physical disabilities. If you are trying to figure out whether someone's intelligence is affected by their disability, you should ask if they have an intellectual disability (or not ask at all).

, Sometimes habits can be hard to break. Make the active choice to acknowledge your mistake and apologize for it, even if you think the people around won't care or won't be affected by your language. By pointing out your mistake, others will take note and perhaps think twice before using ""retarded"" in their own language. You can simply say, ""I'm sorry for saying that. That was inappropriate"".


Even if you don't think you are in the presence of someone with a disability, someone near you may have an invisible disability, or know someone with a disability. They will appreciate your sincerity and apology.

, Many people have taken the pledge not to use the R-word and are proactively sharing their stories with people around the world. Making a public or active decision not to use the r-word can:


Make yourself accountable. When you slip up, others will catch on and remind you that you used the word. It will also challenge you not to use the word because you won't want to break your pledge and look like a bad example to others.
Raise awareness of the dangers of using the r-word. Some people may have never thought the r-word was offensive. By pledging publicly, you are raising awareness of the problem and challenging others to rethink their use of the word.
Generate discourse. People may tell you that using the r-word is ""no big deal"". This is a great opportunity for you to educate others about why the r-word is not cool and that it does matter when you use hurtful and offensive language.

, View people with disabilities as different, not inferior. You can help them feel included by accepting them for who they are, disabilities and all.


Don't criticize someone for looking or acting unusual (e.g. stimming, having an unusual face, or being a little hyper). These quirks are part of who they are, and should be respected just as much as your love of computers or the shape of your chin.
Stop calling bad things ""stupid"" or ""dumb."" People who have intellectual disabilities don't deserve that comparison. (And maybe they hate Nickelback just as much as you do.)
Recognize that each person has their own worth. A dyslexic person might be a ridiculously hard worker, while your friend with Down Syndrome is the kindest person you know. Some strengths are even tied directly to disability, such as the spacial perception strengths associated with autism.

, Their disabilities do not necessarily define or encompass their entire identity. However, this doesn't mean avoiding or dismissing the subject of their disabilities. Some things you can do to help navigate interactions:


Get to know them first. Many people with disabilities want to be included. Do not treat them like they are ""special"" by using baby talk or talking about them like they aren't there. Instead, approach someone with a disability like you would with anyone else.
Communicate with them. Some people with intellectual disabilities understand better if you slow your speech down a little. Some are better at communicating in other ways such as with facial expressions, hand gestures, or writing.
Learn more about their disability, either through your own research or through others. By having a better understanding of someone's disabilities, you can better communicate with others and change the way you think about people with disabilities.

, Having obvious physical signs of disabilities does not mean someone also has intellectual disabilities, or that they are incapable of handling a normal conversation. (Don't forget Stephen Hawking!) Some things you can do to help you navigate interactions with visibly disabled people are:


Speak to the person normally and directly. Avoid using baby talk or addressing someone next to them. In most cases, if alternative ways need to be used to communicate, the person or someone else will inform you.
Don't assume every physically disabled person needs help. You may want to hold the door open for them, carry their bags, or help them pick up stuff that has fallen. However, you may be accidentally getting in their way, or making them feel like they are different from everyone else. Offer help first before diving in by simply asking them, ""Can I help you with that?""

, This shows sensitivity towards disabilities in a respectful way. Observe how the individual speaks about their disability and mimic their language. In some situations, you can ask them directly how to address their disability, but remember to do this respectfully.


Some people may not be comfortable to talk to you about their disability. Get to know the person a little bit, and then you might be able to ask them about their disability. For example, you can say, ""I'm curious about your using a wheelchair. Are you comfortable talking about it, or would you prefer not to?""
Not all terms will be accepted by every person who has that disability. This person may tell you it's okay to use a particular term around them but it doesn't necessarily mean you can use it for every other person that has the same disability.

, When you are speaking or writing to the public, do a bit of research to ensure you use widely accepted terminology when talking about disabilities.Or when you are speaking about someone with a disability and you don't know the specific term or how to address their disability, use descriptive language such as, ""Maya has a developmental disability"" or ""He is deaf.""


Different situations and places have different accepted terms to describe disabilities. Identity-first language is more common in the UK and the Autistic, Deaf, and Blind communities.This means you would use the term ""disabled person"" compared to ""person with a disability"" which is person-first language. Always ask about this.
Person-first language is generally preferred by people with other intellectual and developmental disabilities and in the U.S.When you're uncertain, use both person-first and identity-first language to respect both preferences.

Assess proxemics and haptics, or distancing and touching.,
Read the person's eyes.,
Look at the person's posture.",How to Read Body Language2," This is one way to communicate the status of an interpersonal relationship. Physical closeness and touch signal liking, affection, and love..


People in close relationships require less personal space than with strangers.It is worth noting that personal space is culturally fluid; keep in mind that what is considered close in one country is considered far away in another.

, Studies have found that when people are engaged in an interesting conversation, their eyes remain focused on their partner's face approximately 80% of the time. They don't only focus on the other person's eyes, however, but focus on the eyes for a few minutes, then move down to the nose or lips, then back up to the eyes. They may look down at table every once in a while, but they always return to meeting the other person's eyes.When people look up and to the right during a conversation, it usually means they're bored and have already dismissed the conversation.Dilated pupils mean that the person is interested in what is going on. Keep in mind, however, that many substances can cause the pupils to dilate, including alcohol, cocaine, amphetamines, LSD, and others.Eye contact is also frequently used as an indication of truthfulness. Overly persistent or even aggressive eye contact suggests that a person is very aware of what messages he is trying to send out. A person who tries to deceive someone, thus, may distort his eye contact so that he doesn't appear to be avoiding it, which is a widely recognized indicator of lying.However, keep in mind, as noted above, that there is a lot of individual variation when it comes to evaluating eye contact and lying.

, If someone rests their arms behind their neck or head, the person is conveying that he is open to what is being discussed or may just laid back in general.


Tightly crossed limbs are usually a sign of resistance and low receptivity to another person. In general, when the body is arranged in such a manner, this is a sign that a person is mentally, emotionally, and physically closing themselves off from another person.In one study of 2,000 negotiations, which were videotaped to assess the negotiators' body language, there wasn't an agreement in any case where one of the participants had his or her legs crossed."

Evaluate eye contact.,
Watch for certain facial expressions.,
Consider the person's posture, gestures, and stance.,
Be aware of gender differences in showing attraction.",How to Read Body Language3," Making eye contact is a sign of attraction, as is blinking more than the average 6-10 times per minute.Winking can also be a sign of flirting or attraction. However, keep in mind that this may be culturally-specific; some Asian cultures frown upon winking and consider it rude., Smiling is one of the clearest signs of attraction. Make sure you know how to decipher a forced smile from a real one. You can tell fake smiles from real ones because the smile doesn't reach all the way to their eyes. Genuine smiles usually result in tiny crinkles around a person's eyes (crow's feet). When people fake smile, you won't see the wrinkles.Raising the eyebrows has also been observed as a sign of flirting., Generally people who are attracted to each other try to close the distance to one another. This may mean leaning forward towards the other person more but can also be more direct, in the form of touching. A light tap or stroking of the arm can be a signal of attraction.


Attraction can also be signaled by the person's feet staying pointed toward or facing the object of his interest.Palms turned up is another sign of romantic interest because it suggests openness., Men and women can show differences in demonstrating attraction via their body language.


A man is likely to lead forward and turn his torso toward the person of his interest, whereas a woman reciprocating attraction turns her torso away and leans back.An interested man may lift his hands above his head, angled at 90 degrees.When a woman shows attraction, both arms may be open, and the hands may touch the body in the area between the hips and the chin."
"
Notice eye contact.,
Assess facial expressions.,
Evaluate gestures and stance.,
Consider how the person manages their personal space.,
Watch how and when the person touches.",How to Read Body Language4," Eye contact, a channel of kinesics, is the primary way that people communicate dominance. People establishing dominance will take the liberty of staring at and surveying others while making direct eye contact. They will also be the last person to break eye contact.If you're looking to assert your power, keep in mind that constant eye contact can be intimidating., A person asserting dominance will also refrain from smiling in order to communicate seriousness and may instead frown or purse his lips., Gestures can display dominance; pointing at others and using large gestures is a way to show others your status. In addition, when someone takes a wider and taller stance while also being relaxed, this is another show of dominance.Dominant individuals will also have a firm handshake. They will usually place their hand on top with their palm facing downwards; the grip will be firm and sustained in order to demonstrate control., Those with high status will generally enable more physical space to exist between themselves and lower status people. High-status individuals will also take up more physical space to show their dominance and mastery of the situation.In other words, an expansive pose signals power and achievement.Power is also displayed through standing versus sitting. Standing - and particularly in the foreground - is seen as a more powerful pose.A straight back and strong shoulders kept back, rather than hunching forward, further conveys confidence. Slouching and slumping, by contrast, convey a lack of confidence.Dominant individuals will also lead from the front and walk ahead of the group or go through the doors first. They like to be up front., People asserting their status will have more options when it comes to touch because they feel more confident in their position. Generally, in an unequal situation where one person has a higher status, he will touch the lower-status person with greater frequency.In social situations where both communicators have equal status, both people will reciprocate touch in similar ways."

Know that reading body language is a complex task.,
Remember to consider individual differences.,
Be aware that body language can differ according to culture.,
Note that understanding differs according to nonverbal channel.",How to Read Body Language5," Nonverbal behavior is itself complex since all people are different and present themselves differently.Reading body language can be challenging because when interpreting the signs people are sending you, you need to take into account the whole picture. For example, did that person already mention to you today that he had a fight with his wife or didn't a get a promotion at work? Or was he visibly anxious over lunch?


When interpreting others’ body language, it’s important wherever possible to take into account their personality, social factors, verbal behavior, and the setting. While this information is not always available, it can be helpful to read body language. People are complex, so it shouldn't come as a surprise that how they convey themselves with their bodies is complex too!
You could compare reading body language to watching your favorite TV show; after all, you wouldn't just watch one scene in your favorite TV show, but the whole episode in order to properly understand the meaning of that one scene. You'd also probably keep in mind past episodes, a character’s history, and the plot as a whole. You need to look at this bigger picture also when it comes to reading body language!

, There is no 'one size fits all' when it comes to body language. If you are invested in being able to read a person's body language accurately, you may have to 'study' that person for some time. What is true for one person may not always be true for another.


For example, when lying, some people break eye contact, while others attempt to maintain even more eye contact than usual so that they won't be suspected of lying.

, For some emotions and expressions of body language, the meaning of the messages is culturally-specific.


For instance, in Finnish culture, when a person makes eye contact, it is a sign of approachability. By contrast, when a person makes eye contact, it is considered to be an expression of anger for the Japanese.To give another example, in western culture, a person who feels comfortable with you will lean forward toward you and square their face and body directly toward you.People with certain disabilities may have unique body language. For example, autistic people often avoid eye contact while listening, and fidget frequently.
Note that while some physical expressions of emotion vary from culture to culture, some research suggests that certain expressions of body language are universal across cultures. This is especially true for the communication of dominance and submission. For example, across different cultures, a lowered posture indicates submission., The nonverbal channel is the means by which a message or sign is conveyed without words. Important nonverbal channels include those of kinesics (eye contact, facial expressions, and body language), haptics (touch), and proxemics (personal space). In other words, the medium determines the message.As a general rule, people are best at reading facial expressions, and then body language, and, finally, personal space and touch.Even within each channel, there can be great variation. For instance, not all facial expressions are equally easy to understand. People are generally better at reading facial expressions that are pleasant rather than unpleasant. One study found that individuals are better at accurately interpreting happiness, contentment, and excitement, compared to anger, sadness, fear, and disgust. "

Convince yourself that swearing is a negative thing.,
Practice positive thinking.,
Be patient with yourself.",How to Stop Swearing2," Swearing is used in a lot of different contexts - you might swear when you are angry or frustrated, when you are trying to emphasize a point or when you are trying to be funny. Swearing is an unpleasant habit for a variety of reasons. It gives the impression of stupidity or a lack of education, even if this is not the case. It can be intimidating or viewed as a form of bullying if directed at another person. It can also be extremely offensive or off-putting to listeners, thus limiting your job prospects or ruining your potential for romantic engagements.Your swearing habit may have developed as a child, if you were exposed to bad language in your family home. Or it might have started as a teenager, when you used curse words to look cool in front of your friends.
Whatever the reason, there's no point in looking back and blaming people. The most important thing is that you recognize that you have a problem and commit to working through it.

, Positive thinking is essential to giving up swearing. This is because people are generally much more inclined to swear when they are complaining about something, in a bad mood or just being negative in general. By thinking positively, you are removing the need to swear altogether. Admittedly, learning how to think positively can be difficult. If you find yourself leaning towards negative thoughts or emotions; just stop, take a deep breath, and ask yourself ""does it really matter?""For example, ask yourself ""does it really matter if I'm a few minutes late for my meeting?"" or ""does it really matter if I can't find the remote control and have to switch the channels on the television set instead?"" Putting a situation into the right perspective can help you to calm down and overcome negative emotions.
In addition, you will need to think positively about your ability to stop swearing. If you have a negative outlook and have doubts about your ability to succeed, you are setting yourself up for failure from the get-go. Remind yourself that if people can give up smoking or lose hundreds of pounds of weight through dieting, you will definitely be able to give up swearing!

, Swearing is habit that you've probably picked up over a number of years and which you've come to rely on as part of your daily speech. Like any ingrained habit, it will be impossible to stop doing it overnight. Training yourself to stop swearing is a process, you'll have good days and bad days, but it's important to keep at it. Remind yourself why you're doing it and visualize how good you'll feel when you've finally kicked the habit.


Really think about why you want to stop swearing. Maybe you're afraid of giving off the wrong impression at a new job or you don't want to set a bad example for your kids. Use this as motivation to keep trying.
Whatever you do, don't give up. Exercise your self control and remind yourself that you can do anything you set your mind to!

Pay attention to your swearing habits.,
Replace swear words with harmless substitutes.,
Expand your vocabulary.",How to Stop Swearing3," An isolated swear word here and there can be forgiven - but if you find yourself swearing constantly, unable to to go more than a sentence or two without throwing in an expletive, that's when you know you have a problem. The first step in training yourself to stop swearing is to become aware of when you do it. Do you only curse around certain people or in specific situations? Is there a particular swear word that you use all the time? Try to identify why you curse and the role that swear words play in your speech patterns.


Once you begin paying attention to your swearing habits, you may be shocked by how much you rely on swearing to express yourself. Don't be too dismayed by it though, recognizing how often you curse is the first step towards fixing the problem.
Once you start paying attention to your own cursing habits, you will start to pick up on other people's, without even realizing it. This is also a good thing, as you will realize how unpleasant swearing sounds and what a negative impression it gives off.

, Once you have identified your major swearing habits, you can set about eliminating swear words from your casual speech. This is when you curse for no real reason - you're not angry, it didn't just slip out - you are just using the curse word as a figure of speech. You can correct this problem by replacing the curse word with a harmless substitute, perhaps something beginning with the same letter or with a similar sound, which doesn't cause offense.


For example, try replacing ""sh**"" with ""sugar"" or ""f***"" with ""duck"". You'll feel silly saying these words at first, but you'll get used to it after a while. Using such meaningless words may even eliminate your need to express yourself negatively at all.
Even if you slip up and say the forbidden curse word, follow it immediately with your chosen alternative. Over time, your brain will come to associate the two and you will be able to actively choose one over the other.

, Swear words are often used ""for want of a better word."" The problem with this excuse is that there are plenty of better words out there, any of which will allow you to express yourself much more eloquently and succinctly than a curse word ever will. By expanding your vocabulary and replacing your most commonly used swear words with an array of alternative options, you will come across as being more intelligent, pleasant and laid-back than ever before.


Make a list of your favorite swear words, then use a dictionary or thesaurus to come up with a range of alternative options. For example, instead of using the word ""B.S."" morning, noon and night, try replacing it with infinitely more descriptive and humorous words such as balderdash, hogwash, drivel and baloney.You can also expand your vocabulary by reading more books and newspapers. Jot down any descriptive words that tickle your fancy and make an effort to use them in a sentence. Also make an effort to really listen to other people and make a mental note of the words and phrases that they use to express themselves, rather than resorting to swearing.

Use open body language.,
Identify emotional body language.,
Avoid blocking.,
Spot when someone is lying.,
Consider spacing.,
Identify your body language patterns.",How to Communicate With Body Language1," This means that you have an assertive handshake, sit calmly, but exude energy, and seem in control of all gestures. Your posture should be relaxed, but your back should be straight. This shows people you are comfortable and confident. Pause when you speak to draw in the listener and show confidence.
Keep your legs slightly apart so you take up more space. This also demonstrates confidence. Lean in slightly when a person is speaking to show interest (leaning away will show a sense of hostility). Don’t cross your arms. Instead, let them dangle at your sides or press them together in your lap. This shows you are open to other people.
Make sure your handshake is firm, but not too crushing. Look the other person in the eyes, although you shouldn’t stare too much. Blink, and look away sometimes so they don’t feel you are trying to be intimidating.
Play with your tone of voice. Tone of voice is a way that people communicate confidence. The key to success is projecting confidence.;
, You can determine emotions by paying careful attention to non-verbal cues. You should also take into context what’s going on at the time you spot the emotional signs, though.


When people are angry, their face flushes, they bare their teeth, they clench their fists, and they invade body space, sometimes by leaning forward. When people are nervous or anxious, their face pales, their mouth seems dry (so they may drink water or lick their lips), they show varying speech tone, and they have tension in their muscles (so they may clench their arms or hands, and their elbows may be drawn in to their sides.) Other signs of nervousness include trembling lip, fidgeting, and gasping or holding breath.

, If you are giving a presentation or speech, you want to be as open as you can to your audience. Thus, you should remove physical barriers that will limit your ability to connect.


Podiums, computers, chairs, and even a folder, are all props that create distance between a speaker and audience, preventing a sense of connection.
Crossing your arms or speaking to someone while sitting behind a computer monitor are blocking behaviors.

, Body language can give away liars. They might be able to hide their lies in their words, but their bodies often tell another story.


Liars are less likely to maintain eye contact, and their pupils may appear constricted.
Turning the body away from you is a sign of lying.
Complexion changes, such as redness in the neck or face, and perspiration, are all signs of lying, as are vocal changes like clearing of the throat.
Be aware that some signs of lying – sweating, poor or no eye contact- are also indications of nervousness or fear. , Different cultures have different ideas about how much physical space you should give another person. But, generally, social distance is broken down into four categories.


Intimate distance. Defined as touching another person to 45 centimeters. If you enter a person’s intimate distance, this can be very unsettling for them unless it’s welcomed or you’re already intimate.
Personal distance. 45 centimeters to 1.2 m. You are close enough to shake hands and to see each other’s expressions and gestures.
Social distance. This is the normal distance in situations that are impersonal or business transactions, defined as 1.2 m to 3.6 m. Speech should be louder and eye contact remains important.
Public distance. 3.7m to 4.5m. Examples of those who often operate in public distance are teachers or those who talk to people in groups. Non-verbal communication is critical but often exaggerated. Hand gestures and head movements can be more important than facial expressions as the latter are often not perceived.

, Make a conscious effort to think about what your body is doing in different interactions with different people. A mirror can be useful to examine facial expressions and posture, but mainly you just want to pay attention to what your body does when you're angry, nervous, or happy.


Determine whether your body language is in sync with your message. Your body language is effective if it communicates the message you want it to communicate. Does your posture communicate confidence, or does it make you seem unsure of yourself even though your words express confidence?
If your non-verbal signals match your words, you'll not only communicate more clearly, you'll also be perceived as being more charismatic.

Use hand gestures when speaking.,
Move throughout the room.,
Spot emblems.,
Have good posture.,
Mirror another person.,
Emphasize your point with gestures.,
Avoid gestures that show nervousness or insecurity.Keep a check on other body language signals.",How to Communicate With Body Language2," Experts believe that people who are great speakers are more likely to use hand gestures during conversations or presentations, and they say hand gestures give listeners greater confidence in the speaker.


More complex gestures involving two hands above the waist are associated with complex thinking. Politicians like Bill Clinton, Barack Obama, Colin Powell, and Tony Blair are considered charismatic, effective speakers, and that's partly because they frequently use hand gestures.

, Don’t only move your hands. Great speakers move around. They point at slides, and they don’t keep their distance from people. They are animated.


Keeping your hands in your pockets when speaking or having a conversation will make you seem insecure and closed off.
In contrast, if you take your hands out of your pockets and keep your palms upward, you will demonstrate that you are likable and believable. , These are gestures that are the equivalents of words. Emblems can be either passive or they can be accepting. Remember that some emblems will have different meanings to different cultures.


Clenched fists or other tension in the body can be signs of aggression, as if the person is prepared for a fight. Facing the other person, squared off and towards them, and sitting near them can also be signs of aggression. Sudden movements might be made.
In contrast, accepting gestures are those when the arms are rounded and palms sideways, as if the person is offering up a mock hug. Gestures are slow and gentle. Nodding when a person speaks shows you agree with them, and makes you seem like a great listener. , If you go to, say a job interview, and you have bad posture, you will probably register more poorly to the interviewer.


People will associate bad posture with weak confidence or boredom or lack of engagement. They might even think you’re lazy and unmotivated if you don’t sit up straight.
To have good posture, your head should be up and your back should be straight. Lean forward if you’re seated. Sit down the front of your chair, and lean forward slightly to show you’re interested and engaged.

, Mirroring is when one partner mirrors the posture of the other partner. By copying the actions of the other person, you will make them feel connected to you.


You can mirror a person’s tone, body language or position of the body. You shouldn’t do this blatantly or repeatedly though, only subtly.
Mirroring is one of the most effective ways to use body language to build a rapport with someone. , Have more than one gesture. This will help you better get your message across. If you want to make sure you're not misunderstood, repeat both gestures when you speak the idea aloud.


If the listener doesn't pick up on one gesture, he or she will likely be familiar with the other. You don't have to use a body language gesture (or two) for every word, but it's a good idea to have a toolbox of gestures you can use to reinforce very important, yet easily misinterpreted concepts.
Direct the most positive gestures toward the listener. This lets you more clearly indicate that you are offering a favorable outcome to the listener. Direct the most negative gestures away from yourself and the listener. This way you clearly indicate that you wish that no obstacle stands in the way of your intended message.

, Watch for wandering eyes, hands picking at fluff on your clothing and constant sniffling.


Touching one's face signals anxiety. Improve your posture. If you're constantly hunched over or touching your face, you'll never look confident, approachable or at ease. Improving your posture and working to eliminate nervous tics can be difficult and will take time, but you'll quickly improve your overall non-verbal communication.
These small gestures add up and are all guaranteed to dampen the effectiveness of your message. Don't worry about if you accidentally perform a few of these in any given setting.

Figure out the “visual dominance ratio.” When you are talking to someone, you should try to be the person who is “visually dominant” to demonstrate confidence.,
Use eye contact to send messages.,
Understand affect displays.,
Avoid defensiveness.,
Watch for disengagement.",How to Communicate With Body Language3," This ratio is determined by figuring out who is looking at the other person’s eyes more, and who is looking away more.


Your visual dominance ratio helps determine where you stand on social dominance hierarchy compared to the other person in the conversation. People who spend most of the time looking away have a relatively low amount of social dominance. People who are less likely to look away are probably the boss. People who look downward display helplessness because they seem like they are trying to avoid criticism or any conflict.

, The eyes are the windows to the soul, as the cliché goes. You can learn a lot about a person by paying attention to how they use their eyes.


Avoiding eye contact at all, or looking downward with the eyes a lot, are both indications of defensiveness. Eye contact will be more continuous if a person is trying to listen to you, rather than speak. Looking away from the other person can also be an indication the person doing the speaking isn’t ready to stop and listen yet.
Looking at a person can be an indication of attraction. People who are interested in someone show strong eye contact and lean forward toward the other person in the conversation.
Depending on the context, making eye contact with another person can be used to show respect. For example, when you’re giving a presentation to a room full of people, divide the room into thirds. Address comments to one side, and then the other side, and then the middle. Pick out a person in each section to address comments to. The people who are sitting around them will think you are having direct contact with them, and this will make them rate you higher as a speaker. , Pay close attention to facial expressions that convey emotion, especially if they conflict with the words a person is uttering. They can help you figure out a person’s true emotions.


Regulators are facial expressions that provide feedback during conversations, such as nodding the head, and expressions of interest or boredom. Regulators allow the other person to assess level of interest or agreement. Essentially, they provide feedback. You can show empathy towards another person by using affirmative movements, such as nodding your head and smiling. These gestures, used when another person is speaking, give them positive reinforcement and show you like what they are saying.

, Certain body language gestures, including facial expressions, communicate defensiveness, not confidence. Thus, they make you seem less in control.


Limited facial expressions and small, close to the body hand/arm gestures are indications of defensiveness.
Turning the body away from the other person or crossing your arms in front of your body are other indications of defensiveness. , If you are giving a presentation, you want people to be engaged. If you are the person watching the presentation, you want to seem engaged. There are signs you can look for that indicate engagement or a lack thereof.


Heads tilted downward and eyes gazing elsewhere indicate disengagement.
Slumping in a chair is a sign of disengagement. Similarly, fiddling, doodling, or writing, are signs that a person is disengaged.

Use non-verbal communication..,
Use encouraging words to show understanding.,
Repeat or paraphrase to show understanding.,
Politely end the conversation.,

Improve your understanding.,
Express your views.,
Change the subject.,
Change the relationship.,
Take action.,
Be genuine.,
Consider what the other person likes.,
Follow through.,
Be supportive.",How to Act Like You Care," Active listening is a style of listening in which the listener demonstrates their attentiveness to the speaker.There are many ways you can show attentiveness without speaking.


Maintaining eye contact is a common way of showing that you are listening.Nodding, smiling, and exhibiting a relaxed posture also suggest that you are listening attentively.;
, Active listeners often use short phrases to show that they understand and are paying attention.Even if you aren't actually interested in the topic, these cues show you are listening politely.


Common phrases of encouragement include ""Mmm hmm,"" ""I see,"" ""Right,"" and ""Uh-huh."", You can show someone you understand and are listening by repeating back to him or her what's been said, or paraphrasing what he or she has just told you.If you don't actually understand what you've just been told, you can also ask for clarification. This also sends the message that you are listening.

, When the opportunity presents itself, you will probably wish to either end the conversation or change the subject if you aren't actually interested in the topic.


Offer a reason for ending the conversation, such as a task you need to resume or a person you need to findIf this is your first time talking to someone, you can also end a conversation with ""It was nice meeting you.""You can also tell the person that you really want to hear more about the topic of conversation and you'll call them tomorrow. Then follow through on your promise so that they know that you care.

, If you often find yourself pretending to be interested, this may be a sign that you should change the way you are interacting with others.


There are many reasons you might not be interested in listening. Sometimes you just aren't in the mood, and that's fine. Other circumstances, however, call for different responses. You might not understand the topic well. Or, you might not feel like your views are being heard. You may just have no interest in the topic. It could just be that the person talking thinks they know best and only wants to hear their own perspective.
Everyone finds themselves in the position of disinterested listener occasionally. However, constantly playing the role of an active listener isn't fulfilling and doesn't lay the groundwork for good conversations or satisfying relationships., Frequently, a person may lose interest in a conversation because he or she doesn't understand the topic well enough. In such a case, it might be worth asking for more explanation--you might be surprised to find you are interested!


Often, people who know a great deal about a topic will discuss it at a level of detail or specificity that is hard for others to understand. If you want to keep the conversation going, ask them to explain in simpler terms.For example, you may have a friend who is chemist. You may find science to be generally interesting, but every time it comes up, your friend starts using terms you don't understand or discussing the details of their experiments. You might find some common ground if you can convince your friend to talk in more general, accessible terms.

, Sometimes a conversation isn't interesting because you aren't conversing, you're just listening. If you don't mind the topic but aren't enjoying the conversation, try adding your own thoughts and perspectives more often.


Inserting your own views or feelings often improves conversation.As long as you aren't interrupting, sharing your thoughts on a topic can also show that you are really listening., Ultimately, the problem may be that you just aren't interested in a topic, even if you like the person talking. If you are willing to continue the conversation, but would rather talk about something mutually interesting, change the subject.


Look for a chance to use something the other person has said as a ""bridge"" to a new topic.For example, if someone is talking to you about music, but you are much more interested in movies, you might look for an opportunity to bring up a famous film soundtrack as a means of shifting the topic.

, The problem may actually be the person talking rather than the topic. If this is the case, you may need to try to work on your relationship with that person, or maybe even end the relationship.


For example, if someone you know only talks about themselves and never wants to listen to others, that person may be a narcissist. People like these can be very difficult to have conversations (or relationships) with.If the relationship is important to you, it may be worth talking to the other person about why you have a hard time conversing with them. If you and the other party care about each other, it may be possible to change the relationship in such a way that you want to listen and the other person wants to listen to you. Understanding the problem is the first step toward improving the relationship.If the relationship isn't important, it may just be that this is not someone you want to have conversations with. In such a case, it might be better to avoid contact rather than routinely having to pretend you are interested. While this can be hurtful, sometimes its for the best., It's great to tell people you care about them and be a good listener, but as the saying goes, actions speak louder than words. If you want to show someone you care, do something nice for him or her.Some examples of things you can do to show caring include:


Cooking someone a meal, or buying one at a restaurant.Giving a gift (even a very small one).
Making or buying them a card, even if there's no special occasion to buy a card for.
Doing a chore like taking out the trash or washing their car, especially if it's a chore you know she or he particularly dislikes.
Giving a hug.Think creatively! There are lots of ways to show you care. Remember that for many people, surprises are especially nice., There are many ways you can act like you care for someone who is important in your life. Caring acts will be most effective when you are being sincere, not just acting.


Doing something nice for someone may not communicate caring if you do it just to appease or placate him or her. When you interact with others, be aware of your emotions and make sure the things you say and do come from a genuinely caring place.

, Keep in mind that the actions or words that might make you feel cared for may not communicate caring to someone else. Learning what makes your friends and loved ones feel good will help you express your caring.


For example, you might enjoy being gently teased by someone you care about. Maybe your girlfriend or boyfriend has a pet name for you like ""goon"" or ""doofus"" that makes you both laugh. Keep in mind that some people find any kind of teasing hurtful.
Maybe there's a movie that really cheers you up that you watch with a close friend when you feel sad. That may work well for you, but showing up to your brother's house with a copy of the film after he's lost his job may seem weird or insensitive to him, rather than an act of caring.

, When you tell someone you are going to do something, do it. Be reliable and trustworthy.This is especially important when it comes to promises. For example, imagine you've told someone you will keep a very personal secret. It's very important that you don't tell anyone the private information, even if it seems harmless at the time.For more everyday commitments, like agreeing to pick up a gallon of milk or make some photocopies, try to remember to do these things without being reminded. This shows you are thinking about the other person., When a friend or loved one is going through hard times, you can show you care by being there for him or her. Spend time around the other person, and be a good listener. Even if you can't help with the problem, being there to listen shows you care.If a friend is having a life crisis, don't be afraid to tell him or her you care and are concerned. Check in regularly, offer support, and help him or her find professional help if necessary."

Match your behavior to others'.,
Look utterly ordinary.,
Keep your opinions to yourself.,
Don't look people in the eyes.,
Don't approach other people.,
Enjoy solitary or anonymous pursuits.,
Don't break the mold.",How to Be Obscure1," Perhaps the single best way to avoid attracting attention to yourself is to do what everyone around you is doing. There is safety in numbers — if your behavior is indistinguishable from that of the people next to you, it's unlikely that you'll be singled out for any sort of special attention, especially if you're in a large group of people. If you're looking to blend into the crowd, start by examining the ""crowd"" around you. Ask yourself: What are the people around me doing right now? Are they talking to one another? If so, how friendly are they? How do they seem to be acting? The answers to these questions should help you match your behavior to those around you.


Obviously, this step is very context-dependent. While sitting quietly in the corner and reading a magazine may make you virtually unnoticeable in a crowded waiting room, it can get you noticed at a wild house party, so pay attention to your surroundings if you're looking to go undetected.;
, Even if you perfectly match your behavior and attitude to that of the people around you, you can still easily be noticed if you look a way that's not expected in whatever situation you're in. Some fashion choices, especially tattoos, are long-term, so there's not much you can do other than conceal them. However, the clothes you wear and (to a lesser extent) the way you wear your hair are under your control, so keep these things plain and ordinary if you're looking to go unnoticed.


Here's a sample ""casual"" look that shouldn't attract any attention in non-formal settings. Best of all, it's mostly unisex:





Jeans
T-shirt
Plain hoodie
Athletic shoes/sneakers
Clean-cut haircut (for men), straight hair or in a bun (for women)
Light makeup, minimal jewelry (for women)






Note that ideas for a wide variety of other cheap, unassuming outfits are available online on budget fashion blogs or simply via a search engine query., One sure-fire way to get noticed is to speak up when it's not necessary, so, if you're trying to blend into the crowd, you may want to try to ""clam up"" when your opinion isn't required. For interactions you do have to have with others, keep your responses polite and friendly, but brief and to-the-point. The more time you spend expounding on any topic, especially personal ones, the less anonymous you become.


Again, this advice is entirely context-dependent. While keeping completely silent may help you on the bus, it will probably call unnecessary attention to you if you do it when you're called to answer a question in class. ""Keeping your opinions to yourself"" also means knowing when saying nothing at all is more attention-grabbing than an ordinary response.

, Eye contact is a powerful social tool — it's a way to forge an instant connection with someone else without exchanging a single word, though some research in recent years has shown that it's not necessarily useful for getting people to like you or agree with you.Regardless, if you're interested in remaining completely anonymous, you'll want to avoid other peoples' eye contact except in social situations that demand it. This means that when you're walking or driving outside the house, you should avoid meeting random peoples' gazes and that when you're in a situation where someone might talk to you, you'll want to avoid eye contact until conversation has started.


Some people who are naturally shy or socially awkward can have a difficult time maintaining eye contact in social situations. Because being unable to maintain any sort of eye contact can call as much attention to you as using too much eye contact, you may want to practice with a willing friend or even the TV or mirror if this is the case with you. Luckily, medical research suggests that practice can be effective for improving eye contact skills., This one is a no brainer — if you're trying to be a complete wallflower, don't approach other people and try to start conversations. If you're in a social situation and someone comes to you to start a conversation, you'll obviously want to respond with politeness and honesty, but don't start conversations with strangers you don't have to. Instead, try hanging back and talking with one of your friends or simply taking in your surroundings on your own.

, As noted in the advice above, you'll go more unnoticed by strangers if you don't come into contact with them at all, so try to spend some of your free time doing things that don't require other people at all (or only require a few close friends). There are hundreds of fun, exciting things to do that you don't need anyone else for which can allow you to have a great time and grow as a person while ensuring you keep a low profile. Below are just a few ideas for fun solitary hobbies:


Learning to play an instrument or composing your own music
Reading
Working out (e.g. running, swimming, biking, lifting weights, etc.)
Studying a new skill
Exploring the wilderness/Geocaching (Note: always tell someone where you're going before venturing into the wilderness on your own)
Writing (e.g. short stories, blog posts, writing for user-supported websites, etc.)

, This is the first commandment of wallflowers and people who don't want any unneeded attention. Avoid publicly going against the group you're with. Don't act ways that the people around you aren't acting. Don't dress, behave or speak in ways that aren't considered ""ordinary"". Don't question society or your role in it. If you do harbor any sorts of disagreements that challenge the status-quo, keep them to yourself to avoid the extra attention!


If it's not obvious, a life that's dedicated only to staying anonymous can be seriously lacking in opportunities for self expression. Try to keep things in perspective — the attention you get from challenging the status quo can be scary, but it's better than constantly being afraid of the consequences.

Be mysterious.,
Be unpredictable.,
Don't care about other people's opinions.,
Pursue varied interests.,
Be coy about personal details.,
Stay calm.",How to Be Obscure2," If you're trying to be hard to pin down, nothing's more useful than cultivating a mysterious persona. Be a person of few words, but when you speak, make it count. Try to maintain a fairly deadpan personality, even when you're joking. Talk about things in broad strokes, but leave the details vague. Leave your motives up to others' imaginations. With luck (and a little practice), you'll leave others perplexed, but intrigued.


For example, let's compare a mysterious exchange to a non-mysterious one. Let's say an attractive person comes up to you and asks, ""Hey, haven't I seen you at that bookstore around here?"" An ordinary response might be, ""Yeah! I go there every weekend. They have a great selection. What's your name?"" This is a perfectly fine, friendly response, but we can be more mysterious if we say something like, ""Mmm. Dostoevsky's brilliant, isn't he?"" This makes your answer a little less cut-and-dry and gives your partner a few more follow-up questions.
There are tons of resources online for how to be mysterious. Often, these are dating guides written for a male audience, but there are numerous resources for women as well., If no one's confident that they can predict what you're going to do next, they won't be able to define you or pin you down. Keep people on their toes by doing whatever strikes your fancy at any given time. Are you out on a date? Pop into a new hole-in-the-wall joint you've never been to. Are you stuck in an airport terminal? Take out your guitar and start a sing-along with the people around you. Starting to follow some of your wilder impulses can help you make yourself completely undefinable to other people.


With unpredictability comes risk, however. The hole-in-the-wall joint that you visit on a whim may end up being disgusting, while the people you try to get to join you in a sing-along may give you the cold shoulder. As we'll see below, keeping a cool head and remaining indifferent to others' opinions and expectations of you can help you deal with the occasional failure.

, When people start to care about what other people think of them, they become predictable, and when people become predictable, they're not mysterious anymore. Keeping a high opinion of yourself (even when those with poor taste may not) is crucial for achieving the sort of mysterious, hard to pin down persona that can be so desirable. Don't work for anyone's approval but your own.


Learning how to not care what others think of you is one of the most common topics when it comes to online self-improvement resources. Many sites offer gentle, introspective advice (like this one), while others take a more practical, down-to-earth approach (like this one). Choose a resource that fits your needs and personality.

, Maintaining a wide range of hobbies and interests isn't just a way to keep your life varied and interesting — it's also a way to keep people guessing about you. Keeping your interests diverse helps ensure that people always have something to ask you, which can help you seem exotic and exciting. Try to indulge many different passions in your free time. For instance, on a given weekend, for Friday evening, you may play pickup basketball at the park, while on Saturday, you may study Old English literature. Finally, for Sunday, you may spend time writing on your blog.


Note, however, that doing something different every time you get some free time means it can be hard to develop skills (like, for instance, playing an instrument) that require steady, consistent practice. Because of this, you may want to devote a little time to the same long-term skills consistently even as you keep the rest of your interests varied.

, If you're looking to be hard to define, never reveal too much about yourself. Think of Bond (James Bond) — when people ask him about himself, he always lets them know just as much as they need to, but never too much. Making sure not to volunteer too much information about yourself at any one time can make you absolutely irresistible to the people you talk to. If you tease them with short, sly answers about yourself, they'll naturally want to know more, and, before they know it, they'll be hooked on your every word.

, Keeping your cool is an essential skill when it comes to being hard to define. Being mysterious, unpredictable, and guarded generally comes across well if you're pleasantly calm and collected, but not if you lose your cool. If, for instance, you become nervous, frustrated, or coldly dismissive when people ask you about yourself, you may get a reputation for being hard to get to know, but you won't be the smooth, desirable, hard to pin down type that you might have been if you had applied your moves correctly. So, try to remain relaxed and lucid whenever you're in a social situation — if you do so, you'll eventually become the (dark, quiet, and obscure) life of the party. Below are just a few techniques that may be helpful for relaxing before social situations:


Personal meditation
Getting plenty of sleep
Relaxing breathing techniques
Ensuring you have time to ""cool down"" after draining activities
Exercising
Spending time alone (e.g. reading, watching a movie, browsing the internet, etc.)

Listen to obscure music.,
Watch obscure movies.,
Read obscure literature.,
Enjoy obscure food.,
Dress in obscure fashions.,
Have obscure friends.",How to Be Obscure3," The mark of a too-cool-for-school hipster with fashionably obscure tastes is the music he listens to. Keeping your personal playlists packed with little-known bands, niche genres, and rare recordings is a must if you're looking to gain a reputation as someone with a knack for the obscure. Try to listen to bands and artists that the people you know are unfamiliar with — the smaller and less well-known the act, the better.


You don't have to download un-listenable amateur garbage to get a taste for obscure music. If you're trying to transition from mainstream music to more obscure artists, start by browsing the latest reviews at online sites associated with ""hipsterdom"", like Pitchfork.com, Avclub.com, and independent music blogs to get ahead of the curve when it comes to good obscure music.
For bonus hipster points, try to get the albums of your favorite obscure bands and artists on vinyl.

, Another way to show that you have a taste for the obscure is to develop a love for little-known cinematic gems. For instance, hosting a screening of the latest release from your favorite indie director or introducing your friends to under-appreciated cult classics can give you a reputation as a connoisseur of the obscure. Having this interest also gives you something to talk about with others, since almost everyone likes movies (think along these lines: ""Hey, you like Tarantino? You'd love Sergio Corbucci's The Great Silence).


Unfortunately, indie and arthouse films usually don't have big advertising budgets, so if you're not looking for them, they can complete their theatrical runs before you're even aware of them. Try subscribing to the email newsletter at a local arthouse theater or browsing online movie review sites with an indie focus (like, for instance, Thedissolve.com) to stay abreast of the latest in obscure cinema.
You may also want to try attending film festivals. Small indie films are often screened at festivals before they are picked up for wide distribution. Additionally, some films from particularly unknown directors only make it to the festival circuit, which means that sometimes festivals are the only place to learn about and watch certain films. Try searching an online festival directory (like this one) to find a festival near you.

, Books seldom offer the instant gratification of music or movies, but, for many, they give the sort of long-lasting impact for which there is no substitute. Reading books that few people have heard of can give you a distinguished, scholarly mystique that you simply can't get by consuming obscure books and music. If you don't currently read for pleasure (and, today, many people do not), try to get through a few good, obscure books per year. You'll develop a rewarding new habit and impress people with your eclectic tastes.


To learn about obscure books, try browsing a literature discussion site (like, for instance, Goodreads.com). At these types of sites, you'll usually find reviews, recommendations, and, often, a ""New Releases"" section (or equivalent) that can point you to the latest and greatest reads.

, Preparing food is an art form that almost everyone participates in in some form or another. By developing an appreciation for food that's out of the ordinary and eventually learning how to make this type of food, you won't just impress others with your obscure tastes — you'll also gain a skill that will make your meals much more enjoyable and allow you to entertain others. If you're not sure how to start, try looking up recipes belonging to your favorite categories of ethnic cuisine online (for instance, Italian, Japanese, Ethiopian, Middle Eastern, etc.). Eventually, try to transition to categories of food you aren't familiar with. Be adventurous! The only way to learn is to practice.


You don't have to break the bank to cook great-tasting meals. Try browsing through the recipes at a low-budget cooking site (like this one) to get ideas for delicious, nutritious recipes that make a great addition to any diet at a fraction of the cost of fancier meals.

, There's no denying it: By and large, people are shallow. Before anyone even has a chance to talk to you, they'll probably judge you by the way you appear (even if this judgement is minor or eventually discarded after they get to know you). To broadcast the fact that you have obscure tastes to everyone who may see you, try dressing with unconventional style. For instance, you may want to go for a vintage look, wearing clothing that was once the cutting edge of fashion but now gives a retro vibe. Or, you may want to go for an avant-garde look, combining patterns and styles in ways that haven't been done before. Be creative — your style is uniquely yours, so own it and enjoy challenging the conventional tastes of ordinary people.


As above, you don't have to spend lots of money to have great style. If you're looking to update your wardrobe for cheap, try shopping at your local thrift store. These types of stores often have old, out-of-fashion clothing available for a fraction of the price of new styles (though you may need to do some digging to find something wearable).

, To a certain extent, everyone is influenced by the people they hang out with. Other people can inform our opinions, give us new perspectives, and introduce us to people and things we might not otherwise have encountered. Similarly, people are often judged by the company they keep. If you're extra-serious about being seen as having obscure tastes, try to hang out with uncommon types of people. People who see you with your ""obscure"" friends will mentally associate you with them, allowing you to project the image of belonging to a delightfully idiosyncratic group of people.


The places where you're likely to meet people with obscure tastes are the same places where you can find the obscure music, films, books, and so on described above. In other words, try to frequent concerts for up-and-coming indie artists, local film festivals, independent bookstores, non-chain ethnic restaurants, and similar venues for all things ""obscure"".

Avoid the question, if necessary.",How to Be Honest Without Being Harsh," If you say something mean then follow it up by saying. “I’m just being honest” or, “I’m telling you as a friend” it’s likely you’re disguising your mean comment as honesty. Think about the intent of your comment and whether you’re just saying something to be mean.This includes biting comments such as, “I thought you’d never get rid of those jeans!” or, “I’m surprised you ate that considering your weight.”
As the old saying goes, “If you don’t have anything nice to say, don’t say anything at all.”;
, You can say almost anything without coming across harshly as long as you remove yourself emotionally from the situation. This doesn’t mean being cold or stoic while telling someone you don’t love them or that they’re doing terrible work. It means not letting your emotions drive your interaction so that you behave in a mean, angry, or spiteful way.For example, if you have a friend who is always late, don’t lash out at them if they are late, yet again. Instead, say, “I woke up early to be ready and meet with you, yet stood here waiting for you for 20 minutes. Please consider my time when we agree to meet.”
If you need to talk to the person but know that you’re not calm, take some time to neutralize. Give it an hour, a day, or a couple days depending on what you need. Say, “I’m upset now, but I’d like to speak with you about this later so we can better understand each other.”

, Don't tell the person something potentially hurtful or embarrassing in front of other people; speaking to them alone as the best option. If you need to have an honest talk, aim for the right conditions. Choose a place that’s quiet and away from other people and prying ears. Pick a time when you can both talk, not when either of you has to rush off to something else.


Face-to-face is best; it helps both people read each other’s body language and respond to nonverbal cues.

, Don’t become bossy or demanding in your speech. Maybe you don’t like something someone else does and you want them to stop. Instead of demanding that they change or do something different, make a request instead. Asking instead of telling shows that you’re considering the person’s feelings and not demanding anything of them.


For example, if someone goes on and on about a subject you’re not interested in, ask them nicely to talk about something else. Say, “I hear what you’re saying. Let’s move onto something else” or, “I understand your opinion and don’t want to talk about this further.”

, While the truth might set you free, it might also hurt someone else’s feelings. If you feel like an honest moment is needed, make sure that the honesty is truly helpful. There are times when you need to be honest with someone and the truth might hurt. However, do your best to make it constructive and not destructive.


Find ways to speak kindly to people and offer to help them. For example, say, “I’ve noticed you’ve lagged on some deadlines. Is there anything I can do to help you to get these tasks done on time?”Ask yourself, “Might this hurt the person’s feelings?” or, “Can I say this in a kinder, more constructive way?”

, Perhaps you have strong convictions you wish others would see as truth. You might be entirely correct or on higher moral grounds in your ways, but you cannot force an issue onto someone else. If they make it clear they don’t want to discuss it, drop the conversation.


For example, you might have strong religious values or moral beliefs. If you’re trying to convert someone to your truth, honor their choice to not engage in the discussion, even if you know your words to be true.
Often, forceful discussions turn people off instead of allowing them to appreciate your perspective.

, Don’t make the exchange all about you. Listen to the other person and consider their feelings. If they sound uncomfortable or shocked, tailor your words to be softer or more gentle. Be aware of their communication and how your words are being interpreted.


Don’t just listen to their words, be attentive to their body language, too. If they are avoiding eye contact, crossing their body, or looking like they want to leave the conversation as soon as possible, consider changing your tone.

, Be conscious about how the other person feels (or might feel) while you speak to them. However the person acts or responds is valid. If they are offended or upset, understand that it’s okay for them to react, even if you don’t like it. Let them know you understand and are sensitive to their feelings.Forget saying “should” as in, “You should try this” or, “You should do this instead.” This invalidates the other person and makes it sound like you’re the expert.
For example, say, “I can see you’re upset by me saying this, and that’s understandable. I want to bring something to your attention, but I also don’t want to hurt you.”

, Maybe you tend to be critical in your approach to life. While this can be a useful skill, it’s often less useful when dealing with people. Don’t focus solely on what you dislike about a person or what they do wrong. Balance your negative thinking with some positive things they do or say. When talking to them about something you don’t like, bring up some things you do like.For example, to a flaky friend you can say, “You are such a great friend and I really love hanging out with you, and yet, I also get really frustrated when you cancel last minute.”

, Speaking truth doesn’t mean you have free reign to share your judgments with the person. Perhaps you’re unhappy with the decisions they make. Refuse to tell them what they are doing wrong and instead, focus on your concern. Be discerning in what you address and how you address it.For example, if you have a friend doing drugs, don’t say, “Drugs are bad for you, I can’t believe you’re doing them.” Instead, say, “I’m concerned about you since you’ve started using drugs. I’ve noticed changes in your behavior and I’m concerned things may not be going well for you.”

, You might be working with someone and be late on a deadline. Instead of blaming someone, find ways to work together instead of trying to find someone to blame. Maybe someone did drop the ball, but if you’re working together, that means finding solutions together.If you find yourself saying, “Well, someone had to say it” as a way to express anger toward someone, you’re likely using your honesty as a way to blame others.

, There’s a difference in tone of voice when you’re yelling at someone or talking to someone casually. Aim to use a casual tone or professional tone when talking to someone. Harshness can come out through tone, so avoid responding too quickly, using sharp words or speech, or speaking loudly.


For example, speak softer to avoid sounding aggressive.

, Maybe a friend has a bad habit that drives you nuts. Don’t lose your cool over it. Instead, add some humor to approach the topic gently. This allows you to say what you need to say but also not make a big deal over it.Humor can also help to diffuse tense or difficult situations.


Make a small joke or say something silly to get your point across.

, Maybe someone asks you a question that makes you uncomfortable in giving an honest response. For example, they might ask, “Do you like my boyfriend?” or, “What do you think of these pants?” While you might want to answer honestly, your response may also hurt the person’s feelings. Aim to be general or respond to something regarding the topic they bring up. This allows you to be honest yet still kind and inoffensive.


For example, if someone asks if you like their terrible food, say, “This is a unique flavor unlike anything I’ve ever tasted before!” or, “My favorite part of the meal is the potatoes.”

, Do you want your club name to describe what your club is all about? Or do you have a secret club that needs a name that will keep other people from knowing what the club's all about? For an open club, you need a name that anyone can understand. For a closed club, come up with an inside joke or a code name.

, Get together and make a list of ideas. You'll be surprised at what you'll come up with in a group that you couldn't have come up with on your own.


Think of something that all of your club members have in common. If you all like the same music, then you can add something about your favorite band to your club name.
Break out your thesaurus. If you can say something ordinary in an extraordinary way, then your club name will really stand out from the crowd.
Choose a name from a book, television program or online game. Sometimes, it's okay to borrow from something that's already been created.

If you decide to have a general history club you can invite members to share what interests them.
You can focus on a certain time period in history, like the Middle Ages or the 19th century.
You can focus your history club on a certain place in the world, like North America or Asia. If you go this route, you can decide to focus on a certain time period in that continent or country as well.;
, If you are starting a history club at your high school or your university, you may need to register your club with your school.


This helps the school to keep track of the different clubs that students can participate in.Becoming a registered student organization with your school may also mean that the school will give you money for your club.
Your school may have certain regulations or rules that registered clubs must follow. Ask about any potential rules that you may need to follow while you're registering with the school. A faculty advisor can help you to navigate these rules as well., Many schools will require you to have a faculty member or parent agree to sponsor your club.


A history club advisor can help you organize your club and help with logistics.
Ask a history teacher or history professor to sponsor your club. You can also ask any other faculty member that you know is interested in history and is willing to help you.

, Choose a name for your club that is easy to remember, catchy, and relates to history.


Sometimes simple is best, you can name your club “Your School Name History Club”
Keep your club name short or use an acronym if you want to have a longer name.
Brainstorm different names. You can let new members vote on the official club name at your first meeting if you aren’t ready to pick a name.

, You can form a chapter of a national organization at your school as well.


National organizations like the National History Club and the National History Bee & Bowl accept new chapters.If your school does not have these, your history club could become a new chapter.If you decide to join a national organization as a new chapter, you will need to follow that organization's rules and regulations.

, You will need to decide how frequently you want your club to meet before you plan your first meeting.


Clubs that meet weekly or bi-weekly will keep your members engaged in club activities.
You should try to meet more than once a month if possible.

, Along with deciding the frequency of your meetings, you will need to decide what time and day you will meet at.


Try to find a time that is convenient for the most people. Not everyone will be able to make every club meeting but you should try to accommodate the majority of participants.
Directly after school ends is a good time if you are in high school.
If you are in college, in the late afternoon or early evening when most classes are done may be the best time.
You may need to adjust your club meeting times if you find that it is not convenient for your members.

, You will need to find a space to hold your club meeting. Try to keep the location the same each time so your members won’t become confused.


Ask your school if you are able to reserve classrooms or common rooms after school.
Reserve your room a few weeks in advance to make sure that you have a space to meet.
Try to meet in a central location that is accessible for your members.

, A club constitution is essentially a list of the basic rules that your club will follow.


The more formal your club is, the more formal your list of rules will be.
The list of rules will structure how your club will run. A constitution can establish the types of officers your club will have, who can be elected to an officer position, when and where you meet, and general meeting requirements.If you decide to have an informal club, you may not need a constitution.

, Invite people that you think would be interested in participating in your history club.


Ask history professors or teachers if you can come into their class and invite their students to your club meeting.
If your school has a radio station or television station, ask the manager if you can come on their program and invite members.
Invite your friends to join and ask them to each invite a few people you may not know to come with them.
Use social media to spread the word about the new club that you've formed and to invite friends to join.

, During your first meeting, you should introduce the club and explain why you wanted to start a history club.


Ask people at the meeting why they are interested in history. See if there are any similarities in what people are interested in. For example, if a lot of people are interested in World War II, you can plan a World War II themed activity.
Decide on a club name if you have not already done so.
If you have made a constitution or list of club rules, let the people at the first meeting read and vote to approve the list.

, Use the schedule that you designed to begin meeting on a regular basis.


In the next few meetings, ask club members to nominate potential officers for the club. Officer positions could be President, Vice President, Historian, Secretary, Representative, or any others you think are relevant. Holding club elections for officer positions can encourage people to become more active in the club., Having an Internet presence is a great way to keep your members informed and to attract new members.

They may have a budget for clubs at the school that you can receive funds from.
Collect dues. You can raise money for your club through dues, where your members pay a certain amount of money each year or semester to participate in the club. Try to keep club dues low though because high dues discourage people from joining.
Hold a fundraiser by selling t-shirts, having a bake sale, or bringing in a speaker that audiences pay to see., You will have to decide what you’ll want to do during your meetings and how the club spends its time.


Ask members to give short presentations about a topic in history that they’re interested in and have a discussion about that topic.Watch a documentary or movie from the time period you’re interested in.
Travel to a local historical site nearby. This site could be a battlefield, a historical landmark, or a place that has historical significance for your town.

Create a secret or a secret mission.,
Read a few clique-like books, like the clique series by Lisi Harrison, for some background information, although, maybe not so mean like they were.,
Think of a name.,
Conduct a proper initiation for you and your closest friend.,
Figure out what your society does.,
Find potential members.,
Induct your members.,
An important thing in secret societies is to meet in secret, that means meeting in a new place every time or having access to a secret room somewhere.,
Make a dress code.,
Keep quiet and have fun.,
Initiate well to do people in the society.,
At first, be friendly, but do not reveal the central secrets of your society.,
There needs to be a way to get rid of someone if they become bad for the group or start talking—like blabbing the society's secret.",How to Create a Secret Society," A secret society must have something to protect.

, Get any number of your friends to read these books. Privately talk with one of your closest friends whom you know will love the idea of starting a secret society.

, You and your closest friend should discuss what your secret society should be called. Also discuss who you will induct. Remember, even if you have a large group of really good friends, not all of them are secret society material. They won't find out, as it is a secret society.

, This should be done before you initiate others. That way, you are sure to come up with a good idea. The initiation is one of the most important parts of the society. It has to be something neither of you would do normally. Candle-lighting sets a serious and official tone, which is always good. Secret names are fun to have.

, There has to be rules. Set a schedule for fun things you can do, i.e. dressing alike on certain days, or having monthly rituals. Have fun with it. It's all about your creativity. Newsletters are common. It might be fun to post mysterious messages in some part of your school. Everyone sees it, but very few know what it means.

, Subtly drop something related to your secret in a conversation with a friend to figure out how they feel about it. Make sure there's no possibility they ever betray you, make sure they will be okay with the rules. Don't mention your secret society until you are absolutely sure they can be completely trusted. If they betray you, your secret society is not so secret anymore!

, Invite your friends to a sleepover and then spring it on them. They will be surprised and excited, and thrilled because they are special.

, You could even figure out a time to chat online.

, Most small secret societies use robes while large ones, like the Freemasons, have complex aprons.

, Your friends and you will be even closer than ever.

, In a school, initiate the most brilliant and enthusiastic students that seem like clique-material, and they will motivate and inspire others. But you don't want to have too many members. The more members, the less secret it is. Five to ten should be good.

, After time passes, slowly begin to unravel secrets to new inductees. After all, you don't want to tell them the secret immediately, because what if they blab it to others? You don't want that.

, If they do, pretend like that was never the secret, but immediately create a new secret. Put this in the rules.

Figure out why you lie and who you lie to.,
Anticipate behaviors that will make you feel guilty.,
Stop comparing yourself to others.,
Accept the consequence and decide to face them.,
Do things that make you feel pride.,
Avoid situations in which you'll have to lie for others.,
Distinguish between what the person you are conversing with needs to know and what you want to say.,
Always exercise tact.",How to Be Honest1," We've all lied at one time or another, to different people, to ourselves, and for different reasons. But coming up with a systematic plan for becoming more honest will be difficult unless you try to define those reasons and those people for yourself.



Lies to make ourselves look better might include exaggerations, embellishments, and flat-out tall-tales we tell to others, and ourselves, to make ourselves feel better about our inadequacies. When you're unhappy about something, it's much easier to fill it in with lies than tell the truth.

We lie to peers we think are better than us, because we want them to respect us as we respect them. Unfortunately, being dishonest is disrespectful in the long run. Give people more credit for their ability to empathize and understand you on a deeper level.

Lies that avoid embarrassment might include lies told to cover up bad behaviors, transgressions, or any activity we're not proud of. If your mom found a pack of cigarettes in your jacket, you might lie and say that they're your friend's to avoid punishment.

We lie to authoritative figures to avoid embarrassment and punishment, including ourselves. When we've done something we feel guilty about, lies are told to eliminate the guilt, avoid the punishments, and get back to the objectionable behavior we're forced to lie about. It's a vicious cycle.;
, To break the chain of embarrassment and lying, it's important to learn to anticipate things that you'll likely feel guilty about in the future, and avoid those behaviors. When you lie, you're covering up some uncomfortable truth that's more easily couched in a lie. You can either get comfortable with the truth, or abandon the behavior that makes you embarrassed.


If you smoke cigarettes, you won't have to lie if everyone knows it's true. Own up to it. If a behavior is un-own-upable, it's probably best to avoid it. It would be humiliating for your partner to find out that you had an inappropriate relationship with a coworker, but you won't have to lie if you don't do it.

, Sometimes we lie to make ourselves seem bigger and better than we really are. Because we're constantly competing and comparing ourselves to others, any inadequacies can be most-easily overcome with a quick and creative lie. If you stop feeling competitive with others and give yourself the value you deserve, you won't feel the need to lie to bring yourself up, because you're already up!


Forget what you think other people want to hear from you. Give other people the benefit of the doubt, and assume that they're not running ""game"" on you, or being manipulative. Speak from your heart and tell the truth, without even the slightest bit of concern about whether or not it will make you look ""bad."" People respect honesty, even when the truth is uncomfortable.
Let your honesty impress people, not your exaggeration. Lots of dishonesty results from attempts to impress our peers with elaborate tales that will one-up everyone else at the table. If you're unable to contribute to the round of anecdotes about European travel, just listen quietly and wait until the subject changes, instead of making up a ruse about your study-abroad in Majorca.

, Sometimes, it's better to own up to lies, to deceits, and to prior behaviors that you're embarrassed about, rather than continue weaving an elaborate web of lies. It can be liberating and extremely healthy to come clean. Even if there will be some consequences at the end of the admission, it'll be the honest consequences that you deserve.

, You don't have to lie if you feel good about yourself! Surround yourself with caring, understanding people who will respect you for who you are. Do things that give you pleasure and that make you feel proud of yourself.


Getting super-drunk every night might make you feel good for a couple hours, giving you pleasure, but the ice-pick in your brain the next morning at work will have you feeling embarrassed and guilty when you can't make it into work. Take care of yourself, mentally and physically. Don't do things you're embarrassed to do.

, Be wary when someone tells you something in confidence that you know that you should share with someone else (e.g., knowledge of a crime, a lie, or a harmful act against another). Hearing such information puts you in a difficult position, especially when the truth eventually emerges and reveals to the affected person that you knew all along.


If someone begins a sentence with ""Don't tell so-and-so about this, okay?"" be prepared to offer your own disclaimer: ""If it's something that I'd want to know about were I them, then please don't tell me. I don't want to be responsible for anyone's secrets but my own.""

, Sometimes, we feel a burning urge in our guts to make ourselves be heard. Telling off a rude roommate, confronting your spouse, or arguing with a teacher can all seem like moments that require our complete and uncorked honesty, but pulling out the stopper can be a quick way to sour relationships and say things you don't actually mean. To avoid over-sharing, try to figure out the difference between things that you need to say because another person needs to hear it, and things that you want to say to make yourself feel better.



Someone else needs to know if they're missing something that will cause them physical or emotional harm, or if they're doing something that's affecting other people in the same way. Your roommate might need to know that their excessive drinking is making you uncomfortable in your own house, but not that you think a new date is ""trashy.""

You might want to say something in a fit of anger or high emotion that, upon reflection, you might be able to couch in a more friendly way. In the middle of an argument about a lackluster relationship, you may want to say, ""You're gaining weight and now I'm not attracted to you,"" and this might be important for your spouse to hear in some ways, though not in others. However, ""I think we could be healthier"" puts the same sentiment in the language of something your spouse needs to know, in a much more polite way.

, Everyone likes a straight-shooter, but sometimes a straight-shooter's aim can be off by a couple inches. Consider the effect of your words and learn to rephrase possibly-offensive or uncomfortable language. Learn to volunteer appropriate opinions


Use ""I"" statements when sharing uncomfortable truths. When you're sharing your opinions and truths with others, try to keep your honesty tamed. Focus on talking about your feelings, and your opinions, to stay respectful of others.
Try to add the phrase ""In my experience..."" or ""Personally, I've observed that..."" at the beginning, or end it with ""...but that's just my observation/experience, that might not be how things are everywhere"".
Learn to listen quietly while others are speaking, even if you disagree with what they're saying, or feel the need to dissent. When you take a turn to speak, they'll offer you the same courtesy, making the exchange both more honest and more comfortable.

Give yourself an objective appraisal.,
Confront the things about yourself that you dislike.,
Create opportunities for yourself to improve.,
When you decide to act, carry through with that action.",How to Be Honest2," It's important to look in the proverbial mirror every now and then and take stock of how you feel. What do you like about yourself? What do you need to work on? It's possible to build up elaborate psychological barriers that force us into dishonest behaviors, opinions, and activities that could be avoided by giving ourselves an objective appraisal. Write down a list of your strengths and weaknesses in a notebook, not to take stock of your self-worth, but to find things to improve and to celebrate your achievements.


Identify your strengths. What are you good at? What do you do better than most people you know? What do you contribute to daily life? What are proud of? In what ways are you better than you once were?
Identify your weaknesses. What embarrasses you about yourself? What could you do better? Have you gotten worse at something specific, over the years?

, A big source of dishonesty in our lives comes from an unwillingness to confront the things about ourselves that we're ashamed of, embarrassed about, or just plain disgusted by. Without dwelling on them, try to define them honestly.


Maybe you always hoped to have published that debut novel by the time you turned 30, a goal that's no closer now than it was 5 years ago. Maybe you know you need to get in shape, but find it easier to keep up the same old routine. Maybe your relationship is stale and you're unhappy in it, but can't bring yourself to make any considerable changes.
As much as you can, try to eliminate excuses from your mind. It doesn't matter why this particularly uncomfortable truth about you is so, because you can't go back into the past to change it. You can, however, change your behavior now and start making yourself happier.

, From your list of strengths and weaknesses, try to identify specific areas for improvement, and specific ways that you might improve yourself.


What was necessary for your strengths to become strengths? What did you do that you're especially proud of? In what way could that truth inform your desire to improve some of your weaknesses?
What threatens your ability to improve yourself? Are these threats external, like a lack of funds necessary to buy a gym membership and lose a few pounds, or internal, like a lack of desire to research DIY weight-loss options?

, Lying to yourself is easy. It's easy to come up with a couple hundred reasons not to do something you don't want to do. That's why we let it happen so often! Make it hard on yourself. When you decide to end a relationship, or start working, start doing it. Make it happen. Now. Don't wait until you come up with a litany of reasons that it's ""not the right time."" When you make a decision, set it in motion.


Make it easy on yourself to be successful in accomplishing your improvements. Set up a risk-and-reward exchange when you accomplish a daunting task, like buying yourself that new guitar after ending your ugly relationship, or treating yourself to a vacation after losing a couple pounds.
Accomplish your tasks with digital aid: you can sign up with Skinny-Text to receive exercise reminders on your phone, or even consider using Pact, which will charge you a specific amount of money if you choose not to exercise.

Don't add color to your stories.,
Get creative with ""white lies."",
Stay silent if you need to.",How to Be Honest3," One all-too-tempting and common little lie is in filling in extra details to make a story more entertaining. It can be tempting to make it a bear that wandered into your campsite, rather than a raccoon, but you might be setting a precedent that opens up reasons and opportunities for more lies. Let the truth be the truth and be as honest as possible.

, We've all been there, when someone asked something dreaded, like: ""Do I look fat in this?"" or ""Is Santa Claus real?"" Sometimes, we feel we must lie to make someone else feel better, or to lessen the blow or some uncomfortable truth, but the choice between being honest and lying isn't always a choice between A and B.



Emphasize the positive. Shift the focus away from what, in all honesty, you think is negative. Instead of saying ""No, I don't think you look good in those pants"" say ""They're not as flattering as the black dress—that dress really looks amazing on you. Have you tried it on with those stockings you wore to my cousin's wedding last year?""

Keep some opinions to yourself. It might be true that you're not crazy about the cowboy-themed restaurant and bar that your best friend wants to visit on her only night in town, but it's not necessarily ""honest"" to share that opinion. What you want is to serve the greater good of the evening–you've only got one night together!–to keep fun moving forward. Instead of saying, ""I don't like this place. Let's go somewhere else,"" say ""Although it's not my favorite place, I want to do what you want to do. Let's make it awesome.""
Deflect the question. If your child wants to know if Santa Claus is real, tell them you're not sure, and engage them. Ask them what seems to be true for them: ""What do you think? What do kids say at school?"" You don't have to decide between a flat-out lie and the total truth. The real world is more complicated than that.

, If you're in a tense situation, in which getting honest would disrupt everyone's mood and happiness, it's not necessarily dishonest to remain silent. If you've got the option of staying out of it, stay out of it. It takes courage to stay silent in an awkward situation sometimes.


Choose the high road. In a disagreement, more opinions don't make the issue easier to untangle, necessarily. You don't have to tell a white lie to get an argument to end, nor do you need to continue dropping truth-bombs. Stay out of petty disagreements entirely, rather than reigniting the flame."

Maintain your GPA.,
National Honors Society members are always looking for ways to earn their 25 hours of community service that they must fulfill each year in the organization, so ask them for help in these subjects.,
Do well on standardized tests.,
Be a leader.,
Volunteer.,
Stay out of trouble.,
Find a local chapter.,
Review the criteria for your local chapter.,
Find a teacher to nominate you for NHS.,
Obtain candidate status.,
Work hard on your application.,
Maintain membership.",How to Be Accepted Into the National Honor Society," Your cumulative GPA is one of the criteria used to see if you make National Honor Society standards. If you want to be in NHS, work on maintaining a high GPA.


Members of National Honor Society must have a GPA of 3.5 or higher on the 4.0 scale. On a 5.0 scale, this would be at least a 4.375 and 5.25 on a 6.0 scale. On a letter grade scale, this would be at least a B+ and 90% or higher grade average on a 100 point scale.Start working on your grades early in high school. If you start off with a low GPA you'll have to work extra hard to pull it up in the following semesters. Take your studies and homework seriously.
If you're struggling with a particular subject, consider hiring a tutor or asking a friend in class to help you out. Most people do not excel equally well in all subjects. You might be an excellent chemistry student but struggle remembering dates for history class, for example.;
,


Practice good study skills. Flashcards, memorization, and practice tests and quizzes are all great means to prepare for an exam. If your teacher offers any optional after school review sessions, always attend even if you feel confident about your skill set.

, The NHS also has criteria when it comes to standardized testing. In order to be accepted into NHS, you need 1750 or higher on the SAT, a 200 or higher on the PSAT, and a 26 or higher on the ACT.Most bookstores, as well as Amazon, sell up to date study guides for most standardized tests. Many colleges and organizations like Kaplan offer prep courses, which can be taken in person or online. If you're serious about NHS membership, consider asking your parents if you can enroll in one of these courses.
Remember, you can retake most standardized tests if you do not like your score the first time.

, National Honor Society values leadership. The organization seeks out student leaders who convey good problem solving skills and contribute ideas to the world around them. If you want to be an NHS member, you need some leadership experience on your resume.Get involved in your school. Join a club that speaks to your passions and go for a leadership role. You might not be able to be say, president, right away but you can always take a smaller position as a board member or treasurer. Consider running for student council. Being a representative for your class would look great on an NHS membership application.You can also get involved outside of school. If you play sports, being the captain of your hockey or soccer team can convey leadership skills. Consider volunteering to couch little league, taking on the role of coach to kids younger than yourself. If you're involved in any other type of community, you can try to be a leader there as well. Say you take art lessons at the community art center. See if they need volunteers to tutor younger students.

, NHS seeks out students who have a dedication to serving their community. If you want to be in NHS, volunteer for a cause you care about and stick to your service longterm.


There are many ways to volunteer. You should pick a cause you feel passionate about as you'll be more motivated to stick your service out. Love animals? Work for your local Humane Society. Interested in politics? Try doing campaign work for a cause you support. Big reader? Ask your local library if they need assistance.
If you're struggling to find volunteer opportunities, go to a local community center, church, hospital, or coffee shop. People often leave flyers in these kinds of establishments trying to recruit volunteers. You can also ask the school counselor or principal of your school. He or she might be in contact with a variety of local organizations seeking out student workers.

, Character is another category NHS pays attention to regarding candidates. A student with high character adheres to high standards of honesty, is courteous to others, and has a clean disciplinary record. Avoid people and situations where you might get in trouble. Things like recreational drug use and underage drinking look bad on an NHS application., If you want to join National Honor Society, you must be enrolled in a school with an active NHS chapter. You can use the National Honor Society website to find information about your school's chapter of NHS.


Students cannot apply to enter the NHS at the national level, via the organization's website or any other means. All admissions to the NHS are handled at the local level - you must apply to your high school's NHS chapter and no other. That's why it's important to get information about your chapter before attempting the application process.If your school doesn't have an NHS chapter, all is not lost. Try asking your principal, academic adviser, or teacher to establish an NHS chapter at your school. Though students and parents aren't allowed to apply to establish chapters, they are encouraged to share information with receptive school faculty members., Criteria for admissions varies from chapter to chapter. Some schools require an application and resume. Some schools merely require an essay detailing why you feel qualified to join NHS. Figure out what the specific qualifications are at your school and go from there.

, You cannot simply apply to NHS cold. A faculty member at your school must nominate you. Then, the educator associated with your school's chapter of NHS will make a decision regarding your application.


Sometimes, a teacher will simply nominate you without your asking. However, if this does not happen and you feel qualified consider approaching a teacher and asking. Pick a teacher whose class you feel you've done well in and who is impressed by your work and dedication.Your teacher will have to print out and submit a student nomination form. You can find this form for your teacher on the NHS website., Once your teacher submits your student application form, the person heading the NHS chapter at your school will make a decision. He or she will decide whether or not you meet NHS criteria and are eligible to apply.


Remember that individual chapters differ in their precise rules. Some require you to complete an application to even be considered for membership,while others don't require you to apply until after you've been singled out as eligible. When in doubt, always consult your local chapter for precise instructions.

, NHS applications vary from school to school. Whatever your school requires, spend a lot of time on your application. A solid application can increase your chances of being accepted into NHS.


Include all the experience you have related to NHS's core values: scholarship, leadership, service, and character. Include things like work on school clubs, experience with sports, volunteer work, after school jobs, and any awards or achievements.
Many chapters of NHS require an essay as part of the membership application. The essay might be a broad overview of your qualifications or it might ask a specific question, like ""If you had to have dinner with anyone living or dead who would you pick?"" Spend a lot of time on your essay. Write a couple of drafts and have a friend or family member look it over for you.
If you are not granted membership, you have the right to appeal the council's decision. However, appeals must be made to the local chapter itself - state and national NHS agencies do not hear membership appeals. Do not be discouraged. Continue your service activities and leadership activities and maintain your good GPA. You can always apply again next year.

, Once you're accepted to NHS, you will have to maintain your member status. This means keeping your grades up, continuing to score high on standardized tests, continuing your community involvement, and maintaining a clean disciplinary record. Continue to work hard, even after acceptance, as it is possible to be dismissed from NHS.

, You will be asked to fill a variety of meeting roles such as timer or evaluator and to make speeches during the meetings. Most clubs formally induct their members in a short ceremony. You will also have to pay a new member fee and semi-annual dues.

, The president will discuss with you which officer positions suit your experience and expertise. Available officer positions are: president, vice president education, vice president membership, vice president public relations, sergeant at arms, secretary and treasurer.

, A smaller club will be forced to rely on volunteers or even require that members fill certain positions in rotation.

, Each officer is provided with a manual that outlines his or her responsibilities, while the semi-annual training provides tips from Toastmasters with experience in the role.

Even if you are 'the best' in the world at doing one thing, there are always other things that you cannot do, and may never be able to do.
Recognizing your limitations does not mean abandoning your dreams, and it does not mean giving up on learning new things or improving your existing abilities. It simply means acknowledging that, as human beings, none of us are perfect and none of us can do everything by ourselves.;
, We judge others because it's a lot easier than looking at ourselves. Unfortunately, it's also completely unproductive and, in many cases, harmful. Judging others causes strife in relationships, and it prevents new relationships from forming. Perhaps even worse, it prevents us from trying to improve ourselves. Everybody makes mistakes.


We make judgments about others all the time, usually without even realizing it. As a practical exercise, try to catch yourself in the act of judging another person or group of people, and whenever you do, judge yourself instead. Consider how you can improve yourself, instead of how you think others should act. After all, you cannot control other people's decisions and behaviors - but you can control yours.
Work to address your flaws. Remember that growth and improvement is a lifelong process that never stops happening, even when you're very skilled at something.

, Suppose you graduate from an Ivy League university at the top of your class. You definitely deserve a lot of credit for the many hours of studying and for your perseverance. Consider though, that there is someone just as intelligent and hardworking as you who had less supportive parents, grew up in a different place, or just made one wrong choice in life. You could be in their position instead.


Always remember that with a bad choice yesterday, your whole life could be different today and, furthermore, that today could be the day your good choices change your life.
Though you have undoubtedly worked hard for what you have, you could not have done it all without other people's support. Everything we do is a result of what many other people have done to us. It is all because of the people around us that we get shaped and become better persons at some point so that we could achieve our goals.

, Part of being humble is understanding that you will make mistakes. Understand this, and understand that everyone else makes mistakes, and you will have a heavy burden lifted off of you. However, this doesn't mean that you should be sloppy - try to avoid obvious mistakes, but don't be afraid to try new methods or ways of accomplishing your goals.


Each person can only experience a tiny sliver of life at a time. There will always be people who are older and wiser than you. Your elders' opinions could be worth listening to, although you must make the decision based on your knowledge of them.

, Although you may fear that people will be angry and frustrated with you, it is always better to admit than to cover it up. Whether you've made a mistake as a boss, parent, or friend, people will appreciate the fact that you're willing to admit that you're not perfect and that you're working to improve yourself and the situation. Admitting your mistakes shows that you're not stubborn, selfish, or unwilling to not look perfect.


Admitting your mistakes will make people respect you more, whether they are your own children or your coworkers.

, It's okay to have a healthy self-esteem and to feel proud of your accomplishments, but nobody likes it when someone constantly tries to bring attention to themselves and their own achievements. If you feel like you really have done something great, chances are people will have already begun to notice that, and they will come to respect you even more for your humility.


This doesn't mean you should lie about achieving something; if someone asked if you ran a marathon then it's perfectly acceptable to say 'yes'. But don't constantly talk about how absolutely amazing you were for running the marathon, or achieving other goals.

, Humble people don't have to be meek wallflowers - being humble doesn't mean not having any self-esteem. However, a humble person should be mindful of everyone in the conversation and shouldn't talk down or disrupt anyone. As a humble person, you should recognize that everyone, including you, has their own goals and dreams and they may want to talk about their achievements and their opinions on things.

, We are human beings and who we are now has a lot to do with other people's influence and guidance. Countless people have given you support and helped you to become the person you are so that you can achieve your dreams. It's totally fine to be proud about your achievements, but keep in mind that nobody ever does anything totally by themselves, and that as people, we are all helping each other to accomplish our goals.


Share the love. Recognize others who have helped you on your path to success.

, Challenge yourself to look at others and appreciate the things they can do and, more generally, to appreciate people for who they are. Understand that everybody is different and relish the chance you have to experience different people. You will still have your personal tastes, your likes and dislikes, but train yourself to separate your opinions from your fears and you will appreciate others more - you will be more humble as well.


Being able to appreciate the talents and qualities of other people can also make you recognize qualities that you want to improve or attain within yourself.

, While competition can be healthy and stimulating, it's nearly impossible to be humble when we're constantly striving to be the ""best"" or trying to be better than others. Instead, try looking at yourself more. Remember, the ultimate goal isn't to be better than anyone else, it's to be better than the person you used to be. When you focus your energy on improving yourself instead of comparing you to everyone else, you'll find that it is much easier to make yourself better since you don't have to worry about whether or not you're better or worse than anyone.


Every individual is unique. Appreciate people for who they are as human beings, not for their skills and appearance in relation to yours.

, Although it is ultimately up to you to decide if you were right or wrong, it is a whole different thing to acknowledge that you make mistakes and that you're not always right. Somewhat more difficult however, is the ability to acknowledge that in many cases other people — even people who disagree with you — may be right. Deferring to your spouse's wishes, to a law you don't agree with, or even, sometimes, to your child's opinion takes your recognition of your limitations to a different level.


Instead of simply saying you are humble and as a person you will make mistakes, you should also concentrate on living with that mindset - being humble is a way of life, not a one-time action.

, This is another way of appreciating others. Contemplate moral texts and proverbs about humility. Pray for it, meditate on it, do whatever it takes to get your attention off yourself and your perception of your own worth (especially compared to others). You can read inspiring biographies, memoirs, the Bible, nonfiction and fiction on how to improve your life, or whatever it is that makes you be more humble and appreciate the insight that others have to offer.


If you're not into spirituality, consider the scientific method. Science requires humility. It requires that you let go of your preconceived notions and judgments and understand that you don't know as much as you think you do.

, Nobody is perfect or the best at anything. There will always be people who are better at you at something, and therein lies the opportunity to learn from them. Find people you aspire to be like in certain areas, and ask them to mentor you. Under mentorship; good boundary setting, confidentiality and discernment is required. As soon as you cross the line of being 'unteachable', bring yourself back down to earth again. Being teachable means that you admit that you always have more to learn about life.


You can be more humble by taking classes in something you know nothing about, such as pottery or screen writing, and knowing that you will let others teach you and show you the way. This can help you realize that everyone is good at different things and we all need to help each other in order to become better people.

, A big part of being humble is respecting others, and part of respecting others is helping them. Treat other people as equals and help them because it is the right thing to do. It's been said that when you can help others who cannot possibly help you in return, you have learned humility. Helping people in need will also make you appreciate what you have even more.


It goes without saying: don't boast about the volunteering you've done. It's great if you're proud of your work, but remember: volunteering is not about you, it is about the people you have helped.

, If you're always rushing to get things done first and get to the front of the line, challenge yourself to allow others to go before you - for example, elders, disabled people, children, or people in a hurry.


Ask yourself, ""Do I really need to do this first so badly?"" The answer will almost always be no.

, Give someone you love, or even someone you barely know, a compliment. Tell your partner that he/she looks great today; compliment your co-worker's new hairdo, or tell the cashier at the grocery store that you like her earrings. Or you can go deeper, and compliment important aspects of people's personalities. Give at least one compliment a day and you will see that other people have so much to offer to the world.


Focus on the positive attributes of others instead of always looking for their flaws.

, If you've made a mistake, then confess and admit that you're wrong. Even though saying you're sorry to someone else is painful, you'll have to get over your pride and tell another person that you're sorry for the harm you've done. Eventually the pain will subside, replaced by a feeling of relief because you know that you have made amends. This will show the person that you value him or her greatly and that you acknowledge that you've made a mistake.


Make eye contact when you apologize to show that you really care.
Don't be a repeat offender. Apologizing about something does not give you a license to do it again. Doing so will make people distrusting of you and what you say.

, This is another great way of appreciating others more and being more humble. The next time you engage in a conversation, let the other person talk, don't interrupt, and ask questions to keep the person talking and sharing. Though you should contribute to the conversation, make a habit of letting others express themselves more than you do so you don't act like you're only concerned with the things that are going on in your life.


Ask questions to show that you understand what the person is talking about. Don't just wait for the person to stop talking so that you can start talking. Remember, if you're busy thinking about what you want to say, then you'll have a harder time focusing on what they are saying.

, Because we as individuals know very little about the world, you'd expect that we'd be awestruck more often than we typically are. Children have this sense of wonder, and it inspires the curiosity that makes them such keen observers and capable learners. Do you really know how your microwave works? Could you build one on your own? What about your car? Understand your brain? A rose?


The jaded, ""I've seen it all"" attitude makes us feel far more important than we are. Nobody has seen it all - nobody knows it all. Be amazed like a child and you will not only be humbled; you will also be readier to learn.

, Gentleness of spirit is the sure path to humility. Use 'Aikido' where possible when faced with conflict: absorb the venom from others' attacks and turn it into something positive by trying to understand why they are angry and reacting with gentleness and respect. Practicing gentleness will help you rediscover your sense of wonder as you focus on the positive aspects of life.

, Go take a walk in the park. Stand near the bottom of a waterfall. Look at the world from the top of a mountain. Go for a long hike. Swim in an ocean. Find your own way of being in nature and take the time to truly appreciate all that it entails. Close your eyes and feel the breeze on your face. You should feel completely humbled by nature - a force that is so immense in its depth and power. As you develop your wonder and respect for all of the things that were there long before you were and which will be there long after you are gone, you will began to realize just how small you are in this world.


Spending more time in nature will make you see how big and complicated the world is -- and that you're not at the center of it.

, Yoga is the practice of love and gratitude, and it will make you develop your sense of wonder about your breath, your body, and the love and kindness in the world around you. Yoga makes you see how fleeting your time on earth is and to appreciate it even more. Make a habit of practicing yoga at least twice a week and reap all of the emotional benefits as well as the physical ones.


Yoga is all about being humble. There is no such thing as bragging about how you've hit a new pose in yoga. It's all about doing everything at your own pace.

, Children possess a sense of wonder at the world that is difficult to replicate as an adult. Spend more time around kids and see how they appreciate the world, are constantly questioning it, and how they get pleasure and joy out of the smallest and most mundane things. To a child, a flower or a toilet paper roll can be the most incredible thing in the world -- for an afternoon, anyway.


Spending more time around children will remind you of how magical the world really is.

If it sparks your interest, try meditating. It will be able to reduce your stress levels to enable better mental clarity. This may enable you to see yourself in a clearer manner.;
, Everyday we see images of what is ""okay."" It changes constantly (which proves it doesn't really exist). To be you, you gotta give up trying to live up to some non-existent standard. There's no more being a prep or a jock or a hipster and there's just being. There's no more carrying that Coach purse because it says ""Coach"" on it. You need a better reason than that!


Throw away your aspirations of fitting into any select group, clique, or social class. If the genuine you is what they are looking for, they will come calling later, when you have established your true identity.

, Unfortunately, in today's world we're so bombarded with what society expects of us that sometimes we don't even know who we are. We spend years (sometimes decades, sometimes entire lifetimes) molding ourselves to fit someone else's idea of who we should be, burying who we really are under layers of fluff and masks. Take a minute to write down what actually feels like you. It can be things you do, things you are, or things you think -- it could be anything, so long as it's true.


When you have a list of a dozen or so things (as simple as ""I am happier in flip flops"" or ""I seek adventure above all else""), post it somewhere you'll run into it often. Then, when you go to make a comment or when you're reviewing your day, you can see if your behavior is in line with you who really are. Odds are you'll come up with some things you do/say/think that aren't true to you.

, We may not always like where we come from, but there is no escaping the influence our history has on who and what we are. Many people spend a lot of time and effort escaping their past, such as changing the spelling of their names to sound more politically correct, or giving other people too much power to reshape them culturally. Where do you come from? After all, your parents shaped you greatly and your grandparents shaped them. Think about the following:


Your upbringing. What do you remember most vividly about it? How was it different than most people's?
Your location. How did that shape you? What hobbies and personality traits do you have because of it?
Your likes and dislikes. How many of them are shared with your family? How many do you have because of your family?

, It's a natural human inclination to strive to be surrounded by people...even when those people drain us. But to really be genuine, to get at a you that is happy and natural, those people that leave you exhausted after interacting with them have to be cut out. That's all there is to it. Give yourself thirty seconds to think about it and you'll know exactly who they are.


There are people in the world that just aren't good for us. It's hard to cut them out, especially when we feel like we're being cruel. But it's important not to view this behavior as selfish. Sure, it's in your best interest -- but if you don't act in your best interest, no one will. You're not being selfish, you're being logical.
Forget all the hyped up latest trends unless they fit the genuine you. They last a matter of months -- why would you want to cycle through identities that quickly? Look at your own style and preferences. If a t-shirt and jeans are you, fanfrickin'tastic.

, It's easy to think we're honest and sincere -- but in order to function tactfully and appropriately with others, it seems like we've inserted mind games into everyday interactions. That little white lie we tell Gina about how people actually like her, how we hint at asking for something from a friend because we think it's bad manners to ask for too many favors, etc. We're not being us -- we're being who people think we should be. Gotta cut that out.


The two main sticklers are people-pleasing and avoidance. If you find yourself sacrificing your happiness to please others, that first one describes you. And if you avoid saying or doing things simply because they'd be frowned upon or they might be potentially embarrassing, that's the second. Those little voices inside our heads stopping us aren't us -- they're a part of us that's very much so taught and inorganic.

, This may not be as easy as it seems, considering the immense influence the media has on us all. Sure, we are all unique individuals, but few, if any, people have absolute resistance to the persuasive influence of advertisers, the media, and peer pressure to conform. Because it's so difficult, decide what genuine means to you. The beauty of it is that you get to choose.


Does being genuine mean pursuing your own fashion? Does it mean saying whatever crosses your mind? Does it mean showing your emotions, whatever they are? Does it mean ignoring what's popular? There are many takes on this concept -- what speaks to you?

, If you've gotten rid of your toxic friends (we all have 'em), this shouldn't be too hard. Who do you crave hanging out with? Who always makes you feel good about yourself? And then think about this: who is the person you are afterward?


We all have versions of ourselves. Some are ""worse"" than others, as they can't all be the same. The idea here is to bring out the best you and to make that ""best you"" a constant. And the best you is naturally genuine, obviously.

, You know the phrase ""stop and smell the roses?"" Kinda like that. Tons of us go around in a technology-induced stupor, barely doing the thing we call living. We're unaware of how we come off, how we actually feel, how we influence others, etc. So wake up! Pay attention the world around you. Stop right now and look around your environment. Note 4 things you didn't notice before. Crazy how your mind just sifts out stimuli, huh?


There's so much going on in our heads sometimes it's hard to realize we're playing those games we talked about, especially when we've been playing them since we were babies. If it would help, start watching other people. How are they placating others? How do they phrase things? How do they position their bodies? Once you notice other people not saying and doing what they mean/want, you can notice similar patterns in yourself, waking yourself up.

, When you abandon the mind games and socially acceptable behavior, you're bound to feel vulnerable. You'll no longer be employing those same defense mechanisms that kept you so comfortable before. Scary stuff, man. But when you feel vulnerable, know that it's a good thing and that it will go away. You just gotta get used to being honest and showing how you really feel.


There is a time and a place for everything. If you're sitting in chemistry class and you get a text from your mom yelling at you and you feel like crying, it's definitely best to hold back the tears and finish the test. Know your priorities here. If Jenn said something that upset you, don't start chewing her out if you're upset. Being vulnerable doesn't mean jumping to conclusions! It's still important to employ a level of rationality.

, This one's a tough one. Obviously to be genuine you have to be honest, but how do you stay honest without causing others pain? For example, doctors are instructed not to berate obese patients for their weight, and take a more respectful approach to health.You can strike a balance of honesty and compassion.


Let's take the classic example of, ""Do I look fat in this?"" Instead of outright saying, ""Yep. You do,"" try something like, ""I don't like the way it tugs at your waist."" You're still being honest (it's not a good look), but you're placing the focus on the outfit instead of on the person.
If you're going to criticize someone's actions, compliment them also, so they don't think you're hating on them personally. For example, ""I'm surprised that a thoughtful and educated person like you would say something so antagonistic towards Muslims.""

, It's easy to walk around the world not realizing how even the tiniest mood we have can have repercussions. A friend is going through a hard time when we're super busy and we sort of give them the brush-off. We flirt with someone in front of a person who has a crush on us. To the same token, your genuineness will be impactful on those around you. If you use your powers for good, you can start a positive ripple effect all over the place.


You know that person who walks into the room and it lights up? How them passion and being just seem contagious? That's being genuine. That's 100% them. That stuff is powerful. Your impact can be the same.

, Let's set up the scene: The apocalypse has happened. Everyone you know is gone. You take refuge in a city that has been abandoned, able to do whatever you please. Literally every door is open to you. Now, where do you do your shopping? What do you look like when you look in the mirror? That's the real you (minus the angst and the gun-wielding).


Some people take pride in thinking they're pretty. They like make-up, they like doing their hair, they like nice clothes. That's fine. Others don't. That's also fine. If you want to wear overalls and not comb your hair, more power to you. If you want to carry that Coach purse and buy expensive make-up, more power to you. Just make sure you're doing it for yourself.

, So many of us are busy self-presenting—conveying the image we want to convey instead of who we actually are. We make sure we come off as macho or lady-like or intellectual or anti-conformist. Drop it! Put your true self out there. If you feel something, feel it.


Most of us are guilty of trying to look ""cool."" That's not genuine. If you spent the afternoon playing bridge with Grandma, talk about how you spent the afternoon playing bridge with Grandma. You've nothing to hide. That's just exhausting work anyway.

, When you're speaking in front of a large group of people, it's tempting to scan the audience, glazing over the entire surface. And lots do. But a better way is to make eye contact with one person at a time, drawing them in fully. Imagine Barack Obama locking eyes with you! Dang. He sees you. He's real. Instead of robotically going over the motions, he's actually making direct contact. The same sentiment should be applied to your life.


The next time you're in a group of people, concentrate on one at a time. You can't fully appreciate a person and extend your true self when you're trying to accommodate more than one person. Not only will you be able to be genuine, but that other person will be left spellbound by your social skills.
Work on becoming a good listener and validating people's feelings. These skills can help you connect with people in a more genuine way.

, Flattering, gossiping, or otherwise saying something just to fit in is as disingenuous as it gets. We're all guilty of this at one time or another, even if we have good intentions (we don't want to embarrass ourselves, etc.). The only thing you can do is be aware of your desires and behaviors and address them as honestly as you possibly can.


There are going to be haters. Some people will be put off by your honesty and your tell-it-like-it-is mentality. As long as you're not cruel about it, it's their beef to have. Most people, hopefully, will appreciate your candor. Few people are ballsy enough to get real.

, Don't paste on a camouflage smile to fit a situation. The same goes for the whole range of emotions; if you are going to show the world the real you, the world should see all of it. That way, when you do, it'll matter that much more.


The same broad sentiment applies to activities. If you don't want to do it, don't do it! If you don't feel like drinking, don't drink. If you don't want to spend a night in the club, don't. If you'd rather do something the group isn't feeling, so be it. There are better ways to spend your time, be it alone or with a different group of friends.

, It's tempting, in talking to others, to assert our power, be it verbally or through our body language. We square our shoulders, close off our bodies, and make people come to us. Drop the act. That's another one of those games. There can't be any concern for our image or our pride when we're aiming to be genuine.


When you meet someone, be warm. They're not a threat to you unless they have a gun pointed at your head. And if that's the case, square shoulders won't get you anywhere.
Displaying confidence is a good thing. However, there's a line between confidence that's natural and confidence that's a display. If you feel completely relaxed, your confidence is right where it should be.

, There's no need to bust out the tape measure when you're talking to someone. When someone starts dropping names, don't bite. This is a game they're playing that's disingenuous and a total indicator of their low self-worth. Shame. Resist the urge to one up them with your story on how you chilled with Snoop Lion at the bus stop.


Unfortunately, plenty of us are guilty of trying to make ourselves look good when we meet people. We absolutely bomb by coming off as full of ourselves or trying too hard or being a bit of a braggart by displaying our achievements. That's not exactly how interaction works. The next time someone says, ""Yeah, I just got a sweet promotion,"" just congratulate them and move on. That's all you need do.

, Sometimes there are people that we just don't jive with. That we're incapable of really being genuine with because interacting with them just seems...fake. If you run into this situation, don't force it. That person may not be meant to be in your life right now, and that's fine. Maybe later, maybe never, but definitely not right now.

, If you were to die tomorrow, odds are you'd have some sort of regret that you didn't tell someone how much you cared about them. It'd be a shame to live like that, so lose the restraint! Let people know how much you appreciate them. You'll get it back in return too!


If you find yourself giving out fake compliments to get conversation going or asking for things for a different purpose than actually needing those things, those are clues that your behavior isn't genuine. Give it time. It's possible you may need to get a feel for the other person first.

, Now that you've spent some time rewiring your actions with people and the world at large, take a moment to reflect on it. What do you struggle with? What can you see is already changing? Think about a couple times you were genuine today and a couple of times you could've improved. What can you aim for tomorrow?


If it would help, make a list of people you consider genuine. Sometimes it's hard to see our behavior for what it actually is—it's a lot easier to emulate someone else!
Look in the mirror at the beginning of every day. Consider that this is what every one who looks at you will see, then resolve to let them see you as you really are. When you get it, it'll be totally freeing and feel like you're home.

, Sometimes, bluntness can hurt. Recognize that some people are a little more fragile than others, so handle their feelings with care. Make it clear that even if they did something wrong, you still appreciate them and think they're great. When in doubt, err on the side of kindness.


Kind words can be genuine. For example, ""Yeah, I'm disappointed that our plans fell through, because I was looking forward to them. But I'm not mad at you, and I hope we can still enjoy our evening together.""

Stay active on social media.",How to Be a Good Club President," You must be comfortable standing and speaking in front of your fellow club members.It’s natural to be nervous when you first become the club’s president, but you want the club members to respect your authority.


You must be comfortable giving orders and setting a schedule. If there are discrepancies of opinion, it is up to you to make the final decision.
You also need to have the confidence to hold your club members accountable to the rules of the club and to deadlines like fee payments.;
,


When someone comes to talk to you about an issue, take them seriously. If you don’t have time to address it right then, let them know. Tell them you’d rather talk about it later when you have more time because you really value what they have to say.
The positive interaction of all your club members will create a successful club.
Create a democratic decision-making process, rather than overriding opinions of others.

,

No matter what type of club you are leading, you want to make sure that your members enjoy coming and bring friends.

Change up the style of the meeting and the meeting spot.
Take time to do purely fun activities with your club members like having a movie or game night or volunteering together.. This will help create friendships within the club.
Bring snacks to meetings and take time to play games. Kicking off meetings with an ice breaker can be a good idea.

, In order for your club to run smoothly and achieve its goals, the objectives must be clear to you and to all your club members. Define a mission statement for your club, or write out the mission statement that already exists.This mission statement should be short and simple.
Post it somewhere in your meeting area, and remind members of the statement at each meeting.
This will help you club stay defined and improve, no matter what type of club it is.
Also, this will give potential new members an accurate idea of what your club is.

, Clubs need money for activities, trips and meeting expenses. If you are associated with a university or school, you may be able to appeal to the school for funding if you meet the criteria for becoming a club.


If you’re not associated with a school, you may want to consider making your club a non-profit. You should only consider this if your club is raising tens of thousands of dollars per year as this will require significant paper work and cost money. But long-term it can help with avoiding any taxes down the road on income the club generates.
Consider fundraising. Activities like a car wash, selling products, or simply starting a donation page can help raise money for your club.
You can also charge membership dues and fees that are used to fund the club.

, Outline the basic requirements for someone to become a member. Keep these as simple as possible. For example, you may want age requirements if your club is more adult in nature.


You may also make ongoing criteria that are necessary to remain a member of the club, such as regular meeting attendance and participation in events or a certain GPA if you are associate with a school.
This will also ensure that you have an active club.

,


You’ll need marketing. You may want a member of the club devoted to this, but as president this will also be your responsibility to make sure the club is growing.
Create a website. This allows potential members to read about your club and contact you with interest.
Hold open-house events. Advertise events for potential members to come and see what your club is all about. This is a great way to vet potential members and also showcase what your club can do for them.
Ask current members to recruit. They are likely to have circles of friends with similar interests.

, Part of being a good leader is knowing that you can’t run your club alone.Your fellow officers and members are there to help and it is important for you to tell them what you need and expect out of them.


Listen to their ideas, and let people volunteer for tasks they are interested in.
Delegating tasks and responsibilities will keep members engaged and invested in the club.You’ll need a treasurer, a secretary, a schedule manager, and a membership manager.

, Have regular meeting dates and times, and tell members well in advance if a meeting will be cancelled.


Before each meeting, plan what you will talk about. You should create a meeting agenda, where you outline what is going to be discussed in the meeting and who is going to be speaking on the topic. If you want other officers to speak at a meeting, make sure you discuss it with them before the meeting.

, Having a structure to your meetings will make your club more productive. You should begin every meeting with a call to order. You may say, ""I call this meeting to order"", or ""This meeting is now in session.""


You should then have someone delegated to take meeting minutes, or notes on the meeting. This could be you or someone delegated to be the minute-taker.
You should review the meeting minutes from the last meeting at the beginning of the meeting and revisit any issues or concerns that were not addressed in the previous meeting.
You should then discuss each item on the meeting agenda. Allow for discussion and debate between club members but try to reach a consensus on each issue and move efficiently through each item. At the end of the meeting, you should have an official ""end"". You may say, ""I now end this meeting"" or ""This meeting is now over.""

, Make a Facebook page that provides a forum for members to interact and also to recruit new members. You can also create other club social media like Instagram or Twitter.


Social media is a quick way to send information or invitations to events.
Send out e-newsletters with club content, meeting notes, and upcoming events.

Be genuinely interested in people.,
Remember people's names when you meet them for the first time.,
Assume rapport.,
Talk about topics that interest the people you're with.,
Share information about yourself.",How to Be Charming1," You don't have to love everyone, but you should be curious or fascinated by people in some way. Charming people walk into a room full of people ready to spend time talking to others; they don't stand against the wall waiting for the moment when they can escape. What interests you about other people? If you're empathetic, maybe you're interested in how people feel. Maybe you're interested in what makes people tick, or what knowledge they hold. Use your interest as the basis for getting to know people.


Learn how to ask questions based on your interests while being polite and others will feel they are interesting.
Follow up with more questions to continue showing your interest; the person you're talking to should never feel that you're trying to cut the conversation short.;
, This takes an enormous amount of effort for most people, but it's completely worth doing if you want to be charming. When introducing yourself, repeating the person's name will help you to remember it. For example: ""Hi, Jack, I'm Wendy."" Follow through with small talk and use the person's name during your conversation. Repeat it once more when you say goodbye.


Repeating someone's name is not just about helping you to remember that person. The more often you say someone's name, the more that person will feel that you like them and the greater the chance they'll warm up to you.
If someone else walks up while you're having a conversation, introduce the two people by name.

, This simply means talking to a stranger or a newly met acquaintance in a very friendly manner, as if the person is a long lost friend or relative. This helps break down an initial awkwardness and speeds up the warm-up process when meeting new people. Soon, people feel more welcomed and comfortable around you.


Kindness, coupled with respect, makes others feel as if they are loved and cared for. This is a powerful tool during interaction.

, If you're in a sporty crowd, talk about last night's game or the meteoric rise of a new team. If you're with a group of hobbyists, ask about their hobbies and make pertinent remarks related to fishing, knitting, mountain climbing, movies, and so on.


Nobody expects you to be an expert. Sometimes you can build rapport just by asking questions, and not caring if you seem naive. There are people who like talking about and explaining their interests, and will like you for listening. It is your level of interest and willingness to engage in topics that makes you an interesting person to be around.

Exercise an open mind. Let others do the explaining. If someone mistakenly thinks you know more about the topic, be genuine and simply say that your knowledge is limited but that you're hoping to learn more about it.

, Being quiet about yourself makes you seem standoffish. Sharing as much about yourself as you ask others to share is a way to build trust with other people. They'll feel special because you wanted to talk about your life with them, and before you know it you'll have new friends.

Consider whether this is for you.,
Find fellow foodies.,
Decide where to hold the first club meeting.",How to Start a Cooking Club1," If you love to talk and think all things food, find your bliss when shopping food and end up more often than not at the farmers market to do your food shopping, then you're the perfect candidate to start a cooking club.


If you love talking about food with others, and enjoy all the nuances and specifics about special food products, a cooking club will provide you with the outlet to share this love with people who have the exact same passion. No more need to talk endlessly about the intricacies of food to a bewildered spouse or family member; use the club to get this out of your system!






If your cookbook collection has its very own bookshelf and is bulging at the seams, it's time to get the books down and start cooking those recipes with fellow foodies!






Ask yourself what you want to get out of the club. Do you want to save money, make new friends, discover new cuisines, share recipes, etc.? You may have various motivators, and it's important to recognize these up front, so that you can begin tailoring the club toward this end and attract like-minded members.





;
, A group of people who enjoy cooking is essential to creating a vibrant club. These people don’t have to be close pals of yours, or even of each other, when the club starts. Rather, they have to be willing to pitch in and share in the cooking, and be the type that would actually enjoy that. Five or six people is a good size, especially if you’re all trying to cook in one kitchen.


Advertise online for possible foodie club members. Use Facebook, Twitter, MeetUp and other resources to find people.
Leave small advertisements on community bulletin boards, inviting people to come along to a first meeting.
Ask foodie friends along and ask them to see if they know of anyone who might like to come along as well.
When seeking members, think carefully about the criteria. You might want people with families, single people, people with a busy lifestyle, etc.––whatever matches your own needs is a good place to begin. Specify the parameters as part of your advertising.

, You may wish to have the first meeting at your house, if you feel it's safe enough to do so. It's always advisable to have other people you know and trust around when you first meet the new club members. If you're not sure about bringing them into your home to begin with, hold the first meeting at a local cafe, bar or restaurant–-anywhere you can share and critique food together. After the club is established, the idea is to use your home kitchens and dining areas, once the trust is in place.


At the first meeting, discuss meeting dates. Use an online calendar with reminder notices to help keep track of the cooking club dates.






Try to aim for a regular monthly date. It's important to realize that not all members will manage to make every meeting––build that reality into the flexibility of your meetups.

Make eye contact.,
Smile with your eyes.,
Give a firm handshake.,
Use charming body language.,
Control your tone of voice.",How to Be Charming2," Looking at people directly in the eyes gives you a certain hold over them. It projects confidence on your end while making the person you're speaking with feel that they are interesting enough to gaze upon. Keep eye contact throughout the conversation. No matter what you're talking about, holding the person's eyes will make you seem more charming.

, Scientists have pinpointed more than 50 types of smiles, and research suggests that the sincerest smile of all is the Duchenne smile - a smile that pushes up into the eyes.The reason it's more genuine is because the muscles needed to smile with our eyes are involuntary; they only become engaged in an authentic smile, not in a courtesy smile.Also, if you look at someone and then smile, it will instantly charm them.

, Shaking a person's hand when you first meet them is a polite way to show the person they're someone you want to talk to. Use a firm grip, but don't hold on too tight - you don't want to hurt the person's hand. After one good shake, release the person's hand from your grip.


In regions where shaking hands is not customary, use a different appropriate physical gesture to show you're interested in talking to someone. A kiss on both cheeks, a bow, or another physical gesture gets the conversation off to a good start.

, Face the person you're talking to so that it doesn't seem as though you're anxious to walk away as soon as the conversation is over. During the course of the conversation, it may be appropriate to use light touching to keep it moving. You can lightly touch the person's shoulder to emphasize a point, for example. At the end of the conversation, decide whether it's appropriate to give a quick hug or another handshake.

, Your voice should be gentle and peaceful, yet direct. Articulate your words clearly and project your voice. Practice giving compliments into a recorder and play it back. Does your voice sound sincere?

"
"
Use impressive phrasing.,
Issue compliments generously.,
Be gracious in accepting compliments.,
Praise others instead of gossiping.,
Be a good listener.",How to Be Charming3," Be mature and use a touch of wise, polite language. Don't you find people that say ""Hello"" are much more charming than people that mutter ""'Sup""? Here is another example: Change ""It's none of his beeswax!"" to ""It shouldn't be any of his concern."" Of course, don't overdo it, but try to be polite and turn every negative into a positive.

, Compliments raise others' self esteem and make them feel fondly toward you. If you like someone, find a creative way to say it and say it immediately. If you wait too long, it may be viewed as insincere and badly timed, especially if others have beaten you to it.


If you notice that someone is putting a lot of effort into something, compliment them, even if you feel that there is room for improvement.
If you notice that someone has changed something about themselves (haircut, manner of dress, etc.), notice it and point out something you like about it. If you're asked directly, be charming and deflect the question with a very general compliment.

, Get out of the habit of assuming that a compliment is being given without genuine intent. Even when someone makes a compliment out of contempt, there is always a germ of jealous truth hiding in their own heart. Be effusive in accepting the compliment.


Go beyond a mere ""Thank you"" and enjoin this with ""I'm glad you like it,"" or ""It is so kind of you to have noticed."" These are compliments in return.
Avoid backhanding a compliment. There is nothing worse to a person complimenting than to receive the response ""Oh well, I wish I were as ______ as you in that situation."" This is tantamount to saying, ""No, I am not what you are saying I am; your judgment is wrong.""

, If you're speaking with someone or you're talking in a group of people, and up pops the subject of another person in a positive or negative way, be the one to mention something you like about that person. Kind hearsay is the most powerful tool in gaining charm because it is always viewed as 100 percent sincere. It has the added benefit of creating trust in you. The idea will spread that you never have a bad word to say about anyone. Everyone will know that their reputation is safe with you.

, Charm isn't always an outward expression, but an inward one too. Engage the other person to talk more about his or herself, about something that they like, something they're passionate about, about themselves. This makes the other person more comfortable to share and express themselves with you.

"
"
Decide how to run the cooking sessions.,
Take turns.",How to Start a Cooking Club2," There are lots of possible ways to run the ""cooking"" part of a cooking club, and it's something that you'll need to discuss together and reach a consensus on. Nothing is set in stone and no exact way is right over any other. Some suggestions include:



Theme cooking: Choose a theme that you are all interested in learning more about, such as national country-specific cooking (French, Greek, Chinese, etc.); party cooking; baking; candy-making, etc.







Try-something-new cooking: Have club members come with a dish from a cuisine they've never attempted before.







Cooking together: Instead of bringing a dish, bring a recipe and have everyone pitch in together to make the recipes for a whole meal.







Freezer-friendly cook-up: You get to cook one meal in enough quantities for, say 4 club members, share this meal with the others and keep their additional meals to place in your freezer for the upcoming month! For those who like the idea of freeze-ahead meals but lack the motivation, a club can help get you right into this time-saving measure.







Budget cooking: A cooking club can be a fantastic way to pool resources to pay for more expensive food items.







Making preserves: Preserves (jams, jellies, chutneys, vinegar- and oil-preserved food, etc.) are wonderful to have in the pantry but finding the motivation and adequate knowledge to make them alone can feel daunting. As part of a club, you can share lots of ideas, have many helping hands and each of you take home a jar or more after each club session!







Deconstructed store food: For those lacking in time, hold sessions where you're perfectly allowed to build on bought food and try to improve on it, rather than cooking from scratch. Even if this isn't your usual theme, this can be a good one for busier times (such as holiday season) or when lots of members are away (summer vacation time).







Parents/carers and kids cook-up: Teach your kids how to cook in a group situation––this can be great for sharing ideas around and keeping your patience intact while the mess gets cleaned up by everyone involved!







Book club-meets-cooking club: An occasional read of a book about food––chef's, restaurateur's and foodie travelers' experiences, etc. all qualify for good food reads; some cookbooks might be okay if they contain enough interest beyond a mere assembly of recipes. Have a chat about how you found the book, then head off to cook something inspired by the reading!







, While you’ll need to have one person who organizes things a bit, the fun of a cooking club is sharing the labor. The location for meetings rotates as group members take turns hosting the monthly dinners.


One possible approach: The host makes the main course, others bring appetizers, side dishes, desserts, and so on.
Another approach: The host decides on the month's theme and allocates recipes or rosters specific members onto different aspects of the meal if cooking it together.
A random approach: Don't ask, just turn up with a dish. If this means everyone turns up with snacks or dessert, that's dinner for the night!
A cleaning roster is probably helpful too––don't make it so that the host is left with all the cleaning up afterward! You might like to consider eco-friendly disposable plates and utensils, to lessen the cleaning burden.

Focus on friendship.,
Embrace imperfection.,
Keep the memories and even share beyond your group.",How to Start a Cooking Club3," A cooking club offers its members hospitality in its truest form. Our culture often misunderstands hospitality as entertaining in high style. But true hospitality is not about impressing people, or creating the perfect experience or the fanciest dishes around a Pinterest-worthy table. Rather, it’s about being authentically welcoming, making others feel comfortable.


Treat hospitality as your chance to express your love and warmth for others through sharing food, time and attention to each other. It isn't about who can do the better job at entertaining.
Be welcoming and gracious when hosting others in your home. Be willing to try new things and to share ideas together, so that you all make interesting discoveries about the art of cooking.
Enjoy the company of your friends as much as the food.

, This is not a place to compete or try to outdo one another. The group members should understand that the cooking club is a place of giving each other the space to learn and to share. As Niequist notes, ""t’s about declaring your table a safe zone, a place of warmth and nourishment.""


Encourage the club members to experiment and be supportive when their endeavors don't work out as they'd hope. Use the lessons you all learn together to improve your cooking skills and techniques.

, Take plenty of photos of the food you cook and the fun you are having together. Consider compiling an eBook of the recipes you make together and sending this around to each other. And if you like, share the photos (and recipes/tips) online with other friends and followers, on sites such as Facebook, Twitter and Google+. Readers will enjoy seeing the smiles and joy of club members, as well as learning something from your experiences.


Consider running your own blog for the cooking club. Either a passionate enthusiast of blogging could take on this role, or all of you could offer to do a write-up in rotation. The blog could report on club events, recipes tried, cookbooks reviewed, club members' wisdom, etc.
Pinterest, Indulgy and the like are good to use but avoid creating dishes and images for the sake of uploading. Use these sites as your club's tool to show what happened organically and without obligation, not as the mandatory directive for what your club should achieve.

Don’t make her do anything she’s not comfortable with.",How to Be a Gentleman," A gentleman looks and smells pleasant when out in public. It is one thing to sweat while working out, but not while out and about. Take regular care of your body and that you look polished and clean before you step out.


Make sure to bathe regularly.
When applying deodorant or cologne, be sparing. An overpowering odor--even of cologne or body spray--is not pleasant, and can be offensive.
Use of hair product is fine, but be careful of hair gel. This product can be sticky and get rock hard after a while, making your hair look stiff. You can also inadvertently come off as ""greasy"". If you don’t smell clean and fresh, then it doesn’t really matter how charming you are or how your clothes look. It’s important to get the hygiene down so people don’t get distracted by an unpleasant odor or appearance.
Wash your hands after you use the bathroom. A gentleman cares for himself and others by preventing spread of disease. Also, other men in the washroom will notice if you bypass the sinks.;
, Wear clothes that fit your body well, eliminate flashy clothing and avoid fashion ""faux pas"" (e.g. baseball hats cocked slightly to the side). A simpler wardrobe will keep the emphasis on you, not your clothes, which will change your appearance. Keep it simple, and you’ll look elegant and gentlemanly.


Stick to subdued blacks, grays, blues and browns. A gentleman can actually wear any color in moderation, but the classic colors for men are not bright.
Choose classic clothing for men. Examples include suits, oxford-style shirts, khaki pants.
Wear athletic clothes only for workouts or athletics. A gentleman will not wear his suit while hiking through the Alps, or practicing for his black belt, or playing tennis. But he will avoid wearing his tennis clothes unless he is going to, from, or playing tennis.
What is considered ""flashy"" will vary from culture to culture, and situation. A white linen suit and pink shirt may be fashionable on a tropical island, but be regarded as quite flashy at a corporate board meeting in England.
It’s very important to wear pants fit you. Make sure to hold your pants up with a nice simple belt to show that you’ve really put a lot of thought into your look.
The next time you need a suit, make sure you get measured for one instead of picking one out yourself. A true gentleman makes an effort with his appearance and goes the extra mile to wear well-fitting clothes. Wearing a suit that actually fits you instead of one that is one, two or even three sizes too big, will also help show that you put a lot of thought into your look.
Always make sure our shoes are clean. Some people say that shoes are the first thing a lady notices when talking to a man. A quick (but effective) brush can make a world of difference. Most importantly, clean shoes show that take into consideration the people who will have to look at them once you leave your home.
It’s also important to wear the right clothes for the occasion. Try to stick to appropriate dress codes, whether wearing business casual clothes for work, or to wear formal wear for a wedding. And keep in mind that it’s better to be slightly overdressed than underdressed.

, To be a true gentleman, you have to make sure your hair is regularly combed and that you either make a point of shaving your facial hair or that you maintain a nice, solid beard. Avoid the stubble and go for a nice clean shave every morning, or you will look sloppy. Keep a comb handy so you can run it through your hair (in private) if your hair gets windswept or loses volume after a long day.


Even having clean nails makes a difference. Clean under your fingernails and trim them every day or two to make sure your hands have a neat appearance.
Trim any protruding nose hairs to maintain a groomed look.

, A true gentleman knows how to give a true handshake. Whether you’re meeting your future boss, your girlfriend’s dad, or your sister’s boyfriend, you should make sure to look the person in the eye, grip his or her hand firmly, and show that you mean business. Don’t grip too hard to show off, but give a firm grip to show that you care enough to make an impression. This shows that you’re a gentleman who takes the time to acknowledge new people.


If a new person that you don’t know walks into the room and you’re being introduced, give him or her the courtesy to stand before giving him or her a handshake.

, If you’re in public, then you should avoid farting, belching, speaking too loudly, being overly demanding, grabbing your crotch, or getting too drunk. A gentleman is always in control of himself, body and mind. If you do lose control, however, it’s important to apologize instead of acting like nothing happened.


Remember that a true gentleman is a person who can go out in public without making a scene or embarrassing himself.
Self-awareness is a key part of being a gentleman. Always consider how others may perceive you, and be aware of how your actions may be considered offensive.

, Always be aware of how you can help people. Wait an extra few seconds to hold the door for the person behind you. Offer to help people get their grocery bags to the car. You don't have to go overboard and risk hurting yourself (e.g. if you've got a precarious grip on something heavy, don't open the door for someone) but respect is paramount. True gentlemen don’t only focus on the women they like and ignore everyone else; being a gentleman is a way of approaching the world and all of the people in it, not just the ones you’d like to date.Be on the lookout for people who could use some help but who may not want to ask for it. The man carrying a tray of coffee would love it if you opened the door for him, but he may not ask.

, Be prepared to ask questions or make statements of courtesy, like ""How was your day"", ""May I help you?"", ""Let me get that for you"", or ""I'll take care of that"". Learn to speak slowly and carefully and to take the time to really talk to people in a polite fashion, no matter how rushed you may be. Whether you’re talking to your neighbor or the cute girl in your physics class, make an effort to smile, to be friendly, and to make interesting small talk about how your day is going. A gentleman doesn’t cut right to the chase, but takes his time getting to know people.


Being able to make conversation is a sign of class and maturity, which are two important aspects of being a gentleman.

, Don't swear. Don't be vulgar. If it's too difficult to stop cursing all together, tone it down a lot. It’s just not gentlemanly to curse. If you do curse, you should apologize and try to keep the behavior from happening in the future. If you’re in a situation where you tend to curse more often, such as watching sports or driving in traffic, take extra care to watch yourself so you still come off as a perfect gentleman.


Along with cursing, you should avoid any lewd or vulgar comments in general. And remember that what’s funny to you and your buddies behind closed doors may not always be appropriate for a girl you’re courting.

, You can tell people enough to let them know a little bit about you, at first, but you should wait to really reveal every last thing about yourself. In addition to making you a much more desirable conversationalist, it will make you seem more mysterious to not share too much, which many women find attractive. Get a basic idea of what's going on in music, sports, and politics so you can sound intelligent when you make conversation. Be sure about subjects you state are important to you by making the effort to stay up-to-date on them.


Instead, focus on asking people questions about their interests, hobbies, and plans. Let them know that you’re more interested in them than yourself.

, Learn to avoid politics until you know someone better, and learn how to be neutral if someone else brings it up. A simple shrug will do wonders. A gentleman doesn't make other people uncomfortable. Be focused more on being agreeable and making people feel comfortable than in proving that you’re right and that the other person’s opinions are worthless. You don’t need to show someone up to impress women; what’s far more impressive, in fact, will be your ability to get along with people.


Always remember to know your audience. What may be funny to a working class guy from the Bronx may not fly with an upper crust Manhattan socialite. Be sensitive to the needs and interests of others.

, Being a gentleman doesn’t just mean being polite and courteous to women; it means being respectful to other men, to the elderly, and even to children. A true gentleman shouldn’t be able to turn his charm on and off, and he should be kind and respectful to absolutely everyone who deserves it. Respect a person’s space by not standing too close when you talk to him or her. Respect a person’s privacy by not peering over his or her shoulder or asking too many personal questions. The key is to make people feel comfortable and good about themselves, not like they’re being mistreated.


Say hello to people when you walk by them, ask how they’re doing, and know when they want to be left alone.
Avoid speaking too loudly or making too much of a racket in public or even in your home, out of respect for your neighbors. It’s not respectful to act like you’re the only person on the planet.
Make sure to chew your food with your mouth closed, with respect to your dinner partners.

, There may be some situations that justifies physical confrontation, but it should be in self-defense or the defense of others. However, those situations should be rare indeed.


Remember: a ""gentle-man"" literally means not being a person who resorts to physical violence as a solution.
It is wiser to walk away from a situation, or call the police when appropriate.
Self-defense techniques (such as martial arts) always stress using physicality as an absolute last resort.

, The worst thing you can do to a woman is look her up and down like she’s a piece of meat. Women are human beings with their own thoughts, hopes, and goals, and you should never ogle them and treat them like they’re only there to serve as a feast for your eyes. When you meet a new woman, ask her name and get to know her for real, instead of just staring at her like you’re undressing her with your mind.


Gentlemen understand that women are to be treated with respect. They don’t talk to them with cheesy pick-up lines and prefer some tasteful, lighthearted flirting instead.

, Open car or building doors, pull out chairs. Each woman is different, and you should see which gentlemanly gestures she’s comfortable with. For example, it may be gentlemanly to give a woman your coat if she’s cold, but if she tells you that she's fine, don't insist.

, This is an old-fashioned gentlemanly action that is done so that you “protect” the woman from the street as you’re walking. You can take it or leave it, but you should be aware of it. See how the woman reacts when you try it and use that to determine whether she finds the gesture sweet or dated.

, If you bring up a subject and she doesn't seem interested, move on to something else.

, It's okay to tease them, but being cruel is not the way to go. Teasing does not mean calling them vulgar words, however. No matter how joking your tone is, it hurts a woman when a so-called ""gentleman"" calls them a dirty word. Also, don’t ever, ever act like you know more than a woman about something just because you’re a man because you think that you can really “teach” her something.


One sign of a fake gentleman is a man who is nice to a woman who starts talking down to her the second he realizes she doesn’t view him romantically. To be a true gentleman, you should accept the idea that not every woman in the world will fall for you and still treat them with kindness, no matter what they want or don’t want.
Never use the flirting technique known as ""negging"". This involves the use of low-grade insults or backhanded compliments; a tactic originating in the culture of Pick-Up-Artists. It operates on the philosophy of deflating women's egos so as to avoid pedestalling them, thus making the man appear more blase and less desperate to supplicate to women. This is a very cynical mentality and no intelligent, mature, or classy women will find this acceptable. You will be regarded as a thug, pimp, hustler, or ""player"" rather than a gentleman.

, Offer to walk her to her door (or car) if at all possible. If your girl has to park far away from her dorm or home, always offer to drive her to and from your destination. At the same time, you don’t want to overstep your bounds by making a girl feel like she can’t go out by herself.


It goes without saying that, if a girl has come over your place, you should not just stay on the couch and say “see ya” as she leaves. Make the effort to at least walk her to the door or to her car, whatever the case may be.

, It can be tricky to know exactly which courteous traditions to follow and which ones to forgo. What is appropriate in the place and era of ""Downton Abbey"" may or may not be right today in your circumstances. In general, just be sensitive to a lady's modern independent sensibility, and if she looks uncomfortable with your actions, back off a little. Here are some other traditions that were formerly seen as gentlemanly, which are beginning to lose steam:Reaching for a check at a restaurant.
Helping her with her coat.
Standing when a woman enters the room.
Offering a woman your seat.

, Remember to keep doing nice things for your girlfriend when you're around her. If she's carrying something, pick it up when she puts it down and always kindly let her know you want to help by saying ""oh, let me get that for you"", whatever the object is. Remember, being selfish is not attractive. If you are watching television with your girl and you know she likes a particular show or sporting event, leave it there. She will appreciate that little bit of selflessness more than you know.


That said, you don’t want to make the girl feel helpless, or like you should do everything for her, either. Take note — if she seems annoyed when you try to carry things for her or help her out, then you may want to back off and give her help when she really needs it, not just symbolically.

, It can be nice to show up with a card or a flower, and not just for holidays. Expensive and showy doesn't matter; it's the effort. In fact, a rose, a little love note left on her pillow, the gift of a book she’s been wanting to read, or a heartfelt kiss will keep any girl happy for days. These little gifts will make her see that she’s on your mind even when she’s not around and that you’ve taken the effort to get her something.


Though candy and flowers are nice, personalized gifts are even nicer. Two tickets to a play she’s been wanting to see, a souvenir with her name on it from a place you had to visit without her, or a poster that made you think of her, really show that you’re thinking about her, not just some romanticized version of what any girl could be.

, If you really like your girlfriend, let her know it through loving touches. If you’re in public, hold her hand or put your arm around her shoulder, or give her a peck on the cheek when you want to. When you’re alone, you can be a bit more intimate, by kissing her on the neck, or caressing her back or thighs, as long as these advances are wanted. To be a real gentleman, you should move slowly, and wait until the girl is ready before you try anything beyond kissing.


True gentlemen are proud to be seen with their girlfriends and give them lots of affection, even if their friends are around. Don’t stop holding your girlfriend’s hand when your buddies are around; that said, it’s not very gentlemanly to try to make out with your girlfriend in public, either.

, Don't go around punching everyone who looks at her sideways, but if anyone is giving her looks or unwanted advances, intervene. Put your arm around her shoulder and move yourselves away, or go to her and speak up for her. The physical contact reassures her and lets the aggressor know that he's got to deal with both of you. It’s not gentlemanly to let other men make advances toward your girl or to make lewd comments about her.


You should not threaten to beat the guy up or call him names. Instead, take the high road and find a classy way to tell him to back off.

, If you really want to be a true gentleman, then you should never say anything negative about the girl you’re dating to your friends. You may think it’s cool to complain about your girlfriend or to act like you’re really not into her, but this is incredibly lame and disrespectful behavior that will get back to your girlfriend and make you look pathetic. The only time you talk about your girlfriend to your friends is to praise her or to genuinely ask for their advice in a given situation.


The key to being a gentleman is to have respect for all people. There’s nothing more disrespectful than airing you and your girlfriend’s dirty laundry just to get some laughs.

, Another thing you should avoid if you want to be a gentleman is to tell your friends about your latest sexual progress with the girl you’re dating. It’s just not gentlemanly to talk about finally having sex with the girl you’re dating, what she’s like in bed, or even what kind of a kisser she is. This kind of thing is meant to stay between the two of you, and telling your friends what happened — or didn’t happen — between the sheets is about the worst thing you can do to a girl.


Whether you’re dating the girl or just have gone on a few dates with her, you should really keep your bedroom habits to yourself. If she finds out, she’ll be furious, and you’ll have a reputation of kissing-and-telling.

, A true gentleman recognizes a woman’s limits and respects them. If the girl you’re dating or seeing isn’t ready to sleep with you — or does not want to come even close before marriage or a serious commitment — then you should respect this decision instead of putting pressure on her to do more. Having sex or getting more intimate may not seem like a big deal to you, but every woman has her own limits and her own ideas of what she wants to do with her body. Don’t ever make her do more than she wants to do, and don’t ever, ever make her feel bad for sticking to her guns.


A true gentleman lets the woman make the calls of how far she wants to go and never makes her feel guilty or bad for not doing what he wants. He takes the time to listen to a woman and has the patience to wait for the one who is worth it.

The job of an editor is to be in charge of communications. If you get to know everybody, then your job will be a lot easier and you will be more likely to get responses when you need it.;
, There are so many different ways to communicate these days and people prefer using different types of communication. You need to develop all of the different forms in order to have optimal communication. The main ones include Facebook, Email, and your Website. If you don't already have a group page on Facebook, a weekly email going out, and a website to post everything going on, then get started!

, As events come up, you need to know everything about it so that members can come to you with any questions they have. If you don't have the information, then it will take a lot longer to answer their questions

, As a KEY club officer, you are part of a team. This isn't a one many show, so you need to be able to work well with a team. You all need to be meeting once a week to plan the upcoming meeting and volunteer events. This needs to be separate from the regular member meetings.

Exude confidence.,
Show charisma through your body language.,
Make people feel special.,
Be witty.,
Be engaging.",How to Be Charismatic," Charisma isn't the same thing as confidence, but appearing confident can make you more charismatic because your confidence will put others at ease and inspire faith in your abilities. If people see you as a confident person, they will naturally want to be around you. Here's how to be confident:


Be positive. Confident people are generally positive because they love who they are and what they do. Don't start off a conversation by criticizing another person, place, or political figure. Instead, focus on the things you love, which will engage people and make them want to be around you. If you come off sounding like you hate everything that comes your way, people will worry that your negative vibe will rub off on them.
Speak with confidence. Speaking with confidence doesn't mean talking more than everyone else, or louder than everyone else. Say something important and say it with conviction. Speak at a relaxed pace and speak clearly. Vary your tone, rhythm, volume, and pitch to emphasize your most important words and to keep your speech interesting. To practice speaking with confidence, you can record yourself speaking, and make sure that you sound confident when you talk.
To appear confident, you first have to be confident. Truly confident people love who they are, what they do, and what they look like. If you don't feel confident on the inside, work on emphasizing your good qualities, addressing your flaws, and improving your appearance to show that your looks matter to you.

Remember that if you're still working on developing your inner confidence, having a confident voice, clothes, and body language can go a long way in making people think you are confident.

;
, Your body language can say a lot about how you feel about yourself, and can help you seem more approachable to others. The wrong body language can make you look shy or indecisive, so it's important to move in a way that shows you're confident, engaged, and alive. Here's how to do it:


A charismatic person stands tall and walks with steady, determined strides. They walk into a room of strangers with pride, ready to embrace a new opportunity. They also gesture with their hands instead of crossing them over their chest.

Improve your posture. Nothing conveys confidence like good posture. Stand or sit up straight, but not rigidly. When you meet someone, give a firm handshake and look the other person in the eye. Display positive body language while you're talking to someone or even when you're just waiting around. Sit facing the person or people you're talking to, uncross your legs and arms, and keep your hands away from your face. Look at ease, and don't fidget or convey nervousness.
Think about your own gestures. When you speak, does your body language back you up, or do you look nervous, uncaring, or bored? If you're passionate about something, do your gestures communicate this?
Practice in a mirror. Watch yourself in the mirror and give a speech or even pretend to hold a conversation. What are your eyes doing? How about your hands? Do you look like the shifty politician or the charismatic one? Could someone know what emotion you're trying to convey even if they couldn't hear you? Practice regularly, and make note of what you need to improve.
Mimic the body language of those you are conversing with, so that you can get closer to them in a non-verbal fashion. If someone is gesturing a lot, you can join in, while if a person is more reserved, you shouldn't gesture too wildly.
Look people in the eye when you're talking to them. Don't stare them down, but don't glance around the room or look everywhere but at them. Engage them with your eyes, not just your voice. Don't check your phone, your watch, or look around for other people to talk to because you won't appear engaged.
Watch how other people gesture. Notice how some speakers' gestures appear fake or out of sync with their message. These people come off looking shifty or uncertain as a result. Other speakers use body language exceptionally well. These are generally the more effective communicators and appear more trustworthy and competent. These people are often successful actors, religious leaders, and pundits. Look for good and bad examples of the use of body language. Pay attention, and learn.

Smile genuinely when you greet someone. Your smile should say that you're excited about getting to know them.

, No matter whom you're talking to, you should always try to charm that person and make them feel like the only person in the world. To have true charisma, you should be able to talk to anyone about any topic, and be a good and attentive listener. Here's how to do it:


Be anyone's equal. If you're talking to a potential employer, a group of wealthy donors, a child, a stranger, or an attractive guy or girl, for example, don't put them on a pedestal or talk down to them. Be respectful of other people, but respect them as equals, and expect that they will accept you as such.
Show an interest in people's lives. Without being nosy, ask people questions about their lives, their background, or their opinions on certain matters. Make them feel that what they've done matters, and that you value their thoughts.

Listen actively when others speak. Give someone your full attention when they are speaking to you. Nod in agreement or make brief interjections, such as ""I see,"" or ""Okay,"" to assure the person that you are listening and you're interested in what they have to say. A brief touch on the upper arm can emphasize your agreement or empathy with something someone says, and it can make the person feel connected to you.
Learn and remember people's names and address people by their names. This will make you more likely to remember that person's name when you see them again.

Compliment people freely, but genuinely, and accept compliments graciously and without any fuss.
Remember that being charismatic isn't the same as pleasing people. Charismatic people don't care about what others think. They are just totally charming and charismatic on their own.

, A truly charismatic person should be able to make people laugh without trying too hard. Part of being a person who everyone wants to be around is engaging a group of people in laughter and jokes. You should be able to charm people with your sense of humor. Here's how to do it:


Learn to laugh at yourself. If you learn to poke fun at yourself, people will be charmed at how confident you are and will be more comfortable around you. You don't have to be self-deprecating to show that you're aware of your flaws, and to let people join in on laughing at them. Being able to pull this off is a sign of having true charisma.
Learn to joke around with a variety of people. You should be attuned to the sense of humor of the person or group of people you're talking to. If you're talking to people with a raunchy or slightly offensive sense of humor, don't be afraid to play ball. However, if you're around an older or more sensitive crowd, then tone down your humor and stick to short and inoffensive jokes. When you're with a new person, be conservative at first. You don't want to risk offending or turning a person off with an inappropriate joke.
Don't try too hard to be funny. You don't have to make a joke every five seconds to be a witty person. The well-timed joke can go a long way. Value quality over quantity, and focus on making just a few jokes over the course of a conversation.
Learn to tease people. If you're comfortable with someone and are already on your way to charming them, you can learn to joke around by teasing that person a little bit. This can bring you closer to the person and can show that you don't take anything too seriously. Just make sure it's a person who is amenable to your jokes.

, To be truly charismatic, you need to be able to not only impress, charm, and listen to a group of people, but you should be a person who is good at engaging others and always has something interesting to say, so people will naturally gravitate toward you. Here's how you do it:


Be versatile. A truly charismatic person should be able to speak to a variety of people about a variety of topics. You should be well-read, read the newspaper every day, and have a variety of interests, such as foreign languages or modern ""art"", so you can discuss these topics with anyone.
You can work on being well-rounded and knowing a little bit about politics, history, science, and literature, so you can tailor the conversation to the individual you're speaking to.
Think before you speak. Reduce the fluff and filler material in your daily communications. Try to make every word count, and think about how you're going to phrase something before you open your mouth. If you don't have something important to say, remain silent. It may seem surprising, but limiting the amount you talk will make what you have to say more interesting.
Get in touch with your emotions. Research has shown that people who are generally believed to be charismatic feel emotions strongly, and they are also able to relate to what others are feeling. Don't be afraid to feel anger, pain, sadness, or elation, and don't be afraid to communicate your emotions in an appropriate manner.
Put it all out there. People tend to hide thoughts and feelings from each other without any bad intentions, but everyone warms up to someone who is totally honest without being awkward or weird. If you can communicate honestly and help people open up, you'll be on your way to being charming. Of course, there are a few exceptions; don't say anything that will make people feel uncomfortable or want to back away from you.

End things quickly.",How to Write a Ghost Story," It can be helpful when writing a ghost story to begin by thinking about what you find scary about ghosts. Imagine a situation where you come face to face with a ghost and take note of what you think would make you feel the most fear. Knowing what you find to be terrifying about ghosts can help you get inspired when writing your ghost story.Think about which situations meeting a ghost would be most terrifying.
Imagine the details of the ghost and how it haunts you, noting what scares you the most.
Try watching your favorite horror films or reading other ghost stories to get inspired.;
, A large part of your story will be the setting. While you may be able to create a scary ghost, putting in the wrong setting can make it seem less frightening. Imagine some of the creepiest locations you can think of to use for a setting in your ghost story.What locations do you find disturbing or discomforting?
Your setting should have a feeling of isolation, cutting the main characters off from help.

, Chances are you already have some ideas about your characters, the setting and the plot. Although you may have a picture of what you to have happen during your story it can still be helpful to imagine many possibilities of what might actually occur. Take some time and write down every idea you might have about your story.Think about any details of your story and ask yourself more about them.
Imagine other settings or characters and see how these change the feel of your story.
Think about multiple endings for your story and see which ones you enjoy the most.

, Every story has some basic components in regards to its story arc. Some models differ and not all stories are bound to the same arc. However, the eight point story arc is commonly used when writing fiction and can result in consistently good structures for your story to follow. Review the following basic outline of the eight point story arc:Stasis. This is the introduction to your story and it demonstrates the normal life of your characters.
Trigger. This event is something that pushes your character out of their normal life.
Quest. This is where your character is given a goal or something they must do.
Surprise. This will take up the middle section of your story and will be the events along the way towards your heroes goal.
Critical choice. Your protagonist will need to make a hard choice that demonstrates their character.
Climax. This is the moment your story was building up to and the most dramatic moment of the story.
Reversal. This should be the consequence to your character's critical choice or the main challenge.
Resolution. This point is where your characters return to everyday life but are changed from the ordeal.

, Once you have a basic understanding of what is going to happen during the course of your story you will want to build an outline. An outline will help you visualize the course of your story and let you examine it for any potential problems or things you might want to change. Write your outline in a chronological ordering of events.
Don't leave any gaps in the narrative for your outline.
Try to think about each scene and examine how they work together.

, Ghost stories usually build up slowly over the course of the story. By gradually increasing the amount of strange happenings, you reinforce the idea that something even larger is on the horizon. The reader should notice this exponential increase, becoming more and more anxious while awaiting the climax of your story.Don't rush to reveal the confrontation or climax of your ghost story.
Building the tension of the story slowly can make the climax even more intense.

, Every story has its focus and it will generally be on the main character or protagonist. This character will be the link into the world of your ghost story, giving your readers a direct vantage point to relate to within the story. Think about the qualities, motivations, history, and other details about your main character.Try to think of why your character is in the situation they are.
Imagine how your character would react to the events in your story.
Try to get a clear mental picture of what your character looks like.

, The antagonist in a story is most easily understood to be the “bad guy”. This character will be the one who comes in conflict with your protagonist or hero. In this case, your antagonist will likely be your ghost. Think about some of the following aspects that ghosts in horror stories usually have:Your ghost will need a reason or motive for existing and doing what they do.
Ghosts come in different forms, being more or less physical or having different powers.

, Other characters in your story should be there to give the reader further insight into either the main character or the antagonist. These characters are called foils and although they have their own motivations and structure they are often used to punctuate aspects of main characters..


Foils usually have different personalities than the main characters in order to highlight the individual characteristics.
Your supporting characters should also have their own unique qualities and personalities.
Ask yourself what relationships these characters might have with the main characters of your ghost story.

, The goal of any ghost or horror story is to engage the reader and make them feel what the characters are feeling. Simply telling the reader what's happening can be less effective than showing them. Whenever possible try to describe the characters reaction to something scary instead of telling the reader that they were scared. ”The ghost appeared and I was frightened” is an example of telling the reader what's happening.
”The ghost appeared and my stomach tightened up in knots. I could feel my face break out in a sweat and my heart trying to leap out from my chest.” is an example of showing the reader what's happening.

, Although you may have a perfect idea of exactly what happens in your story, using less details can make your story even more chilling. Readers will automatically fill in details with their own mind, creating an image that is uniquely terrifying to them. Try to keep descriptions to a minimum and allow your readers to scare themselves.For example “The ghost was ten feet tall and exactly as wide as the door that it came through.” is probably too direct.
Try saying something like “The ghost was enormous, making the room suddenly feel claustrophobic and tight.”

, The pace of your story should start slowly, build up speed and then end even faster. A sudden and abrupt ending can really leave your readers shocked, making a long lasting impression. When you are thinking of how your story ends, make sure the final moment can be described quickly.Consider ending your story in a single sentence.
Offering too much explanation at the end of your ghost story can lessen the impact of your ending.

Identify the parts of your story.,
Commit to the final event or actions of your story.,
Figure out the main conflict in your story.",How to Write a Good Ending to a Story1," The beginning is that which precedes everything and before which there was nothing, the middle follows the beginning and precedes the end, and the end follows the middle and there is nothing afterwards.Your ending should probably come when the main character has either reached, or failed to reach, the goal they had wanted in the beginning. For example, your character, who works in a sandwich shop, wants to be rich. They go through various challenges in order to purchase a lottery ticket (and to keep the ticket from getting stolen). Do they succeed? If so, then perhaps your ending is the moment they hear all the numbers on their ticket being announced.;
, This approach is useful if you feel you have a story with so many events that all seem pretty major or exciting, making it hard to find a good ending. You need to decide on an endpoint in your story, after which there will be no more major actions or events.


The number of actions or events you include in your story is only important in relation to the meaning you are trying to communicate. Figure out what events make up the beginning, middle, and end of your story. Once you decide where it ends, you can shape and polish your story's ending.

, Are the characters in your story fighting against nature? Against each other? Against themselves (an internal or emotional battle)?


Someone stumbles out of small plane crash in the woods, in the middle of winter. They must find a place to get warm, out of the elements. This is a ""human-versus-nature"" type of conflict. Someone attempts to psyche out their competition at a talent show. This is a human-versus-human conflict. Most conflicts fall into one of a few categories, so figure out which one is at work in your story.
Depending on the kind of main conflict you have been exploring, the final events of your story will either support or not support the development (build up) and resolution of that conflict."
"
Write out a reflection about the events of the story.,
Ask the “So What?” question.,
Use 1st-person narrative voice to tell the reader what is important about your story.,
Use the 3rd-person narrative voice to tell the reader what is important about your story.,
Write a “conclusion” section for your story.,
Identify the larger connection or pattern to the events in your story.",How to Write a Good Ending to a Story2," Clarify the significance of the sequence of events that you have arranged. Let the reader know why these events are important.For example, your story might say something like, ""My grandfather always made a point of expecting me to do the just and fair thing, in any situation. Now that I am a police officer I understand why he felt this was so important, because those life-lessons are really what sustain me when knowing just what to do in a situation can be so challenging.""

, Reflect on the importance or relevance of your story to the reader. Why should a reader care about your story? If you can answer this question, then review your story to see if the sequence of actions you have chosen would lead a reasonable reader to your answer.For example: ""Why should we care about Noni and his village? Because the climate change that is flooding the land he grew up on and loves will soon raise the water levels in our own cities, and if we act now we can be more prepared than Noni was when his whole world changed in that storm.""

, Whether the “I” in the story is you (the writer) or the voice of a character you have created, you can simply speak directly to the reader.


For example: ""I realized, in that moment, that all my hard work and long practice hours had led me to this moment, standing on that incredible stage, warmed by the glow of dazzling lights and the breath and sounds of everyone in the stadium.""
Celebrity talk show interviews, for example, will often be nothing more than a series of conversations with no clear structure. However, the interviews we remember most are ones where people give clear, effective stories by explaining in direct language what they feel that experience means and why it is significant., You can have another character or a narrator voice speak for you and convey the importance of the story.


For example: ""Denise carefully folded the letter, kissed it, and laid it down on the table, next to the money. They would have questions for her, she knew, but in time they would learn, as she had done, to find their own answers. She nodded, as if agreeing with someone in the room, and walked out of the house and into the old taxi, whining and trembling gently at the curb like a loyal but impatient dog.""

, The nature of the section will depend on the genre you are writing in. Academics and scientists agree that a good ending to any writing should end by having the author leave their readers with “something to think about.” This “something” is the story's significance.If you're writing a personal or academic essay, then your conclusion could take the form of a final paragraph or set of paragraphs. If you are working on a sci-fi novel, then the conclusion might need to be an entire chapter or sequence of chapters at the end of your story.
Please don't end with ""I woke up and it was all a dream"" or a similar one-line conclusion. The meaning or larger point of the story should feel like it flows naturally from the events of the story itself, and not like a tag placed on at the last minute.

, What does your journey (or your character's journey) seem to represent? Thinking about your story as a journey—where you or your main character ends up in a different place, somehow changed from the beginning—will help you see the ways in which your story has its own unique shape, and will help you find an ending that feels right.

"
"
Use action to show (not tell) what is important.,
Build your ending with description and sensory images.,
Create metaphors for your characters and their goals.,
Select a vivid image.,
Highlight a theme.,
Echo a moment.,
Return to the beginning.",How to Write a Good Ending to a Story3," We know that stories full of action, whether written or visual, appeal to all ages. Through physical action you can also communicate the larger meaning and importance of your story.


Let's say you have written a fantasy story where a warrior has saved a town from a dragon. Everyone is grateful to her except the town's former hero, who has spent the story feeling jealous about being outdone. You could end with the local guy giving over his prized sword to your heroine. Without even having characters speak, you can show the reader what is significant.

, Sensory details connect us emotionally to the story, and much good writing uses imagery throughout.However, by using rich, sensory language to paint word pictures in the final part of your story, you will leave the reader with depths of meaning.


""Timmy knew the monster was defeated, sinking now into the depths of the toilet bowl. But he stood and waited anyway, watching for every spot of dark color to disappear, to howl away into the watery elsewhere, until nothing but a clear and faintly blue calm remained. He did not move, in fact, until his own reflection returned to him, finally, in the surface of the bowl's water.""

, Leave clues in your story for the reader/viewer to build an interpretation. People enjoy stories they can “wrestle” with and think about after reading. You don't want to make your story so confusing that a reader cannot make sense of it, but you'll want to include figurative language that is not so obvious to understand. By doing so you will add interest and significance to your work.


For example,"" As Sam said goodbye, she revved the engine of the motorcycle and then Joe could feel her becoming a memory--taking off in an explosion of sound and light, then stretching away, a rocket's arc down the street and up the hill, and finally the smell of smoke, and the echo of her goodbye, until she was nothing more than the aftermath of a firework, a thrilling vision he would always feel lucky to have seen up close.""

, Similar to using action or sensory descriptions, this approach is particularly useful when telling stories within an essay. Think about the mental picture you'd like to “haunt” the reader with—some visual picture that can capture what you feel is the essence of your story—and leave that for the reader at the end.

, You might be working with a number of themes, particularly if you're writing a longer story, such as a history-based essay or a book. Focusing on a specific theme or motif through images or the actions of a character can help you create a structure that is unique to your story. This approach is particularly useful for open-ended stories.

, Similar to highlighting on a theme, you can choose a particular action, event, or emotional moment from within your story that feels most meaningful, and then “echo” that in some way—by repeating the moment, by returning to it and reflecting or expanding on it, etc.

, Similar to highlighting a theme and echoing a moment, this strategy means ending your story by repeating something you introduced in the beginning. This is commonly known as a “frame” or “framing device,” and it can offer shape and meaning to a story.For example, a story that begins with a person looking at, but not eating, a leftover piece of birthday cake can end with that person returning to the cake. Whether they eat the cake or not, the return to it will help the reader see the larger point or mood you are exploring.

"
"
Review the events of your story to see how they connect.,
Ask yourself: “What happens next?” Sometimes when we get too excited (or too frustrated) about a story we're writing, we can forget that events and behaviors, even in a fantasy world, tend to follow logic, the physical laws of the universe you're imagining, etc.,
Ask yourself: “Why are these events in this order?” Review the sequence of events or actions in the story, then question actions that seem surprising in order to clarify the logic and flow of your story.,
Imagine variations and surprises.,
Raise a question based on where the story has brought you.,
Think like an outsider.",How to Write a Good Ending to a Story4," Remember that not all actions carry the same importance or connection. A story follows an unfolding of meaning, but not every action is included in a story in order to lead the reader to the same idea. Not all actions that occur in a story are completed or successful.


For example, in the Greek classic “The Odyssey” by the writer Homer, the main character Odysseus attempts to go home a number of times and fails, encountering monsters along the way. Each failure adds excitement to the story, but the importance of the story is in what he learns about himself, not about which monsters he defeats.

, Often getting to a good ending is as easy as reflecting on what would logically happen in a situation. Endings should make sense based on what has happened earlier.,


Let's say your main characters are looking in the park for their lost dog when they find a secret doorway to a fantasy realm. Don't abandon the logic you began with, if it is useful: let them have their adventure, but let them find their dog in the end (or have the dog find them).

, We don't want stories to be so logical that nothing new happens in them. Think about what would happen if a certain choice or event were slightly changed--and definitely include surprises. Check to see if you have included enough surprising events or actions for your reader.


If your main character wakes up, goes to school, returns home, and goes to bed, then that story might not appeal to very many people because it is so familiar as a sequence of events. Let something new and surprising happen. For example, your character is on her way out of the house when she discovers a strange package on the steps with her name on it.

, Review what you have learned from the events, evidence, or details you have arranged. Think about—and then write about—what is missing, which problems or concerns are still not addressed, or what questions arise. Endings that reflect on questions can invite the reader into deeper thinking, and most topics—if pursued through logic—will lead to more rather than fewer questions.


What new conflicts, for example, now await your heroes now that the monster has been destroyed? How long will the kingdom remain at peace?

, Whether it is a true story or imagined, re-read your story from an outsider's perspective, and think about what would seem logical for a person reading the story for the very first time. As the writer of the story, you might feel particularly excited about an event involving one of your characters, but you should remember that a reader outside of your own head might have a different feeling about which part of the story is most important. Having some distance from your story will help you consider it more critically.

It's best to know what you're writing about so you won't have to worry about it when you're trying to form the words. As your character goes through the bad events, come up with detailed images in your head. Using your creativity, form words to go along with that image.

, Once the raindrops start hitting the streets, go outside and walk around. This way, you'll achieve a sense of seriousness, a dramatic feeling, or inspiration.


If you would prefer not to get wet, carry an umbrella with you.

, Sometimes, seeing how other authors wrote their stories may help you write yours. Don't be afraid to try out their writing style, but make sure you aren't plagiarizing.

, Play a very sad or depressing song. Often, music will unlock a feeling inside of you that cannot be brought out in any other way. You could also construct a playlist of depressing, sad songs so that you have a continuous loop of them playing.

, Distractions often can divert your attention from writing the story. A loud, noisy environment where you cannot concentrate makes it harder for the words to come out, and you'll only end up with frustration. A quiet room is what you'll need in order to properly think.

, If your main character is a patient with terminal cancer, then go visit someone who has terminal cancer. If you can't find one, go online and look up some journals.

, You don't want any light to blind your sight into the words of your mind. This will also create a dark atmosphere in which you'll truly feel depressed.

, This can be immensely cathartic. Use a thesaurus if necessary in order to come up with heart-touching words.

, Full stops at the end of sentences. If you're not sure about the commas, have someone with the eye of an eagle and the heart of a grammar Nazi look it over for you. Don't overuse ellipses.

, This act takes over your life. If you really want to save the world, of give the world resources to do such, ignore the world's mockery and resentment and write to the best of your ability.

Ask for an outside opinion.",How to Write a Biographical Sketch," If you're writing a biographical sketch of yourself, you may feel that you already know everything there is to say. However, you'll need to write down everything you know about yourself before you can begin to write an informative sketch. Here's what to do:


Make a list of all of the jobs you have ever worked. Highlight the ones that are the most important.
Make a list of all of your achievements, whether they are publications, projects that you've led, or promotions you've earned.
Write down the things you're most proud of about your own life.
Write down a few key personal details about yourself. Just stating where you live, and who you live with, may be sufficient, depending on the required word length.
Read through old cover letters to see the different aspects of yourself that you have emphasized in the past.;
, Gathering information about a historical figure will be harder than finding information about yourself, but if you're writing about someone you care about, it should be a fun and educational process. Here are some ways to get as much information about the historical figure as possible:


Research the person on credible sources online. If the person is famous enough, he or she may even have a website.
If you're in school and know a professor who is an expert on the historical figure, ask if your professor has time to sit down and answer a few questions about the person.
Go to your local library to read a variety of biographies about the person.
Search through a variety of reliable sources to get a more well-rounded view of a subject. If you learn specific information, make certain it can be confirmed from other sources.
Choose one interesting experience that illustrates the main point that you want to make about that person's life. Gather details about that incident.
Write a timeline of the person's life that will show that you know when and where the person was born, where he lived, and what he did throughout the course of his life, and where, when, and how he died.
Make a list of the person's jobs, pursuits, and accomplishments. You should know this person inside and out before you begin writing your sketch.

, Once you've gathered enough information about yourself and have a strong sense of your life and achievements, it's time to take a step back to think about which of your achievements or characteristics you want to emphasize to a potential employer, and which aspects are not as crucial to your goals. Here's what to do:


Think of which of your characteristics you want to emphasize. If you want to show that you're an original thinker, highlight the unique projects or ideas that you came up with. If you want to demonstrate that you're great at working with others, emphasize your successful team work.
Think of the aspects of your life that you don't need to include. A biographical sketch can be a page or shorter, so you won't be able to include every single thing you've done or you'll run out of room. Cross out the things you've done that may not be relevant to the job.
Think of a perfect anecdote that shows the qualities you want to highlight. You can brainstorm a few anecdotes and choose the best one. Remember that the anecdote will only work in longer biographical sketches.
Think of the achievements and work experience you want to emphasize. You won't be able to include everything, so pick the most relevant work experience and the most impressive achievements to use.

, Once you've done your research and have gathered enough information about the historical figure, you should sit back to think about what it means, to see if you notice any trends, and to have a better sense of what you want to convey about the person.


Ask yourself about how the historical figure was shaped by his time period and environment.
Ask yourself how the historical figure impacted the lives of the people around him, the general public, and future generations.
Figure out which of the figure's achievements, work, and life experience you may want to emphasize. Unlike a biographical sketch for work, you may not be interested in the person's work experience, but in her relationships, for example.
Figure out which quality of the person you'd most like to emphasize. Are you interested in the person's work ethic, sense of humor, or ambition? Whatever quality you want to focus on, make sure the facts you present support it.
Find the perfect anecdote to demonstrate the qualities of the person you'd most like to show.

, If you have room for an anecdote, it should go in the beginning of your sketch so you can hook your readers and paint an instant portrait of the person you are writing about. Remember that you should always write in the third person, even if you're writing about yourself. The anecdote can be just one paragraph, or even just a few sentences long, but it should convey a sense of the person's character and what makes him or her special.


Clarify who the person is. If you're writing about yourself, that's easy. If you're writing a biographical sketch, it can be trickier. If you want to start with the person as a child, such as telling an anecdote about the childhood of Abraham Lincoln, you can surprise your reader by explaining whom you're talking about at the end of the anecdote.
Convey a sense of the person's character. If you want to show how honest or trustworthy the person is, make sure to tell the perfect story to illustrate these qualities.
Show what makes this person unique. Use specific details and engaging language to demonstrate what makes the person you're writing about different from everyone else.

, Once you've hooked your reader, you need to provide the right concrete details to give a sense not only of the person's character, but also of the arc of his life and his achievements and passions. Here are some things to consider:


Be honest. Don't embellish for the sake of impressing your reader. Your goal should be to tell things as they really are.
Be creative. Don't tell a story your readers have heard before. Find a new way to provide the same information, or a way to provide information your readers may not be used to hearing.
If you're writing a biographical sketch of yourself, provide the relevant information about the positions you've held, the type of work you did, and the things you accomplished and hope to achieve. You can limit personal information in this sketch, since your employers will be focused on your work experience.
If you're writing a sketch of a historical figure, explain where he was born and where he died, what his passions were, what he achieved, and how he shaped society. You can also mention any relevant personal information about the figure.
Remember to describe all the things the person did in chronological order, so your readers are oriented.

, After you've hooked your readers and provided sufficient information about the person you're writing about, you should finish with clarity and confidence. You can wrap up your ideas in just a sentence or two. Here's how to do it:


If you're writing a sketch about yourself, you can end with personal information. Simply state where you live, what you do, and whom you live with.
If you're writing about a historical figure, leave your readers to think about the impact that this person has had on society.

, Once you've written the biographical sketch, you need to revise it to make sure that it's the appropriate length, that it meets your objectives, and that it flows smoothly. Spending time on revising the sketch can help you convey your message and emphasize the right qualities of yourself or a historical figure. Here's what you can do:


Read your work over twice. The first time, don't mark it up, but make mental notes of any places that sound funny. The second time, read it with a pen and mark any places that should be expanded or eliminated, or phrases that just don't sound right. Work to improve those places.
Read your work aloud. This can help you see that it flows smoothly and that your readers will have a strong sense of the person you are writing about.
Make sure the sketch meets your objectives. Remind yourself of the qualities or personal experience that you wanted to emphasize about the person you were writing about. Does the sketch focus on these qualities, or does it leave the reader with a different impression of the person?
Make sure it meets the appropriate length. You may feel that every sentence is absolutely crucial, but your readers or potential employers won't be impressed if you try their patience by going over the word limit.
Set the sketch aside for a few days. When you return to it, you will feel less attached to every word and will be able to see what works and what doesn't.

, Once you feel that you've improved your biographical sketch and that it won't require any more major changes, it'll be time to improve the sketch on a sentence level. Editing will require you to pick the sketch apart sentence by sentence, to improve your writing for clarity, precision, and conciseness. Here's what to do:


Trim down long and awkward sentences for a better flow.
Replace boring words with more descriptive ones. Find a more interesting way to say ""good"" or ""nice.""
Delete anything that isn't interesting or off-topic.
Address all grammatical and punctuation errors.

, Once you feel confident about your revision and edits of your biographical sketch, you should seek an outside opinion before you share it with the world. If you want to try to publish your biographical sketch of a historical figure, you should know if it sounds as convincing as you think it does. If you want to take your personal biographical sketch to the job market, you should know if it makes you look like a promising candidate. Here are some people to ask for help:


Ask a trusted friend who is a careful reader if the sketch is lively, informative, and has a smooth flow.
Ask an expert in the field. If you're writing a biographical sketch, ask a historian or professor, and if you're writing a personal sketch, send it to a person who works in your field (but not a person who may consider you as an employee.)
Ask a person who has written many biographical sketches and knows what makes them work.
Ask a friend who is an expert writer or grammarian.

Finish a rough draft before editing.,
Proofread and edit your script.,
Rehearse your stuff.,
Perform your sketch.",How to Write a Comedy Sketch," Is your sketch for a movie script, a play, a speech in need of comedy, or maybe even a Youtube video?


Depending on your mode of delivery, you can use other tools for comedic effect like props, costumes, lighting, or digital effects.

, Certain kinds of comedy work for certain kinds of audiences. Avoid topics that are overly offensive or will bore your audience.


Think about your audience's average age. If you are performing for children, use content geared towards younger people like teddy bears, ponies, or popular cartoons. If you are performing for adults, focus on topics for adults like sex, violence, international intrigue, politics, parenthood, or work.
Think about the kinds of people in the audience. If you are into lowbrow comedy and your audience seems to be more highbrow, then you might want to consider their expectations. Remember what is funny to you, might be improper, insensitive, or outright offensive to others. Jokes about wealthy businessmen might work well in front of lower and middle class audiences, but will not be received in the same way by upper class people.
There are some exceptions, when it is ok to be offensive. Roasts are events where people come together to make fun of someone. Keep in mind that even these events need to mix insulting jokes with levity.

, Look online for well-known comedy sketches, sketch groups, and sketch programs like Monty Python and Saturday Night Live.Research is absolutely necessary for two reasons. First, it will show you what many people consider funny. Second, it will show you what has been done before. For the most part, you should try to be original, because humor depends on your audience not expecting your joke.Know the genre(s) of comedy you fit into, as well as your prospective audience's expectations for that genre. You don't want to misrepresent yourself or your comedy.

, Now that you know how you will present the material and your audience, what kinds of topics do you think they'll enjoy? You can't write a comedy sketch without doing the leg work first. There are many ways to brainstorm before writing. Think of suitable topics for your sketch.


Write down ideas as they come to you. You never know when inspiration will strike. You could be at a store buying doughnuts and think of a good joke for a comedy sketch on food, eating, or exercising.
Draw inspiration from popular movies, television shows, books, or comic strips. Some of the best comedy sketches are spoofs of other mainstream fictional or non-fictional works.
For example, you could spoof the film series, Indiana Jones. He was a college professor, but most professors would never be as adventurous as him. In your spoof, you could play a ""realistic"" professor confronted by the same situations as Indiana Jones.
Many people swear by free-word association. On a piece of paper write down a word (or central idea) and then list 5 words that automatically pop into your head. If any of the resulting pairs seem strange, you might have something worthy of comedy.
For example, begin with the word bear. Now think of words or concepts that pop into your mind when you think of bears like: wild animal, dangerous, wrestle, fish-lover, or furry. Identify which one is interesting to you and you think will interest your audience. Maybe you choose to write a sketch on wrestling bears.

, The best jokes are surprising and often absurd.


Like a magician, comedians need to be skilled in the art of misdirection. Lead your audience in one direction with the beginning of a joke and then add a ""punchline"", that surprises them.
For example: I once wrestled a bear. It weighed less than a pound and was stuffed with cotton.
This joke uses the art of misdirection. The first sentence is the idea developed through word association. It makes you think that the following story will be about a person taking on a 400 pound grizzly bear, so it is funny when it turns out to be a stuffed teddy bear. This joke is funny too because it is equally absurd. How many adults do you know that wrestle teddy bears?, Many comedians agree that a joke succeeds or fails based on timing.


Think about how you might deliver the joke about wrestling a bear. Pause after you say ""I once wrestled a bear"". Give your audience a second or two to think about you wrestling a bear and all the danger that entails. Maybe take a deep sigh to show that the story that follows in serious to you. Then say ""It weighed less than a pound and was stuffed with cotton."" Now something unexpected has occurred and the audience will laugh.If you say it quickly, the audience won't have the time to assume anything and the joke will flop; , Most great comedy sketches begin with a single idea. Now it is time to expand on your central idea.


Explore your premise. Don't be afraid to write an idea down and throw it away soon after. You will probably think of 10 ideas for every 1 good idea.
For example, the premise you've settled on is an adult wrestling a teddy bear. Many comedians say that great comedy needs to be somewhat realistic. Focus on normally realistic actions. Don't all of sudden switch to a teddy bear in space or a teddy bear coming to life. Your audience won't be able to follow you.
Focus on the action you've set up in your premise. What wrestling moves did you use on the bear? Did you get it in a headlock, full-nelson, or some other elaborate hold? Where did this wrestling match take place? In your bedroom, in your daughter's bedroom, or in a store like Build-A-Bear? What started the fight in the first place? What was the outcome? Use these kinds of questions about action and place to expand your idea or joke into a premise. , Now it is time to put pencil to paper or fingers on keyboard. You know your basic premise. It is time to outline, which should include how you plan to begin, what content, premise, or rough jokes will make up the majority of your sketch, and how you will end.Many write their sketch's story backwards. If you have a great ending in mind (like a grown man fighting a teddy bear in a Build-A-Bear), start there and write what leads to that. Maybe the adult did not like the way the teddy bear was ""looking"" at him when he went in to buy his daughter a birthday present. Maybe work has been stressful and the man just needed to physically hit something. Maybe this particular bear reminds him of someone he hates. Use your imagination to develop a storyline. , Be sure to include the setting, actors' lines, acting directions, and stage directions.Choose a setting. Your character or characters will be in at least one place. Give detailed information about the setting. What other objects will be in the setting with your actors? In the Build-A-Bear fight sketch, describe other stuffed animals and how they looked on. Describe how the store is brightly colored to further accentuate the strangeness of the battle taking place.
Be sure to set the character's name apart from their lines. Write their character's name in bold or italic type face followed by a colon.
Write their lines. Many script writers find it helpful to include other cues in the actor's lines that indicate something about their speech pattern. For example, if the character stutters, the script might use periods or spaces in the text to indicate their speech pattern.
Include acting directions. Think about what your actors are doing. Most likely they will not just be reciting lines in front of an audience. Tell your actors where to look, how to stand, what kind of body language to use, or any other aspects the actor needs to pull off the scene. Oftentimes, comedic writers will write ""pause for laughter"" to give the audience the chance to laugh without missing any of the scene.
Include stage directions. Tell your actors where to go on stage, if they should be sitting or standing, if they should move pieces around the stage, or if they should enter or exit the stage., You don't want to have all your jokes at the beginning and none at the end or vice versa, so space them out across the entire piece.


Jokes and their punch lines can be built on top of each other to make a better effect, especially if the same punch line is going to be used over and over again.
Many comedians like to include callbacks in their writing. Callbacks are when you reference something that occurred at the beginning of a sketch at the end of the sketch. For example, if in your sketch about a grown man wrestling a teddy bear, you mentioned how he went to Build-A-Bear to buy his daughter a birthday present, make a joke about the daughter's birthday gift at the end. Maybe say: ""My daughter got a damaged teddy bear for her birthday because they made me buy the one I destroyed."", Some people will focus so much on editing that they will lose the flow of the overall piece. After finishing an outline, write until the rough draft is complete. Then move to the revision stage.

, Read it aloud. Record yourself and watch it back. Make every sentence easy to understand. If your audience doesn't understand your sentence, then they won't get the joke. , Practice in front of the mirror, perform it in front of a miniature audience, or however you will need to test it. Then go back and revise it again. Fix the kinks, improve the funnies, revise it, etc. Practice makes perfect.


For the hypothetical sketch about a man wrestling a teddy bear, actually get a teddy bear and wrestle it. You might come up with more detail after performing the action. This will make your sketch more realistic. Maybe you'll realize that it is harder to get a teddy bear in a headlock than you thought, because their heads are filled with cotton so they can easily escape your grasp. You might then choose to use this detail in the sketch.
Test and revise, test and revise, learn from mistakes. That's pretty much the point.

, Now it's time to take your stuff out there and show them what you've got!


Don't be afraid to improvise during the performance. Some of the funniest content comes from accidents. Learn to embrace it.

Identify the purpose of a backstory in your story.,
Make a timeline of the character’s life.,
Read examples of a backstory.,
Create a childhood backstory.,
Write short pieces about the character’s recent past.,
Make the backstory complex and immersive.,
Avoid a long backstory.,
Connect the backstory to the character’s present.,
Check the tone and language of the backstory.,
Cut down the backstory.,
Put the backstory in the main story.",How to Write a Backstory," Start by asking yourself, “Why am I writing a backstory for this character?” “What purpose will the backstory serve in my main story?” Consider how the backstory will deepen your character and strengthen your narrative. Identify what you want the backstory to do in your main story. This will help you start the backstory with purpose and intent.For example, you may want the backstory to reveal a character’s haunted past and help to explain why a character is so damaged in the present. Or you may want the backstory to show the character’s complicated relationship with their father, who has just passed away in the present.;
, To help you get started on the backstory, sit down and outline a brief timeline of the character’s life. Begin from their childhood to their present. Draw a line indicating their life span and break it into sections for “childhood,” “adolescence,” and “adulthood.” You can then briefly plot key experiences or moments of the character’s life on the timeline.If you are writing about a character who is a teenager, you may only have childhood and adolescence sections on the timeline. If you are writing from a child’s perspective, you may only have a childhood section, broken into smaller parts.

, To help you get a better sense of what makes a good backstory, read examples of a backstory in literature. Most popular novels will have a backstory woven into the narrative. Many short stories will also contain a backstory throughout or broken into sections that go from the present to the past.Examples of a backstory in writing include Anna Karenina by Leo Tolstoy, ""Tiny Smiling Daddy"" by Mary Gaitskill, and Moby Dick by Herman Melville.
Go through your favorite stories and identify where a backstory is placed in the narrative. Notice how long the backstory is in the narrative and how it is woven into current events in the story.
Often you can identify the backstory in your favorite stories by a shift from the present tense to the past tense. There may also be an indicative clause at the beginning of the backstory like “When I was a child…” or “As a young girl…”.

, Begin at the beginning of the character’s life. Create a backstory that includes key moments from the character’s childhood. Pick specific moments and events from childhood that are particular to the character. The childhood backstory should include experiences that are defining and significant to the character.For example, if your character is struggling with their relationship with their father in the present of the main story, you may write a backstory that includes childhood memories with the character’s father. The backstory may show how damaging the character’s childhood was because of their father.

, If you do not want to go all the way back to childhood, you can write short pieces about events that happened before the character’s present in the story. Create short pieces that focus on key moments or events in the character’s recent past. Think about how the character’s past interacts with the present as you write these short sections or pieces.For example, if you have a main character who is depressed and anxious with their partner, you may write a backstory about a recent miscarriage they experienced. Or you may write a backstory about a bad fight the character had last week with their mother.

, The backstory is not an excuse to simply dump information onto the reader. Instead, it should be just as complex and immersive as the main story. Make the backstory specific to the character. Try to immerse your reader in the details of the backstory so it feels like part of the main story.For example, rather than write a backstory like, “I hated my father. He was absent most of the time and I never got over it,” make it more detailed and complex.
You may write instead, “When I was a boy, my father worked fifteen hours a day. Then, he came home and went straight into his study, where he drank until morning. I said maybe ten words to him throughout my childhood.”

, When it comes to a backstory, shorter is often better. As you write the backstory for a character, try to keep it as short and to the point as you can. Though it may be tempting to go on about a character's past, having a long backstory can often distract the reader from present events and bog down your narrative.This is especially important if you are writing a short story, as the form usually does not call for a long backstory. If you are writing a longer piece like a novel, you may have more room to include more of a backstory.

, As you write the backstory, try to always connect it back to the character’s present in the story. Write a backstory that relates to the character’s current conflict or problem. The backstory should deepen the emotions or feelings the character is having in the present.For example, if you are writing a story about a character dealing with a break up, do not include a backstory about her childhood pet. Instead, you may include a backstory about her relationship with her former partner to deepen the emotions she is feeling in the present.

, Once you have finished a draft of the backstory, read it aloud to yourself. Listen to the language and the word choice. Notice if the backstory matches the tone and mood of the main story. If you are writing the backstory in the first person, make sure the language in the back story suits the first person voice in the main story.


Revise the backstory so it fits with the main story’s tone and style. You do not want the backstory to sound like it was written separate of the main story, as this can disrupt the reader’s experience of the story.

, Just because you have a detailed backstory of your character does not mean you have to use all of it in the main story. In fact, when it comes to a backstory, less is often more. Read through the backstory and cut it down so only the key events or moments are included. Focus on the parts of the backstory that really get at the core of the character and demonstrate the themes or ideas in your main story.For example, you may remove a backstory about the character’s childhood if the character is an adult in the present and the childhood memories do not relate to the present action of the story.

, One of the trickier components of a backstory is weaving it into your main story effectively. Try not to give too much too soon to the reader. Instead, place the backstory into the story in doses or short sections. Include only one to two lines of backstory in a scene set in the present. This way, the backstory doesn’t feel too distracting to the reader.Make sure the backstory does not take over the main story when you place it in the narrative. The main story arc should be more immediate and important than the backstory.

"
"
First whisk out a pen and paper and figure out what you want to do series-wise.,
When you are satisfied with your story arc, make up a first episode.,
Do episodes 2/3-6 in this order: 2/3= future, 3/4= past, 4+5/5= present.,
Really spice it up now!,
8 should have the return of something.,
9 and/or 10 should be new.,
11 should be really scary.,
Think about final episodes.,
Write the script and give them all names.",How to Write a Doctor Who Series," Maybe D.W. is public enemy number 1. Maybe his new companion has infinite knowledge of the universe. Make sure that you can hint at the disaster and create suspense. For example, my doctor discovers a massive surge of time energy creating 'mutations in the space-time continuum'.;
, It needs to introduce something new, maybe a new doctor or companion, or a new alien. It needs to either: Set up the story arc or... Drop a hint. I did a 2-parter where the doctor finds 12 large red spheres in 12 different locations around the world. The hint is a startling realization that the spheres' origin does not exist.

, The future does not have to contain massive space battles or destroyed planets. It could easily be an Atraxi prison with no prisoners (my idea). The past doesn't have to be a special moment, it could only be some African-Americans fighting an other-worldly creature (mine also). Tip: if you did a 2-part story for the first episode, do a short story for the present story. The future would not have to contain hints, but I suggest dropping a few in the next 2 or 3.

, The main episode of your series should be the 7th one! It should show you what the Tardis team is up against, and really give some spoilers. Don't unnecessarily give away previews though. Say what you need to and nothing more. I did one with micro-robots that can turn into any material, and imitate any object.

, Anything. It could be a 2 part story. It should set some side stories about the ending, and also endanger a lot of people. Not the entire world, but a group of people.

, New monsters, new setting, maybe a new cast if you can manage. No big story setups, just fill the gaps, fun-time episodes.

, Don't mention anything about the story arc AT ALL.

, A two-parter or a simple extravaganza? Either way, 12 should have the return of the classic monsters, and 13 should be EPIC! Build a story wall, knock it down to create suspense and awesomeness, and build it up again with some elaborate touches. The audience must understand every question and know what happened without a doubt.

, Good names are: 'The white house globe'. 'The angels circle'. Name them according to what they contain and the style of storytelling used.

"
"
Plan before you write.,
Think of what you are going to write first.,
Be creative when you are writing.,
Be comfortable while writing.,
If you cannot think of anything, open up some books to get ideas.,
Avoid getting writer's block by taking time.,
Don't overload your trash can with crumbled up papers of bad writing.,
Don't eat something while writing.,
Once you write something stupid, then add more adjectives and words to make it better.,
Ask friends to come over and they can help you!,
Be determined.,
Once you are writing, keep on writing.,
You can also write something totally random.,
Kill a main/minor character.",How to Work Through Writer's Block," Take a spare piece of paper and write some ideas or make a 'word web'.;
, Is it a story? Perhaps an article? Or a summary of a story? Always think first, then write.

, If you're writing a story, think of a good blurb. For example, a girl who has no friends or a guy who is sentenced to jail for a crime he didn't do, etc.

, There's no way you can be squished with hard books and gum wrappers, etc, and start writing.

, Look at your past English textbooks and find any extra adjectives or words in them that you can use for your story.

, You don't have to rush and write a story. Fit a time in your schedule where you can just relax and write in your pajamas in bed.

, Take one piece of paper, write something and check to see if its good or bad. If its bad, rub or scratch it out and rewrite something with the same story but in different words.

, Get a glass of water or better yet, a water bottle, and keep it on your bed-side table. If you feel that writer's block is coming at you, take a long, nice sip of the water and your brain will feel refreshed, as if you can think clearly again.

, You don't have to rub it out or throw it away to waste paper.

, Or find a family member who is very good at writing, (Example: Mom, brother, sister) and you can write together.

, Once your going to write something, be confident. Otherwise, how on earth are you going to get over writer's block?

, Just don't stop until you think that the story should come to an end.

, IE ""Suddenly, purple penguins deleted the software the hero used to track the antagonist. Then, (name of protagonist) vanished the purple penguins forever from the earth."" Do that until you have something else, and then go back and delete your random spree.

, Want to kill writer's block? Kill a character! Be sure to come up with an interesting excuse for it, and remember, you can always bring the character back.

Decide which area of writing works best for you.,
Choose fiction.,
Choose non-fiction.,
Think mish mash.,
Select your topic.,
If you're writing fiction, some additional helpers include:


You already know your characters inside out and think you've met them personally.,
If you're writing non-fiction, the following also tends to help:


It's something you're an expert at/in.,
Take notes all the time.,
Find the time to write.,
Be focused on the purpose of this book.,
Write a synopsis of your book.,
Review progress frequently.,
Set a deadline.,
Go over the work thoroughly.,
Have the work reviewed by colleagues, coworkers, acquaintances.,
Try to come up with a unique or catchy title for your book.,
Submit your book to a journalist who has a good reputation (who does not trample authors' work).,
Let your editors rip the work to pieces.,
Make essential changes.,
Decide how the book will be published.,
Let the publisher do the marketing needed.,
Wait.,
Understand that there is no guarantee that the bestseller magic will happen.,
Start writing the sequel.",How to Write a Bestseller," If you're flexible, maybe try both. You never know which might work best. The next steps provide the things to consider in making your choice.;
, Take a look at How to write a short story and its related wikiHows for detailed assistance. Prepare the profile and the background of your characters in advance. The would-be bestseller must be easy to read and:


Your readers must be able to sequence the events from earliest to latest; a reader will quickly give up if they are all mixed up and unclear.
Your readers must be able to tell in what sequence the events in your book 'occurred'.
In general, infinitely super-glue the attention of your readers through connecting traits in your characters, amazing plots and fascinating story-telling.

, Look for a relevant topic that a great many people are concerned about. You have two angles: find out whether anybody has yet written about it. No? Great, go for it. Yes? What unique angle can you provide that hasn't yet been covered?


Refer to as many useful sources as possible on the topic.

, Who says this bestseller has to be a novel or a non-fiction style? It might be a blog, an autobiography, a travel-log, an esteemed reference text, a children's book, a school textbook (captive audience, bound to be a bestseller) or a book of fierce humor. It might be other . Choose whatever style works for your quirks and abilities and run with it, right to the many publishing methods now available to you.

, In general, selection of the topic will be helped by some or all of the following:


You're passionate about the topic. You could write on it until the cows come home and then some.
It's a really popular topic, either currently (get moving then) or perennially (always have a unique angle though).

, Writing about them will be a breeze.
You have a plethora of current day fixations, addictions and fascinations in your notebook, waiting to fly off the page and accost your characters and mess up their lives. People love to be able to connect with the everyday stuff that rankles, perplexes and overwhelms.

, Or you are willing to research it to death. Nicer still if you have a certificate or degree or oodles of experience to back up this expertise and/or research. It helps people feel that you're reliable.
You have the phone numbers of experts you can call on to ask questions about when you're stuck or feel like making it up.
You like what you're writing about. If not, you're very good at standing in the shoes of different perspectives and you're able to remain objective. How long you can keep that up will determine how successful you'll be at getting the book completed.

, Carry a notebook with you wherever you go and capture the ideas that pop into your head at the time they appear.

, Few people can afford to be novelists-in-residence without some income source earned by fair means or foul. Unless you're Alain de Botton, who writes living off an inheritance (although now his writing makes the money too), you'd best make the time wherever it's free. Use your time on the bus to and from work, during lunch, after dinner, on the weekends, during vacation blocks.


Asking for time off work to write a bestseller should be done with care. Judge the nature of your workplace first––the more conservative the establishment, the less likely this will be something considered worth their loss of your time.

, Bestsellers do not need to be the best written; some may well be, but it can also take many years before the public catches up with such genius unless you also manage to win a literary prize. If you want to be great now, just start typing or writing, get it down and then fiddle with it later. Procrastination and perfection are the enemies of the bestseller.

, A plan, an outline, whatever you will. You can mind map it if you prefer. There are lots of rules for doing this. You can even read those too if you like. Or you can just get stuck into it and write, write, write. Not everyone does this the color-by-numbers way, so find your own path.


Fiction: Set out the characters, their traits and quirks, their motivations. This should be fun; fill them out as they grow in your mind. If they're based on your neighbor or ex-lover, make sure they're unrecognizable unless you enjoy being sued. And write out the situations you want to develop in your book, the plot so to speak, the series of events, be they fortunate or not so fortunate. And how will this all end? A cliffhanger, a surprise, a happy ending or a kaboom and everyone dies?
Non-fiction: Consider the need for sections, methods, parts––how will you break things down? Chapters can be nested inside sections, etc. Say you're writing about people's love of apple pies. Section one could cover what the apple pie is, with stories of people waxing nostalgic about apple pies from years gone by. Section two is where to source the best apples for pie making. Section three is a stack of apple pie recipes. Section four is troubleshooting failed apple pies. Section five is photos of your favorite apple pies off Instagram. And so forth... Some topics, like cats and beer, people will never get enough of and all you need to do is have a modern, current angle. Other things that are way too cliched, like celebrities and pop music, and you'll need funky new ways of bringing such over-written topics to people's attention that they don't already know.

, Is the writing taking you where you want it to? Is it good, interesting, fathomable, fascinating, gripping, useful, entertaining, sparkling, witty, trendy, or whatever combination of such things you're trying to make it?


Don't be afraid of splitting elements off for other projects. Sometimes you are mid-stream writing about one thing and another insists on birthing itself. Write it down, label it and put it aside for your next project. Avoid trying to add too much to the one piece you're writing now. After all, should you manage the bestseller, you'll need to produce more after and these side ideas are perfect germs of new bestsellers for later.

, Miss it various times. Set more deadlines. Miss those too. After all, life has a habit of getting in the way. Eventually, set the uncrossable deadline and mean it. This time, finish the book. Enough already! There is a point at which you must choose between being an author-in-waiting and a published-author-hoping-for-a-bestseller. Decide and get on with the writing to completion.


Be realistic. A book on the lost herd of rice carving gnus of outer Mongolia will likely take longer than a fiction piece about vampires destroying the local tea party. Especially if you need to budget the money and travel to outer Mongolia to verify the research. Deep research can take years; you can nudge your imagination quite a bit faster.
Holes can be filled in later. That is what friendly reviewers and your not-so-friendly editors are for, pre-publication. Listen to them; they can see the trees you keep missing for being deep in the proverbial forest.

, Read your own work after a break. Correct grammatical and spelling errors. Remove stuff that is fluff, bloat, nonsense or simply adds nothing special.

, While you may be tempted to get friends and family to review it, do you really believe they'll be able to tell you honest irritation, dislike or criticism? Be fair on them and realistic and only ask people who are less inclined to flatter you or be subjective. For example, you may join a writer's club and meet a few critics who are able to give you suggestions on improvement.

, As a case in point, if your book is about global warming, the title can be 'Coats are Useless': The uselessness of coats indicate the impossibility of winter since we wear coats in winter. However, avoid getting stuck on this aspect. Many an author wastes time trying to come up with the perfect title, only to have the publisher hate it and change it anyway. Put some effort into the title but not all your spare time.

, Maybe this does not seem specific. You can have your book listed in a catalog or you can write to a newspaper/magazine to advertise your book. Better bring along positive comments from other reputable magazines and/or critics.

, Don't pontificate about how amazing your writing is. Editors are crafts persons just like writers and they are there to help not hinder you. They are there to polish the gems and bring them to their shiny potential, hopefully bestselling potential. Embrace this help for all it is worth and let them make their suggestions. Entertain their suggestions seriously.


Friendly editors are useful for easing you into the editing experience. Nasty ones are just nasty and are good for sharpening your wits against and allowing you some self pity. At the end of the day though, look for the ones in between––nice to invite to a dinner party but very fierce about their craft and the ability to make your craft look better.
Submit the book to a publisher only if you do not mind having the book edited impersonally. This can be a good or a bad thing, depending on how you choose to view it. On the whole, the experience of that editor and the backing of a publishing house and its already established reputation can only be good for you. There are people who purchase based on who published the book, not just who wrote it.

, Ultimately, you need to make good judgment calls about what to leave in, what to rewrite and what to pull out, based on your editor's and reviewer's comments. Trust both your own instincts and what they have said, but be careful about both. Your own instinct can sometimes just be stubbornness parading as ""truth"", while not every reviewer or editor will get the totality of your writing. Try to get some distance from the writing, give yourself time to consider the comments made about it, then come back to it and assemble it for its last phase, the publication.

, There are different possibilities, such as using a renowned publisher, vanity publishing or publishing eBooks or blogs online.


Choose a well known publisher and half the battle can be won for bestseller status. Suggested examples are Oxford University Press and Penguin Books, which publish many bestsellers. However, publishers reject a lot of attempts at book deals, so have a huge list to work through and don't give up. Keep sending that manuscript out, again and again until it gets accepted. If not, vanity publishing is more accessible than ever.

, If you've chosen to use an established publisher and they've accepted your work, expect them to market the daylights out of the book. If they don't, ask why not. If you don't like the answer, you might need to return to the drawing board but it is worth pushing them before giving up.

, Some bestsellers are sleepers. Some might need nudges from you. Share the link to where it can be bought from on Twitter, Facebook, Google+, etc. Give some away in blog or Facebook competitions. Tell friends and family it has been published (the one time you can guilt them into helping through this whole process). Give some away as Christmas gifts. Send copies to a favorite celebrity. Market yourself.

, It completely depends on the situation, the whim of the buyers, the tone of the season, the calibration of the planet... Really, there are lots of things that go into making written work turn bestseller or viral. You can do your best to achieve this but apart from the well known (and very bankable) churner authors in such areas as crime, law and romance, most authors live with hope. Your publisher can do some things but even they can't perform miracles, so be patient. If, after a year or two, the book seems to be doing the ordinary thing, like being bought occasionally, go back and write again. It just means you've still got a bestseller waiting to emerge, so don't give up.


Consider sending your book to literary award groups or organizations. In some cases, the publisher may need to do this on your behalf. Getting an award can be helpful though, both for recognition and a little bit of handy cash.

, Get onto this really quickly if your work is a bestseller; your readers are already hanging out for more. Ditto if it isn't a bestseller––the sooner you get back to believing in your writing, the better.

Make a list of five things you’re afraid of.,
Use a story from your life.,
Look for inspiration in the news.,
Eavesdrop.,
Read some “missed connections.” Another great place to find story ideas is the “missed connections” tab on Craigslist.",How to Think of Topics for a Short Story1," A central component to any story is a character’s emotional drive. Few emotions are more compelling than fear. Sit down and create a list of five things that you fear. (Don’t think too hard about it. Just take out a pen and write.) See if you can imagine a character sharing this emotional experience, and think about how it could shape their story., Another tried-and-true approach to crafting a story idea is to take something from your own life. Think about moments in your life which contained a high-level of emotional intensity: When have you had the most fun, been the most heartbroken, or experienced the most anger? When you have you learned an important lesson? When has an experience changed you? You can always dramatize and/or spice up your story, but looking back over your life can give you a nice jumping off point., A classic source of story inspiration is the news. Open up a newspaper, turn on the TV, or go online to your favorite news source. Some papers may even have a section for humorous or outlandish news stories, and these may be an excellent place to start.

, One of the best sources of inspiration is the people around you! Go to a crowded place (a park, a restaurant, a bar) and just listen in to people talking. (It may help to pretend to be reading a book, or put ear buds in without music). Regular people often say the most funny and interesting things. Allow something you hear to spark an idea for your story., This is a section where people try to connect with random people they have met in the world. In some cases, these stories are ripe with story potential. Take some time to read these over and see if anything sparks."

Write about something ugly.,
Imagine an asteroid is headed straight for Earth.,
Write about one or both of your parents.,
Envision a closed door.,
Picture a Chinese restaurant.,
Search for unique prompts.",How to Think of Topics for a Short Story2," When you hear the word “ugly” what comes into your mind? Is it a person’s face? Is it a despicable deed? Is it a poorly decorated room? Use your concept of ugliness to generate a story., An asteroid headed straight for Earth generates a few questions: How can it be stopped? What happens if it crashes? Is there a post-apocalyptic landscape? Who might be responsible for this asteroid? Could it be extra-terrestrials?, Your folks might be wonderful people, or they might be jerks. Either one could be a good jumping off point for a story. You may tell the truth about your parents, or you may speculate about things that could happen (or could have happened already)., Why is the door closed? What is behind it? Is the door inside a building or outside? Is it a freestanding door in the middle of the dessert? Could this door lead to another dimension, or open into an important business meeting?, A woman opens a fortune cookie that reads, “You are in grave danger. Do not tell this to anyone.” What does the woman do? Does she believe that this fortune is telling the truth? Who could be trying to warn her? Who could be trying to harm her, and why?, If using writing prompts is a fruitful exercise for you, begin to seek out your own. Check out books filled with writing prompts (e.g., 397 Journal Writing Prompts and Ideas, 300 Writing Prompts, and 642 Things to Write About) from your local library, or do some basic internet searches. You may also seek out a writing partnership where you develop prompts for one another.

Imagine a character.,
Figure out what your character wants.,
Create an obstacle.,
Place them in a setting.,
Come up with a theme.",How to Think of Topics for a Short Story3," The basic building blocks of any story are character, plot (what the character wants and what stands in their way), setting, and theme. You can start with any of these, but a common place to begin is character. Look around you. Do you see anyone interesting? Can you picture an interesting person in your mind? Let that be your main character.You may try to think of anyone you know with extraordinary features.
Do you know anyone who is extraordinarily beautiful? Extraordinarily brave? Extraordinarily strange?
Allow these people to inspire your character.

, At the center of every story is desire. In order for you to start formulating your plot, you have to figure out what your character wants. You may begin by asking yourself what you want. Can you make a list of five things you wish for? Do you think any of these resonate with your main character?Another question to ask yourself is why does your character need this thing right now? A sense of urgency makes for a strong story.

, If the center of every story is a character who wants something, the driving force of the story is what stands in the character’s way. What is preventing your character from getting what they want? What is stopping them from achieving their goal? Make this something concrete and immediate (unless it is not meant to be realistic)., The setting of a story includes the place and time that your story takes place in, as well as any details that occur in that place. To get at your setting, ask yourself the following questions: What city are they in? What year? What does it look like there? How is the weather? How are the people dressed?It may help to think about places you have been, or places you wish you could go.
You may even think about places that have appeared in your dreams.

, Behind a character’s goal and their quest to overcome a series of obstacles, is an overall message or theme. You may begin you hunt for the theme of your story by asking yourself to list four things that are important to you. Next, list four things that you believe. These things may be big or small. Then, look over your lists. Chances are, embedded in there will be a theme you can latch on to. For example, your list of things that are important to you might include your family, recycling, eating a healthy diet, and watching good films.
Some themes embedded in this list are: family is the center of a happy life, saving the earth is essential to human survival, you are what you eat, and watching the stories of others helps us understand our own lives.

Decide what style and size of notebook you want.,
Purchase a notebook.,
Personalize your notebook.,
Decorate the notebook with craft supplies.",How to Start a Writer's Notebook1," Notebooks come in a variety of sizes, from the small pocket-sized variety to large composition notebooks. Notebooks also come in both lined and unlined varieties—and lined notebooks can be found in both wide and college ruled. If you don’t want to use a paper notebook at all, you could opt to start a digital writer’s notebook by using documents or memos on your tablet, phone, or computer.If you’d like your notebook to be portable (in a shirt pocket or purse), a small notebook may be better. However, if you plan to be prolific and to fill every page with writing, a larger notebook may be more practical.
If you’re notebook shopping on a budget, size will be the single factor that most determines the price—smaller notebooks, and notebooks with more flimsy covers are usually cheaper.
If you plan to draw in your notebook, you may also want to find a notebook with graph-paper pages.;
, Visit a local office-supply store or bookstore, as these businesses will have the most variety in notebooks. Look through the selection, and find a notebook that appeals to you. It can be a spiral notebook, a composition notebook, or whatever kind you like.If you write a lot, and don’t want to constantly buy new notebooks, consider buying a three, four, or five subject notebook, so you have ample space to expand.
Buying multiple notebooks will also be helpful if you want to categorize your writing into multiple subject categories.

, To make your notebook unique to you and your writing, you may want to divide the notebook up into different sections. For example, if you’re planning to write different genres, you could have poetry in the front, fiction in the middle, and your creative brainstorming in the back.If you like, these sections can be marked with adhesive tabs to make them easier to find.

You can also personalize the notebook by writing your name in the front, doodling pictures when you’re bored, or taping in a couple pictures of you and your friends.
Your personalization doesn’t have to be messy or showy; it just needs to make the journal feel like it’s yours.

, This step is optional, but if you have something decorated, it often makes you more likely to use it more frequently. Visit a craft-supply store and purchase glue, and pick up some colorful items that appeal to you.


Get pictures, gems, feathers, strings, whatever you want to create your own personal writing place to escape.
You can also decorate the cover of your writer’s notebook with stickers. You don’t have to do this all at once; build up a collection of stickers over time (through visiting local businesses, for example) and use them to make an appealing collage on your notebook’s cover.

Start writing something that you’ll enjoy.,
Remember to write in your notebook frequently.,
Explore different genres and styles.,
Write multiple drafts of any project.,
Get feedback on your writing.",How to Start a Writer's Notebook2," It’s important to have fun with your writing, especially when you’re just starting a notebook. Write some of your old story ideas, start a chapter of your novel, write dialogue, write down a funny conversation you heard at the store, etc.Don’t worry whether or not your writing is “polished.” Just focus on writing something that’s interesting to you and that you can keep coming back to day after day.

, Although it’s exciting to start a new notebook, that excitement can quickly fade away. Set a schedule so that you remember to write—try writing every day, for example. If once a day is too often, plan to write two or three times during the week, or at least once a week. To get in the habit of writing frequently:


Plan to sit down and write after you get home from school or work.
Write first thing in the morning, before you tackle responsibilities for the day.
Write in bed at night, before you go to sleep.

, Even if you already have a good idea of what you’d like to write, it’s still fun to try different types of writing. And who knows, maybe you’ll find a new style of writing that becomes your favorite. If you usually write fiction, try writing science fiction, fantasy, a detective story, or a comedic story.

Try writing poetry. In poems, you don’t need to have characters or plots; you can write about your feelings or observations of the world around you.
Read a variety of works for ideas and inspiration. When deciding what to read, plan to focus on different genres so that you can see how well-known writers

, No writer has a perfect first draft; it’s important to realize that writing is a process that often takes many drafts to perfect. Let your writing sit for a day or two, then return to it and re-read your own work. Figure out what the best parts of what you’ve written are, and then fix the parts that don’t seem to be as good.

Always revise your work after you’ve finished a draft, a poem, or an essay. If you don’t like what you’ve written or think it could be better, add or remove a section, change the genre or style, or change the point of view., It can be tiring or feel pointless to write alone day after day; see if any of your friends or family members would like to read your work, and ask for their opinion. Although receiving helpful criticism can be tough, it will help you improve as a writer.

You’ll also receive compliments on your writing, which are encouraging and can motivate you to continue writing or to try a new style of writing.
However, if you would prefer your notebook and its contents to remain private—especially if you’ve written sensitive or personal information inside—that’s fine too. If someone asks to read your notebook, you can just say, “No thank you, I’d prefer that other people not read what I’m writing in my notebook.”

Jot down notes, descriptions, or details.,
Listen to how people speak.,
Plan out your story or novel.,
Have fun with words when you write.,
Describe scenes that you see.",How to Start a Writer's Notebook3," You can have an entire section of your writer’s notebook dedicated to quickly sketched notes. While these short impressions may not take up much room on the page at first, they will quickly accumulate as you find more things to describe day after day.These will make great details to use in a short story or essay.

Note things like: how a tree looks when it loses its leaves, how fresh baked foods smell, or how you feel at the end of a long day.
Make notes of what you have seen in the past such as the author/artist and write any description of your inspiration in the start of the book.

, Try listening in on someone’s conversation, write it down, and write your imaginary ending to the conversation.This is a useful trick for learning to write dialogue in a story or novel—listen to the conversations of family, friends, and strangers around you, then imitate how they speak in your own writing.

You can also try this by listening to someone’s conversation on the phone. You won’t be able to hear the other side of the conversation, but that is the fun part, because you can imagine what the other person is saying and incorporate that into your writing.

, You can do this by making character pages, where you map out things about a character for a book or story that you are going to write. To practice, take notes on a real person, or make up a character resembling one in an existing book. If you’re writing fiction or a personal essay, draw on real-life experiences that you’ve had with your friends and family., Words are one of the most fun parts of writing, and can be explored through synonyms and antonyms, rhymes, and other word tricks. Try making word pages, where you look up descriptive words in the dictionary, and write the definitions down in your writer’s notebook.

Try taking words you’ve already used in your writing, and looking up their synonyms in a thesaurus.
This will help you to use more descriptive words in your writing, making it more interesting and more detailed. It will also help you to expand your vocabulary.

, Use all five of your senses, and watch an elaborate sunset, stare at the mountains, sit in a field of waving grass—or do something simple like describing a cafe as you sit down and drink your hot chocolate, or munch on a muffin. Drawing from real-life observation is a powerful tool that many professional writers use to enhance their own descriptions and imagery.If you take your journal with you everywhere you go, you’ll be able to jot down impressions, observations, or phrases that you see or overhear throughout the day."

The night before your ""inspiration day"", watch a historical movie and write down several stories that interested you within it.,

,, But from this point on, the story you chose is going to be the base for your entire novel/novella/short story. (Feel free to change it, if you think another would be more well-suited.)

, Try to use characters in your previous writings that were interesting, but whose stories never were successful. But don't make them major characters. Feel free to borrow the general personality of a character you really liked from a book that was not your own, but your homework is, however, to give them your own magic touch. You might want to do this by making them have a few more traits: for every flaw they have however, they must have a strength. This is true to any human you'll ever meet!

, You might want to read a little Shakespeare, especially his comedies, or at least watch a movie based on one of his plays to learn what a great subplot is.

, I hope you are writing all your ideas down on several organized pages in your journal.

, Put the surviving ideas together in a ""collage"" of good ideas, along with a few powerful quotes from good books you have read, and a summary of your historical story. Make it readable, since it's going to be your reference point from now on.

, Don't forget to write down the great ideas you get in doing so!

, Put down a minimum of pages you have to write everyday. Decide not to change the plot mid-way, instead, change it during revision.

Don’t write a log of your daily life.,

Prepare for rejection.",How to Start Travel Writing," The first step in becoming a travel writer is to read as much as possible. Reading other travel blogs will help you get a grasp on what travel writing should look like. It will also help you figure out what kind of travel writing you want to do.


Try regularly reading one or two famous travel writing blogs for a month or so. Pay close attention to how they’re writing their stories. What do they focus on? What’s their tone? How do people respond to their articles?
Every travel writer is different, but you’ll find they all aim to be informative, personable, and accessible to readers. They convey their personality and their likes and dislikes in what they choose to write about.
If you aren’t sure what sites to visit, some popular travel blogs like Nomadic Matt, View From the Wing, Expert Vagabond, or The Planet D are some great places to start.Don’t be afraid to take notes. The more information you have, the better prepared you will be when you start writing yourself.;
, Since there is currently a plethora of travel writers both online and in print, it's good to have your own point of view. This can be anything from writing specifically about food when traveling, to writing about a specific activity like deep sea diving, or simply going different places for different cultural events like festivals.


Having a niche will also help you be specific and clear in the point you are trying to convey to your reader. Do you want to give them tips? Immerse them in the sights and sounds of a particular city? Describe a food so well they can taste it?

, Once you have an idea for what you want to write on and how it's best to build a site as an online base. You should keep all of your writings, photographs, and links to social media on your blog. You should also have a mini-bio about yourself, a small itinerary about past and future travels, and maybe a picture of you. This site will act as a portfolio for you when you want to get published, so the more content you have on it, the better.


There are a multitude of online sites you can use for blogging. If you’re just starting out, try a free website like Weekly, Wix, WordPress, or Blogger. If you have a bit more experience and want more options, try a paying website like Squarespace.

, Being a travel writer doesn't just mean going abroad to exotic or foreign places. It's unlikely you will have either the time or money to constantly be on the move. Instead, you need to learn to write about all places. Write on areas you've previously traveled to, or even areas within your local community. Not everyone has lived where you have and it’s your job to make these places accessible to them through your writing. Try going to local festivals, locally owned restaurants, parks, bookstores, anywhere that seems interesting to you.

, Knowing what to write on isn't always going to be obvious, especially if you're just writing about your hometown. You need to try and see things from a different perspective. Picture yourself as someone who has never visited and imagine what questions they might have. What would they be interested in or want to see? Chances are there's a lot going on in your local area that even you aren't aware of - find it.Try going to local festivals, concerts, plays, restaurants, or parks. Learning to describe even the ordinary in a way that someone will want to read is a great way to get comfortable in travel writing and find your voice.
You can join mailing lists for events in many cities, you can also join local forums, or get local newsletters that will let you know what’s going on around you.

, Whether you’re writing on an area you know well or somewhere completely new, speaking to other people is a great way to find new stories. It can be hard to find things outside of your interests, so speaking to different people within the area can help open up new doors for you. They can tell you about events, introduce you to new people, or even take you places on their own.


You could ask, ""What's the best food around town?"" or ""is there a local myth or legend?""

, Think about what moves you and why. When you go to a new place, take note of how you feel and react to things. Did you go somewhere and hate everything? What particular events set you off and why? Sometimes it’s difficult to figure out what about an event or place is affecting you, so writing down in the moment and reviewing later will help you keep track of these things. For example, if you taste a new food and have a negative reaction, write down what it was and why. If you're watching a festival and a moment stands out to you, write it down.You can write these things down anywhere. Keep a little notebook, a diary, or even type notes into your phone. You aren’t likely to remember everything perfect after a day or trip has ended, so taking frequent notes will help you out.

, The best travel writing is usually down-to-earth. People want to feel what it’s like to live in a place as a local. They don't want the tourist experience, or for you to be giving them a sales pitch about why a place is wonderful. You want to be objective, but you also want to be true to your experience. Writing is a personal experience, and travel writing should be no different.Be careful not to be cliche, though. There are plenty of articles on “hidden gems,” or secret spots in cities. These read like advertisements.

, No one wants to read an in-depth account of how you spent every minute of your day. You need to focus on small moments and be descriptive. Use anecdotes, tell stories, make it personal. For example, if you are visiting a small bakery in Monterosso, Italy and have a moment of nostalgia because it smells like your grandmother’s kitchen, tell the reader this.

, If you have a local community paper of magazine in your area, try getting some of your writings published there first. Or, if there's a particular website you really like, try to see if you can submit an article. You want to focus small at first and try to develop a relationship with an editor to regularly get your work out there. This will help you build up your travel writing resume and portfolio to get more opportunities later.You can usually find submission information directly in the paper/magazine, or on their website. If you can’t find it, try emailing the editor. You can write something like, “Ms. Scott, My name is Ron Conway, I am currently working as a travel writer and was looking for some information about possibly submitting an article.”

, As difficult or awkward as it can be, you need to build an online presence. Make sure you tweet and regularly update your social media like Instagram, Facebook, or Snapchat. Even if you feel no one's paying attention, it's best to stay consistent. The more things you use the more people you can access, and in turn get to come to your blog.


Also, try tweeting at people who are travel writers or have blogs related to travel writing. Don't self-promote, but contribute to conversations. Make yourself known for being knowledgeable.
These people may then come to your blog and later promote you, which will get you more traffic.

, A big part of making connections is talking to everyone you can. You never know when a random encounter could connect you to something or someone great. Making friends with people in the travel industry, hotel workers, concert bookers, or other workers in the areas you’re interested in will help you get to new places. These people will help you get inside information and be where you need to be to get the best story.

, Like any other creative job, being a travel writer takes a long time. You are likely to meet a lot of rejection along the way. Publishing is not only skill, but time, luck, and opportunity. So don't take it personally if you get rejected, just keep building your website and submitting your work when you can."

Get an idea.,
Turn your idea into a story.,
Turn your idea into a story plot.,
Yes, that's right, the end.,
Think about your characters.,
Build plot points.,
Fit your plot points into a story arc.,
Place those potential plot points you came up with somewhere on the arc, working either backward or forward.,
Change around or redevelop your plot, as necessary.",How to Plot a Story," If you have one lurking somewhere, great! If not, brainstorm, or mind map, or do one of the numerous other thought-generating exercises that can be found on the web. You don't need to make it a story just yet—but you do need a vague idea. It can start with anything: a phrase, a face, a character, or a situation, just so long as it's exciting and inspiring to you.;
, Remember to add a little twist, as this is the high-level arc of the story. If you're familiar with the Snowflake Method, or other top-down methods of idea production, then you'll be familiar with this step. So, how do you turn a vague notion of a girl with dark eyes into a story idea? First, understand that stories are about two things: characters and conflict. Sure, there are other things in there, like theme and setting and POV and whatnot, but at the heart of every story, there are characters with a conflict. So let's take our dark-eyed girl. Now we start asking ourselves questions, with the goal of creating a character with a conflict. Who is she? What does she want? What is standing in the way of her getting it? Once you have a character with some sort of conflict, you have a story idea. Write that idea down.

, Now, here comes the hard part. You have a high-level idea for a story, but how do you turn that into a plot? You could, of course, just start writing and see where it takes you, but if you felt any inclination to do that, it is doubtful that you'd be reading this article in the first place. You want your plot. So here's what you do: you come up with the ending first.

, Does our dark-eyed girl get her man? Or does she lose to the rich chick? Come up with your ending first, and if that doesn't spark a few plot points in and of itself, then continue reading on.

, Now, you have a conflict, you have characters, you have a beginning situation and an ending situation. If you still need help finding a plot, then what you need to do now is think about your characters. Flesh them out. Give them friends, families, jobs, histories, life-changing experiences, needs, and desires.

, Now that you have your characters and the ending of your story, put your characters in their world, and watch them interact. Be sure to take notes. Maybe one of them gets that big promotion. Maybe our dark-eyed girl competes in a swimming competition with the rich brat. Maybe her best friend finds out that she's never given up on that crush. Just come up with ideas for what they could do to affect their world, and what their world could do to affect them.

, Here comes the fun part. Now, some knowledge of story structure comes in useful here. For our purposes, Freytag's analysis is probably most useful. Stories have five parts:


Exposition - the character's normal life, up to the point of the ""inciting incident"" that pushes them into conflict.
Rising Action - the conflicts, struggles, and pitfalls that the character faces while trying to achieve their goals. In three act structure, the second act, and usually the meatiest portion of the story.
Climax - the most important part! The point at which all seems possible or impossible, and the character must decide whether to go for the win or take a graceful failure. The turning point of the story where the conflict comes to a head.
Falling Action - how things unfold after the climax, the hero wins or loses, all loose ends are tied up, leading to...
Denouement - a new balance, normal life once again, but different (or perhaps not so different) from the ""normal life"" of the character's exposition.

, Your ending probably falls into the Falling Action or Denouement stage, though if you're good (or lucky) you may have come up with the Climax instead. If you don't have the Climax itself, think of the resolution you want, and think of the event that would be necessary to create it. All things leading up to that event from the beginning are Rising Action. All things resulting from that event are Falling Action. And all things that don't fit into either one of those two categories shouldn't be used in your story, unless it's in a side plot.

, Now you should have a workable plot. It may not be intricate, it may not be pretty, but you have enough to start working with. Once you decide which scenes best illustrate the chain of events leading up to the Climax, you may decide that you want to change them around, or even change the Climax. This is okay. Writing is a creative process, and such things are never neatly cut and dried!

Choose the moment your readers will enter the story.,
Introduce suspense on the very first page.,
Excite the reader with immediate action.,
Question your own decision.",How to Start a Love Story1," You may already know what you’d like to contain in the first scene in terms of plot and character introduction, but are unsure of the exact moment, the perfect bit of dialogue, or the opening narrative fact with which to bring your reader into the fold. Identifying this moment may require a bit of reflection on your part.Tell yourself the beginning is the most important part. In many ways, it’s not – for either stories or relationships. But in terms of luring a reader into the story and ensuring you have them interested – if not thoroughly romanced – the opening scene does have undeniably vital importance.
Know that you need to snare your reader within a matter of a few pages if you want them to commit, and that this will likely require giving them something substantially interesting right out of the gate.;
, While there are no concrete rules for how a love story needs to begin, there are some narrative tropes that continue to melt hearts. Among them; consider the implication of an oncoming challenge to one of the story’s love interests, a dramatic change in circumstances, or a blatant threat to a character or a relationship between characters.A common route here is a moment in which danger or the threat of danger are recognized or experienced by a character who will be featured prominently in your story.

, Another great option for starting your story is choosing a moment that will immediately pull the reader into the story line with a compelling action sequence in the opening scene of your story. Make sure that any initial action sequences are readily comprehensible. There doesn’t even have to be any actual danger; it is more than enough to simply convey a sense of peril that the reader can relate too. Though you may be tempted to get the story line really rolling, keep any initial action sequences relatively simple. Maintain a focus on luring the reader in, without asking them to do too much thinking as you get the story started.

, In order to actually portray the moment most dramatically, consider why the moment is worth starting your story with. Literally ask yourself, “Why should my story start with this moment?” List all of the reasons, including the specific relevance of the moment to each major character and to your anticipated plot developments.Look over the list to help you identify the most compelling links between this moment and other aspects of your story to guide the way in which you convey the moment to the reader.

"
"
Introduce someone for the reader to love.,
Introduce the story’s love interests to each other.,
Make hurdles comical, heart wrenching, or seemingly insurmountable.",How to Start a Love Story2," You might begin by focusing explicitly on one character. Choose one of the people that your story focuses on, namely someone who will fall into or out of love, or will dance anywhere in between. It may sound predictable, but readers are looking for someone to love too – and they’ll likely fall for whomever you introduce first.Prepare the reader to care for a character throughout the story, and to invest their own emotions in that character’s achievement of happiness and contentment.
For instance, introduce a character by showing them experience some sort of significant personal revelation about themselves or another character in the story.
Equally reliable; introduce a character as they’re enduring an undeserved hardship.

, This may seem a bit forward, but it doesn’t necessarily have to be romance at first sight. However the introduction goes, provide the reader with the inclination that this is a relationship to take note of, even if you also include a bit of misdirection to imply some complicating factors.


For example: As Sarah walked down the gangplank, a man with a mane like liquid honey approached. He introduced himself, “It is absolutely thrilling to meet you. The excitement I have derived in reading your letters has prevented me from allowing any other to be the first to greet you. My name is…” He trailed off, rather stunned by the beauty of a woman he had imagined ten thousand times, but whose actual appearance surpassed his most generous fantasies. She looked at him for a moment and replied, “Fetch me a horse.”

, In fact, it may be especially effective to give your lovers a few hurdles to overcome in order to achieve each other’s love. This appeals to several different components of intrigue, as it provides a struggle to invest in both emotionally and in terms of plot suspense.


For instance, “The man turned to beckon a servant, but forgot he’d been holding the end of the rope wound round a pole, and fastened to the gangplank. He let the rope fall to the ground. Before anyone noticed, a gust of wind pulled the boat from the dock, and the rope unwound with incomprehensible speed, dropping gangplank, plumage, and a visibly displeased Lady Sarah into the bay.”

"
Condense the opening moment into a single line.,
Be blatantly sensual.,
Get your reader wondering.,
Sadden, disgust, or frighten your reader.,
Get inspiration from other authors and songwriters.",How to Start a Love Story3," Even if you plan to portray the opening moment over the course of the first few pages – which is totally fine – consider how you would convey the moment in a single line. You may even wind up using this line, whether to literally start the story or within those first few pages. Either way, thinking about specific, attention-wrangling lines will help you keep the start of your love story focused on the potency of the first emotional moment you want your reader to experience., There’s nothing like a dose of sensuality to get a human intrigued. You can do so with a bit of taste, while still guaranteeing an uptick in your reader’s blood pressure. Contemplate your own response to such a beginning: “Suddenly, she felt the secret of a kiss ripple through her body and bloom beneath the surface of her skin. Her joints softened, her breath caught, her lips fell heavily against one another and her tongue swelled against them, reaching for a taste of air tinged with enticement.”


For a more romantically comedic approach to a sensually-charged opening: “She adjusted her pose, ensuring that the features she assumed had caught his eye were catching as much sun as possible. He removed his shirt. Both pretended not to notice the other was looking. Finally, their eyes betrayed them both, just as a bird relieved itself above, it’s excrement somehow landing on each of them simultaneously.”

, A particularly fun and unsurprisingly effective way of grabbing your reader’s attentions is by throwing something at them that’s unexpected and demands explanation. This will intrigue them both by making them wonder what’s going on, and by simply surprisingly them. In other words, begin with a premise that raises questions in the reader’s mind.For instance, “Sarah jumped down from her intricately-saddled elephant and handed the reins to a shirtless man she had never met before.”
Alternatively, “The cauldron boiled thickly and looked of effervescent syrup, but her heart sank quickly as she tossed it into the stew.”

, Some of the most compelling emotions – for both your characters and your readers – are not necessarily the most pleasant. Play to people’s desire for the unsavory and depressing by beginning with a scene that is completely absent of romance.For instance: “He woke up, rose slowly, counted the stains on his ceiling as he did every morning, glanced at the empty spot beside him, and decided not to eat breakfast.”
And of course: “Her cats began licking her ankles where their tongues had already thinned the fabric of her tights as soon as she broke the threshold. She sighed at the site of a darkened patch of carpet in the center of the apartment’s only room, knowing she could remove the visual evidence, but never the aroma.”

, Both contemporary and classic story tellers can be a great source of inspiration. For instance, tune in to your local pop station. Depending on the level of literary legitimacy you’re shooting for, radio singles are ripe for the romantic-one-liner picking. Take, for instance: “We were both young when I first saw you”.Note that even the contemporary artists reference classic storytellers. Consider the lyrics from a popular radio single: “Marry me, Juliet, you’ll never have to be alone.” This line pays homage to Shakespeare by referencing a well known romantic narrative and incorporating into a more contemporary narrative.

"
Make your characters relatable, but extraordinary.,
Bank on the appeal of emotional intrigue.,
Imply internal conflict.,
Have a character face a tough decision.,
Expand upon your characters following the opening moment.,
Include a healthy dose of character flaws.",How to Start a Love Story4," Present your characters as otherwise ordinary humans that have been inspired by the immense power of their love for another. More to the point, avoid any potential for your story to read too simply. You need more than “Beth meets Sue, they fall madly in love, and happiness blossoms in their life ever-after.”For instance, start by introducing your character in their painfully boring place of work. Up the intrigue by implying that one character simply doesn’t have time to maintain an active romantic relationship, as they must work to pay for an older family member’s medical bills. Unbeknownst to the heavy worker, their love interest has been putting in overtime too, raising an amount of money sufficient to cover a necessary but expensive treatment.

, Love stories derive their appeal in part because they allow both authors and readers to explore particularly emotional content of all sorts.Emphasize the strength of the emotions the lovers in your story feel, by implying, early on, the dramatic efforts they are willing to make on behalf of their love interest or relationship.


For instance, have a character say or do something emotionally significant – such as making a sacrifice –to indicate their interest or commitment to someone they care about, perhaps without the other person even knowing about it.

, Maybe your characters aren’t even sure they’re in love! Such an implication can be as compelling as the most certain love in the history of humankind. Consider quite literally starting your story with the admittance of such uncertainty, with characters reflecting on their love or level of commitment to another., One way to ensure they stick around beyond the start of your story is your inclusion of a scenario in which life presents a character with an opportunity or choice. Make a character even more relatable by emphasizing their struggle in making a decision or responding to a significant development in the story.


For instance, have a character seize an opportunity to get a reader cheering for them, or miss one if you want your readers to sympathize.

, A character should never be exactly who the reader thinks they are when you first introduce them. Even if they maintain incredible consistency, you need to add depth to your characters to develop a solid start into a meaningful and complete love story.Write strong protagonists – both male and female – who are independent and capable of making decisions on their own.
Give every character a reason to be respected by your readers. This rules out the lover simply waiting to be saved, as well as a “villain” without any relatable characteristics.

, For instance, consider making your protagonist’s flaws apparent – at least to some degree – at the very start of your story. Alternatively, include a rather apparent antagonist in the beginning of the story who slowly becomes equally as likable as your protagonists. Stated otherwise, call your reader’s assumptions into question.Set your readers up to feel as though they understand a character or relationship, and then shake things up. Show them that even the characters in your book – whom your reader is living vicariously through – will surprise them. And through it all, show your reader that relationships in stories and reality often lead to the experiences that make human life itself a rather romantic ordeal.

Think about what you want to write.,
To research, ask yourself what you are researching.,
After many weeks of researching and expanding your ideas, you have no idea where to put them!,
You have your basic skeleton of a world, you have mapped out your ideas, but what about the plot line?,
Okay, you have your World, your creatures, your history, and even a plot line!",How to Research and Start a Fantasy Story," Nothing ever gets started without a little brainstorming. Write down any interesting ideas that you think might be interesting.


Now once you have a few pages of ideas, it's time to scratch some ideas out. Put yourself in the reader's shoes, what are fantasy stories these days missing? What are the typical cliches?
After you have skimmed your list down to a few it's time to expand these ideas. For example, if Jimmy put down that he wants dragons in his story he must ask himself a few questions.Think of our W's (Who, What, When, Where and Why?) and then our ever loving How. This is also where you will do your research.

, If Jimmy wants dragons in his story and he is wondering what these dragons look like, then he should look up Dragon photos and Dragon Lore.

, Well, this is where you start the wonderful process of World Building.


To build a World, grab your pencil and graph paper, draw random squiggle lines that have a non-uniform shape. Remember, South America doesn't have straight lines when drawn on the map!
Think logically when you place your locations. If, for example, the elves you've created have tan skin and generally wear sleeveless tube leather corsets and short shorts with daggers made of bone, you would probably want to put them in a desert to the south or a wasteland where there is a lot of heat and sun.
Try to avoid location cliches. For example, In a multitude of stories, Dwarves are living inside mountains or are completely underground or even both! Try to play it up a little and have them live in forests or even grasslands!
As for naming your locations, be creative. A name of a continent or World should be fluid and have that worldly 'ring'. For example, in the book Eragon (written by Christopher Paolini) the name of his continent is Alagaesia, doesn't it have that ring that seems to scream that it's a continent? It's also something original and quite creative!

, Creating a plot is a difficult long process. Start by jotting down ideas again and fleshing them out. The difference between this step and step one is that you need to Try to stick to plot ideas and try not to go to much into the history of your world.

, You feel so ready to take on your big epic fantasy to span many books. Hold it, time to edit and revise! Look it over and when you're done looking it over, look it over again. Make sure you have everything you want and need.


Now it's time to begin writing, but wait! How am I going to start this? It's now time to put our chapters together! Start by taking a piece of paper or typing out what you need to happen in the first chapter. This is your guideline!
Now repeat the guidelines for the rest of your story, if you took notes correctly and have much detail in your history and lore in your world, refer back to these! Make sure that when you finish a chapter that you edit it multiple times!

Sometimes you might be rejected because you provided insufficient information.
Alternately, you could be rejected because the policy doesn’t cover your disability.

, The denial letter should also tell you how to appeal and provide any deadlines that you must meet. Highlight this information and write down deadlines on your calendar so that you don’t forget.


If the information is not in the letter, then call up the insurance company immediately., If you get short-term disability through an employer, then you have a right to request a copy of your claim file, summary plan description, and your policy. The plan administrator must provide you with these documents within 30 days.Send a note requesting these documents to the plan administrator, who may be either your employer or the insurance company.
Mail the letter certified mail, return receipt requested and hold onto the receipt.

, If you were rejected because you provided insufficient information, then you need to gather that supporting documentation. You will want to provide this supporting documentation along with your appeal letter. For example, you might want to get the following:medical records from your doctor
an opinion from your doctor or from a second doctor
written observations by coworkers or your boss about how the injury has affected you
other records, such as police records if you were injured in an accident

, You might not know how to begin appealing. If so, you could think about meeting with a lawyer.However, you need to be aware that lawyers don’t work for free, so the expense could outweigh the amount of short-term disability benefits you are seeking.However, try to find low-cost legal help in the following places:


If you are low income, then you might qualify for legal aid. Legal aid provides low cost or free legal help to people with incomes less than 125% of the federal poverty level. You can find legal aid by visiting http://www.lsc.gov.
Your employee assistance program might offer free consultations with lawyers. Check the details of your plan.
You also could meet with a lawyer for a half-hour of advice. You could show the lawyer your letter and ask for tips on improving it. A lawyer might charge $400 an hour but charge $200 for a half-hour of advice. You can get a referral to a lawyer by contacting your local or state bar association.

, You should set up the letter like a standard business letter. Double space the document and set the font to something readable. Usually, Times New Roman 12 point is acceptable., The insurer should be able to identify who you are and why you are appealing from reading your letter. Accordingly, make sure to provide the following information:your name
your policy number or identification number
reason the insurer denied your claim
brief description of your disability

, You also should explicitly ask the insurer to change its mind. Be sure to mention your supporting documentation and argue that these documents show you qualify for benefits.For example, you could write, “As my enclosed medical records show, I broke my arm on August 15, 2016. Because my job requires that I shelve books and boxes above my head, I have been unable to complete a shift since August 16. My enclosed letters from two coworkers explain the details of our job and how I had to leave early two times because I could not complete tasks. I have been out of work since. For these reasons, I am asking that you approve my request for short-term disability benefits.”

, Make copies of whatever documents you are including—medical records, notes from coworkers, etc. Don’t send originals. You can also include a copy of your application and the original denial letter., Make a copy of the letter for your own records, and then send it certified mail, return receipt requested to the address provided by the insurance company.Hold onto the receipt.

, The insurance company should review your appeal letter and supporting documentation. You should receive a response in writing.


You should also consider other appeals. The letter might tell you that you can bring an additional appeal and how. If your short-term disability insurance is sponsored by your employer, then you can continue to appeal. First, you would appeal to an administrative judge and then you might file a lawsuit in federal court."

If you can’t find your notice, contact SSA. Ask that a copy be sent to you.;
, SSA should give you instructions in your denial notice for how to appeal. You must follow all instructions, so read them carefully. Note deadlines and what forms you must complete.Your appeal will be denied if you don’t follow instructions.

, SSA might have used wrong information to evaluate your claim. For example, they might have wrong information about your age, educational level, or work experience. Go over your notice to find errors.

, Your denial notice should identify what medical information SSA relied on when deciding to deny you coverage. Now is the time to supplement your record with additional information.


For example, you might have had new tests taken which show the extent of your disability. You should get copies of the test results to share with SSA.
Also gather updated medical records. Submit the most recent ones, not old ones.You might need to pay your doctor to cover the costs of the copying.

At the top of the letter, include your name and your claim number. Your claim number may be the same as your Social Security Number., In the first paragraph, write that you are appealing your denial of Social Security disability benefits. Also explain whether you have provided additional supporting documentation. You want the reader to know immediately the letter’s purpose.


For example, you can write: “I am writing to appeal my denial of Social Security disability benefits. I have included additional information about my arthritis and have attached medical records from my treating physician.”

, Give enough background so that SSA understands how your symptoms developed and have worsened over time. Also correct any inaccuracies SSA made when summarizing your condition.You don’t have to write a lot, but one or two paragraphs should be sufficient.


For example, you can write, “My arthritis began four years ago, in May 2013. I continued working as a secretary and received initial treatments from my doctor. However, the pain and swelling increased to the point that I had to leave my job in April 2015. At that point, I found it difficult to dress myself and manipulate small objects, like buttons or zippers. Because work is important to me, I took a job as a greeter at a local department store, but by June 2016 the stiffness in my joints had spread to my knees and feet. I am unable to stand for long periods of time as a result.”

, Include a paragraph explaining how your disability prevents you from working any job—not just your old job. SSA might have determined that your experience and education qualify you for other work, and they will deny your application for benefits on those grounds.For example, a concert violinist with arthritis might be denied benefits if they can do other work.

, Explain generally what you have included and why it is relevant. Point out whether this is new information that SSA did not consider when reviewing your claim.For example, you might write, “I have enclosed updated medical records from my doctor which support my claim. These show that my condition has worsened since I first applied. My treating physician has also written a letter explaining my swelling and pain, and how my advanced arthritis has limited my movement. Since you did not have this information when you denied me, I thought it would be helpful.”

, In the final paragraph, ask SSA to reconsider your claim. Type “Sincerely” and then your name. Underneath your name, include your contact information, such as your telephone number and address.

, SSA will give you forms to fill out. There will be a few lines for you to explain why you should win your appeal. You should write, “see attached page” on these lines.Generally, you’ll fill out the following forms:


Disability Report of Appeals
Request for Reconsideration (Form SSA-561)

, You want to keep a copy of your letter and all forms you submit. Gather everything in an envelope and mail it to the office address provided to you. If you want, you can mail it certified mail, return receipt requested.


You can also call one or two weeks after you submitted your appeal to see if it was received., You have a right to several appeals. If you’re initially denied, then you must appeal to an administrative law judge. You should hire a lawyer at this stage. About 80% of all claimants have a lawyer, and you’ll increase your chances of success.


Contact your local or state bar association and ask for a referral to a Social Security attorney.Call them up and schedule a consultation.
SSD lawyers are paid on contingency, which means you don’t pay them unless they win your case. If you win, then the attorney will get 25% of any past-due benefits up to $6,000."

Polish your work.",How to Write Academically," Look up writing guides for the subject area you are going to write in. Different areas of study can have different styles of writing or expectations. A lot of these guides are available on university websites or if you're an enrolled student often are available to download from a university library websites.;
, Quickly the idea of having previous academic work on the internet for students to look at has exploded but so to has the cost of accessing this material. There are usually samples for free but it costs to view the whole thing. This exercise is to get you used to the structure, jargon and expression of academic writing so consider if you need to pay for it to achieve this goal.

, One of the biggest cruxes of academic writing is no matter what the discipline you are writing in, if you making a statement or assertion in your piece of writing you need academic sources to back you up. You cannot leave an assertion out there in an academic piece as your opinion you need sources, and it is far better to have these sources before you commence writing as it puts you in a good mind flow.

, Now you have a good sense of how others writes and through your research of your topic you should have a sense of what you want to say. Now it is time to put fingers to keyboard and start drafting. Remember this is only a draft so don't spend time polishing sentence structure we will get to that.

, Writing academically is an art as stated before and the art comes in saying in what you want to say in the style of the discipline you are studying. Some areas of study encourage robust explanations of things, which require a lot of words to say something short others require a succinct answer of a certain calibre which means saying something long very quickly. Make sure each sentence has a purpose and a reason for being there. It need to inform the reader of something or support something you have said. Words are precious in academic writing and need to be treated as such.

, This will be an invaluable tool while you are writing. When you think a sentence is too matter of fact or not matter of fact enough for the style of writing then a thesaurus can help hone the craft.

, Whenever you are making a statement or assertion about your area of study this is the appropriate place to insert the academic source you have to support this, it isn't important now to have referencing exact as we will come back to it, but as long as you know what source you need to use and the exact spot.

, If possible have another academic writer look over your work. If you have friends at university not in the same course ask them, of if your parents have an academic background try them. If you don't have these resources for a small fee you can post a job to review your paper on a freelancer website where academic writers can review your work. Getting a second opinion can be crucial in providing insight and picking up typos you or spell check miss.

, This is where the dreaded referencing comes in, the bane of any academic work but crucial to ensuring academic honesty and integrity in the work. This is also where it is recommended you read aloud your work because this highlights where certain words don't go together or don't say what you want them to. Also wherever possible once your polishing is done, sleep on it and have a look in the morning because a big break like that can refresh your perspective.

Perhaps you are writing an accomplishment report for a non-profit organization. You could summarize successes, such as the fact you organized events that benefit stakeholders, gained industry recognition, and created linkages with partners.You don’t need to bog the summary paragraph down with too many specifics. You are summarizing the key points here. You are providing the overview. Try not to make the report too long. Two pages is a good rule of thumb, unless the employer has a specific suggestion. Check with the employer to see if there is a recommended format.;
, Now you need to back up the key points in the opening summary with specifics further down in the report.


Use outline form. Organize different areas into their own sections and use sub-points beneath each header. For example, perhaps one of your sections is “events organized and held.”
Under such a header, you could list (with bullets or letters) a brief summary paragraph of each event held, its purpose, and how it advanced the group’s mission. Be specific here.

, Don’t just whip the report together. You want the report to look organized, in a professional font, and on nice paper.


Create a title, and center it at the top of the page. Use bold subheads to organize information.
At the top of the report, provide the basics. Present the dates that are covered by the accomplishment report and the name and title of the person who prepared it., It will be a lot easier if you gather accomplishments as they happen.


Keep a journal or folder in which you track accomplishments throughout the time period of study. This will make your life a lot easier when it’s time to sit down and write.If you don’t do this, you may find yourself forgetting important accomplishments that happened toward the beginning of the time period.

, You should remind people what the goals were at the beginning of the time period being studied. What were the objectives? What are the expectations of the job? If you don’t know, get your employer to provide them.


Then, explain how those were met with actual numbers. The point is to compare what your activities or results were against original projects.
For example, if you raised more money than projected, this will seem positive to investors or superiors. However, if you don’t provide the benchmark, it’s harder to assess whether it’s a success and to what degree.

, Include a few charts or graphs if you think they will help the reader visualize the data you are presenting.


Remember that some of the report readers are going to only scan it because they are probably busy. So visual aids can get your point across more effectively sometimes.
Don't inundate the reader with too many graphs though. Select 1 or 2 that emphasize the key points.

, This technique helps you document your accomplishment. It stands for Challenge. Action. Results. This will help you organize your accomplishments.


Figure out the challenge of the job. Then outline the action you have taken to address it. And then document your results. For example, let's say you are a manager in a restaurant. You could write: Challenge: Lines were becoming too long during dinner rush hour, with customer complaints increasing by 10 percent. Action: Push back 1 waitress' start time by 1 hour to increase support staff during rush hour. Result: Customer complaints about wait times dropped to 2, an 80 percent decline.
The key point is to be specific here. General accomplishments such as “I am a team player” aren’t as meaningful because anyone can say things like that. The key is to connect results to core issues and to demonstrate success through data and specifics., If your program involved some kind of data collection, it’s a good idea to briefly explain the methodology that you used in doing so.


Let the readers know the rationale for the chosen survey methodology. Explain the benefits and results of the survey. Why was this a credible method? For example, using the restaurant scenario, explain why it makes sense to use complaints as a methodology.Explain the survey dates and what you were trying to accomplish with the survey., To narrow down the accomplishments you want to present, think about what made you proudest during the time period. Maybe it was calming anxious visitors. Maybe it was coaching others. Don't just throw too many details at readers.Another method you can use to do this is the STAR method. This method involves briefly describing a situation and task, the action you took to accomplish it, and the results you achieved. As with the CAR method, the goal here is to link problems with results and to explain how you reached them.
Focus on such things are degree of difficulty, one of a kind, first-time, high-visibility, meeting deadlines, innovation, and your work’s scope and impact.
An example would be to explain that when you started as the branch manager, annual employee turnover was at 35 percent. You implemented an employee satisfaction survey, established mentorship for workers, and started a weekly staff meeting. As a result, employee turnover had dropped to 15 percent. As this example shows, the accomplishments don’t have to be excessively wordy as long as they provide the correct linkages.

, Don’t just say what your results are. You need to also explain why those accomplishments have value to your organization.


For example, let’s say you started holding staff meetings. So what? What value did that create for the organization? Think it through. If there is no concrete value, maybe you should highlight something else.
If staff meetings helped increase worker morale as evidenced in a decline in sick days, which saved the employer money, then you’ve demonstrated value.

, You’re defeating the purpose of an accomplishment report if you turn in something tossed together and unprofessional.


Proofread the report for grammar, punctuation, and spelling errors. Set it down for the night, and read it again in the morning. Don’t write the report at the last minute.
Print out a hard copy, and check that for proofing errors. Sometimes a person’s eyes get wedding to the computer screen to the degree that they skip over obvious errors.

, If there is something that you didn’t meet expectations on, it’s better not to dodge it. Don’t make it the central focus of the report, but do address it.


Handle the areas where you didn’t do so well with positive language. For example, focus on the concrete steps that you are taking to address the issue, rather than focusing on blame or excuses.
Don’t blame others in an accomplishment report. Stay focused on what you’ve done. Stay positive. Focus on the things that you or your group did well. Single out areas that you can tout.

, If you can be very specific, your responses will seem more credible. Whenever possible, back up what you say with something measurable.


Generic superlatives like “outstanding” or “dependable” aren’t very meaningful. Telling someone “I had an excellent year” is something that anyone can say.
Remember this phrase: Show don’t tell. Rather than telling people you had an excellent year, show them, through details and metrics, what you did that was excellent. Instead of saying you’re good at customer relations, cite the results of customer-satisfaction surveys, letters you received and lack of customer complaints.
Use numbers. Saying you handled a large staff doesn’t mean much if we don’t know how large it was. Use numbers to express the size of a budget and to outline the scope of duties.

, Do not exaggerate. Do not lie. If you’re caught doing it, you could get in big trouble.


The other problem with lying, even through obvious omission, is that you’re not going to end up being confident in the end, and you won’t be able to improve.
Rather, do an honest assessment of the time period at hand, both weaknesses as well as positives. Address the weaknesses. Just find a positive way to do it.

, Many business and technical writing classes suggest that you not use the pronoun “I.” You can do this in some cases in an accomplishment report though.


For example, you may want to say “I hired 100 people.” However, don’t forget the other people who contributed to the successes. Refer to the team when applicable.
You will gain points by seeming like you’re not arrogant. Vary sentence structure so every sentence doesn’t start with the word “I.”

Proofread carefully.",How to Write a Weekly Report," While you may be required to submit weekly reports as part of your job duties, keeping your job is not the purpose for the report itself. Determining why your employer wants weekly reports will help you decide exactly what information should go into it, and which items are the most important.Typically your report is supposed to update managers on the status of your projects or assist them in making decisions.
For example, if you are a retail store manager, you may be required to submit weekly reports that summarize your sales for the week. Your employer uses this report to evaluate performance, price points, and orders for your store.
If you're submitting weekly reports for an internship or research project, the purpose is to show your employer or instructor how much progress you've made and share any major breakthroughs or discoveries.;
, Identifying your audience is crucial to planning your report. Without knowing who will read your report (and why), you have no way of knowing which information is the most important.Knowing your audience also helps you understand how to write your report and what kind of language to use. For example, you'd write an entirely different report if your audience was a group of five-year-olds than if you were writing it for executives of a major corporation.
You also get a better idea of what your audience already knows, and what you need to explain more in-depth or provide additional resources. For example, if you're writing a weekly report on a legal issue that will be read by a group of lawyers, there's no need to provide an in-depth summary of the law. However, such a summary might be required if you were writing about the issue for executives or administrators with no legal training.
If your report is required in conjunction with an internship, research project, or other school activity, keep in mind that your audience is not your professor or instructor – even though you may be turning it in to them. To find your audience in this context, focus on the nature of your project and your discipline as a whole.

, While you should keep your report as concise as possible, it's still likely that your audience won't be reading the report in its entirety. In recognition of this, you need to put the most important information, or the bottom line, at the beginning of your report.For example, if the purpose of your report is to compare and contrast three different brands of equipment and recommend the one you think would be best for the company to use, your conclusion should go up front. Then you can go on to explain why.
Generally, you want the first page of your report to consist of a summary of results, recommendations, or conclusions. Use the rest of the report to dig deeper, and readers will go further if they feel the need or want to expand their understanding of your findings.

, In most cases, weekly reports are required for record-keeping reasons, and they'll be filed accordingly. It isn't common for a weekly report to be read all the way through in most contexts, and you shouldn't expect that it will.However, don't use this as an excuse to fake your way through your report or turn in sloppy work of poor quality. Your report should be a reflection of you and your work ethic. A sloppy report is likely to be noticed, and saying ""I knew you weren't actually going to read it"" is no excuse for a lackluster work product.
While you want the report as a whole to be high quality and well written, focus especially on the portions of the report that your audience is most likely to read. This typically is your executive summary and your conclusions or recommendations. These should be flawless.
Keep in mind that your employer isn't failing to read your report because they don't care, or because it's unimportant. People in high-ranking management or executive positions are very busy, and they are adept at gathering the information they need to make a decision efficiently. They won't read the whole report unless they have to – but they'll keep it in case they want to go back and look at it again later.

, Many companies have a standard format for their weekly reports, and the managers or executives may be accustomed to getting their information that way. Using a different format can cause frustration and confusion.This is particularly important with sales reports. Managers become accustomed to glancing at a report and knowing where on the page a particular figure or piece of information will be. If you use a different format, your report will be virtually useless for them because they'll have to actually read through it to find what they need.
Speak to administrative assistants and find out if there's a template you can use for formatting, so you don't have to create it from scratch in your word processing application. Many companies have a document template with the correct settings, including margins, tables, paragraph styles, and fonts.

, If you're printing up a paper document, or submitting the document digitally as an attachment, you are going to format your report differently than you would if it is simply to be included in the body of an email.For example, if you're sending your report as an attachment to an email, you should include your executive summary in the body of your email. That way your reader doesn't have to open the attachment to understand the thrust of your report.
If you're submitting a paper report, it's more likely that you will need to include a cover letter or title page so that your report can be properly identified and filed.
Regardless of how you submit your report, make sure your name is included on all pages, and that all pages are numbered in ""X of Y"" format. Pages can be easily separated, and people should be able to tell at a glance whether the whole report is there, and who the report came from.
You can easily include the required information as a header on each page. For example, your header might read ""Sally Sunshine Sales Report, Week 32, Page 3 of 7.""

, The executive summary is a brief summary of the entire report – typically only a paragraph or two, with a couple of sentences for each section of your report. The general idea is that an executive could read this summary and, provided it conformed to their original expectations regarding the issue, they could take action without having to read further.For the executive summary, it's especially important to use clear, concise language that is easy to read. Avoid jargon or terms of art that require any explanation, even if you know your audience is well-versed on those terms.
Write the executive summary last, after you've completed all other parts of your report. After all, you can't summarize something that hasn't been written yet. Even if you have a detailed outline from which you plan to write your report, things can change during the writing.

, Once you understand the format in which your report will be presented, draft an outline of the sections of your report that is consistent with the purpose of your report.Check your outline to make sure it flows logically from one section to the next, and make sure it's tailored to the specific audience you've identified for your report.
Your report typically will include an executive summary, an introduction, conclusions and recommendations, findings and discussion, and a list of references. You may include appendices of relevant data, as well as a table of contents for longer reports – but weekly reports typically won't be this lengthy.
Each section of your report deals with a single topic. Within that section, each paragraph discusses a single idea. For example, if you have a section in your weekly sales report titled ""Popular Children's Brands,"" you may have a separate paragraph for each brand. If you're dividing boy's and girl's clothing, you may have subsections (with appropriate subheadings) for each brand, then one paragraph discussing boy's clothing for that brand and another paragraph discussing girl's clothing.

, Shorter reports may not need a separate title page, but longer reports should have a single page that identifies you as the writer of the report and briefly describes its purpose.The title page is different from the executive summary, and essentially includes the information necessary for administrative purposes so the report can be filed properly.
Your employer may have a specific cover sheet that is required for weekly reports. If that's the case, make sure you use that exact format.
At a minimum, your title page should include the title or description of your report (such as ""Weekly Sales Report""), your name and the names of any other contributors to the report, the name of your company, and the date you completed or submitted the report.

, Your headings and subheadings allow the reader to quickly find specific sections of your report that interest them or that they want to read to gain more background information on your conclusions or recommendations.Make sure your headings and subheadings describe the content in that section or subsection directly and accurately.
For example, if you're drafting a weekly sales report, you may include sections on ""Trends in Women's Clothing,"" ""Trends in Menswear,"" and ""Popular Children's Brands."" Within those sections, you may have subheadings to highlight particular trends or popular brands.
Use the same grammatical construction for all headings so your report is logical and consistent. For example, if your first heading is ""Establishing a Foothold in Menswear,"" then your second heading should be ""Leading the Pack in Women's Clothing"" – not something like ""Women's Sales Figures.""

, Crisp writing with sentences structured in the standard ""subject-verb-object"" order demonstrate clarity of thought and confidence in your recommendations or conclusions.After you've drafted your report, do a read-through and get rid of all unnecessary language. Find the action of each sentence and put the doer of that action next to the verb. Think of every sentence as saying ""who does what.""
Delete redundancies and throat-clearing phrases such as ""the use of,"" ""for the purpose of,"" or ""in order to.""
You may think this style of writing seems boring, but the point of your weekly report is not to entertain. This style will most effectively get your points across and convey the information to your readers.

, Although you may be making recommendations, those recommendations should be based on factual evidence – not opinions or feelings. Persuade your readers with strong facts and clear writing.Avoid adjectives and other loaded words and phrases that have positive or negative connotations. Instead, focus on factual reasons.
For example, suppose in your weekly sales report you are recommending a promotion for one of your sales associates. Back up that recommendation with facts that demonstrate that employee's worthiness rather than subjective details or appeals to emotion. ""Sally consistently has the highest sales in our store, despite only working 15 hours a week"" is better than ""Sally is the nicest person on my staff and always goes the extra mile, even though she's had to limit her work hours to take care of her ailing mother.""

, When you're writing in active voice, you have one word that tells your reader what action is happening in the sentence – the verb. Use short, strong verbs that clearly describe the action taking place.Favor verbs that are simple. For example, ""use"" is better than ""utilize.""
Verbs describing thought processes – think, know, understand, believe – are sometimes necessary, but generally less robust than verbs that describe an action. You may have to dig into your statement and unpack it to make it actionable. For example, suppose you write ""I believe our sales will increase in the coming months."" Unpack that statement and figure out why you believe that. Then you can write an actionable sentence such as ""Historically, sales increase during the holiday season. I predict sales will increase in November and December.""
To keep your writing action-oriented, go through your report and try to eliminate prepositions and replace -ion words with stronger verbs. For example, ""consensus of opinion"" can simply be ""consensus,"" and if someone ""provides protection"" it's stronger to simply say they ""protect.""

, When you write with passive voice, you de-emphasize the doer of the action and emphasize the object of that action. In some situations this is necessary for political or diplomatic reasons, but most often it makes for muddy and confusing writing.Active voice gives credit to those who completed the action and shows the readers of the report who is responsible for that action. To understand why this is important, imagine you were reading an article about a destructive fire that said ""Fortunately, all the children were saved."" The identify of the person (or people) who saved those children is important. If that sentence read ""Local pastor John Goodlace entered the orphanage a dozen times and saved all the children,"" you now know who deserves credit for being a hero in those circumstances.
Active voice also is important to take ownership of actions that may have negative consequences. If you write ""Mistakes were made"" in your report, your employer is going to want to know who made those mistakes so they can be disciplined appropriately. If you made mistakes, taking ownership of those mistakes and admitting responsibility will go a long way.
To locate and eliminate passive voice in your writing, look for ""to be"" verbs. When you find them, identify the action in the sentence, figure out who's doing that action, and put them front-and-center.

, Charts and graphs are much easier to read and follow than a paragraph that provides the same information – particularly if the information you need to convey is number-heavy.Choose the correct visual element to convey the information to your reader in a way that is helpful to them and reflects the purpose of your report.
For example, you might choose a line graph to demonstrate the upward trend in sales of wool coats. This presentation would be more effective to show that increase than a table with the number of wool coat sales in each month, because the table would require the reader to look at all the numbers, compare them to each other, and recognize that they were increasing. All of that can be done with a simple glance at a line graph.
Keep in mind that the eye is drawn to visual elements. Make sure they're neat and clean, and positioned well on the page. Only include visual elements if they are essential to your recommendations or conclusions.

, Every industry or academic discipline has certain terms that seem inescapable, as well as buzzwords that become trendy based on popular books or articles. While occasionally they can be useful, typically they provide no value and fail to convey your message effectively.It may be helpful to write a list of common industry buzzwords so you don't overuse them in your reports. When your report is complete, you can simply search the document for those words and replace them as necessary.
Keep in mind that to your reader, excessive use of trendy buzzwords doesn't show that you're ""in the know"" about your particular field – in fact, quite the opposite. Executives and managers typically are older and have seen hundreds of these buzzwords come and go. Use them too frequently and they'll assume that you're lazy, don't really know what you're talking about, or are just trying to impress them.
You also want to avoid using overly complicated terms. For example, just because you're writing a report summarizing a legal issue doesn't mean you need to pepper that report with tons of legalese.

, If your report is full of typos and grammatical errors, it will be distracting to your reader and reflect poorly on you. Draft your report well before it's due so you have plenty of time to ensure it's properly proofread.Run a grammar and spell check on your word-processing application, but don't rely on them entirely. These programs will miss a lot of errors, especially typos which result in a homophonic error (such as typing ""hear"" when you mean ""here"").
Proofreading your report backwards is a good way to ensure you don't overlook errors. Especially if you're familiar with what you intended to write, you'll glide right past errors such as omitted words because your brain will automatically fill it in. This won't happen if you go backwards.
Reading your report out loud is another good way to catch errors and edit for style. If you find yourself stumbling as you read a particular sentence or paragraph, it's likely that portion of your report is difficult to read – your audience will mentally stumble too. Rework difficult sections so they flow better.

,, In addition to using spell check, make sure you proof for spelling and grammar mistakes by rereading.

, Make sure each point you make is backed up by evidence and thoughtful insights into the significance of the author's choices.

, Make sure you have followed all the guidelines of the assignment, including length, format and bibliography, if applicable.

Decide if the specification will be open or closed.,
Determine requirements.,
Ascertain your writing style.,
Develop your table of contents.,
List all requirements that must be met by the product or assembly being specified.,
Assign a title and control number with revision capability to the specification.

,
Determine the generating authority and the authority in charge of specification changes.,
Read the specification critically.",How to Write a Technical Specification,"


Consider an open specification. An open specification describes required performances without mandating how those performances are to be achieved. An open specification leaves a great deal of freedom to the entity that creates a product or assembly to satisfy the specifications. For example, a computer memory storage specification may not specify the exact medium used to store the data in order to meet the requirement.
Evaluate a closed specification. A closed specification describes not only required performances, but also tools, technologies or sub-assemblies that must be used in the design of a product or assembly to meet the specification. For example, a lifting assembly specification may require that hydraulic power be used by the product or assembly that is to meet the specification.;
, Evaluate all specifications to determine if they are necessary to the product or assembly.

,


Use short and direct sentences.
Avoid using ""it"" or ""which"", and clearly specify what is being referred to in the text.
Define the jargon and abbreviations that are common within the industry. To clearly define industry terms, add a definition section at the beginning of the specification.

, Order the contents such that general requirements about the product or assembly are presented first, followed by more specific subsection or sub-assembly specifications.

, Use the word ""shall"" to define a requirement. Requirements expressed as ""shall"" must be fully and properly met. Consider the following, and add other factors as required for the product or assembly to meet the needs of the specification.


Decide the acceptable dimensions and/or weight of the product.
Specify the full range of environmental conditions under which the product or assembly must meet the specification. If reduced performance of the product or assembly is acceptable at extreme temperatures and humidity, clearly note that in the specification.
Place tolerances on the performance of the product or sub-assembly.
Establish third party workmanship standards or safety standards that are to be applied to the product or assembly. This could include, for example, specifying that the product be UL or CSA certified.
Detail the technical specifications that the product or assembly must meet that are specific to that product or assembly. For example, an electronic assembly would have specifications for processing speed and product electronic interfaces, while a mechanical sub-assembly would have specifications for rigidity and load bearing capacity.
Specify a life for the product or assembly. If scheduled maintenance or calibration of the product or assembly is acceptable, the specification must state that. The specification must state the acceptable conditions under which said maintenance or calibration of the product or assembly is performed and how often said maintenance or calibration is performed.

,, Signature blocks should be included for these authorities.

, Pretend you are an inexperienced implementer or an implementer who seeks to minimize cost by circumventing the specification as much as possible. Modify the specification as needed to provide full requirements to the inexperienced implementer and to close loopholes on the circumventing implementer.

Compile a list of people to thank.,
Decide between cards or stationery.,
Choose blank thank you cards so you’ll have room to write.,
Keep it simple.,
Speak from the heart.,
Be specific.,
Avoid mentioning specific dollar amounts.,
Don’t feel obligated to write long, detailed notes.,
Try to send them within two weeks.,
Solicit help if you need it.,
Remember that thank you notes are not a requirement.",How to Write a Thank You Note After a Funeral," A potential list could include the director and staff of the funeral home, as well as people who sent flowers, prepared a meal, or otherwise helped arrange the service. Be sure to send a note of thanks to the officiant who conducted the services. If someone expressed an especially meaningful sentiment to you at the funeral, feel free to include that person on the list, as well.You will want to have a notepad and pen handy to jot down each person's name and what they contributed. It's likely to be too much to try to remember on your own. You can delegate this task to another family member, but be sure that they get the first and last names of donors and what they gave or did for the services.
People to include on your list are: pallbearers, officiants, musicians, those who made any kind of donation (food, memorial, or flowers), and those who helped you in a tangible way with the arrangements (contacting the funeral home or babysitting your children, for example).Keep in mind that you do not need to send thank you notes to every person who attended the funeral. Only those who went above and beyond in their service or assistance need thank you notes. Everyone else can simply be thanked verbally at the service.;
, There are many choices in thank you card design. Choose a card that looks elegant and understated. Or, if you prefer, you can buy nice stationery and fully hand-write your notes. The design, wording, and cards/stationery are ultimately matters of personal preference.Generally you should avoid sending an email or ecard in place of a handwritten thank you note, as these can seem impersonal.

, Regardless of what style of thank you note you select, look for blank cards or cards with minimal writing inside them. This way you will have space to write, and your thanks will stand out., Although etiquette is important, do not stress yourself out over these thank you notes. This is an instance of it being the thought that counts. Don’t worry about sending the wrong kind of card or choosing an ugly stationery. You are grieving, and these notes are simply a way for you to thank those who helped you during a tough time.

, Let the person know how much it meant to you that they were there for you during your time of need and that it meant a lot to you that they contributed in some way. There are many ways to approach the wording in your thank you notes, and all of them depend on what the person did for you and your loved ones. You might simply write two sentences thanking them for thinking of you at this time of great loss in your life and letting them know that it meant a lot to you.If you are especially close to the person you’re thanking, feel free to include a personal anecdote or story from the deceased’s life, if you share one with whomever you’re thanking. Personalizing your thank you notes is always a nice touch, but certainly don’t feel that you must do this.

, In your thank you notes, reference specifically what the person or group you’re thanking contributed after your loved one passed. Whether it was a meal, flowers, or a memorial donation in their honor, specify what you’re thanking them for and let them know that their thoughtfulness meant a lot to you.Begin your thank you note generally and build to more specifics. For example, good starting points would say something general, such as ""Thank you for your kindness during this difficult time"" or ""Our family appreciates your support during this difficult time.""Then you can build to how they helped you specifically. After thanking them for their kindness if they delivered a meal, for example, you might say something like ""The meal you sent us was wonderful because it made one less thing for me to worry about. We truly appreciated it."" The key is to thank them for their specific contribution., If you’re writing a thank you note to someone who gave a monetary donation in memory of your loved one, thank them for their donation, but don’t mention how much they gave. Simply say that you are thankful for their generosity in honoring your deceased loved one.Good phrasing for a monetary donation might read like ""Thank you for your generosity in our time of grief. The donation in honor of means a lot to us."" This way you convey your appreciation without mentioned how much they gave., Two or three sentences is sufficient to communicate your gratitude. The act of actually taking time to send individual thank you notes speaks volumes about how thankful you are. Don’t feel like you need to write long paragraphs to communicate your thankfulness.Sign the notes either with your own name or “Family of .”

, General etiquette rules dictate that you need to send thank you notes within two weeks of the funeral. Your friends and loved ones know you’re grieving, so if you take longer to send the notes out, don’t worry. A late thank you note is better than no thank you note at all., If the prospect of thanking dozens of people after the death of a loved one feels overwhelming, don’t hesitate to ask those around you for help. Even if it’s sending someone to the post office to buy you stamps or envelopes, delegate tasks to close friends or family members., Finally, don’t feel bad if you don’t get around to thank you notes. While they are a key component of good etiquette, during times of grief, etiquette can take a backseat to our mourning. So if you can’t emotionally get through the thank you notes, don’t beat yourself up for not finishing them.

Review and compile the information the manual needs to cover.,
Outline the flow of the training manual.,
Include a table of contents and an index.,
Write informative chapter previews.,
End each chapter with a summary.,
Create a group or task force to help you write the manual.",How to Write a Training Manual1," Never write a training manual from memory. Go through the various processes and knowledge points that your manual is going to cover and be sure you are clear on everything. Make a list of all the important information and refer to this list as you write the manual, double checking to include it all.Even skipping a small step may confuse your users, so pay attention. For example, you could be telling someone how to enter data into a spreadsheet, but you could easily forget to mention “click File to open a new spreadsheet.” Or when describing how to use a piece of machinery, you may forget to mention flipping a certain switch that’s vitally important.
If you don’t review everything and you do forget something, users are likely to become distressed because something isn't working right. This is not the outcome training should ever result in.;
, Use the list you have made and begin to organize the information into a logical sequence of chapters, sections, or parts. You’ll most likely begin with the basics and work up to more in-depth concepts.


Before you write any content, make sure you have a good idea of where all aspects of the manual will fit together. You don’t want to mention something from what you think is a previous section if the manual hasn’t covered that information yet.
If you can write self-contained sections that don’t build on each other, this may be the right approach in some situations.

, Even if the manual is meant to be read straight through from start to finish, these navigational sections will help people when they need to go back to refresh their memory and study what they learned. The table of contents should have all the chapters titles and any section headings it makes sense to include. Make the index as thorough as possible, giving people lots of things to find throughout the manual.


Word processing programs often have templates for these types of documents. You can also find helpful resources online for how to structure these elements.

, At the beginning of each chapter or section, write 2-3 paragraphs that outline what will be covered in that part of the manual. You could include a list of objectives for the section, keywords that are good to focus on, and mention quizzes or activities that will be included.


Chapter titles should help people know what they’ll find, but they should be able to skim the preview and make sure the chapter has what they need to know.

, It is always helpful to wrap up and review what has been covered in a chapter. It’s a summary, so you can’t mention everything. Try to highlight what you see as being the most vital information that people should take away from the chapter.


You can mention the objectives again to give people the chance to take stock of whether or not they learned what they were supposed to.

, You’ll succeed more easily at writing a training manual if you have people to help you do it. You need people to check for errors as you go, make sure that the content is understandable, and help you consider all aspects of what you are training for. Plus you can delegate some of the work and distribute it evenly.If you can’t have a group to help through the whole process, at least consider asking people a few things at different points as you go to get second opinions.

Write for and to your audience.,
Include problem-solving scenarios and discussion topics.,
Enhance the manual with videos or audio recordings.",How to Write a Training Manual2," Make sure you are clear on who the audience is. Consider if they have a knowledge base or are starting completely fresh. This will give you an idea of how broad or specific you need to be throughout the manual. When it makes sense, write directly to the audience saying, “When you get to this step…” rather than something like, “When a person gets to this step.”If you are training employees on a brand new software that no one has seen, it’s safe to assume they won’t know anything. If you are training for sales techniques at a clothing store, you don’t need to explain what pants and shirts are.
Don’t patronize people by over explaining simple concepts, but also don’t assume they know something that they may not know.

, Not everyone can learn by reading 20 pages of text, so include ways for users to apply what they read and get hands on experience. Give a scenario and ask the reader to solve a problem of some kind. Allow for discussion and collaboration among trainees. You want to cater to different learning styles so the manual is useful for as many people as possible.You can’t fit every employee perfectly, but if you only use one approach you aren’t likely to get through to very many at all. The goal of the training manual is to help employees learn what they need to know, so aim to make it easy for as many people as possible.

, If you are writing a printed manual, consider whether or not you can give trainees access to extra materials, such as videos or audio recordings. For learners who would struggle to read an entire manual, you can work to ensure they still learn what they need to. Many times the written manual will be the primary training tool, but a few extras may make a big difference.This may be affected by the type of content your manual includes and may not be applicable in all cases. Take stock of the specifics of your manual and judge whether or not extra materials could be created.

"
"
Include a section for user notes.,
Utilize images and graphics.,
Include checklists of important steps.,
Include activities and quizzes that measure learning.",How to Write a Training Manual3," As you are writing each section of the manual, people using the manual will be trying to take in a lot of information. When you purposefully include blank spaces for writing notes, you encourage the users to jot down what they are learning. This will increase the amount of information that they retain.Notes sections would be good alongside most sections of text, but you could also make a separate notes section at the end of chapters and the end of the whole manual. This helps people avoid having separate notebooks that they might lose track of.

, Any time you can show the reader something visual, it can have an impact on how much they understand. You don’t want to clutter your manual with too much, but use visuals if you can. You can have screenshots of steps in computer work. You can include charts of important data. Pictures of tools or machinery the person will use are good, too.There really is no limit to what types of visual aids you could include, so think about what you are training for and what would be most helpful for the user to see.

, For many manuals, you’ll be detailing the steps of various processes, and checklists are a great way to sum things up. When a user needs to refer back to a section that includes specific steps, the checklist will refresh their memory and can be checked much more quickly than multiple paragraphs of text.It might even be useful to make these pages easy to tear out so users could keep the checklist handy at later times when they are working on tasks.
Checklists could include materials needed, sections for before, during, and after completing a task, or how to evaluate work once it is done.

, You want to ensure that users of your manual are learning as they go, so write up small tests of their knowledge. Include the answers in a separate spot so they can check how they did. You could have multiple choice questions, fill in the blank and matching, or scenarios for problem solving.These would be separate from any official testing you would have employees take after training is complete. The purpose would be to help them along the way in gauging how much their are learning.

Identify the employment relationship.,
Review the contract.,
Gather evidence of the grounds for termination.,
Seek the advice of a lawyer.,
Use company letterhead.,
Explain the change in the employment relationship.,
Include the reasons for the change.,
Address unsatisfactory performance with specifics.,
Include information on the final paycheck.,
Ask for the return of company property.,
Remind the employee of nondisclosure or non-competition agreements.,
Offer to provide recommendations.,
Add a space to sign.,
Include necessary attachments.",How to Write a Termination Letter," Most employees in the United States are considered “at will.” This means that they may be discharged for any reason at all.Apart from state and federal laws that protect against retaliation or discrimination (on race, gender, sexual orientation, age, religion, etc.), an “at will” employee has no legal protection against termination.


To understand federal anti-discrimination law, you can read the summaries provided by the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.
Your state or municipality may also have anti-discrimination laws. You should try to find them by searching online or by meeting with a lawyer.;
, One important exception to the “at will” doctrine is an employee who works under a contract. Contracts often include provisions stating that an employee can be terminated for “good cause” or “just cause.” A list of examples or circumstances considered may also be included. You should review the contract to see for what circumstances termination is allowed.


Your employee may also be covered by a collective bargaining agreement. If so, locate a copy of the agreement and review the termination provisions. Typically, a collective bargaining agreement lays out a multi-step process you must follow when terminating employment.
Sometimes, an employee can claim that an “implied contract” has been created during the work relationship. If one exists, then you may be able to terminate employment only for “good cause.” A court will look at a variety of factors to determine if an implied contract exists:duration of employment
job promotions
employee handbooks, letters, policy manuals, or other documents which contain language creating a promise of continued employment
an employer’s assurances of continued employment
industry practices



, Even if you have an “at will” employee, you will still want to make sure that you have a paper trail supporting your decision to terminate in case the employee claims illegal discrimination.


Look at your past feedback. See if you have mentioned in previous performance reviews the problem that is the reason of termination. If you have given nothing but glowing reviews, and the reason for the termination isn’t a need to downsize, then you might want to hold off on terminating them until you can give more signals that performance is subpar.Do your own investigation into the employee’s performance. If you have a supervisor pushing to have the employee fired, you shouldn’t just take his or her word for it.Look at the employee’s file and note any commendations, reprimands, and performance reviews or comments.
Identify your valid reason for the firing. You should be able to put down in words why you are firing the employee. If you just “feel” that the employee is a bad “fit,” then try to come up with specific examples of how the employee doesn’t fit and why you think the employee is harming the company. By being able to articulate grounds for dismissal, you can insulate yourself from a wrongful termination claim.

, State law provides many requirements that you must abide when terminating an employee. Some states, for example, have implied a covenant of good faith and fair dealing into every contract. To make sure that you are following all applicable laws, you may want to seek out the advice of a qualified employment attorney.


To satisfy the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, parties must refrain from doing anything that makes it impossible for the other party to fulfill its duties. Furthermore, each party must do everything reasonable to fulfill its own obligations.The concept is sufficiently elastic that you should get a legal opinion that you are complying with it.
To find a qualified attorney, visit your state’s bar association, which should run a referral program. For a link to your state’s bar association, visit this website.
Once you find an attorney, check their qualifications by visiting their website. Look for an attorney who has experience advising clients on employment matters.
Some states also award certification in employment law. This certification is not made available to all lawyers. Instead, a lawyer must have devoted a significant percentage of his or her practice to employment law, have taken special continuing legal education courses, and have received recommendations from peers or judges. Often, the lawyer must also pass an exam.

, Space down two lines and insert the date. Then space down two lines and add the words “Personal and Confidential” beneath the date in bold letters. Space down and enter the employee’s address, aligned on the left.If your business address is not part of the letterhead, then insert your address at the top of the page, two lines above the date. Line it up flush with the left hand margin, as you did the employee’s address.

, You should begin the letter by explicitly stating whether the employee is being terminated or laid off from the position. You should also state the date in which the termination or layoff is effective.Sample language could be: “I regret to inform you that your employment with is terminated effective as of .” Or “I regret to inform you that you will be laid off effective as of….”, In the second paragraph, you should explain the reason for the change. For example, if the company is struggling financially, you might want to lay off the employee to save money. Alternately, if the employee is a poor performer, you would want to note that as well.


You might want to state, “Unfortunately, your performance has been unsatisfactory.”
If the lay-off is for economic reasons, you can state, “The current economic environment has forced us to make difficult downsizing decisions.”

, You can go into additional detail about how the employee’s performance has been unsatisfactory. State specifics, such as the date of performance reviews and what deficiencies were noted. You can also attach copies of anything that supports you, such as prior performance reviews, written reprimands, or customer complaints.If the employee is being terminated for inadequate performance, you could write: “Your employment is terminated due to repeated failure to perform the duties of your job. When you were hired, you were provided a description of your Job Duties. Since then, you have been provided with periodic feedback and training. However, there have been continued deficiencies in your performance and a failure to follow directives. This has been discussed with you numerous times: on . No improvement has resulted on your part.”If the employee is being fired for poor attendance, you could write: “Your employment is terminated due to your repeated tardiness and absences. This was discussed with you repeatedly on . On those dates, I again reminded you of our policies regarding attendance.”If the employee is being laid off for economic reasons, feel free to state that you are thankful for the good work the employee performed.

, If you are offering the employee severance, then you should also state the details here.


For example, if the employee has a final paycheck coming, write: “Your final check will include payment for any accrued, unused hours of vacation leave up to the maximum of .” Then provide contact information if the employee needs to talk over compensation.You may wish to provide severance, either because it is contractually required or because you are willing to provide it in exchange for a release from liability.If you wish to provide severance in exchange for a release, you should contact your attorney. Releases must be drafted carefully, and you will want an attorney to help you describe the severance and any obligations on behalf of the employee in order to qualify.

, If necessary, you should also explain when and how the employee can return company property—office keys, laptops, phones, pagers, etc. You may want to ask the employee to contact you to set up a time to return all company property.


For example, you could write, “You may contact me at to arrange a time to return your and collect any personal items left in your workspace.”, As a condition of employment, the employee may have signed a nondisclosure (NDA) or non-competition agreement. Review the employment contract.


If the employee agreed to either, you should copy and paste in the terms of the NDA or the non-competition agreement. Preface this information by stating, “Per the employment contract signed , you agreed to the following:”

, If you are parting on good terms, then you may want to conclude the letter by offering to provide a positive recommendation for the employee. You can also offer to provide job placement assistance, if you want.


Type: “Thank you for your hard work. I am happy to provide a positive reference for future jobs. Have prospective employers contact me at . I am also willing to provide a written reference if that is preferred.”
Alternately, you may want to simply state that if contacted about a reference you will only provide dates of employment and job title., You will sign the letter, but ideally you will get the employee to sign a copy as well. Accordingly, you should insert a line for your signature. Also include a line for the employee to acknowledge that he or she received the letter.


Above the employee’s signature line, you could write: “By my signature below, I acknowledge that I received a copy of this notice. My signature does not necessarily indicate agreement with the contents.”, State or federal law often dictates that supplemental information be provided with the letter, often in the form of hand-outs. For example, some states, like California, require employers to provide a pamphlet, “For Your Benefit,” to all discharged or laid-off employees.


Some states require that an employer provide a notice immediately as to a change in employment status. This notice is quite short and not equivalent to a full termination letter. A sample notice from California is here.
Provide information about COBRA rights. Additionally, you must provide discharged employees with notification of all continuation, disability extension, and conversion coverage options under any employer-sponsored coverage for which they might be eligible.Include anything else recommended by your lawyer in order to comply with state or federal law.
Finally, include anything referred to in the letter itself, such as copies of performance reviews or written reprimands.

Keep your visual elements neat and clean.,
Distribute information appropriately.,
Include raw data in appendices.",How to Write a Statistical Report," If you've never written a statistical report before, you might benefit from looking at other statistical reports that you can use as a guide to format your own. You also get a good idea of how your finished report should look.If you're completing your report for a class, your instructor or professor may be willing to show you some reports submitted by previous students if you ask.
University libraries also have copies of statistical reports created by students and faculty researchers on file. Ask the research librarian to help you locate one in your field of study.
You also may be able to find statistical reports online that were created for business or marketing research, as well as those filed for government agencies.
Be careful following samples exactly, particularly if they were completed for research in another field. Different fields of study have their own conventions regarding how a statistical report should look and what it should contain. For example, a statistical report by a mathematician may look incredibly different than one created by a market researcher for a retail business.;
, Statistical reports typically are typed single-spaced, using a font such as Arial or Times New Roman in 12-point size. If you have an assignment sheet that describes the formatting requirements, follow those exactly.You typically want to have 1-inch margins around all sides of your report. Be careful when adding visual elements such as charts and graphs to your report, and make sure they don't bleed over the margins or your report may not print properly and will look sloppy.
You may want to have a 1.5-inch margin on the left-hand side of the page if you anticipate putting your study into a folder or binder, so all the words can be read comfortably when the pages are turned.
Don't double-space your report unless you're writing it for a class assignment and the instructor or professor specifically tells you to do so.
Use headers to add the page number to every page. You may also want to add your last name or the title of the study along with the page number.

, Different fields use different citation methods to reference articles, books, and other materials you used in your research. Even if you're more comfortable with another citation method, use the one most common in the field of your research.Citation methods typically are included in style manuals, which not only detail how you should cite your references but also have rules on acceptable punctuation and abbreviations, headings, and the general formatting of your report.
For example, if you're writing a statistical report based on a psychological study, you typically must use the style manual published by the American Psychological Association (APA).
Your citation method is all the more important if you anticipate your statistical report will be published in a particular trade or professional journal.

, A cover sheet provides the title of your statistical report, your name, and the names of any other people who substantially contributed to your research or to the report itself. It provides a neat presentation for your final report.If you're creating your statistical report for a class, a cover sheet may be required. Check with your instructor or professor or look on your assignment sheet to find out whether a cover sheet is required and what should be included on it.
For longer statistical reports, you may also want to include a table of contents. You won't be able to format this until after you've finished the report, but it will list each section of your report and the page on which that section starts.

, Depending on how your report will be used and who will read it, headings can make your report easier to read. This is particularly true if you believe your readers will be more likely to skim the report or jump around between sections.If you decide to create section headings, they should be bold-faced and set off in such a way that they stand out from the rest of the text. For example, you may want to center bold-faced headings and use a slightly larger font size.
Make sure a section heading doesn't fall at the bottom of the page. You should have at least a few lines of text, if not a full paragraph, below each section heading before the page break.

, When you draft your report in a word processing program, it typically will look the same on a sheet of paper as it does on your screen. But visual elements in particular may not line up the way you want them.Check the margins around visual elements and make sure the text lines up and is not too close to the visual element. You want it to be clear where the text ends and the words associated with the visual element (such as the axis labels for a graph) begin.
Visual elements can cause your text to shift, so you'll need to double-check your section headings after your report is complete and make sure none of them are at the bottom of a page.
Where possible, you also want to change your page breaks to eliminate situations in which the last line of a page is the first line of a paragraph, or the first line of a page is the last line of a paragraph. These are difficult to read.

, The abstract is a brief description, typically no longer than 200 words or so, that summarizes all elements of your project, including the research methods used, the results, and your analysis.Avoid overly scientific or statistical language in your abstract as much as possible. Your abstract should be understandable to a larger audience than those who will be reading the entire report.
It can help to think of your abstract as an elevator pitch. If you were in an elevator with someone and they asked you what your project was about, your abstract is what you would say to that person to describe your project.
Even though your abstract appears first in your report, it's often easier to write it last, after you've completed the entire report.

, The introduction of your report identifies the purpose of your research or experiment. Explain to the reader why you undertook this particular project, including the questions you hoped to answer.Aim for clear and concise language to set the tone for your report. Put your project in layperson's terms rather than using overly statistical language, regardless of the target audience of your report.
If your report is based on a series of scientific experiments or data drawn from polls or demographic data, state your hypothesis or expectations going into the project.
If other work has been done in the field regarding the same subject or similar questions, it's also appropriate to include a brief review of that work after your introduction. Explain why your work is different or what you hope to add to the existing body of work through your research.

, Use this section of your report to provide a detailed account of how you went about your project, including the nature of any experiments conducted or the methods you used to collect raw data.Include a description of any particular methods you used to track results, particularly if your experiments or studies were longer-term or observational in nature.
If you had to make any adjustments during the development of the project, identify those adjustments and explain what required you to make them.
List any software, resources, or other materials you used in the course of your research. If you used any textbook material, a reference is sufficient – there's no need to summarize that material in your report.

, Report the specific findings of your research or experiment. This section of your report should be facts only, without any analysis or discussion of what those facts might mean. Start with your main results, then include subsidiary results or interesting facts or trends you discovered.
Generally you want to stay away from reporting results that have nothing to do with your original expectations or hypotheses. However, if you discovered something startling and unexpected through your research, you may want to at least mention it.
This typically will be the longest section of your report, with the most detailed statistics. It also will be the driest and most difficult section for your readers to get through, especially if they are not statisticians.
Small graphs or charts often show your results more clearly than you can write them in text.

, This section provides analysis and defines your results within the overall context of your field or industry. You also should indicate to the reader whether your findings matched your initial hypotheses.When you get to this section of your report, leave the heavy, statistical language behind. This section should be easy for anyone to understand, even if they skipped over your results section.
If any additional research or study is necessary to further explore your hypotheses or answer questions that arose in the context of your project, describe that as well.

, If your findings relate to or contradict any previous studies, talk about this at the end of your report. This is also where you'll address any problems you might have had conducting your study.It is often the case that you see things in hindsight that would have made data-gathering easier or more efficient. This is the place to discuss those. Since the scientific method is designed so that others can repeat your study, you want to pass on to future researchers your insights.
Any speculation you have, or additional questions that came to mind over the course of your study, also are appropriate here. Just make sure you keep it to a minimum – you don't want your personal opinions and speculation to overtake the project itself.

, Immediately following your statistical report, you should include a table or list of any books or articles you used in completing your research, or that you referred to in the report itself.For example, if you compared your study to a similar study conducted in another city the year before yours, you would want to include a citation to that report in your references.
Cite your references using the appropriate citation method for your discipline or field of study.
Avoid citing any references that you did not mention in your report. For example, you may have done some background reading in preparation for your project. However, if you didn't end up directly citing any of those sources in your report, there's no need to list them in your references.

, Your report will have very little value if nobody who reads it understands what you did or what you achieved. Even if you're writing your statistical report as an assignment for a class, you likely should write it for a more general audience.Avoid trade ""terms of art"" or industry jargon if your report will be read mainly by people outside your particular industry.
Make sure the terms of art and statistical terms that you do use in your report are used correctly. For example, you shouldn't use the word ""average"" in a statistical report because people often use that word to refer to different measures. Instead, use ""mean,"" ""median,"" or ""mode"" – whichever is correct.

, Providing a distinct label and title for each visual element allows you to refer to it in your text. Using spatial references in your text can cause problems since your report may not print the same way.This is particularly important if you're submitting your report for publication in a trade journal. If the pages are different sizes than the paper you print your report on, your visual elements won't line up the same way in the journal as they do in your manuscript.
This also can be a factor if your report will be published online, since different display sizes can cause visual elements to display differently.
The easiest way to label your visual elements is ""Figure,"" followed by a number. Then you simply number each element sequentially in the order in which they appear in your report.
Your title describes the information presented by the visual element. For example, if you've created a bar graph that shows the test scores of students on the chemistry class final, you might title it ""Chemistry Final Test Scores, Fall 2016.""

, If your visual elements look sloppy and cluttered on the page, they will be difficult for your readers. Visual elements should enhance the readability of your report, not detract from it.Make sure each visual element is large enough in size that your readers can see everything they need to see without squinting. If you have to shrink down a graph to the point that readers can't make out the labels, it won't be very helpful to them.
Create your visual elements using a format that you can easily import into your word-processing file. Importing using some graphics formats can distort the image or result in extremely low resolution.

, When creating a chart or graph, it should be readable and easily understandable at a glance. If it's too cluttered with data, or the range is too broad, your readers won't get much out of it.For example, if you have hundreds of samples, your x axis will be cluttered if you display each sample individually as a bar. However, you can move the measure on the y axis to the x axis, and use the y axis to measure the frequency.
When your data include percentages, only go out to fractions of a percentage if your research demands it. If the smallest difference between your subjects is two percentage points, there's no need to display more than the whole percentage. However, if the difference between your subjects comes down to hundredths of a percent, you would need to display percentages to two decimal places so the graph would show the difference.
For example, if your report includes a bar graph of the distribution of test scores for a chemistry class, and those scores are 97.56, 97.52, 97.46, and 97.61, your x axis would be each of the students and your y axis would start at 97 and go up to 98. This would highlight the differences in the students' scores.

, Particularly for extensive projects, your appendices may be the lengthiest part of your report. You should include all raw data, including copies of interview questions, data sets, and statistical results.Be careful that your appendix does not overwhelm your report. You don't necessarily want to include every data sheet or other document you created over the course of your project.
Rather, you only want to include documents that reasonably expand and lead to a further understanding of your report.
For example, when describing your methods you state that a survey was conducted of students in a chemistry class to determine how they studied for the final exam. You might include a copy of the questions the students were asked in an appendix. However, you wouldn't necessarily need to include a copy of each student's answers to those questions.

Buy cards with envelopes.,
Write with pen.,
Address the recipient(s) by name.,
Thank the recipient(s) for something specific.,
If possible, express something positive about the recipient(s).,
Make your gratitude clear.,
Conclude the note.",How to Write a Sympathy Thank You," The colors and design should generally be subdued. Since you are writing a personalized note, choose a blank card or one with very little text; an abundance of trite ready-made phrases will depersonalize your gesture of thanks.


Alternatively, you can send a plain note. This is especially appropriate if you feel you have a lot to say. However, if you’re at a loss for words, stick with a store-bought card, as they don’t lend themselves to a lot of writing.
While muted cards are ""normal"" and socially acceptable, consider using blank cards that reflect the personality of the person whose life is being remembered. For example, tasteful images of a motorbike for someone who loved riding.

Do not email a sympathy thank-you. Though this is the most convenient way to contact people, it is also extremely impersonal and will be considered a serious faux pas.

, Whether you’ve chosen a card or a letter, hand-write the note in pen rather than typing it or writing in pencil. Again, this will give the thank-you a more intimate and polished feel.

, Opening with “Dear ___” breaks the ice and keeps the message intimate.

, This can be an actual item (flowers, a card), a gesture of condolence (attending a funeral, making a heartfelt phone call), or simply emotional support. Mentioning specifics demonstrates that you noticed and appreciated the effort made.

, If someone has passed, for example, you might mention how much the recipient(s) meant to the deceased. If the recipient(s) attended an event, you might mention how much their being there gave you strength.


If you can’t think of something nice to say about the recipient(s), compliment the present/gesture instead. For example, say that gift comforted you at a dark time, that the flowers were the deceased’s favorite, etc.

, Begin wrapping up your thoughts by offering a general expression of appreciation. State how much their kindness or condolences have meant to you and your family.

, Write “Sincerely,” “With love,” “Warm regards,” “From our hearts,” etc. before signing your name(s).

Choose your format.,
Consider your audience.,
Consider your knowledge.,
Decide between a short or long-form SOP.,
Keep your SOP purpose in mind.,
Cover the necessary material.,
For the procedure itself, make sure you cover the following:



Scope and applicability.,
Make your writing concise and easy to read.,
If necessary, interview the personnel involved in the process on how they execute the task.,
Break up large chunks of text with diagrams and flowcharts.,
Make sure each page has control document notation.,
Test the procedure.,
Have the SOP reviewed by those who actually do the procedure.,
Have the SOP reviewed by your advisors and the Quality Assurance team.,
Once approved, start implementing your SOP.",How to Write a Standard Operating Procedure," There is no right or wrong way to write an SOP. However, your company probably has a number of SOPs you can refer to for formatting guidelines, outlining how they prefer it done. If that's the case, use the pre-existing SOPs as a template. If not, you have a few options:



A simple steps format. This is for routine procedures that are short, have few possible outcomes, and are fairly to the point. Apart from the necessary documentation and safety guidelines, it's really just a bullet list of simple sentences telling the reader what to do.

A hierarchical steps format. This is usually for long procedures -- ones with more than ten steps, involving a few decisions to make, clarification and terminology. This is usually a list of main steps all with substeps in a very particular order.

A flowchart format. If the procedure is more like a map with an almost infinite number of possible outcomes, a flowchart may be your best bet. This is the format you should opt for when results aren't always predictable.;
, There are three main factors to take into account before writing your SOP:



Your audience's prior knowledge. Are they familiar with your organization and its procedures? Do they know the terminology? Your language needs to match the knowledge and investment of the reader.

Your audience's language abilities. Is there any chance people who don't speak your language will be ""reading"" your SOP? If this is an issue, it's a good idea to include lots of annotated pictures and diagrams.

The size of your audience. If multiple people at once are reading your SOP (those in different roles), you should format the document more like a conversation in a play: user 1 completes an action, followed by user 2, and so on and so forth. That way, each reader can see how he or she is an integral cog in the well-oiled machine.

, What it boils down to is this: Are you the best person to be writing this? Do you know what the process entails? How it could go wrong? How to make it safe? If not, you may be better off handing it over to someone else. A poorly-written -- or, what's more, inaccurate -- SOP will not only reduce productivity and lead to organizational failures, but it can also be unsafe and have adverse impacts on anything from your team to the environment. In short, it's not a risk you should take.


If this is a project you've been assigned that you feel compelled (or obligated) to complete, don't shy away from asking those who complete the procedure on a daily basis for help. Conducting interviews is a normal part of any SOP-creating process.

, If you're writing or updating an SOP for a group of individuals that are familiar with protocol, terminology, etc., and just would benefit from a short and snappy SOP that's more like a checklist, you could just write it in short-form.


Apart from basic purpose and relevant information (date, author, ID#, etc.), it's really just a short list of steps. When no details or clarification are needed, this is the way to go.

, What's obvious is that you have a procedure within your organization that keeps on getting repeated over and over and over. But is there a specific reason why this SOP is particularly useful? Does it need to stress safety? Compliance measures? Is it used for training or on a day-to-day basis? Here are a few reasons why your SOP is necessary to the success of your team:


To ensure compliance standards are met
To maximize production requirements
To ensure the procedure has no adverse impact on environment
To ensure safety
To ensure everything goes according to schedule
To prevent failures in manufacturing
To be used as training document

If you know what your SOP should emphasize, it'll be easier to structure your writing around those points. It's also easier to see just how important your SOP is.



, In general, technical SOPs will consist of four elements apart from the procedure itself:



Title page. This includes 1) the title of the procedure, 2) an SOP identification number, 3) date of issue or revision, 4) the name of the agency/division/branch the SOP applies to, and 5) the signatures of those who prepared and approved of the SOP. This can be formatted however you like, as long as the information is clear.

Table of Contents. This is only necessary if your SOP is quite long, allowing for ease of reference. A simple standard outline is what you'd find here.

Quality Assurance/Quality Control. A procedure is not a good procedure if it cannot be checked. Have the necessary materials and details provided so the reader can make sure they've obtained the desired results. This may or may not include other documents, like performance evaluation samples.

Reference. Be sure to list all cited or significant references. If you reference other SOPs, be sure to attach the necessary information in the appendix.

Your organization may have different protocol than this. If there are already preexisting SOPs you can refer to, abandon this structure and adhere to what's already in place.



, In other words, describe the purpose of the process, its limits, and how it's used. Include standards, regulatory requirements, roles and responsibilities, and inputs and outputs.

Methodology and procedures. The meat of the issue -- list all the steps with necessary details, including what equipment needed. Cover sequential procedures and decision factors. Address the ""what ifs"" and the possible interferences or safety considerations.

Clarification of terminology. Identify acronyms, abbreviations, and all phrases that aren't in common parlance.

Health and safety warnings. To be listed in its own section and alongside the steps where it is an issue. Do not gloss over this section.

Equipment and supplies. Complete list of what is needed and when, where to find equipment, standards of equipment, etc.

Cautions and interferences. Basically, a troubleshooting section. Cover what could go wrong, what to look out for, and what may interfere with the final, ideal product.

Give each of these topics their own section (usually denoted by numbers or letters) to keep your SOP from being wordy and confusing and to allow for easy reference.
This is by no means an exhaustive list; this is just the tip of the procedural iceberg. Your organization may specify other aspects that require attention.



, Odds are your audience isn't choosing to read this for fun. You want to keep it short and clear -- otherwise their attention will stray or they'll find the document formidable and hard to grasp. In general, keep your sentences as short as possible.



Here's a bad example: Make sure that you clean out all of the dust from the air shafts before you begin using them.

Here's a good example: Vacuum all dust from air shafts before use.
In general, don't use ""you."" It should be implied. Speak in the active voice and start your sentences with command verbs.

, The last thing you want to do is write an SOP that is just plain inaccurate. You're compromising the safety of your team, their efficacy, their time, and you're taking an established process and not paying it any mind -- something your teammates may find a little offensive. If you need to, ask questions! You want to get this right.


Of course, if you don't know, ask multiple sources, covering all roles and responsibilities. One team member may not follow standard operating procedure or another may only be involved in a portion of the deed.

, If you have a step or two that are particularly intimidating, make it easy on your readers with some sort of chart or diagram. It makes it easier to read and gives the mind a brief hiatus from trying to make sense of it all. And it'll be appear more complete and well-written for you.


Don't include these just to bulk up your SOP; only do this if necessary or if trying to bridge a language gap.

, Your SOP is probably one of many SOPS -- because of this, hopefully your organization has some type of larger database cataloguing everything within a certain reference system. Your SOP is part of this reference system, and therefore needs some type of code in order to be found. That's where the notation comes in.


Each page should have a short title or ID #, a revision number, date, and ""page # of #"" in the upper right hand corner (for most formats). You may or may not need a footnote (or have these in the footnote), depending on your organization's preferences.

, If you don't want to test your procedure, you probably haven't written it well enough. Have someone with a limited knowledge of the process (or a person representative of the normal reader) use your SOP to guide them. What issues did they run across? If any, address them and make the necessary improvements.


It's best to have a handful of people test your SOP. Different individuals will have different issues, allowing for a wide variety of (hopefully useful) responses
Be sure to test the procedure on someone who's never done it before. Anyone with prior knowledge will be relying on their knowledge to get them through and not your work, thus defeating the purpose.

, At the end of the day, it doesn't really matter what your bosses think of the SOP. It's those who actually do the work that it matters to. So before you submit your work to the higher ups, show your stuff to those that'll be doing (or that do) the job. What do they think?


Allowing them to get involved and feel like they're part of the process will make them more likely to accept this SOP you're working on. And they'll inevitably have some great ideas!

, Once the team gives you the go ahead, send it to your advisors. They'll probably have less input on the actual content itself, but they'll let you know if it meets formatting requirements, if there's anything you missed, and the protocol for making it all official and input into the system.


Route the SOP for approvals using document management systems to ensure audit trails of the approvals. This will vary from organization to organization. Basically, you want everything to meet guidelines and regulations.
Signatures will be necessary and most organizations nowadays have no problem accepting electronic signatures.

, This may involve executing a formal training for the affect personnel (e.g. classroom training, computer-based training, etc.) or it may mean your paper is hung up in the bathroom. Whatever it is, get your work out there! You worked for it. Time for recognition!


Be sure your SOP remains current. If it ever gets outdated, update it, get the updates re-approved and documented, and redistribute the SOP as necessary. Your team's safety, productivity, and success matter on it.

Include any necessary miscellaneous provisions.,
Sign the agreement.",How to Write a Sponsorship Contract1," Include the full legal name of the business as well as the non-profit organization, along with a full description of the non-profit organization's tax-exempt status if applicable.


This section also should include basic contact information for each party to the agreement, such as addresses and phone numbers.;
, Ideally the sponsorship should have a concrete goal beyond the business's desire to improve its reputation and the non-profit's need for fundraising.Discussions between non-profit and business executives can identify realistic objectives to complete using the business's contribution., Typically the corporate sponsor provides a specific amount of money in exchange for the ability to advertise or sell its products at the non-profit's event.For example, suppose a non-profit organization that fights cancer is organizing a 5k run/walk in your city. You own a grocery store, so you offer to sponsor the race. In exchange, the organization allows you to identify yourself in your advertisements as the ""exclusive grocery store"" of the race., The non-profit must use the money received through corporate sponsorship in the same way it would use any other donation.


The non-profit organization doesn't have to pay any income taxes on corporate sponsorship income provided the corporate sponsor doesn't receive a substantial benefit in return for its money. Essentially, this means the non-profit can't give the corporation anything that has any real value, aside from the free advertising the sponsor gets through its affiliation with the non-profit., If either party is allowing use of trademarked logos or other intellectual property in conjunction with the sponsorship, correct usage should be spelled out explicitly in the sponsorship contract.


For example, your non-profit organization may have the right to use a soft drink corporation's logo on signs and t-shirts promoting its events. Likewise, the corporation is granted the right to state in its advertising that it is the official soft drink of your organization.Define specifically what products or goods may be licensed, and whether this license is exclusive., Sponsorship contracts should require the corporate sponsor to comply with all legal requirements and state that the corporate sponsor indemnifies the non-profit organization for any loss or claims arising from acts of the sponsor or its employees., Miscellaneous or ""boiler plate"" provisions are those which would apply to any contract, but aren't necessarily related to any particular part of this contract specifically.

, Representatives of both entities must sign the agreement before it is legally binding.

Explain how the game or event started.,
Describe the important events.,
When recounting a goal, describe the build up.,
End your report with a summary of what happened.",How to Write a Sports Report," It's important to know what you're talking about, so that you can describe the relevant goals, fouls, moves and equipment with expertise. Extra background information such as quotes, statistics, and team news are great to know too, as they'll make your report stand out from any other recount of that particular match.


What do you know about individual players? Try to read up on their backgrounds to gain an idea of their personalities, past sporting history and hopes for the future. This human element can add a lot to your writing, helping to make these people more real to the readers.;
, This will 'set the scene' for the reader.


For example: ""Conditions looked difficult for the two teams, despite the groundsman's best efforts to clear the pitch before the game.""

, Include things like who had the first shot, and which team started the strongest, any missing players or the form of particular players as they went onto the field or arena.

, This means detailing the goals, the sendings off and any altercations. If there is a groundbreaking achievement, such as ""the first time"" something has ever happened in that sport, be sure to detail it well, as the readers will be extremely curious. Fill in the gaps with statistics.


For example: ""For the next twenty minutes, the home side dominated - with 80 percent possession.""

, For example, if the goal came from a free kick, then mention that a foul was committed, which resulted in the set piece. After explaining that, go onto describe how the goal was scored. 


For example: ""The resulting free kick was beautifully curled into the top right corner.""

, This can include a discussion of what the result means to the teams involved, such as whether they survived to another round or are out of the series. If it's an individual, explain what this sports player is likely headed for next, such as another championship round or retirement.


For example: ""The victory lifted them out of the relegation zone and into the top half of the table.""

Buy a card that is appropriate for the person in need.,
Use blue or black ink.,
Use your best handwriting.,
Address the card with an appropriate title.,
Say that you are sorry for the person's loss.,
If you knew the deceased, share a memory.,
Give an offer of help.,
Avoid making trite or tactless remarks.,
Tell the person that he or she is in your thoughts.,
Keep it short and sweet.",How to Write a Sympathy Card," If you don't know the person's belief system, then it's best to get a simple card that does not take religion into account. However, if you know that the person is a devout Christian and would take comfort in a more religious card, then you can get a card with religious images or words. You may feel that any sympathy card you see isn't exactly what you want, but that's perfectly natural; the whole process of writing a sympathy card can feel a little unnatural, as can buying a card.;
, If you want to be tactful, then you don't want to write the sympathy card in pink or purple pen; this will make the person think that you did not put any effort into the card and that you just went with whatever pen was lying around. Blue or black are dignified and appropriate colors for writing a sympathy card.

, If you have naturally messy handwriting, make an effort to write as neatly as you can. You may even write the message on another piece of paper first so you know exactly what you are going to write. If your writing is sloppy or illegible, then the person will again not think that you put much thought into writing the sympathy card.

, Just write ""Dear"" followed by the person's name. This is not the time to use cute nicknames -- just write the name you usually call the person, unless it's too casual.

, You should avoid using the words ""died"" or ""dead"" or anything that refers to the person's death too directly. This may come off as tactless. Simply saying, ""I am sorry to hear about your loss"" or ""I am so sorry to hear that your uncle passed away"" will get the message across. Here are some other things you can say:


""We all will miss ____ dearly.""
""I send my love and sympathy to you and your family.""
""I send you my heartfelt condolences.""
""Words cannot express how sorry I am for your loss.""
""My heart goes out to you completely.""

Avoid mentioning how the person died. There's no need to say that the person died of cancer or that he or she had a terrible accident. This will only make the person feel worse.



, If you knew the deceased person well, mention shared happy events. Write something like ""I truly enjoyed our fishing trips off the Baja coast. John was a wonderful fisherman who never minded sharing his catch-of-the-day with others."" Keep the memory light, fun, and strictly positive. This is not the time to say, ""Though Jay and I had our differences, he was an amazing man…"" Here are some other things to keep in mind as you share a memory of the deceased:


Think of something that can make the person smile. Say, ""I'll never forget the time your aunt Mary played the accordion at your wedding.""
You can say, ""Your uncle Tom was an amazing person and will never be forgotten.""
If you didn't know the person or really didn't know the person well, don't try to attempt to come up with a memory anyway, or it will seem forced. Just say something like, ""I know how much your friend Kathy meant to you…"" This will feel far more natural than trying to conjure up a memory of the person you barely knew.

, Though you can't make the person feel 100% better during this hard time, you can do small things to ease the pain. Tell the person that you will be there for him or her during this difficult time and that you will do anything the person needs to make everything easier. You can offer to do errands, to babysit, just to be a shoulder to cry on, or anything else the person may need help with. Here's how you can phrase it:


""If you need someone to watch little Samantha, I will be there any time you need me.""
""Please let me know if I can help you out with your daily errands. I would love to do what I can.""
""I would love to go grocery shopping for you or to cook dinner for you and your family when you need me.""
""Please don't be afraid to ask for my help with anything at all.""

, When you're writing the card, you may truly be at a loss for words and could end up saying something that you don't really mean or feel. You should avoid making overly trite or insensitive comments when you are trying to express your sympathy. Here are some comments you should definitely avoid:


Do not write trite statements such as ""I know how you feel"" or ""It's all for the best"". In actuality each person grieves and decides what is best for them, so trite messages can not convey how another's loss feels.
Do not compare the loss to one of your own losses. Though you may feel that you can relate to the person's suffering, it's best not to mention it in a card.
Though saying ""He lived a full life"" may sound reasonable to you, it can still make the person feel sad because, obviously, he or she would have wanted the person to keep living.
Do not say, ""Time heals all wounds"" or ""You'll feel better in time."" Though this may be partly true, this will come off as thoughtless and is not what the person wants to hear.
Don't say, ""It was his time."" This is trite and just not something the person would want to hear, even if you're talking about his 120-year-old great-great-grandmother.

, After you've said you were sorry for the person's loss, have shared a memory, and have offered to help, then all you can really do is tell the person you are thinking of him or her and his or her family. This is the perfect way to end the card. Here are some things you can say:


""You will be in my thoughts every day.""
""I am thinking of you and your family during this difficult time.""
If the person is religious, you can say, ""I send my love and prayers to your family"" or ""I am praying for you during this difficult time.""

, A sympathy card should only be a few sentences long. Don't feel compelled to fill the whole card or to add extra words that don't really belong. This is not the time to make inside jokes or to bring up anything that is not really relevant to the person's loss. You don't want it to sound like you're not taking the loss seriously.


Sign off by saying ""Love"" or ""Sincerely"" or another word that is sincere and heartfelt.

Write the SOW before beginning work.,
Research the required SOW format.,
Get it right the first time.",How to Write a Statement of Work (SOW)1," The SOW is usually created after the core contract negotiations are completed but before any work on a project begins. Sometimes, however (particularly with time-sensitive projects), negotiations may continue after the work has begun and the SOW is not finalized until the project is well underway.;
, There is not a single standard SOW as different industries and projects have different deliverables and workflow. A good SOW is a customized SOW.

, While the original SOW itself usually is not revised, a separate side agreement called a Change Order typically is used to modify the SOW’s terms. It is a good idea to include a blank Change Order form with the SOW. Keep in mind, Change Orders can increase the project’s cost. A well-written SOW can help to reduce the need for a Change Order. No client wants to be in a position where his or her specific expectations are left undocumented, which can lead to delays, an increase in total cost, or dissatisfaction.

This section also should explain the relationship of the people in charge of the project, if there is a group. For example, if they are a group affiliated with a particular professional association, the contract should state this up front.
Typically fiscal sponsorship agreements are made between an established, well-known non-profit organization and a small, grassroots project of limited duration.
Make sure that the sponsor's tax status is identified up-front, if appropriate. For example, if the sponsor has 501(c)(3) status and is exempt from federal taxation, this should be mentioned prominently at the beginning of the agreement.

, Both the non-profit and the project's organizers should have a common understanding of what the project is trying to achieve, how these goals align with the non-profit's overall mission, and how the non-profit's sponsorship will assist the project in achieving its goals.


If the sponsor is willing to receive tax-deductible donations on behalf of the project, this should also be mentioned in the agreement. Spell out specifically the means by which the sponsor will accept and hold those funds.
Typically the sponsor is reimbursed for its costs through donations made to the project. This should be stated in the contract, along with the agreed-upon percentage of donations that will be used to meet those costs.

, Typically, fiscal sponsors provide administrative support for a smaller project and its organizers.


The accounts the sponsor is required to maintain should be listed specifically, along with any other activities or accounts the sponsor is expected to supervise.
If the project is to be deemed a project of the sponsor for the duration of the agreement, state this explicitly. List any other rights the sponsor has as a result of this role, such as the right to open new accounts or hire employees to work on the project.
Carefully delineate whether the sponsor or the project organizers have final responsibility for the accounting of the project, and which party must keep records.
Because some large organizations basically will take over your project, if you are a project organizer you must ensure you still have some measure of control over the project's basic operations.

, In this portion of the agreement, you want to spell out specifically whether the organizers can continue to fundraise or add new events to the project, and how those activities will be processed and accounted for.


If the project's organizers are responsible for any administrative tasks related to the project, list them specifically as exempted from the sponsor's responsibility.

, If the project's organizers have the right to use the non-profit's name and logos, that use should be defined specifically in the contract.


If necessary, attach images or examples of the logo as exhibits.

, Warrant the services provided within the context of the sponsorship relationship, and indemnify against any losses or claims that arise as a result of your actions. These clauses should go both ways.If the sponsor agrees to provide any liability or indemnity insurance for the project, include a clause to that effect that describes the limits of that insurance.

, Miscellaneous clauses, also known as ""boilerplate,"" are provisions that are needed in nearly every contract, but aren't necessarily specific to the contract at hand.

, Representatives from both the non-profit organization and the business must sign the agreement before it is legally binding.

General descriptions are acceptable when drafting this “bird’s-eye-view” of the project, but avoid language that could be interpreted in more than one way. Be clear; describe measurable and achievable objectives that realistically can be accomplished in the specified time frame.

, This section provides a definitive statement (no options or alternatives) of the “What?” and “How?” What is the work? How will it be accomplished? Or, often, what is NOT the work and what will NOT be accomplished. What are the assumptions? What deliverables (items the contractor presents to a client for review and approval) are being produced? What, aside from the deliverables, must happen administratively (project management) in terms of progress reporting, time tracking, and other communications.

, This optional section describes where the work will be performed (if relevant).

, This optional section specifies the total time allowed for project completion, the maximum billable hours per time period, and specific times for formal reviews or other project milestones.

, This section states what tasks should be completed by what date/time, and who is responsible for making that happen. Descriptions of tasks and results (primarily deliverables) should be detailed, unambiguous and straightforward so they are easy to understand. Aside from deliverables, the schedule might contain entries for Quality Assurance Testing, Consumer Testing, and Progress Reports.


While the schedule should be specific, don't focus on the “How” as that can put too many hurdles in front of successful project completion. A basic description of the required methodology to be used is sufficient.
The Schedule often incorporates details of acceptance criteria (to measure the quality of the outcome) and payment milestones (usually upon acceptance of key deliverables), though these can be described in a different, separate section.

, This section describes the mechanism for how the parties will determine whether the product or service is acceptable. The criteria can range from measurable quality standards to a specified number of tests, but in any case must lend itself to objective evaluation.

, This section describes any industry standards that must be met to fulfill the contract. Rather than physically reproducing the industry standards in the SOW, specifically referencing a set of standards is sufficient.

, This section specifies any special workforce requirements, e.g., number of employees staffing the project, education requirements (degrees or certifications).

, This section addresses the question of “How Much?” Is the payment a fixed fee? How do expenses/costs factor in? Will the payment be made as a lump sum or in installments? What is the payment schedule? Are there payment milestones?

, Most projects are permeated by various unknowns, for which the parties must make a variety of assumptions. In essence, assumptions are the conditions which the contractor expects will exist in order to complete the project in accordance with the terms of the SOW. For example, the contractor might assume that its employees will be granted access to the client’s computer network in order to install the deliverable software. The Assumptions section should identify as many such assumptions as possible and set forth a contingency plan or the consequences in the event that any assumptions fail.

, This section describes the process for monitoring the project’s progress. Include items such as: Weekly Meetings, Regular Status Reports, Regular Progress Reports, and Project Management Team Meetings. This section also is a good place to describe any additional obligations which might flow from the project, such as maintenance and repair after the initial design and/or installation.

Sign your contract and begin performing.",How to Write a Settlement Agreement," A settlement agreement is a legally enforceable contract.They can be used in a variety of situations where two parties are in dispute about something and they wish to compromise on how that dispute will be resolved.A settlement agreement will act as a ""release,"" which means that in exchange for some act (often the payment of money), one person will give up their legal claim against another person.For example, if your garage is damaged when your neighbor backs into it with their car, you might agree to settle this dispute and release your neighbor from any legal liability if he or she agrees to pay for the repairs to your garage.
Some of the most common situations in which a settlement agreement is utilized include: disputes over damaged property; employment disputes between employers and employees; marriage disputes; and medical malpractice disputes.;
, You will need to decide if you have the legal capacity to enter into a valid contract, which involves knowing what you are getting yourself into by entering into the agreement.A settlement agreement should be in writing.Also, you will want to know what is needed to create a legally binding contract. Those requirements include:


An offer. This is what one party proposes to do, pay, etc.Acceptance. This is the willingness to be bound by the terms of the offer.Valid consideration. This is something of value that the promisor receives from the promisee in return for the promise. It can be tangible or any type of benefit.For example, if you offer to sell your car to your brother for $4000 and he accepts, the $4000 is the consideration. To be valid, consideration must be reasonable and agreed on by both parties without coercion.
Mutual assent. Both parties must accept the offer without being forced to do so by coercion or any other means.For example, if you agreed to give a robber all of your money so that he does not shoot you, there is no mutual assent even though there is an offer and acceptance.
A legal purpose.A settlement agreement must also not be ""unconscionable."" This means that it cannot be illegal, fraudulent, or criminal. For example, you could not agree to settle a lawsuit in exchange for six pounds of cocaine, because the sale of cocaine is illegal in the United States., If you are unable to determine whether your contractual provisions will comply with state law, you may want to consider hiring or consulting an attorney.


In general, any contract lawyer or lawyer practicing in the field your dispute arises in (e.g., property law, tort law, family law) will be able to help you determine if your settlement agreement is likely to be valid.

, Both parties are likely to have a differing view of the dispute. Before writing your settlement agreement, you must come to an agreement of the factual terms of the dispute.A mediator may be helpful in determining this., The consideration is what one party is going to receive in return for giving up any possible legal remedy. You will also want to determine how the compensation will be turned over (i.e., all at once or over time).For example, payment arrangements and logistics should be hammered out before you write the settlement agreement.

, This is likely to be a point of contention in some settlement agreements. Some parties will be willing to settle only if they do not have to admit to liability or wrongdoing. This is very common in corporate settlements.For example, if you are agreeing to settle with a corporation whose hair dye turned your hair green and made it fall out, the corporation could agree to the settlement agreement as long as the settlement is not construed as admission of fault or wrongdoing on their part.

, Sometimes, a conditional settlement agreement may be desirable. For example, this is the case where an action must be performed in order to resolve the issue, but that action will take time to complete. It is not usually desirable in situations where something may not be completed by a certain date, such as keeping a trade secret confidential.In this case, you should negotiate an unconditional settlement agreement, which takes effect after a certain number of days., You must negotiate the scope of the release in the agreement to determine which claims will be resolved, and whether any future claims are also resolved by this settlement agreement. You can negotiate a provision stating that the settlement agreement applies to all claims arising out of the dispute, whether they are current or not yet realized, or the settlement may resolve just one aspect of a suit or a single claim. This will depend on your needs., Begin your settlement agreement by titling the document in a way that informs the reader about what the agreement is.


Depending on the case, it may also require a caption or style of the case to be added. For example, if it is part of ongoing litigation, it may need to include the names or identifiers of all plaintiffs, and this information could change as the case develops., You should write a paragraph that introduces the parties to the agreement (who is involved in it) and defines their roles. You should include names and addresses, as well as a statement that the parties named have the capacity and authority to enter the agreement.The statement may also state that the parties named have the capacity to bind a company or entity, if this applies. For example, if your settlement agreement is with a small business, the small business owner could agree to serve as the binder for his company.
For example, a common introductory paragraph looks like this: ""This Settlement Agreement and Release (this “Agreement”) is entered into as of by and between (a) (“DEFINE PARTY A”) and (b) (“DEFINE PARTY B”). Collectively, and shall be referred to as the “Parties”.""When you define the parties, you will describe one party as the one being released from legal liability, and you will describe the other party as the one granting the release., In this section you will need to describe the ""who,"" ""what,"" ""when,"" ""where,"" and ""how"" of the dispute.It is important to do this so both parties are in agreement about what specific act is being discussed in the agreement and what is being settled. Without this provision, a court will have a tough time upholding and enforcing your settlement agreement in the event it is breached or you have to get it approved.


If you are settling a medical malpractice dispute, you may write a scenario that explains: who the patient was and who the doctor or doctors were; what happened that caused the dispute, (e.g., the doctor left a sponge in the patient's abdomen after the surgery); when the dispute occurred, (e.g., on March 5, 2014 at approximately 12:15 p.m. while the patient was in surgery); where the dispute occurred (e.g., at the doctor's office, located at a certain address); and how the dispute occurred (e.g., the doctor was not paying attention and forgot about the sponge and the patient found out when they started having pains in their side).
Be as detailed as possible and include any information you may think is relevant to the agreement you are creating.

, This section will include the required consideration, which is necessary to spell out in order to have a valid contract.The type of payments that can be contracted for are wide-ranging and will depend on what the dispute was that led to the settlement agreement you are creating. Compensation could be in the form of money, repairs, replacements, or even promises. Compensation cannot be anything illegal, fraudulent, or criminal.
If you are entering into a settlement agreement as a result of property damage, your provision may state: ""Party A agrees to release Party B from liability so long as Party B compensates Party A in the form of $500 in order to repair the broken fence."" Also, instead of including a dollar amount, the provision may state that Party B will be required to repair the broken fence his or herself in order to be released from liability.
If you are executing a settlement agreement as a result of something like trespassing, you may include a provision stating Party A agrees to release Party B from liability so long as Party B never trespasses again. You may then include a sentence stating that if Party B does trespass again, the settlement agreement will be null and void and Party A will be free to pursue legal action.
When you are drafting this provision, be sure you are confident in the consideration you are receiving or giving up. Settlements are legally binding contracts and you will likely be stuck with the compensation you agreed to, even if you find out later it is grossly inadequate or extremely over the top. For example, if you agree to compensate someone $500 for the damage you caused to their vehicle, and they later find out the actual cost of repair was $5,000, they will likely be stuck with the $500 you provided and they will not be able to collect more., During negotiations, you should have determined with the other party whether the settlement agreement will resolve all claims, including unknown and future claims, or whether it will cover only a certain claim. In general, it is advisable to resolve all claims, including unknown and future claims, with your settlement agreement.You should look to include a provision that looks something like this: ""Claimant and Employer hereby mutually release and forever discharge each other and each of their affiliates, subsidiaries, parent corporations and their respective agents, present and former directors, officers, executives, employees, predecessors and/or successors in interest, attorneys, heirs and assigns, from any and all matters, claims, complaints, charges, demands, damages, causes of action, debts, liabilities, controversies, judgments and suits of every kind and nature whatsoever, arising out of the same subject matter or occurrence as this claim/cause of action, as of the date of this Agreement, foreseen or unforeseen, known or unknown, including but not limited to, those arising out of Claimant’s employment with Employer and, if applicable, the termination of such employment.""This specific clause is tailored to an employment dispute, but you can change the wording and the parties in order to make it fit your needs.
Not all settlements will resolve any and all claims arising from the dispute. Make sure to negotiate a clear statement of scope.

, Sometimes, a conditional settlement agreement may be desirable. For example, this is the case where an action must be performed in order to resolve the issue, but that action will take time to complete. It is not usually desirable in situations where something may not be completed by a certain date, such as keeping a trade secret confidential.In this case, you should negotiate an unconditional settlement agreement, which takes effect after a certain number of days.For example, if a contractor you hired ruined your attic through faulty building, a settlement agreement could negotiate your waiving your right to sue conditional on the contractor replacing the attic at no cost and passing a building inspection within one month. If the condition is not met, the settlement agreement is nullified.
You might want to include language such as the following: ""All Parties agree and understand that this agreement on behalf of is subject to approval of the conditions stipulated herein before it can be binding upon the . Counsel for the Parties agree that they will recommend to approve this agreement and will make his/her best effort to secure that approval and to secure that approval at the earliest reasonable date.""Then you would spell out the exact conditions that will satisfy the agreement.

, Oftentimes, when parties are agreeing to settle a dispute through a mutual agreement as opposed to going through the judicial process, the party providing the settlement payment will not want to admit any liability or fault. If you have previously negotiated this, provide a clause, like the one below, that allows the party in the wrong to compensate the other party without having to admit any wrongdoing.


If you plan on including a provision agreeing that the settlement will not include any admissions of fault or liability, you may want to use the following language: ""The Parties acknowledge that the Settlement Payment was agreed upon as a compromise and final settlement of disputed claims and that payment of the Settlement Payment is not, and may not be construed as, an admission of liability by and is not to be construed as an admission that engaged in any wrongful, tortious or unlawful activity. specifically disclaims and denies (a) any liability to and (b) engaging in any wrongful, tortious or unlawful activity."", Making your settlement agreement confidential ensures that neither party can discuss or reveal any of the terms of the settlement to the world.This type of provision comes up most in business settlements where one company is often involved in litigation and settlement, and does not want other potential litigants to know the usual terms of their agreements. It may also come up in medical settlements where a doctor wants to restrict the patient's ability to reveal what happened and how much the doctor paid out.


If you wish to include a confidentiality provision, it may look like this: ""The terms and conditions of this Agreement are absolutely confidential between the parties and shall not be disclosed to anyone else, except as shall be required by law. Any disclosure in violation of this section shall be deemed a material breach of this Agreement."", If you are in the middle of litigation when you decide to settle and create a settlement agreement, be sure you include a provision ensuring that both parties will dismiss the litigation and not move forward with it.


If you are in this situation, consider using this language: ""and his/her/its counsel shall take whatever actions are necessary to ensure that the Litigation is dismissed in its entirety as to all defendants named therein, with prejudice and without costs or fees, within days of his/her/its/their receipt of the Settlement Payment. will cooperate with in securing the dismissal of the Litigation as appropriate.""It is highly advisable to have your settlement agreement approved by the court. This constitutes a court order, which is far easier to enforce than a simple contract. Especially if you are not certain whether the other party will abide by the terms of your agreement, you should present the settlement agreement to the court for approval., Towards the end of your contract you will include any standard provisions that are usually found in contracts. Most of these provisions you can simply take from a form contract you find, but make sure you read over them and ensure they say what you want them to. Some of these provisions may include:


Severability provisions;
Modification provisions;
Indemnification provisions;
Choice of law provisions; and
Entire agreement provisions.

, At the very end of the contract you will make space for all parties to sign the contract. This area should have spaces for your signatures and dates.

, Once you have written your settlement agreement you will offer it to the other party. Assuming that your negotiation process went smoothly, both parties should be satisfied. However, the other party has several options once presented with the agreement:


The other party may accept the offer in full. In this instance, you will then sign the contract and start performing.
The other party could reject the offer in full. If this is the case, you will have to write a more acceptable settlement agreement or go to court. If you have already been through negotiation, this is unlikely.
The other party might try to negotiate some of the terms of your settlement agreement. If this happens, you will negotiate with the other party until you both reach an acceptable agreement. You may have to make minor changes to wording or terms to satisfy both parties.

, If your settlement agreement is part of litigation (i.e., you have been in court and maybe the judge asked you to try to negotiate a settlement), you may be required to present your settlement agreement to the judge in order to have him or her sign off on it.Even if you are not required to get a court's approval, you may want to think about doing so, if it is a possible option, because a court order is much easier to enforce than a contract.This option may not be possible if you are settling a dispute outside of the judicial process., When you and the other party are satisfied with the document, you will both sign it and begin performance in the manner you both agreed upon.

Continue marketing your book.",How to Get a Self Published Book into Libraries," Many people are wary of self-published books because they believe that they are low quality. Make sure that your book is formatted and has been carefully edited. Also, choose your bindings carefully, as libraries generally won't stock books with that are comb bound, spiral bound, or saddle stitched (stapled). It's a good idea to call your local library and ask them what their requirements are. Ensure that the cover makes the book look professional and interesting, as many people do judge a book by its cover.;
, Start promoting your book before contacting libraries to get the word out and show that you're serious. Create a website or blog for your book, and make sure it looks professional.

, Find out who the acquisitions librarian is (the librarian who purchases books for the library or branch), and call her, email her, or set up a brief meeting with her to ask about donating some copies of your books. Don't just put your book in the donations bin or hand it to a random librarian at the check out counter - chances are it will end up in a book sale that way. Be polite, professional, and respectful. Consider giving her a copy to look over if she seems unsure about your book.

, Libraries are usually non-profit organizations, and as such, they like donations. However, most libraries will require you to donate more than one copy of your book, as it costs money to catalogue it and is only worth their time and money if there's more than one copy in their library. Some libraries have special systems or sections in the library specifically for self-published local authors, so enquire about that.

, In order to not only get the attention of the not only the librarians, but the general public, get your book reviewed. Try to land a review from Library Journal, CHOICE, Booklist, Publishers Weekly, or Kirkus Reviews. There are also programs that will send flyers about your book to local libraries for a fee.

, Libraries usually take requests seriously, so it's a great way to get them to put your book on the shelves. Ask some friends and family members to request your book. Be careful that you don't have them submit dozens of spam-like requests for your book; librarians can tell which requests are fake and which are legitimate, and they won't be happy if you waste their time with fake requests.

, Once you get the book on the library shelves, your battle isn't necessarily over. Libraries will usually weed out books if they don't circulate well to free up shelf space for books that will. Make sure to promote your book as much as possible to ensure that people want to take it out.

Gather information about publishing occupations. Request informational interviews with people who work in the industry to learn detailed information about their roles and work environments. Reading job ads posted by publishers is also a good way to access descriptions of various roles.;
, If you have a gift for language and enjoy working alone, writing may be your ideal occupation. A detail-oriented critical thinker who communicates clearly with others might enjoy editing. If you are talented in creating visual images that communicate a theme, you might design book covers for book publishers.

, A small book publisher might focus strictly on crime novels. An academic publisher might supply liberal arts textbooks for major universities. Large book publishers often publish a large variety of fiction and nonfiction on a wide range of topics.

, Small companies often combine tasks in a single position that may require the attention of an entire department in a larger publishing house. For example, working in the sales department for a small publisher might require marketing tasks like researching target audiences and making sales phone calls to retailers. A large book publisher typically splits these tasks into 2 different departments: marketing and sales.

, Many large book publishing companies offer both print and electronic versions of some books. Other companies focus strictly on print or e-books. The distinction is important, especially if you have a technology background and want to work in e-book publishing.

, The type of degree, training and experience you need will depend on your position of choice. To work in the editorial department, you typically need a degree in English, journalism or communications, as well as editing experience. Working as a financial manager in book publishing typically requires a degree in finance and an understanding of publishing costs and potential revenue streams.

, Some positions in this field are highly competitive. Working as an editor or art designer for a reputable publisher is often more competitive, given few open slots and the high demand for these positions. Developing connections with people in the field might lead to recommendations for jobs.

, Larger publishers typically post open positions in the career sections of their company websites.


Explore internships or entry-level positions. One way to get into book publishing is by applying for entry-level positions. These types of positions increase your exposure to the publishing process. They also allow for building relationships and demonstrating your potential.
Read the job postings carefully. Whether the ad is posted on a publisher's website or a job search engine, book publishers usually indicate a job description and required qualifications. Depending on the position, requirements might include a degree in a specific field, prior work experience and specific skills like word processing proficiency or familiarity with popular culture or an academic subject.

, Book publishers work with the written word, so they are often more tuned into how an applicant uses written language. This is especially important when applying for writing, editing or marketing positions.


Review your application carefully before submission. Proofread your resume and cover letter carefully to eliminate any typos or vague language.
Ask someone in the publishing industry to review your application prior to submission. A careful review of your resume and cover letter by an experienced editor or publicist might lend important insights.

Read and follow the publication submission guidelines.,
Develop a working understanding of the publication's audience.,
Develop and be able to pitch a number of ideas effectively.,
Play to your strength.,
Keep at it.",How to Get an Editor to Notice You1," Publications create submission guidelines to make it easier on both writers and editors. By reading and following the guidelines, you're producing work that the publication is looking for, making it easier on you as a writer, in a format that its editors can more easily vet for suitability and quality.


Most publications with an Internet presence offer their submission guidelines on their websites. For those that don't, you can obtain the guidelines by writing to the publication at the address given.
If you blog, consider writing your blog posts according to the guidelines of the publication you plan to submit to. You can then invite the editor to review your posts at the time you contact him or her. Not only will the posts show your expertise in the subject, but by matching the publication's style, it makes it easier for the editor to see how your work will fit with the publication.;
, While the submission guidelines often provide a short description of the publication's target audience, you should try to gain a better understanding by reading at least a single issue of that publication and possibly also issues of competing publications. If you can show how your submission will benefit the publication's readers, you stand a better chance of getting noticed by an editor than by filling your correspondence with flattery or big words.


This working understanding should also include an understanding of the publication's necessary lead time for seasonal material. You'll gain an editor's notice and respect if you learn to anticipate when a publication needs certain material to run in the spring, summer, fall, winter, or holiday seasons.

, To be noticed by an editor, you need to develop your skill at pitching story or article ideas to him or her. You can do this through any of the methods listed below, but if you can master more than 1 of them, you stand a better chance of being noticed and accepted.


Query: In either letter or email form, this is the most common and often the best method to contact an editor. Your query should be focused on your story or article, your background that qualifies you to write it, and your relevant past writing experience.
Letter of introduction: A letter of introduction (LOI) is useful for contacting publications where you haven't yet been able to determine what their needs are. An LOI should be written in the same tone as the publication whose editor you're contacting and should mention something you have been able to learn about it and its audience. It should focus on your writing expertise and conclude with an invitation for them to contact you, such as offering to send them writing samples. When possible, include a referral from either a staff writer or an editor you've worked with in the past. (Despite being called a ""letter"" of introduction, you can also do an LOI as an email.)
Cold calling: If you're more extroverted than most writers typically are, you can pitch your ideas to editors over the telephone. You may find it frustrating to navigate through the publication's voice mail directory, but if you have several ideas ready, you can pitch 1 and then the other if the first is rejected. You can also use the telephone as a follow-up to a query or letter of introduction.
Networking: You can approach editors with your ideas and credentials directly at networking events. You may meet editors for local publications at events sponsored by local businesses or chambers of commerce and those for national publications at writer's conferences and conventions for fans of a particular genre, such as romance, mystery, or science fiction.

, You may be good at several forms of writing; however, because of the number of manuscripts editors may review, you stand a better chance of impressing them with your single strongest skill than a large number of good, but not great skills. If you know 1 subject better than anyone else, look to write about that subject first and foremost; if, in writing fiction, you excel in dialogue, write a story where the dialogue stands out.


If you, in fact, are very strong in several areas, then find other publications that play to those strengths and direct your strongest work in each area to the publication best suited to it.

, None of the above steps are a magic formula to getting an editor to notice you or to get your work published. However, by persistently directing work of consistent quality, you will gain an editor's notice and respect and eventually see your work in print.

Create a press release that is creative but search engine optimized.,
Offer something that is mutually beneficial to each blogger.,
Increase the probability of a blogger using your press release.",How to Get Bloggers to Post a Press Release1," This is a hard balance to create; however, it is important that it is not bland, but also not too poetic or cliched. Figure out 3 to 5 keywords that should appear a few times in your press release that explain the industry, the brand and the product.


A blogger wants to feature top quality content. Your press release must be top quality, with a short but catchy description of the product or event. Include links to exceptional pictures, quotes and other exclusive content.;
, There are a number of things this could entail, including coupon codes, good affiliate marketing percentages, free tickets or products, exclusive content to feature on their website or another creative idea. A blogger wants to see the benefit in advertising your press release for the blog and the readers.

, Include the following things in your press release to make it more valuable:


Include quotes. Quotes from the people creating the product allow bloggers to have a piece of ""on the record"" information right from the source. It is better to have the information straight from the source than for a blogger to have to guess why you have done what you've done.
Always provide additional information. Let the reader know where they can learn more. The blogger should be able to do additional research instead of just giving 1 story. Connect the press release to what is going on in the world, community and other stories.

Address your correspondence to the right editor, by name.,
Communicate in a professional tone.,
Be succinct and direct.,
Reply promptly to requests.",How to Get an Editor to Notice You2," Small publications may have only a single editor, while larger publications may have an editor for each department in which they publish. Learning who the right editor is and addressing him or her by name will earn you that editor's notice and show you as a writer who cares about detail. Editors are listed under their publication's listing in the current ""Writer's Market"" or on the publication's website.


If you are looking for a specific editor's name on a publication website and it's not given, you can often derive the editor's email address by looking for the email address for one of the publication's other representatives. Note the format the identifier component of the email address is in; common formats are ""Firstname.Lastname,"" ""Firstname_Lastname,"" ""InitialLastname,"" or ""LastnameInitial."" Generally, all email addresses for the same entity follow the same format, except when someone goes by his or her initials or when more than 1 person at the publication has the same first and last name. If you have any doubts as to who the right editor is, you can always ask them via Twitter, LinkedIn, or other social media connection.

, Although electronic communications such as email and instant messaging have made written communications easier and less formal than letters, you still need to maintain a professional tone. You can use ""Hello"" or ""Hi"" in your salutations, or even the ""Dear"" used in written letters, but not something like ""Yo"" or ""What up, dude."" You need to spell out every word correctly in your message; you can't get by with textspeak shorthand. You also need to follow the rules for capitalization and punctuation, unless you plan to market yourself to a poetry magazine as the next E.E. Cummings.


As you develop a working relationship with an editor, you may find that your communication with him or her goes beyond the bounds of your current or future writing projects. Even when your editor becomes your friend, keep the tone professional. (You'll find this easier if your normal communication style is a professional-sounding one.)
The professional tone should extend to your website and social media pages as well. If you make it a practice to include the URLs of your website and social media pages in your email signature, which you should, the content of those pages should be as well-written and professional as the content of your emails.

, Your correspondence with an editor should be focused and short. Queries should be about a page (5 to 6 paragraphs) in length, and letters of introduction running 1 to 2 pages, not including any accompanying referrals. Leave out any personal information that doesn't relate to your expertise as a writer in general or to the subject you plan to write about.


When communicating by email, make the subject line pertinent to the purpose of your email. While ""Hello"" is an appropriate salutation, it isn't specific enough for an email subject line. If your email is to introduce you to the editor, a better subject line would be ""Interested in writing for ."" If the email is a query, something like ""Proposed article:"" followed by either the subject you plan to write on or the title you have in mind.

, Prompt replies show you as a writer the editor can depend upon with a time-critical assignment. If you don't have an answer right away, reply by saying that you don't have the answer but will have it by a certain time � and then deliver by that time, if not before.


Feel free to take the advice Scotty gives Geordi LaForge in the ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" episode ""Relics"" and deliberately quote a longer period of time (within reason) to deliver than what you think you actually need. You may well find you'll need that extra time, and as long as you deliver by the date you promised, no one needs to know that you can deliver in much less time than that.

Submit the press release to bloggers you are personally familiar with first.,
Submit to bloggers that are in your niche.,
Search for bloggers in your niche.,
Find the contact info, including the email, of anyone you have researched and want to submit to.,
Write a short introductory paragraph that compliments the blog, a specific blog post and tells how this press release applies to their reader demographic.,
Consider hiring a press release distribution service.",How to Get Bloggers to Post a Press Release2," If you don't know any bloggers personally and you will be pitching to bloggers for your job, now is the time to become part of the blogging community and get to know them personally.

, You want to hook and interest bloggers that cater to the kind of people you would like to notice your product or event. Sending it to bloggers outside of your niche will most likely be wasted time and effort.

, You should track down 20 to 100 to create a large base for releasing your information. The following are ways that you can find blogging leaders for press release submission:


Do a Google search with the subject matter and ""blog"" as keywords. You should find a couple of pages of blog listings to research and submit to.
Do an advanced Twitter search to find bloggers who regularly communicate with a Twitter and blog community. You can find blogging leaders on Twellow, or you can find localized bloggers on the Twitter site, using the search or advanced search method and a subject matter.
Search for other bloggers on Technorati, Findory, StumbleUpon, Feedster and Bing. Each of these places has a blog directory search. Use your press release's subject matter as a keyword.

, Don't spend time researching a blog if an email isn't listed because it will be more difficult to send them a press release.

, Avoid sounding formal or like you are writing a spam email to hundreds of bloggers - the extra time spent on research and writing from a human perspective will pay off in readership.


Be brief. A popular blogger does not have much time to spend reading emails, so be sure to say what you want to say in approximately 5 sentences. If possible, include a short part of the press release below your introduction and include a link to read the rest of it.

, These services submit to news channels, websites and blogs. For a price, they will review your press release, include important key words and spend the time sending it out to potential bloggers.


Although a press release distribution service can be expensive, it is important not to choose simply based on price. A poorly written or edited press release is better off not being sent at all, because no one will look at it. A press release should have an introduction written to each blogger, with promotion offers, to increase the chance of it being run.

Choose the type of diary you want to use.,
Carry your diary with you every day.,
Date the entries in your diary.,
Get in the habit of using your diary every day.,
Avoiding worrying about writing everything perfectly in your diary.,
Use your diary for drawing and art.",How to Use a Diary1," Some people like to use notebooks for diaries. Others prefer to use computers to write instead. Both methods are just fine, so choose the one you are most comfortable with.


If you want to use a computer to write, you can use a text document to write or you can use an online journaling website or diary app.
If you want to use a physical diary, choose one that’s easy for you to write in. Make sure it's a good size for you and get one with lined paper inside.
If you can't decide if you want to use a computer or write in a notebook, go with the one that makes you feel the most creative.;
, Keep your diary close to you if possible. If it’s always within reach, you’re more likely to use it. Start by writing details you want to remember and even random thoughts as they strike you in your diary.


If you’re using a notebook, make sure you choose one that easily fits into your backpack or purse.
Keep your diary safe. Diaries are very private so if you carry it with you, keep an eye on it. If you leave it at home, be sure that it can't be easily found.

, One of the best things about diaries is reading them later, so be sure to date your entries. That way you know exactly when things happened.


Make putting down the date the first thing you do when writing a diary entry so you won't forget.

, Put aside time for writing first thing in the morning or right before you go to bed and hold yourself to it. If you’re very busy, even 10 minutes every day will help to get you in the habit of writing in your diary.


Choose a time when you know you won’t be interrupted by friends or family members.
Write to pass the time when you're riding in a car or on a bus.These trips are a good opportunity to jot down your thoughts and ideas.

, Don’t feel that you have to write long paragraphs and perfect sentences in your diary, or even sentences at all. If it’s easier for you to get down short phrases or bulletpoints, go with that.


It can be tempting, but avoid editing yourself in your diary. Don’t worry about spelling and grammar either.
No one is judging what you put in your diary and it’s for your eyes only.

, Feel free to write poetry, put down song lyrics, and record quotes from others that are meaningful to you. Some people express themselves best through art, and that is a completely valid way to use your diary, too.Experiment with drawing, painting, collecting found objects and creating collages in your diary, especially if you find that the words aren’t flowing.
Mix it up! Write when you're in the mood to write, and draw or make other art if you're more in the mood to do that.

Write down major life events in your diary.,
Write down things about ordinary days.The big stuff is important, but don’t forget to write about the small things that happen in your daily life, too.,
Collect photos and keepsakes for your diary.,
Write down your dreams in your diary.",How to Use a Diary2," No matter how memorable an experience may be, some of the details will fade over time. Use your diary to write down major life events in great detail so that you can look back on them later.


One day you will be able to look back at your old diaries entries and recall these important moments in vibrant detail.
Think of your diary as a gift to your future self.

, You'll find the big stuff and the small stuff interesting in the future.What seems ordinary today could very likely seem extraordinary to you in the future. Nothing you write in your diary is boring.

, Use glue or tape to place mementos and keepsakes into your diary. You can write text to go with the items if you want, but it’s not necessary.


Great examples of these types of items are ticket stubs to events you’ve attended, photos, leaves and pressed flowers, found objects and even completely random things that caught your attention on that particular day.
You can get even more creative and arrange these items into an artistic collage.

, Keep your diary close to your bed and use it to record your dreams. Try to write down the details of your dreams as soon as you wake up, since they can be incredibly fleeting.You can keep a separate diary just for dreams, or you can enter them into your regular diary.
If you enter them into your every-day diary, it might be helpful to write them down in a different color of ink, just to keep them entirely separate from other entries.

Create a schedule for yourself.,
Track your success in your diary.Sometimes it feels like you’re spinning your wheels when it comes to getting something accomplished, especially if it’s something big.",How to Use a Diary3," Putting your goals into words in your diary allows you to focus more easily on those goals, and often makes them feel more achievable.Not all goals have to be lofty ones. You can use your diary for goals both big and small, short-term and long-term.
The main objective is describing clearly what those goals are. Once you do that, developing a plan of action comes much more easily.

, You can make daily lists of simple things you need to get done, or you can create to-do lists for more long-term goals. Whether you’re trying to accomplish a certain goal, solve a particular problem or simply plan out your day, they are all much easier to tackle once you’ve broken them down into smaller tasks.If you’re trying to make a tough decision, try creating a list of pros and cons in your diary to help you.

, Use your diary to map out your day, organize your thoughts and making time to do the things you need to do, like homework or chores.


Your diary is also a great place to set reminders for yourself, especially if you are using it daily., Your diary is a written account of what you’ve done along the way and functions as an excellent log of your progress.


Progress can be hard to measure objectively and sometimes it's easy to forget successes you’ve already had.
Looking back at older entries can help you put things in perspective.

Consider whether you want an agent.,
Begin compiling a list of agents.,
Avoid scamming or unethical agents.,
Begin sending out queries.,
Be prepared to receive rejections.,
Be ready for the requests!,
Prepare for the offer of representation.,
Do not immediately accept the first offer you get.,
Finalize the deal.",How to Get a Publishing Agent," If your dream is for your book to be published by a large publishing house, you will probably want an agent. If you are targeting smaller publishers, you may want to forego finding an agent.

Although an agent will collect 15% of your royalties, including your advance, as their commission, they will often be able to negotiate a better deal for you. You should weigh all these pros and cons and consider what you really want to do at this step in your writing career.
An agent will only be interested in a novel if the novel is completely written and well-polished. A non-fiction book does not need to be completely written, but there should be several sample chapters done and a full proposal (outline of the book). If you are not done, you aren't ready for an agent just yet. Focus on the book first!;
, Look for agents who represent the genre of your book. If you have written more than one book in different genres or plan to write in multiple genres, you may wish to narrow your search to agents who represent all the genres you write.

You can find agent information through their websites, writer's forums, or printed industry guides. Keep in mind that an online resource will probably be more recently updated than a printed resource.
You can also find agents by looking at published books similar to what you've written. Check the acknowledgements page, or check the writer's online blog to see if they name their agent. One agent usually represents multiple authors, so don't worry - you're not 'poaching'!

, If an agent's website or communications with you mention paying an up-front fee to be represented by them, or to have your submission jumped to the front of the line, avoid this agent and do not pay them anything.

Avoid agents who want to charge you for a mandatory 'editing service' or require you to hire a freelance editor - recommended by them - before they will review your submission.
If you are unsure about an agent, ask around on writer's forums. You can ask without making accusations if anybody has any experience with this particular agent. You can also ask around for a list of known scammer agents.

, Review the agent's guidelines for queries. Usually, for a novel, the query will be composed of a short query letter and possibly some sample pages. Many sample query letters can be found online.

You can send queries to multiple agents at once, but it is usually best to not send to everyone on your list at one time. You may later realize that your query letter can be improved, and you will be glad that there are still agents on your list who did not see the old version!
Keep track of your query letters as you send them out in a spreadsheet or a notebook. Make note of the agent's name, the date you sent your query, and the response time frame they have posted. Some agents do not respond to a query unless they are interested. Others say they will always respond; if the time frame passes without a response from these agents, you should re-query, in case your original query did not reach them.

, Just about every author who has an agent went through the query process, and 99% of them received at least some rejections. Many best-selling authors received tons of rejections before their first book found an agent.

Remember that rejections may feel personal, but ultimately they are not about you as an author or a person. Maybe the agent just didn't have the right vision for your book.
If you receive all rejections from one round of queries, it may be time to review your query letter. Maybe it isn't representing your book as well as you thought.
If you can, review any rejections you receive with personalized notes that may offer constructive criticism. It may sting, but it may also help improve your book in a critical way!

, If an agent is intrigued by your query letter, the agent will respond with a request for a partial or a full, meaning several chapters of your manuscript or the entire manuscript. With a non-fiction book, an agent will request the entire proposal at this point. Don't rush! Take a moment to celebrate that someone is interested in your book. Then, carefully review their message, as well as any guidelines on their website regarding how they like partials or fulls to be sent.

Many agents prefer that you copy and paste the original query letter into the first page of the document. They also often require a heading and page numbers. Following their guidelines will make it easier for them to get to your submission more quickly.
Track these submissions separately but in a similar way to how you are tracking query letters. Again, if the response window passes without a response from the agent, check in with them to be sure they received the materials you sent.
Don't stop sending out query letters! A partial or full request is not the same as an offer of representation. The agent is still deciding, and you should not sit still to wait on their decision. They expect you are still moving forward, and you should do so.

, Having an agent actually offer to represent your book may seem like a pipe dream - until it actually happens. You should be ready.

Have a list of questions that are important to you. This may include things like where the agent plans to submit the book, whether or not they will require significant edits, and what sort of communication style they have.
Ask if you can contact any of the authors they currently represent.

, This may seem silly at first - all this time waiting for an agent, why wouldn't you accept an offer of representation when you finally get one? Well, there's a lot to do, and you may be able to get yourself more offers to choose from!

Tell the agent you need some time to contact other agents who have your material. This is considered common courtesy in the publishing world; you should not worry that this will make the agent withdraw their offer.
Contact any agents who have requested a partial or a full from you, and inform them you have an offer from another agent. Give them a deadline to respond, or, if you are absolutely sure you prefer the agent who has already offered to them, you can simply say you are withdrawing your material from their consideration. If you like, you can do this same process with any query letters you have sent out that haven't had responses yet, but it is not expected.
Contact the authors currently represented by the agent who offered. Ask them about their experiences with the agent. Remember you are not asking them to badmouth their agent; an agent can be the perfect agent for one author, and a terrible agent for another author. Communication style, taste, and persistence are all key.
If you receive back offers from any other agents after informing them of your offer on the table, ask them all the same questions and ask for authors of theirs to contact as well. Fully evaluate all your options before choosing your agent.

, Once you have picked the agent who you believe is right for you, contact them and tell them you accept their offer of representation.

Inform any others who have offered that you thank them for the offer but you have chosen another agent.
Your agent may send you an agency agreement to sign, or they may work on a verbal agreement until the book actually sells to a publisher.

Identify types of illustrations and time period of your book.,
After you have done some research, pick at least three of the drawings you like the best.,
After you have chosen the type of art style you like, you must decide on if you are going to draw them yourself or have someone else draw them.,
If you decide to have someone do the artwork for you, do some more research.,
Once you found an artist, email an asking to do the job.",How to Find Illustrations when Writing a Book," You might want to do a little research on different types of art. This will help when deciphering the illustration needs for your book. Also, ask yourself what time period does this range from. Time periods are very important when it comes to matching illustrations to the book,itself. If the setting is in some greater time period, you might want to research art in that period for readers to see the mood for the book.;
, Ponder about these three exceptional drawings. After all, they are going to be in your book. Remember: You are just seeking the type of art; these are not the drawing themselves!

, If you are going to draw them yourself, please do not put pressure on yourself when you mess up a drawing. Drawings take time. Even the famous painters and sketchers made mistakes on their artwork. Once your beautiful masterpiece is finished being sketched, you should probably find a way to color it. Use vibrant colors that will catch the reader's attention if the book is in a fairytale or happy setting. If it is in a mysterious setting, like Sherlock Holmes, I would not suggest coloring your artwork at all.

, This means you should look for the specific kinds of artist. Remember: Some artist specialize in specific kinds of art. For example, if the artist mostly does pastels, that artist specializes in pastels. Since you looked for the kind of art you want, you should know what kind of artist you need. When looking for an artist, look for their creations to see how professional they are at their job.

, If they are, tell them exactly what you want. Be descriptive! You might have to pay them for this ,too.

In this section, you will find all sorts of ideas. You do not have to use all of them. Choose one or two that appeal the most to you!;
, Even if your diary is already fancy, you can still glue some pretty gemstones to the cover. If your diary is plain, but you don't want to go through a lot of effort of making it fancy, you can always add some pretty stickers to the cover.

, For an added touch, add some embroidery to the fabric first, before you glue it on. It can be as simple as several rows of a straight stitch., You can use scrapbook paper, maps, or wrapping paper. You can even design your own cover on the computer, print it out, and use that instead!Use glue to make the cover permanent, or tape to make it temporary.


Cover your finished journal with decoupage glue (such as Mod Podge) or contact paper to protect the paper from getting dirty or wet.

, Cover the front of your journal with a thin layer of liquid glue, then shake some glitter onto it. Wait for it to dry, then brush some glossy decoupage glue (such as Mod Podge) onto it.If you want multiple colors, work with one color at a time. Let each color dry first before moving onto the next.
Make sure that your sealer is glossy. If it is matte, your glitter won't sparkle anymore.
Sealing the glitter is important. It will prevent the journal from shedding all over the place. Consider sealing the edges of the cover as well.

, Wrap duct tape around the cover. Fold the ends of the tape over onto the inside of the cover by 1/2 inch (1.27 centimeters), then trim off the excess. If you are using patterned tape, make sure that the patterns line up!Cover the spine of your journal with contrasting tape. For example, if you use patterned tape for the cover, use solid-colored tape for the spine., There is so much more to decorating than using glue, stickers, and glitter; it also includes things like color, font, and text size. In this section, you'll find lots of ideas for how to decorate the inside of your diary. You don't have to use all of them—choose a few that are the most interesting to you!

, They don't have to be very big or fancy. A simple sketch, such as a flower, heart, or cat can really make your page stand out. Just make sure that it has something to do with what you are writing about!If you don't want to draw, you can always use colorful stickers instead!
This is great for calendars. For example, if you have a party coming up, add a doodle of a cake, present, or balloon!
Another idea is to glue items inside your diary that have something to do with the entry, such as maps, postcards, ticket stubs, and postage stamps!

, This can easily make a plain page look more interesting. You can do this for entry titles, but you can also use it for random words throughout your entry, such as: ""I went to a PARTY and had so much FUN!""Try using caps, bubble letters, block letters, or even cursive.
To create glowing text, write your word first, then trace over each letter using a highlighter., Write your header using a different font from the rest of the page, then draw a cloud or zigzag border around it using a highlighter. For example:Write ""My Birthday List"" using bubble letters, then draw a cloud-shaped outline around it using a highlighter.

, Lay down a strip of washi tape, then write your header on top of it using a pen. Another simple background is to simply highlight the text you want to stand out.


Turn the background into a banner by cutting a V-shaped notch into each end before putting it down., Draw a banner using a pen, then color it in with colored pencils. You can also use a banner-shaped stamp to create the banner instead. Write your header inside the banner., Cut a 1-inch (2.54 centimeters) piece of colored tape, then cut a V-shaped notch into one end. Use this in your calendar to make important dates stand out., A simple way to do this is to draw pretty vines and leaves around the borders of your page. You can also use squiggles, zigzags, and other designs as well. This can turn a simple page into a more fancy one.


You don't have to decorate every page, nor do you have to use the same border each time.

, Some diaries may already have a special first page where you can write your name and the title of your diary. Other diaries have a blank first page. In either case, you'd want to make the first page extra special. Here are some ideas to get you started:


Write your name, the title of your diary in large letters.
If you want, you can add a message that says ""TOP SECRET"" or ""KEEP OUT"", but be warned, if someone finds your diary, this will most likely make them want to read it even more.
Use lots of bright colors. Sparkly or metallic gel pens are great for this!
Decorate the corners and borders with doodles and stickers.

, The act of writing something down will help you get over the anxiety of writing in your diary for the first time.If you'd like, you can decorate the page further with doodles, sketches, or illustrations.

, This is a great way to start a diary that you plan on keeping for the entire year. Include things like your likes, dislikes, hobbies, and other stuff. This way, at the end of the year, you can go back to the begging of your diary and see how much has changed!

, If you don't know what to write about, try to answer some general questions, such as what you are doing or feeling at this exact moment.Alternatively, you can have a box filled with slips of paper that have words and writing prompts written on them. When you don't know what to write about, pick a slip of paper from the box.


You can find all sorts of writing prompts online.
Writing your observations about the world and people around you are a great way to beat writer's block.

, If you can, try writing at the same time each day as well. This can be a precise time, such as 9:00PM or an arbitrary time, such as ""after dinner"" or ""when you wake up.""

, Some people are afraid of writing in a pretty journal because they don't want to ""ruin"" it. If you are one of these people, you might feel better about writing in a cheap, plain notebook. Once you get comfortable writing in one, you can move on to fancier, more expensive ones.

, A planner can make a great diary! Instead of writing your plans in each of the sections, however, write something about what you did, saw, or felt that day!The small spaces will force you to keep your writing focused and to the point.

, It may be easier to scribble it in the half dark. If you go to your PC, you may find the dream has disappeared like smoke in the few yards you’ve crossed to get there.

,, You don’t have to wake up fully to record a dream story or image. You may find that your tone of voice as you relay the dream tells you something about the dream (i.e. you sound angry or sad or delighted.) A disadvantage is that you will probably need to write the dream out, as well, in order to work with it further. Another disadvantage to speaking the dream might be the interference with a partner’s sleep.

, You can do this by simply saying so to yourself. You could also write the date at the top of one of your pages with a note that this will be a dream from the night of etc.

, Write or record it immediately. Even if you only recall an image or a feeling from the dream, get it down in your dream diary. Again, the more attention you give the more the unconscious seems to respond.

, There are many ways to do this. You don’t need a book to begin to interpret the dream. In fact, as you start, a book could lead you away from the dream as something that comes from you, uniquely. A simple way to start is to read the dream and then give it a title. Note in the diary whatever feelings arise when you think of the dream images. If it’s a longer dream, you can divide it into chapters and title the chapters. Circle the words that seem most important and make links to associations that occur to you. You can also make a sketch in the diary of any of the images. Coloring the sketch will tell you even more about the image. Then you can take another step by examining symbols. Not only what does a bird mean to you, but what about ""bird"" as a symbol? What is the interplay between your personal association and the cultural one? When you hit upon a good interpretation, you will feel an ""Ah ha!"" Remember that a dream convey the new, not what you already know and that they are multivalent, meaning that they may have multiple meanings.

Be open and honest.",How to Start a Diary," There are plenty of options for keeping a diary – you don’t need to stick with just a paper version. You can keep a traditional paper diary, but you can also use a website or blog that is private and password protected. You can also simply use a document on your computer.Paper notebooks give you total control and privacy, but you won’t have a backup option unless you make copies.Keep in mind that anything you store online is susceptible to hacking, so even if your online diary is password protected or private, there’s always a chance someone could get in.;
, If you choose to keep a paper diary, you’ll need to actually purchase a diary. You can use any paper notebook as a diary, even something as simple as a one subject spiral notebook or a composition notebook. But you can also go a little bit fancier and choose a leather bound notebook or a notebook with thicker, higher quality paper.Some great options for paper diaries include the 'Leuchtturm' 1917 notebook, Moleskin notebooks, or Whitelines notebooks.Most stores have a notebook section – browse the shelves and see if anything pops out at you. If you don’t love your diary, you probably won’t write in it.
To increase the security of a paper diary, you can purchase one with a lock on it. Just make sure you keep the key in a secure place.

, You have a lot to choose from when it comes to selecting what you’ll use for writing in your diary. You can use a regular ballpoint pen or a pencil, including those you might have at home. You can also mix it up with colored pens, fountain pens, and even colored pencils and markers. The more you enjoy what you’re writing with, the more likely you’ll write regularly.

, If you want to ensure that you write every day, schedule specific writing time. Maybe you’ll like to write first thing in the morning about the day before, or maybe writing in your diary at the end of the day is a good way for you to decompress. When you write is not as important as making sure that you write every day.To make sure you stick to your writing schedule, you can use a smartphone, your watch, or your computer to set a reminder to write every day at the same time.

, On some days you might find it hard to write and other days you might have so much to say you feel like you could write all day. Setting a time limit can give your writing structure and make it easier to turn into a daily routine. Start with ten to fifteen minutes per day. If you find you are always running out of time, you can always increase the amount of time you spend writing.Setting a timer can help you write within the time limit without having to check your watch every few minutes.

, Writing in the same location every day can help you stay committed to writing regularly. If you’re going to the same location every day to write, it will create a pattern and give your writing even more structure. It doesn’t matter where you write – it can be at a coffee shop or a room in your home – as long as you always write in the same place.

, It can be easy to give up on keeping your diary if you put too much pressure on yourself. It’s okay if you occasionally skip a day or two – once you get back into writing, simply jot down short summaries of the days you missed., Sitting in front of a brand-new, blank diary can be a little bit intimidating. If you find yourself stuck, start by writing down one of your favorite quotes or poems. This can help you feel inspired and also takes the pressure off of you to write the first entry in your diary.You can also copy down new poems or quotes as you go.

, Make sure you date every entry you make in your diary. This can be useful if you’re trying to remember when a specific event happened or just to see how your writing – and therefore your life – have evolved over time., Once you begin writing in your diary, don’t feel like you have to commit to one particular type of entry all the way through your diary. You can use traditional paragraph-like entries, but you can also add to-do lists, bullet points, drawings, or even your own poetry. Your diary should be a place for you to record your thoughts, and your thoughts might take different forms on different days., You don’t need to write pages and pages every time you sit down to write in your diary. One paragraph that sums up your day is plenty, especially when you first start writing.


You don't always have to write short entries, however. Sometimes you'll find you have a lot to say about your day or something in particular that happened. It's okay to write long entries in those cases.

, Some days you might have so much - or so little - on your mind that it’s hard to even know where to begin. Try by writing “So right now, I’m…” and just write down whatever comes to your mind first. This can be a great way to get started and you might find that the words flow a lot more easily after that., Sometimes you might wish you could say certain things to certain people. Maybe it’s someone you can’t or don’t talk to anymore, or maybe it’s someone you don’t see regularly. Maybe there are things you need to tell yourself. Using a diary entry to write to other people can bring you closure and help you work out your feelings.If you're not quite sure how to start this type of entry, simply format it as if you're actually writing a letter, with the date and address of the person you're writing to at the top.

, This sounds counterintuitive, but if there’s an event you’d like to forget, it might actually help to write it down. Once you get it out of your head and onto paper, your brain might not hold so tightly to it.For example, let's say something really embarrassing happened to you at school or work. Writing down all the details helps you get them all out of your head, and might prevent you from reliving the event over and over.

, A great way to add to your daily entries is to list the things that you’re grateful for that day. These can be as simple as “the sun was shining” or as detailed as a conversation that you had with a friend. It also helps you keep track of the good things in your life., The best part of keeping a diary is that you can be brutally honest in it without having to worry about being judged. You can write down your deepest fears and biggest secrets without worrying that your diary is going to tell someone else. If you feel like you have to edit yourself, you might be less likely to use the diary, so staying open is key."

Gather your supplies.,
Score your note cards.,
Apply a layer of glue to your cards.,
Prepare your card stock.,
Apply the gold leaf.,
Glue your note cards to the card stock.",How to Make Your Own Notebook1," You should be able to find all the necessary materials at your local craft store. When shopping for gold leaf, avoid the ""peel and stick"" variety. Search for a gold leaf kit that includes gold leaf sheets, adhesive, and a sealer. Gather the following to make your notebook:1 pack of 4"" x 6"" note cards
Glue
Craft knife
Gold leaf kit
Painter's tape
Foam brush
Card stock
Ruler
Bone folder
Pencil
Rubber band or clip;
, Stack your note cards taking care to keep the edges even. Use your craft knife to make small cuts along one of the 4"" edges of your note cards.Scoring your note cards will help the glue stick to the cards, creating a better bond., Bind your cards with a rubber band or a clip. Make sure you keep the edges straight. Use a brush to apply a layer of glue to the scored edge of your note cards.You will need to add a total of 3 layers of glue. Let the first layer of glue dry before adding another., Measure the thickness of your note cards. If you used a single pack of 4"" x 6"" note cards, your stack is probably around 3/4"" thick. If so, measure a piece of card stock that is 12 3/4"" long and 4"" wide.If you are using a different size note card, double the length of the card and add the thickness. For example, if you are using a stack of 4"" x 8"" note cards, you will need to first measure the thickness of the stack, and then add that number to 16"". The width of your card stock will still be 4"".
Using a ruler and bone folder, make two score lines 6"" from each end of card stock. This should leave you with a center strip that is 3/4"" wide. This center strip will be the binding area for your notepad., Turn your card stock over and use your painter's tape to fix it to a flat surface. If you want to make a pattern with the gold leaf, use the painter's tape to make the outline.Apply a thin layer of the gold leaf adhesive to the card stock and let it dry for at least 2 minutes, or until it feels tacky. If you try to apply the gold leaf while the adhesive is still wet, the gold leaf will not stick.Lay a layer of gold leaf down and carefully smooth it out. If you bought your gold leaf in a kit, you should have instructions for applying gold leaf. Most kits come with small sheets of wax paper to help you smooth the gold leaf out. Use your foam brush to further smooth the gold leaf.Once the gold leaf is dry, use your foam brush to wipe away any excess pieces.Apply a thin layer of sealer to the gold leaf. The sealer will prevent the gold leaf from getting scratched. Let the sealer dry and then remove the painter's tape., Turn your card stock over and add some glue to the center strip you marked off earlier. Place the scored and glued side of your note cards into the center strip and hold it in place. Let the glue dry completely before using your notebook."

A rotary cutting mat isn't necessary, but may be useful if you don't have another flat surface to cut on. You'll need the following to make your notebook:Craft knife
PVA glue
Stapler
Graph paper
11x14 Bristol board
Paper cutter
Ruler or straight edge
Corner punch
Large rotary cutting mat

, Trim 10-12 sheets of graph paper and one sheet of Bristol board to 7"" x 5.5"" using your paper cutter., You can make a cover out of plain Bristol board if you like, or you can make your cover more decorative. Use anything from old repair manuals to comic books to personalize your notebook.Apply a layer of PVA glue to your Bristol board. Make sure you have enough to create a firm bond, but don't add so much that it ruins your board.Spread the glue out so that it covers the entire piece of Bristol board. Lay the board on your chosen cover and smooth it out using a ruler or straight edge. Try to remove any air bubbles that might pop up.Trim any excess cover material from the edges using your craft knife., Stack your sheets of graph paper so the edges are flush. Place your cover on top of the graph paper, keeping all the edges flush, and use your ruler to measure 3.5"" in.If it helps, mark the middle of your cover with a pencil so you know where the spine is.

, Keeping the pages straight, add at least three staples down the spine of your notebook. Space your staples evenly down the spine.Use a straight edge on the center fold. Place your ruler along the staples and fold one end of your notebook over. This will ensure you get a straight fold and will keep your notebook even.Use a corner punch if you plan on carrying your notebook around in your pocket or purse. Rounding the corners can help keep the pages from getting bent."

Add the cover to your notebook.,
Trim the cover.",How to Make Your Own Notebook3," Making a Moleskine style notebook requires some special supplies. You should be able to find everything you need online or at your local craft store. You'll need the following to make your notebook:


24 sheets of 8 1/2"" x 11"" computer paper
1 sheet of 8 1/2"" x 11"" vellum, or marbled paper
1 piece of 9"" x 5 5/8"" Naugahyde
1 sheet of 1 1/2"" x 5"" cheesecloth
Upholstery thread
Small sheet of wax paper
Bookbinder's or other large needle
Beeswax
Bookbinder's awl
PVA glue
Craft knife
Ruler
T-square and triangle
Pencil
Bone folder
Binder clips

, Each sheet of 8 1/2"" x 11"" paper will give you two sheets of 7"" x 5 1/2"" paper for your notebook. Use your T-square and triangle to make cut lines on one sheet of paper. This sheet will serve as a guide so you can cut multiple sheets at a time.


Stack anywhere between 6 and 12 sheets together and make sure the edges are flush. Place your guide sheet on top of the stack. Use your T-square as a straight edge, and use your craft knife to cut through the stack.
Cutting multiple sheets of paper may be difficult, so start with fewer until you feel comfortable cutting more.
Repeat this process until you have cut all 24 sheets of paper, and your vellum, down to the correct size.

, Use your bone folder to fold each piece of paper, or folio, in half. If you need to, make a mark at the 3 1/2"" line along the long edge of each sheet.


Try to make your folds as strong as possible so that you can lay each sheet flat.
Fold your vellum in the same way, and set it aside for later.

, Take six of your folded pieces of paper and collate them by stacking one piece on top of the other. Once you've stacked six pieces, fold them and lay them flat. They should look like small booklets. Try to keep the sheets aligned on the bottom and the spine.


Repeat this process with the remaining sheets, working six at a time. When you finish a set, stack it on top of the previous booklet. As you work, keep all the edges lined up, even those of the finished booklets.
Keep each booklet, or signature, in the same direction.

, Take your stack of signatures and make sure the spines and bottom edges are all in line. Bind them all together using binder clips. Place one at the top, and one at the bottom.


Don't worry if the top edge is a little jagged. This is the edge where you made your cuts, and it's normal for it to be a little off. Just make sure your spines and bottom edges are in line.
Measure 1/2"" from the bottom edge of one of the spines and make a mark with your pencil. On the same spine, make three more marks, one at 2"", one at 3 1/2"", and one at 5"". Mark the remaining spines according to these marks.

, Take the binder clips off your stack of signatures. Take one of your signatures and open it. Place the crease on the edge of a desk, or something you don't mind poking holes into. Use your awl or a large needle to punch a hole in each of the marks you made on the spine.


Take care to make sure each hole is on the edge of the spine, and not in the sheet itself. This may take some practice. You may have better luck if you lay the signature flat on a piece of cardboard and punch all the way through. If you try this method, make sure your pages don't slip out of alignment.
Repeat this process with the remaining signatures.

, It's better to have more thread than not enough, so make it a little longer if you want to be safe.


You want the thread to be equal to the number of signatures multiplied by the height of the spine. The spine in this notebook is 5 1/2"" and there are a total of 8 signatures. If you choose to make a smaller notebook, or one with fewer pages, follow this formula to determine how much thread you need.
Thread the needle and pull around 6"" through. Use the beeswax to wax the thread. The beeswax is optional, but it should make sewing a lot easier.

, Open one of your signatures to the center and push your needle through the bottom set of holes from the outside. Pull all but 2"" through the hole.


Move to the next hole, and push your needle from the inside to the outside. Pull all the slack outside. Push your needle through the third hole, moving from the outside to the inside, and then from the inside out on the fourth hole.
When you finish on the fourth hole, pull all the slack out of the signature. Hold the short piece of thread at the bottom and pull the rest of the thread in line with the spine. If you pull at a ninety degree angle, you run the risk of tearing the holes.

, Grab another signature and place it next to the one you just finished sewing. Push your needle into the top hole of the second signature and pull the thread taught. Keep the spines of the signatures close together.


Push the needle through the second hole from the inside of the second signature. Then, push the needle through the corresponding hole of the first signature. Keep the thread somewhat taught throughout the binding process.
Next, push the needle out of the third hole on the first signature. You should be threading in the opposite direction as you were when you made your first pass through the first signature. Push your needle through the corresponding hole in the second signature, working from the outside in.
You should be on the final hole of the second signature now. Push your needle from the inside out on the fourth hole of the second signature.

, You should see two pieces of thread hanging from the bottom of each signature. Tie the two signatures together using a square knot.


Take the two pieces of thread and cross them. Run the right hand knot under the left hand knot, and then back over. Pull this bottom knot somewhat taught.Then, cross the two pieces of thread at the top, again keeping the right hand piece on top of the left hand piece. Wrap the right hand piece around the left hand piece and pull the knot tight.You can triple tie the knot if you want extra security, but it is not necessary. Don't cut any of the excess thread off yet.

, Place the third signature next to the first two. Sew through the third signature using the same method as you did with the first two. Make sure to run your needle through the third and second signatures to sew them together.


The last hole you exit on the third signature should be the top hole. To secure the third signature to the first and second, use a kettle stitch. Take your needle and run it under the thread that binds the first and second signature together on the top hole. Pull the thread tight through the loop.
Use a kettle stitch each time you exit the last hole of a signature. The holes you end on will alternate from top to bottom with each new signature.
Repeat this process until you have sewn all your signatures together. When you have sewn all the signatures together, tie the ends of the thread together and cut any excess thread off.

, Place your sewn signatures between a set of heavy books or weights. Leave a small amount of the spine sticking out.


Apply a layer of glue along the spine. Take care not to let any glue bleed between the pages. Push the ends of the thread down and apply a layer of glue over them as well.
Cut your cheesecloth so that it is a little shorter than the spine and 3-4 times as wide. Make sure the cheesecloth is centered on the spine and glue it down. You can add a layer of glue on top of the cheesecloth to ensure you have a good bond. Let the glue dry overnight before adding the cover.

, Place a piece of wax paper under the first page of your book. Make sure the wax paper is larger than the page. The wax paper will prevent you from getting any glue on the rest of your book.


Spread a layer of glue on the first page and place a piece of the cut vellum on top of it. Make sure all the edges are in line and press the vellum down firmly.
Add another layer of glue to the top of the vellum. Wrap some of the cheesecloth that is hanging off the spine over the top of the vellum. You may need to add a little more glue on top of the cheesecloth to make a firm bond.
Take your Naugahyde and line it up over the vellum. Drape the other end of the Naugahyde over the spine, or fold it around to the back of your book. Press the Naugahyde into the glue firmly.
When the cover dries to one side of your notebook, repeat this process on the other side.
When you are ready to glue the other side, make sure to pull the cover tight around the notebook. Place the notebook between heavy books or weights when you finish gluing the cover, and let it dry overnight.

, When your notebook is dry, you may need to trim some excess material from the cover. Make the cover a little larger than the rest of the notebook to protect your pages.

Journal prompts are a great way to think more deeply about things that inspire you and to spark new ideas.Pick a quote that you’ve been inspired about. Use the quote as a prompt to write a short story or reflect on how the quote makes you feel.
Ask yourself “what if” questions, like what if I started my dream job tomorrow or what if I suddenly knew how to fly.
Commit to trying a new journal prompt each week and incorporate it into your writing schedule. , As you're working on filling your journal, or after you have finished your journal, read what you've written. Take this as an opportunity to reflect upon thoughts that you had, quotes you liked, and dreams that you had.


Rereading your journal can be a great way to reflect upon the progress that you've made over time in your life or in your goals.
Use your journal to feel inspired whenever you're feeling down or if you need some encouragement.

Or, you might try an app on your phone that uses speech-to-text technology. No matter which sort you choose, the main thing is to be able to access it as soon as you wake up.
If you’re interested in seeing patterns in your dreams, try writing a title on each one for easier indexing.
Consider analyzing your dreams using a dream dictionary, or by looking carefully at the imagery you see recurring in your dreams and thinking about what it might mean.;
, This kind of diary can be fun to create if you’re thinking about the possibility of your children, grandchildren, or great-grandchildren reading your diary in the future.

Rediscover your passion for writing.,
Experiment with your friends & family: Friends & family can help you, be at your side when you need them most.,
Don't get too carried away with their comments: Most family members will tell you is that your article is good.,
Write more than 5 articles in the beginning: A good writer is most essentially a prolific one.,
Articles should represent your point of view and not you.,
Start a Blog: Blogs are in!,
Practice sitting for hours with your laptop.,
Speed up office assignments.,
Don't get discouraged by online scams.,
Research research research.,
Spend at least half a day per selected agency.,
Write a pleasant article.,
Don't demand or expect an astronomical pay.,
Submit the article but don't give up.",How to Become an Online Freelance Writer," A profession like online writing is definitely for someone who has had a flair for writing. Maybe a small poem for the school magazine , a short essay for the college daily- the love for penning down thoughts in a manner that appeals to others...is the only criteria required. There will come a point in life, when every other thing around you becomes mundane enough or you want that extra little income. Freelance writing is just the option for you!;
, This is the time. Make them go through, in some degree of detail, the very first thoughts that springs from your mind onto paper (or a word doc). More importantly so, if you are writing after long years of inaction. And yes, listen to every feedback they give you. They are your first readers, after all.

, But make sure, they do not score a 10/10 for an article written badly. Ask them to give you a frank opinion or an objective view, no matter how bad that might sound to you. This will ensure that the world outside doesn't come back to you with harsher comments or you are able to take the discouragement that might be associated with your first (few)publications.

, The easiest way to give a good launch to your freelance writing career is to write a lot. Review the book that you read lately or a movie you liked. You can write about job hassles, misadventures with your boss or colleagues, a relaxed evening spent with your sweetheart or a good date that you had lately. If you have kids, you will never run out of topics to write about!

, Writing an article about yourself (or others) should not sound like a private opinion. Remember, there is a difference between writing your personal diary and writing an article about yourself. Be personal but draw a line, where it is required. Similarly, if you are writing about a particular topic or a social issue, make sure there are some facts in there (Google/Wikipedia provide you with loads of them) and not just your associated thoughts.

, They are free (literally) for you to play around, go wild with your thoughts and post whatever you like. But again be careful that whatever you are posting will be read by editors with whom you may apply a future freelance job. So act accordingly. Project that part of you that can make your career as a successful freelance writer. This blog should be your forte, your strength, the expression of your freedom.

, If you are a homemaker, finish the laundry, the dishes, the cooking, get plenty of cushions and go! This is definitely going to take time and needs peace & quiet! When a train of thoughts start flowing, it is wise to convert them to words immediately lest they be forgotten within the next few minutes. A beautiful word, a funny line, a thought-provoking quote... generally don't come back to you by the time you grab that cookie from kitchen or have a quick chat with your next door neighbor.

, Office goers who are planning to freelance have a tough job to do as well. Balancing work, home and writing is definitely a challenge. Its still easy if you work in shifts, but a regular 9 to 6 job requires either late nights or early morning sacrifices to be made. Plus it also depends on whether you are a morning person or a nocturnal one! This job requires hours and you should do whatever possible to give it a good, smart start.

, You will read about scores of scams, negative feedback, bad experiences etc. that people share, regarding their experience as online/print freelance writers. If you are starting your career as one, you also shall have your own share of sour sagas to narrate after some time. But don't let that clip the wings of your newly happening writing career. Always remember that tenacity and perseverance pay (literally!)

, Yes, you just have to do plenty of it. Research on the web for all the agencies that give offer paid freelancing jobs. Make sure these sites are legitimate. Online user reviews will also give you a lot of information. Google, Bing or any other popular search engines might give you plenty of attractive ads but it is up to you to choose whether the agencies are authentic enough. Preferably, go for those people who offer an income (there are others to whom you have to pay for getting offers/jobs). In the end, bookmark the important sites and check if others have bookmarked them too.

, Once you have shortlisted the agencies for whom your are going to contribute articles, research some more on them. Read reviews, published articles, testimonials, photographs of any meetings or camps they had in the past. The form you fill to subscribe to this agency should have proper online security checks. Don't give your email Id out randomly (the barge of spam will be too much to handle; plus there are added online security risks). Tread carefully and start by choosing just one, highly reliable web agency.

, Your first article should impress. The editors of the online agency will have tons of articles to skim through. Make their job easy & the freelancing job is yours! Your article should be precise, light (flowery or eloquent speeches are most unwelcome), slightly humorous and attention grabbing. Check out for spell, formatting & grammatical errors. The editors should be able to picture the reader enjoying this article & giving them a thumbs up.

, Some freelance agencies that will ask you your expectations. Don't stretch out to your limits & name an amount that will repel them. Be modest and give ask for a moderate pay. Prices differ across agencies, jobs, countries and also the experience level of writers. As you are new, chances are that you are not quite known in the industry and will be paid accordingly. Most importantly, don't fall for websites that offer you that six-figure pay. The generally end up duping you royally.

, After submitting the article, keep your expectations low.If you are in luck and the agency selection is good, you have a fair chance of getting the amount that has been promised to you. But in case you don't get a dime, don't be disheartened. There are plenty of other opportunities. Try sending the articles to other online agencies or publications and keep the persistence up. If your work is good, you will surely be noticed & get the kind of work you want.

If you find your parents skimming through your diary, sit down with them and talk.",How to Keep Your Diary a Secret," Like, don't buy a diary that says 'diary' across the front. Just buy a cute one that could be a school textbook, or whatever. It's a good idea to buy your diary when you are out alone, so that nobody gets suspicious.;
, Not in the typical places, like under your bed or in a pillowcase. Hide it between the mattresses of your bed, In that purse at the back of your closet you never use, or even tucked away in the back of your bookshelf.

,, Across it, write, 'my diary, do not enter'. Inside, write a few pages of fake entries.

Substitute letters for other letters.,
Substitute your own symbols for letters.,
Substitute letters from another language.,
Substitute equations for numbers.,
Be aware that substitution ciphers can be broken.",How to Make a Secret Note2," In a simple substitution cipher, you can assigning letter values to other letters. For example, A may equal C and and F might equal J. Make sure you don’t choose easy combinations like A = B or A = Z. They’ll be easily broken.Make decoder rings. Those decoder rings you got in a box of cereal years ago may come in handy, but you can make your own too if you want. Write your letters, A through Z, in a large circle. Then, write the substituted letters inside the large circle to form their own smaller circle. Now you’ll have a key for your cipher.
Randomize the cipher. Once you’ve got your keys and your friends have theirs too, you can cut out both rings from the paper. Turn the smaller ring inside the larger outer ring to create new substitutions. When you pass your note, write what A equals, and the reader will know where to set their rings.

, To make a slightly more complicated substitution cipher, you can make your own simple symbols to stand in for letters. The more each symbol looks different than the letter it represents, the harder the code will be to crack. Make sure each symbol is also simple and easy to draw quickly.Create a key for your new language. Make a master key that shows which letter matches up with each symbol. As you practice writing in your new script, you’ll become more familiar with the symbols, but you’ll need a key at first to remember which is which.
Share the key with friends. Your language won’t be of much use if only you can read the notes you pass! Share the key with your friends, advising them to keep it safe so that no one else finds and learns the symbols.
Write your messages in the new language. Practice the symbols until you can read and write them as quickly as your native language. It’ll take a while, but you’ll get to know the symbols well over time.

, For example, swap A with (α) Alpha, B with (β) Beta, C with (Χ) Chi, etc. from the Greek alphabet..


Use similar characters for missing letters. Some foreign alphabets may not contain all the letters in your language. Greek doesn't have Y, but there's a visually similar Upsilon (Y in capitals), so you might use that instead. Make sure your reader knows that you’re going to be substituting some letters for others not in the language.
Test some examples. For example: ""See you tonight"" becomes ""ΣΕΕ ΤΗΟΥ ΤΟΝΙΓΗΤ,” with “you” subbed out for “thou” because Greek doesn’t have a character for “Y”.

, Numbers tend to stick out in messages with a lot of text, so try to find a better way to to hide them in your cipher. For example, replace the ""8"" in ""See you tonight, 8 o'clock"" with ""√(128/2)"". The 8 is replaced by a simple math: the square root of (128/2=64)=8.

, It’s relatively easy to crack a substitution code, because you’re still using your native language and only swapping out the letters for other letters or symbols. Words like “and”, “you” and “the”, which will show up frequently in your messages, and can be found out and used to piece together parts of a key. Common letters like E, T and A also help code-breakers to decipher your message."
"
Use a simple transposition cipher.,
Use the snake method.",How to Make a Secret Note3," Transposition codes take your normal message and rearrange the letters according to a simple, agreed upon rule. This type of cipher can be harder to crack than a substitution cipher, because there will be no frequently used words to be found: they’ll all be scrambled.Write your message normally. Because you’re going to be scrambling the message, you’ll need the normal message as a starting place. Choose something simple to start with like, “How are you today”
Decide how to rearrange the letters. A simple transposition cipher, for example, might take each letter and place them in reverse order within the word, but not the sentence. “How are you today” would become “woh era uoy yadot”.
Let your friends know the rearranging order. They’ll need to know how you scrambled the words so that they can read your messages. Pick something a little more difficult than just reversing the letters, as the example of “woh era uoy yadot” can be easily cracked.
Try using a matrix. Draw large box on a piece of paper and divide it evenly into rows and columns. Write your normal message with one letter written in each smaller box. Your new message will be made by making the vertical columns into sentences instead of the horizontal ones. To decode, your friends will have to make their own grid, write the sentences vertically, then read left to right as normal., This method is a type of transposition cipher, in that the letters are written and arranged up and down a paper instead of straight across, creating a block of text. Be aware that this may be easy to crack, because none of the words are scrambled.


Write your message starting in one of the corners of the paper. Make a column up or down from where you started. Write in a straight line all the way to the next edge of the paper.
Write the next column when you reach the edge. Once you reach the edge of the first column, start writing the next line in the opposite direction. If you started writing upwards from the bottom left corner, you’ll now write in a line going down to the next edge of the page.
Repeat for each column. Continue writing your message up and down the paper, like a snake. When looked at by anyone else, they’ll only see a block of text that makes no sense when read from left to right.
Sign your message with a small snake. Your friends will know how you’ve written the message and how to read it. Meanwhile, no one else will know what it means.

"
"
Use a passage cipher.,
Use a Book Cipher.",How to Make a Secret Note4," Choose a short passage, making sure that every letter in the alphabet is used to begin a word in the passage. If it’s too hard to find one with any Xs and Zs, you can write your own.


Number each of the words. Starting with the first word in the passage, count the words and then number them left to write. It should look like: “A1 fine2 day3 to4 go5 out6 running7…”, etc.
Write your message using the numbers. In the example, A = 1, F = 2, D = 3, 4 = T, 5 = G, 6 = O and 7 = R. To spell the word “far”, you’d write 217.
Share the passage with your friends. Leave it un-numbered, and have them count the letters mentally. To everyone else, the key will look like a normal paragraph, and no one will know it’s the key to a code.

, Like a passage cipher, you’ll use the words in the book to make up the words of your message. You’ll make up a rule that determines how the words are found, and this will be used to transmit them message.Pick your book. This should be a common book that both you and the receiver of the message own. It must be the exact same edition so that the words and pages are in exactly the same places.
Determine your method. Book ciphers often use three numbers separated by commas to denote information. (100,28,5) might mean that the target word is on the 100th page, the 28th line and the 5th word in that line.
Write your messages using the method. Your “words” will be made up of groups of numbers and almost impossible to break. Book ciphers are so difficult to crack because to break it, someone will have to know and possess the exact edition of the book you used.

Choose your favorite format.,
Vary your diary entries.,
Experiment with pens and pencils.,
Try setting up an online diary.",How to Make a Diary Interesting2," Do you want to write in an elegant handwritten journal? Or would you rather create a daily blog? There are benefits to both. A handwritten diary can be easily carried in your purse, backpack, or even in a pocket. An online blog is more interactive, and you can include links to other sites, photos, respond to comments, etc.


Try different formats until you know what you prefer.
Personalize your diary to express your personality, using stickers, drawings, photographs, widgets, or anything else that you might want to include.

, You might sometimes write long entries, and other times just a quote that caught your attention. Include mementos of your day, such as flowers pressed between the pages of your diary, or a special card or paper wrapper. You might want to add a photo of something you saw that day, which may be accompanied by a story...or, it might not.Try cartooning a diary entry. Particularly if you’ve never drawn before, this can be a fun thing to try to make your diary interesting.
Write a daily entry in haiku, or another kind of poem for variety.

, If you write your diary by hand, try writing with a variety of pens or pencils. Writing in colored ink may change the things that you think to write about, or you might try color-coding your thoughts. Writing with a calligraphy pen or a fine fountain pen might lead to new ideas.If you write with a pencil, you can easily include sketches in your diary. Colored pencils can also lend themselves to new and interesting ideas.
Try writing with gel pens, ballpoint pens, felt-tipped pens, fine-tipped or thicker tipped pens.

, If you've never tried creating a diary online, explore some of the free options such as Penzu, Dear Diary, My Diary or Diary.com. Popular blogging programs, like WordPress, Live Journal, and Blogger, can also be set on ""private"" settings and used as a diary.Digital diaries have many possibilities for personalization, and allow you to be very creative with content. For example, you could include audio clips, or video options.
Consider adding more photographs or other images to express your feelings.
Some online sites allow for more social interaction than others. Remember, you can select what you want to share even on a public blog site.

Reread your diary to see your progress.,
Remember that a diary provides accountability.,
Commit to a daily writing practice.",How to Make a Diary Interesting3," Whether you’re using your diary to record your goals, getting over a romantic breakup, or using it to chart your travels, it can be fun to look back across your earlier pages to see the progress you’ve made. Successes can be easily forgotten. One of the best things about a diary is that you’ll have evidence of your own personal progress.Reading about the hard times will remind you that you have what it takes to get beyond them. You’ll be able to see evidence of achieving goals, working through frustrations, and overcoming adversity.
Keeping a journal can remind you to articulate steps you’ve taken to work towards your goals.

, Even if no one ever reads your diary, writing down your goals, and steps taken towards those goals, tends to keep you more focussed on doing the things you said you would do. Writing down the things you’ve done every day that lead you towards your goal, as well as the things you’ve left undone, will help you stay on track.When you start to see the tangible results of your actions, you’re more likely to want to continue to move towards your goals.

, Find a time of the day that’s best for you to sit down and write in your diary. For many people, this is first thing in the morning. It can be any time of the day when you can find a time that’s relatively undisturbed. Some people use their lunch breaks to write in their diaries. Others find it easiest to write in the 30 minutes before bed.No matter what time you find works best for you, make sure to prioritize this time. Try not to schedule other things that conflict with the time.
Even though you’re making a commitment to write every day, try to think of your writing time as a special treat that you’re giving yourself. Maybe pair your writing time with a favorite beverage or snack. If you start to think of it as a chore, you’re heading in the wrong direction.

"
"
Add details to your diary entries.,
Write a title for each diary entry.,
Think about including a “Table of Contents.” If you’re writing in a paper notebook, set aside several pages at the beginning in order to insert a “Table of Contents” as you go.,
Consider writing for an “ideal reader.” You may not ever plan to have your diary read, or you may be blogging online under a pseudonym.,
Use writing prompts.",How to Make a Diary Interesting4," The more details you can add to each day’s entry, the more interesting it will be to read -- and to write! If you’re writing about the events of the day, for example, include who you saw, where you were, what you were doing there.Think about adding sensory information to really make your diary entry realistic. What did you smell? What was the light like? What did you hear during the situation you’re writing about? Was your body cold, or hot? All of these details can be interesting to consider.
If you were outside, think about what details you noticed that let you know what time of day it was, or what the season was like. For example, you might include the jonquils that hadn’t yet started to bloom, and the frost melting on the grass.

, Not only can writing a title to summarize your main point of each entry be interesting, but this practice will help you should you want to come back to your diary for information later. The title can be short, only a few words, and summarize the main gist of your entry.


For example, you might write: Clarke Family Reunion, Day One. Battlefield, Tennessee. If you’re processing your feelings following a breakup, your title might be the date, and a short descriptive phrase, such as “Feeling lonely, but called a friend.”
If you’re writing a travel diary, the title might be the date, and location you’re writing. For example, May 13, 2015. Copenhagen. Fish Market.

, If you’ve included a list of titles for your entries, you can then go back through and write down the titles and page numbers for easy referencing.Diaries may just be a way to process your feelings in the present moment, but you may want to go back to them in the future to refresh your memory on what your life was like.
Number each page as you go, if the pages don’t already have numbers.

, No matter what format you’re using for your diary, it can help your writing be more interesting if you’re focused on writing for an ideal reader. After all, think about how much more interesting it is to tell a story to a receptive friend than it is to repeat it to an empty room.Some people write diaries imagining their children may read them years in the future. If this is the case for you, what details would you want to be sure and include?
Sometimes the ideal reader is someone much like yourself, who may have the same hardships, struggles, and successes that you do. If that’s true, then you might want to include periodic affirmations as a way to encourage your reader (and yourself!)

, If you’re stuck for ideas about what to write in your diary, try looking at a list of writing prompts. You might want to write about the past: What was your younger self like? Where did you go to grade school? Who was your best friend, and what was that friend like? What did you do together? Try writing a letter to yourself as a younger person.You might write about the future. For example, what do you think your life might be like in 5, 10, or 15 years? What do you hope will be different? Are there parts of your life that you hope remain the same? Writing letters to future children or grandchildren can be an interesting topic to write about in your diary.
Be imaginative and creative. Writing about your special superpower (real or imagined!) or imagining your ideal mate can be quite entertaining, but also useful in learning more about yourself.

Gather paper for the pages.,
Make a glued binding.,
Make a threaded binding.,
Create a cover.,
Add a lock if you wish.",How to Make Your Own Diary1," Select the type and size of paper you’d like to use for the pages you’ll write on in your diary. Use simple printer paper, colored paper, scrapbook paper, or any other lined or unlined style of your choosing.


For a thinner diary or one with threaded binding, fold larger pieces in half and stack them inside one another so you have a set of several folded pages. Note that this will work best with 10 folded pieces of paper (called folios) or less, though you could attach several of these together.You may want to trim the outer edges of the paper when doing the folio method, as the inside folios will stick out further than the outer ones.
For a thicker diary or one with a glued binding, keep a stack of paper flat with the edges lined up evenly.;
, Gather together a stack of paper that you want to use for the pages of your diary and make sure the edges are lined up evenly. Hold them together with binder clips and apply glue to the edge where you want the spine to be.


Place scraps of paper under the binder clips to protect your paper from becoming indented or marked by them.
Use a paintbrush or foam brush to apply a light layer of PVA or Elmer’s Glue to the edge of the stack you want to bind, where the spine of the diary will be. Let dry and apply more coats if necessary.Glue the bound edge of the paper to a cover made of heavy paper, cardstock, fabric, etc. Or, create a quick and easy spine with some colorful duct tape or similar heavy tape over the glued edge of the paper.

, Fold 10 pieces of paper or less in half and place them inside one another. Open up this stack, called a folio, to the inner fold to mark and pierce holes for threading the pages together.


Make three marks evenly spaced along the fold for the holes. Use an awl meant for bookbinding to make the holes if you have one, or simply use a needle thick enough to pierce through the pages that you have.
Cut linen thread or waxed string to at least four times the height of the paper you’re using. Using a needle, thread it through the middle hole to the inside of the fold, then out through the top hole. Then push it through the bottom hole to the inside of the fold, and out once more through the middle hole.
With the excess string, tie a double knot over the thread that spans the two outer holes, then trim the excess.If you’d like to thread several folios together, thread them individually and tie them together with the excess thread in the center. Or secure them more firmly with a few extra “stitches” to hold them together at the top and bottom holes.

, Wrap a piece of thicker paper, cardstock, fabric, or leather around your paper to create a durable front and back cover to keep the pages safe. You can also glue several pieces of paper together to create a cover that is thicker.


Measure to cut the cover to the same size as your inner pages, or slightly larger (about ¼-½ inch, for example) if you wish.
If you use one piece of material to wrap over the front and back sides of your diary, remember to account for the width of both sides, plus the width of the spine after gluing or threading. You may also want to add a couple of centimeters to the total, to account for any length lost when folding the material over the spine.
If you bound your pages with thread, adding a cover is optional or may be done before threading. If you bound your pages with glue, you should glue the bound edge into the center of your cover where the spine will be.

, Make a “secret diary” by adding a lock to your homemade notebook to prevent others without the key or combo from opening it. Do this by adding loops to the front and back cover that you can put a small toy lock through.


Purchase a small toy lock that has a key or requires a combination to open.
Make two small loops out of string, fabric, or even use metal jewelry fasteners to glue to the inside outer edge of both the front and back cover of the diary. Make sure whatever loops you use allow your lock to go through both of them and close securely.You can hide where you glue the loops to the covers by placing a piece of paper, fabric, or colorful tape over the area.

Make invisible ink with a lemon.,
Make corn-starch invisible ink.,
Make a mini whiteboard.",How to Make a Secret Note5," Invisible ink can be made from lemon juice and water. The lemon juice mixture is clear when applied to paper, but turns brown when heated up due to oxidization. This makes passing secret notes easy, because no one will even know you’ve written anything on the paper.Squeeze half of a lemon into a small bowl and mix in a few drops of water.
Use a paintbrush to apply the lemon juice to the paper, writing as you normally would. Make sure not to use too much of the liquid, as it can make the paper fall soggy and it could fall apart.
To decode, heat the paper with a hair dryer, or hold it under a warm light bulb. The clear lemon juice will slowly turn brown as it warms up.

, This invisible ink takes a few more obscure ingredients than lemon juice alone, but if you have corn starch and iodine, it works just as well. You'll need access to a stove too.Mix two tablespoons of corn starch and four tablespoons of water in a small pot.
Heat the mixture on medium heat until warm, but not hot: around 3 or 4 minutes.
Dip a toothpick into the corn starch solution and use it to write your message on the paper. It will dry clear and look like a normal piece of paper.
To make the decoding solution, mix one teaspoon of iodine with ten teaspoons of water in a bowl. Mix well.
Dip a sponge in the iodine solution and wring it out so it's damp. Carefully wipe the sponge over the paper to decode the message: it should turn purple. Be careful not to make the paper too damp and soggy!

, This method doesn't create a hidden message, per se, but it allows the receiver of the message to wipe it away quickly and easily. This will keep any message safe from prying eyes and essentially hidden. You'll need glossy tape, a small notecard or paper and a felt tipped pen.


Cover a small card or paper with tape. Make sure the it’s the glossy kind of tape, like packing tape, not the matte “invisible” type of tape.
Write your message on the tape with a felt tipped pen.
Pass the note to your friend. It will look like an ordinary note: colored marker on regular paper.
Your friend can now easily wipe the message in felt tipped pen off of the glossy surface, destroying the secret message as soon as it's read.

Learn to write well.,
Learn to shoot photos and video.,
Learn about other sports.,
Round out your knowledge.,
Do an internship.",How to Become a Baseball Writer1," The most important thing you must learn before becoming a baseball writer is how to write effectively. However passionate about the sport you might be, unless you can write an article that is interesting to read and conforms to conventions of journalistic style, you will never be a baseball writer.


In the words of one professional sportswriter, ""You are very unlikely to start as a sports journalist …What you need to do is to become a journalist first.""Many people who become baseball journalists have to get some experiencing writing other kinds of stories first. Regardless of what type of journalist you are, you must master the craft of journalism.
This does not, necessarily, mean getting a college degree in journalism. Many sportswriters have degrees in other fields such as English, and learn the specifics of journalism outside the classroom.That said, a journalism degree is helpful both in applying for jobs and developing the necessary skills to be a successful baseball writer.Some universities even have programs that allow you to specialize in sports journalism. You should give serious consideration to this option.;
, Increasingly, journalists of all stripes are expected to have multimedia skills. This is especially true of sports journalists, who are often expected to take pictures, shoot, and even edit video as part of their reporting.Mastery of these skills will help you get a job, and a journalism degree program can help you develop these abilities.
While the need to shoot video is most common for television journalism, as newspapers move online, they are also increasingly expecting journalists to produce video and other multimedia content.You should also be comfortable with blogs and social media, as many journalistic institutions will expect you to produce these types of content on their behalf as well.

, It goes without saying that you should learn all you can about baseball. To increase your likelihood of successfully getting a job as a baseball writer though, it will also be a good idea to learn enough about other sports to write about them as well.


This may seem odd on first consideration, but many sports journalists start off as ""general assignment"" sports writers at small publications that may not have writers who are dedicated to baseball specifically.Being able to write confidently about other sports will help you get one of these positions, which can then become a stepping stone to a baseball-specific job at another media outlet.

, To make yourself a competitive candidate in sports journalism jobs, it's a good idea to develop a knowledge of a variety of other topics and skills as well. If you have the opportunity in college, take some courses that will round out your knowledge. It is helpful to develop some background in:Business and economics (major league baseball is a business!)
Statistics
Data presentation and analysis
History
Sports management

, As in any other area of journalism, getting an internship during your last year of college is a very valuable experience that can make you a better writer and more qualified job applicant.Any journalism internship can help, but if you can find one that is baseball (or even just sports) specific, that will be most helpful.
Many newspapers offer internships in sports writing. Check to see if one in your area does.
An internship is a great way to develop more writing experience, a better sense of how news organizations works, and connections that can help you land your first job.

Luckily, it is easier than ever to make this happen. Once you have your book written, find a platform online that enables you to publish an e-book, or find a print publisher that will make hard copies of your book.


The key to successful self-publishing is relentless promotion of your book. If you are not going to promote your book yourself, you shouldn’t expect that your book will be very successful.

, There are a ton of different types of outlets that need writing. These may be topical, such as travel websites, instructional websites, technical magazines, or erotica. Start-ups need writing on their websites, brochures, ad copy, and so on."

, While many people may only promote themselves online, there are other ways to promote yourself. These “low-tech” ways may even reach people you aren’t reaching online, exposing you to more potential business.


Try making a brochure, or attend a writer’s conference. You can also place ads in a local or regional newspaper or on Craigslist.

, It may be uncomfortable for you to talk about what a skilled writer you are. But if you want others to believe it, you need to tell them. This doesn’t mean that you need to constantly talk about how great you are, but you need enough confidence to reassure a potential employer that you have the chops necessary to do a good job.

Sports ethics (e.g. major ethical controversies, such as steroid use)
Baseball and medicine (e.g. common injuries and treatments)
Baseball in other countries
College baseball
Take every opportunity you can to learn more about baseball. Read books about the sport, watch documentaries, listen to podcasts, and go to games.

, It is common in sports journalism for great players or games to be compared to those who came before them. It may not seem important to know who the top players were in the 1950s, but having this knowledge will be helpful in understanding the culture of baseball, and in writing about it effectively.Many people who are really interested in baseball history will watch or listen to old games from years gone by to get a deep understanding. Many historic games can be watched on YouTube.

Apply for positions.,
Join the BBWAA.",How to Become a Baseball Writer3," A ""freelance"" journalist is one who doesn't work for a specific news outlet, but writes independently and seeks to sell articles to publications one at a time. Many sportswriters get their early writing experience in this way.This allows you to work from the comfort of your home and write stories about topics that most interest you. It is hard to make a living doing freelance work, but it's a good way to start getting your name out.
In addition to newspapers and magazines, some websites, such as todaysknuckleball.com will pay for high-quality baseball articles written by freelance writers., No baseball writer (or any other sports journalist) goes straight from college to writing for Sports Illustrated. Start by looking for jobs at small publications, such as small town newspapers and radio stations.By the same token, when you land a job at a small publication, you won't probably start out covering major league baseball games. If you can get a sports writing job at all, expect to start out covering little league or high school games.

, It is hard to get into baseball writing as a career, because many people want to be sports journalists. Be prepared to struggle for the first months or even years of your career while you establish yourself. You'll be both busy and broke.

When you start looking into jobs, look into the media organizations you would most like to work for. Where are they located? Would you be willing to move there for the right offer?, Baseball writers have to work very hard during baseball season. If you get a job covering major league baseball, expect baseball to become your life, at least during the season.You will work long hours and have little free time to enjoy other pursuits.
You should also expect to work major holidays during baseball season, such as the 4th of July, rather than enjoying them with friends and family.

, During the season, you will also need to travel extensively with the team you cover. You will often need to be away from home for periods of two weeks or more., If, after considering all of these factors, this sounds like a job you want, work hard and make it happen. For the right person, being a baseball writer is the best job in the world."

Talk about Author's Notes.,
Contemplate.,
Give compliments.,
Articulate.,
Recycle.,
Think about their ego.",How to Be a Good Reviewer," For some, Author's Notes might be short or long or mediocre - but that doesn't change the fact that they want to also talk. As boring as it might be, their Author's Note's (A/Ns) are to announce minor stuff. Like how they are doing in life, or events that occurred or how they are feeling. Normally, most readers would ignore that, and read on. The author, when they post up a new chapter, wants at least someone to review. What they look for is variable. Revised A/Ns of a story or chapter reload/re-posted, is their silent message of how much they improved. Not many might see that, though, and you have to read carefully if the author doesn't want you to review or just doesn't care.;
, A good reviewer (reader) - by any chance - should take the time to ration what they will say. Like write about why the characters are OOC (out-of-character), and if you like them that way. You have to think about the PLOT, and characterization of the written up fiction characters; (e.g. how did that girl/guy end up that way?). Emotions, and if that author cares about what they have written. And if the flow of the story is either too fast or going to be a boring talk. Now, reviewers, when authors write (especially those who know words beyond your comprehension of understanding or sapient wording) stand by your dictionaries, and thesaurus' or locate a wise man or woman. But sooner or later, you'll get it, and... oxymora, ex: ""I will not tolerate intolerance."" And if you want to be a good reviewer, the thing to do best is make sure you contemplate your questions and see if they are worthy. Read over the chapter if you have to, read the whole story. What matters is that if the author will give you a chance, it depends if you have an account; they might block you. But beware of your words.

, Know that reviewing (if you're a frequent user) on stories, in some cases you get one review per chapter. There's more to the world than appreciating a good story from a bad story, or a happy, jubilant fic from a dark, intense fic of feelings, and for that one review of chance, make sure it's a good review. Some stories are exceptionally short or long, but concerning that, a good praise and notice is pretty complimenting for the author on their writing.

, Sometimes, it depends on the genre or direction of the story, the reviewer will take an immediate disliking that the plot is changing, instead of what it said on its summary. Reviewers will tend to not care about their grammar or spelling, some writers won't either and will insert A/Ns in the middle of the story. For some, it's unbelievably annoying; others, maybe not. That should be used for A/N, if it is that important and prominent for the story... But, a good reviewer should leave a good length on their story instead of the typical: ""please continue update soon"". And it would do a reviewer good to see the reviews themselves, to see if their own review is good enough. And it's good to be open-minded towards same sex relationships, it seems they are gaining a popularity. So, think before flaming and reducing hate.

, Remotely, reviewers should have some heart if a story is failing. Offer up some ideas, or voice your doubts why you think that particular story is failing. Remind them, to think it over, not plan it; planning doesn't always go the way you want it to. If you are interested in a story, but it was discontinued, try to review every chapter and bring some ideas. Make sure you think about the summary and events, and recycle them to begin a refresh start. And think about their personal life, insults won't get you noticed for a good review. Especially if they want to dedicate it someone. It could be you if you try hard enough. And give some constructive criticism, on their errors, etc., they will need it. Don't be too harsh if you want them to restart, but be... more encouraging with your explanations of your ideas. It will help more than you think.

, As a reviewer, you don't want to boost it too high, or their quality of writing might alter. If the reader, or reviewer thinks that the author is unworthy, the reviewer will show jealousy by flames. Or it might not be jealousy at all, just negativity of the readers' emotions. But, it depends if the author has an apathetic view and has a passion for writing and just doesn't care for what other people think. Just remember that one's praises can go to one's head, and blind them. They are not winners, just equal as any of us.

Write a query letter.,
If you've gotten a good agent, you're done.,
If you're doing this without an agent, you need to research which publishing companies accept unsolicited manuscripts.,
Negotiate with your publishing company, do some final edits, agree on cover artwork, and give it a year or two.",How to Become a Published Author; from Idea to Bookshelf," There is absolutely nothing better you can do than read as much as humanely possible. Read the classics. Read really bad books. Read really good books. Start to look at an author's style, and figure out what you like about the plot, or the characters, and how the author sets that up. Read every single possible title you can that sounds similar to your idea, or in the genre that you're interested in. Read the reviews for them. Figure out what people like reading, and what you like reading. Become aware of all the similar stories so that you don't end up plagiarizing or even worse, unintentionally coming up with something that's already been done before, because an editor won't sell it.;
, Don't start your book straight away--just write. There are places online, fanfiction.net, fictionpress.net, livejournal.com--so many places where one can polish his or her writing skills. Scott Westerfeld, author of the ""Uglies, Pretties, Specials"" series, once said, ""Your first million words will be 'crap'."" Find a website that is created for users to post their writings and simply write. Use the feedback to become more aware of your style, and become a better writer. Write at least one million words.

, When you're finally ready to move on to the book part, figure out what you want to do. What genre are you writing in? You should be familiar with this genre from your reading, but this is the part where you hatch the premise for your novel. Does it sound like something you would read? Has this idea ever been done before? Does it sound too familiar to something you've seen or heard? Is it too confusing, or does it have too many plot holes? If you're writing nonfiction, you won't necessarily have to write the entire book, merely outline it and write the first three chapters, so you can skip the next step. If you're writing fiction, continue.

, What is the most important thing to you? Character? Plot? Map out your plot if you want to. Develop your characters. Create an outline for the entire book. Maybe you work better writing vivid scenes you see in your head, then connecting the dots in between. However, and this is absolutely vital, finish your manuscript. Millions of people out there are ""writing a book that they would finish if they just had the time."" What makes you different? The fact that you finished it.

, Edit it. Edit it again. Get outside opinions. Edit even more. You cannot expect an agent or editor from a publishing company to polish your manuscript up, because they're not going to look at it unless it is amazing. Go through it until you can barely stand the story anymore and MAKE it amazing.

, Are you just doing this for a few family and friends, or do you see this as the next Harry Potter, the next Twilight, the next Hunger Games? If you decide to self-publish, realize that you probably will never be recognized as an author by anyone except family and friends and perhaps a few local bookstores, but your book will be in print. You will also have to pay anywhere from $1,000 to $3,000 USD to produce these books. (These self-publishing companies are sometimes knows and ""vanity publishers"" and if you wish to figure out which companies are such it is as simple as googling their name then ""vanity""). On the other hand, getting your book accepted by a major publishing company takes a lot of work, a lot of research, and a lot of luck. Well, what are you waiting for? Continue on!

, On the one hand, an agent will take 15% of your royalties (what you make on the book). On the other hand, 4 out of 5 books published have an agent behind them. Authors with agents generally get larger advances than authors without agents.

, An editor/agent who is famous for his or her work in romance novels won't care about your murder mystery, no matter how good it is. Also, beware of scams. An agent should never ask you for a fee; they make 15% of what you make when the book is sold, which becomes a very good incentive to get it sold. Check out the Literary Marketplace for an updated list of editors and agents.

, This should include proof that you've researched (I'm looking for an agent/editor, and I know that you often work in the romance genre. I've written a book..."") Your query letter should cover the mere skeleton/premise of what your book is about, and mention your writing credentials/ past publications. If you don't have any, don't worry, and it is better to say nothing than vanity/self publishing companies you've published from. If you've worked at all in the literary business, mention it here. Do not mention any publishing companies that have turned you down. Research online and read examples of query letters. You send publishing companies a query letter and your manuscript together.

, Your agent might offer some edits, then they will find you a publisher and help you negotiate a contract. It's their job to be a good in-between and get everything settled. Once a book is sold to a publisher, you will probably do a final edit of the manuscript, then the publisher takes care of marketing and perhaps you'll have a bit of say in cover art. Anywhere between one and two years later, your book will be released.

, Send your manuscript along with a self-addressed and stamped postcard so that they can reply easily. If you haven't heard after three months, submit to another agency. Be sure to mention in your query letter that you will submit to other agencies after a certain period of time.

, Voila! Your book is published. Now that you've gotten one book published, especially if it's popular, your next will be far easier. So go on, what are you waiting for? Write!

Look for the words ""explain"" or ""describe"" in the writing prompt.,
Brainstorm about what the prompt is asking you to write about.,
Create a thesis statement.,
Think of strong topic sentences that support your thesis statement.,
Compose the introduction for your essay.,
Write the body of the essay.,
Add your conclusion.",How to Answer a Writing Prompt1," Expository prompts direct you to write an essay that explains or describes something. This type of essay is informative, but often does not require that you make an in-depth argument or state an opinion.


Other words that signal an expository writing assignment include ""summarize,"" ""clarify,"" or ""tell about.""For example, ""Explain camping to a person who has never camped before"" is an example of an expository prompt. So is ""Describe how communication has changed in the last 20 years."";
, Make sure you don't try to cover so much that 5 paragraphs is inadequate. You should also avoid a focus that's so narrow that you have problems coming up with 5 paragraphs.


For example, for ""Explain camping to a person who has never camped before,"" you could take several approaches. You could explain reasons why people might want to go camping, or you could explain how to set up a campsite. You might even want to try both approaches in your essay.

, For expository essays, the thesis statement says what you will be explaining or describing and how you will do it.


Strong expository essays have a theme or center of gravity that organizes them.For example, for ""Describe how communication has changed in the last 20 years"" you might want to focus your essay on how teens use communication differently, or the impact of communication changes on daily life.
An expository thesis statement does not have to present an opinion or even make an argument. It should be based on the facts you will examine.For example, ""Over the past 20 years, communication has changed significantly. It is now affordable to stay in touch with people all over the world, easier to connect with people from different places and cultures, and keep others updated with even your minor doings.""

, A topic sentence is specific, and gives a ""preview"" of what the paragraph will be about. Each paragraph needs a strong topic sentence at the beginning.For example, if you were writing an essay explaining camping, you might have the following topic sentences for your paragraphs: 1) ""There are many reasons why people might want to go camping."" (Paragraph about reasons to go camping.) 2) ""You must consider several things when choosing a campsite."" (Choosing a campsite paragraph.) 3) ""Finally, you must set up your campsite."" (Paragraph about setting up camp.)

, Your thesis statement will be the last sentence.


You'll want to open with a general statement about your topic that ""hooks"" your reader. Then provide any context your reader needs to understand your topic. Close with your thesis statement., Depending on your prompt, your answer may be as short as a paragraph. Most writing assignments expect several paragraphs, and many prefer the 5-paragraph form. For each paragraph, develop it by doing the following:Begin each paragraph with a topic sentence.
Explain your topic sentence.
Give an example that supports your topic sentence.
Analyze your example.
Write a concluding statement.

, Restate your thesis at the end of the paragraph. A good conclusion will show how your ideas progressed, give the reader something to think about, or present new directions for the information.For example, if you are explaining camping, you could conclude by saying something like, ""Although some people who live in cities have never been camping before, it is actually fun and easy. Next time you're considering a vacation, why not consider camping?""

"
"
Find the words ""tell,"" ""time"" or ""event."",
Write a story about something that happened to you.,
Begin with an introduction that tells the reader that you will tell a story.,
Write a narrative essay more loosely than you would other types of essays.,
End the essay by telling the reader what you learned from the experience.",How to Answer a Writing Prompt2," Narrative prompts ask you to tell a story, usually about yourself. You may also see the words ""Describe"" or ""write about.""For example, a narrative prompt might look like this: ""Talk about a time when you experienced friendship"" or ""Describe a moment when you showed courage.""

, You'll want to gear the narrative you tell to answer the prompt. You will often want to write about a moment that taught you a lesson or had an impact on your life.Write in first person. Tell the story as yourself, using ""I"" and ""me.""

, Your introduction provides the setting and context for your narrative. Let the reader know what you will be writing about, who the major ""characters"" are, and the purpose of your narrative. This purpose is your thesis statement.A narrative thesis statement may offer the lesson you learned or talk about the impact of the moment on your life, such as ""The most memorable moment in which I showed courage happened in seventh grade."" It could also identify a theme that connects your story to a greater theme, such as ""Most people do not know how courageous they can be until they're faced with danger. This was true for me, too.""

, Use description, metaphor, anecdotes, dialogue and other literary devices.


You may want to structure your essay chronologically to show the development of the lesson over time. This is usually the clearest way to structure your essay. Use words such as ""then,"" ""next,"" and ""finally"" to show your progress., This is where you come back to the thesis you gave in the beginning. What did you learn? How has the experience changed you in some way?"
"
Look for the words ""persuade"" or ""convince."",
Decide which arguments will work best on the reader.,
Identify what your reader's most likely objection or argument might be and how you can refute it.,
Write an introductory paragraph in which you give background on the issue.,
Add body paragraphs.,
Include a paragraph in which you state the most likely argument or objection of your reader, and then refute it.,
Compose a conclusion.",How to Answer a Writing Prompt3," Persuasive prompts direct you to make an argument that convinces another person of your point of view or opinion. You will need to use logic and examples to convince the other person.You may be trying to convince the tester who will read your essay, or you may be asked to write as if you were trying to convince a hypothetical person.
Other signals that you are writing a persuasive answer include ""How do you feel about"" or ""What do you think about"". If a prompt asks whether you agree or disagree with a statement, it is a persuasive prompt., This will depend on who your audience is. For example, if you have been directed to convince a hypothetical committee to fund a project, you will want to use logical, factual arguments. If you have been instructed to persuade your peers that school lunches are important, you may want to use more emotional arguments.


Cause and effect are a common persuasive thesis. For example, ""Giving underprivileged students free school lunches raises their performance and makes the whole school better"" is a cause and effect argument.Value is another common tactic. This type of argument emphasizes the importance of something. For example, ""Allowing global warming to continue will destroy habitats for animals such as polar bears and penguins. We cannot allow our world to lose this rich wildlife."", These possible objections may even be in the prompt itself. Read it carefully and consider what possible objections could be.For example, someone might object that providing free school lunches places a burden on taxpayers, or singles students out as ""poor"" in the eyes of their classmates.
To refute these objections, consider the type of argument you want to make. If you're making a logical argument, use logical refutations. If you're making an emotional argument, use emotional refutations.

, Give the important context or information that your readers need to know. End with a thesis statement that tells the reader what you want to persuade her to believe.For example, if you are writing about the necessity of stopping global warming, you will need to identify what scientists believe are the main causes of it. End with your thesis that states that although it will be difficult to stop global warming, we cannot afford to lose the rich wildlife that global warming is destroying.

, Depending on the instructions in your prompt, provide body paragraphs that give your main arguments. In each paragraph, provide evidence or examples that support your arguments.


Most persuasive essays will include at least 3 body paragraphs., This paragraph usually comes right before the conclusion. Use the information from your brainstorming session to refute the point., Persuasive conclusions often end by restating the thesis and emphasizing the importance of the argument you have made. You can also include a call to action for the reader, or end with a quotation or question that encourages further thought."

Include strange, sensory details.,
Have a unique take on grammar and punctuation.",How to Be a Quirky Writer," Your writing style comes from your mastery of voice and tone. Your writing voice is the authorial personality you assume in your writing. You may use different writing voices depending on the type of story you are writing. Or, you may maintain the same writing style throughout all of your writing.You may also use a certain tone in all your writing, using specific word choice, sentence structure, and grammar. Or, you may vary your tone based on the character you are inhabiting or the type of story you are writing.
You should have a good sense of your own writing style before you try to add quirks to it, as you should have a strong foundation in place. You may realize that your existing writing style is starting to feel stale or too familiar and be seeking ways to jazz it up.;
, You are often told in writing classes to write for your ideal reader, focusing on reaching one particular person rather than a big group of people. You can add quirks to your writing by focusing instead on a quirky reader. This reader may be more interested in strange, weird details and a unique writing voice.Often the quirky reader will be more interested in stories with strange or weird characters and stories that discuss unfamiliar or uncommon subject matter. A quirky reader may be more adventurous than the average reader and more open to writing about the strange or weird side of life.
For example, maybe you often write with an ideal reader in mind who is interested in pleasant, easy to read stories. You may then shift your focus to a quirky reader who is more into strange descriptions, an ominous tone, and a weird setting. Picture what this quirky reader might be interested in reading and write with them in mind.

, You can push your writing to feel more quirky and unexpected by breaking a writing rule you have always respected or upheld. We all have writing rules that we always follow. Breaking one of your writing rules could encourage you to embrace the unexpected and not get stuck in your own little writing box.This might be a common writing rule like “show, don’t tell” or “never open a story by discussing the weather”. You may then challenge yourself to break this rule and do so effectively. It may take time to break the rule with positive results. But it could push you to embrace a more quirky writing style.
There are several known “rules of writing” lists that have been made by popular writers, including Elmore Leonard’s 10 Rules for Good Writing and Stephen King’s Top 20 Rules for Writers. You may choose one of their rules and attempt to break it in a way that makes your story stronger and more unique.

, You can also add variety and interest to your writing style by trying to write like you talk. Often, we tend to put on a writerly voice or a voice that we think all writing must emulate. But writing like you speak to your friends, your partner, or your family members can give your writing style a unique spin and sound.You may notice that you use words that are in another language or that are part of a slang when you speak to your friends. Rather than edit these words out of your writing, you may include them in your story to give your writing voice a personality and unique sound.
For example, if you speak Spanish when you are talking to your family members or a combination of Spanish and English (Spanglish), you may include this in your writing. Maybe there are Spanish terms and English terms side by side in your story or in the voice of a character based on you.

, You can also learn how to be more quirky in your writing by reading writers who are known for their unique writing voice and style. Many of these writers took big risks with their writing by using a writing style that was outside of the norm or the mainstream. Several quirky writers to read include:


Chuck Palahniuk: Read his short story “Cannibal.”Cormac McCarthy: Read his novels The Road and No Country For Old Men.
Junot Diaz: Read his short story “The Cheater’s Guide to Love.”Mary Gaitskill: Read her short story “The Other Place.”Octavia Butler: Read her short story “Bloodchild.”, Draw on a real life experience that felt strange, unsettling, and distinct. Then, use this experience as the basis for a story or a written piece. Leaning on your own quirky experiences can push you to explore different subject matter and focus on content that you usually would not write about.For example, you may remember a strange experience where you kept getting phone calls meant for someone who had your number before you did. You may then write about the experience of answering calls meant for someone else and the strange conversations you had with strangers over the phone.

, You can also tap into history and focus on an historical event that has been forgotten or hidden in contemporary writing. You may need to do some research to find an historical event or a group of people in history who have been underrepresented or ignored in the writing world. You could then explore this history in your own writing to make your work stand out.For example, you may write about a forgotten historical event like the plight of Japanese villagers on a small island in the Pacific. Or you may look into your own family history and write about an event that was kept hidden or secret from you as a child.

, The characters in your stories can also be more quirky and unique if you imbue them with strange characteristics. Give your character traits that are a little off or that feel unique. You can then explore the perspective of your quirky characters more fully in your stories.For example, you might have a main character who has an obsession with Elvis and collects Elvis memorabilia. You could then explore this character trait further in your story, focusing on the quirks of your main character.

, You may also be able to find inspiration for a quirky story by putting a unique spin on a folktale or legend that already exists. You may flip around the gender roles in a well known folktale or rewrite a well known legend from a minor character’s perspective in the story. Twisting around an existing tale can help you create a story that feels new and familiar at the same time.For example, you may try to write the legend of Hercules from the point of view of the Three Fates. Or maybe you try to imagine what the folktale of Little Red Riding Hood might be like from the perspective of the hungry wolf.

, You can make the language in your writing feel more unique and unexpected by avoiding cliches. Cliches are phrases that have become so familiar they lose their meaning and impact. You should strive to banish familiar terms and phrases from your writing so it feels special and unfamiliar to your reader.For example, you may notice you tend to use the same familiar cliches to describe the weather, such as “streams of light in the sky” or “the warm glow of the sun.” You may then try to make these phrases less familiar or come up with less cliche phrases for the weather in your writing, such as “ribbons of golden pink hung in the air” or “the searing globe in the sky.”

, You can also imbue your language with quirks by using literary devices. Literary devices can make your writing stronger overall and make a big impact on your reader. Try to integrate them into every kind of writing you do, from prose writing to poetry to essay writing.You may use literary devices like metaphor and simile in your writing, though you should always try to create metaphors and similes that are not cliche or familiar. For example, you may describe a character with a metaphor like ""she was a woman trapped in the wrong forest,"" or with a simile like, ""she was as lost as an animal in a zoo.""
You can also include juxtapositions, oxymorons, and paradox in your writing, especially when you are developing your characters and your plot. For example, you may use the contrast of two images or feelings in a juxtaposition, such as ""she was having the worst time at the party and he was having the time of his life.""

, You want to immerse your reader in a world that feels unfamiliar and strange. You can do this by including details that activate all five senses, from sight to touch to feel to sound to smell. Make your sensory details a little strange or off so they feel unexpected to your reader.For example, you may describe the experience of waking up using strange, sensory detail. You may describe the sheets as “soft waves of satin” and your pillow as “a hill to place my head on.”

, You can make your language use seem more unique in your writing by playing around with grammar and punctuation. Many writers with quirky writing styles do this as a way to make a character voice more unique.


You may include certain speech ticks or slangs in your character’s dialogue. For example, maybe your character has a lisp and their dialogue in your story reflects their inability to pronounce certain words or terms.
You may also have the text reflect the mindset of a certain character, such as having no punctuation for a character who is thinking in a stream of consciousness or unique grammar for a character who is having a mental breakdown.

Keep track of your output for feel-good sake and self-assessment.,
Build in time for interruptions.",How to Be a Prolific Writer," Once you establish a daily routine, it's hard to break. It becomes automatic, like your first cup of coffee in the morning. Once you get used to a daily session, it feels wrong to skip it.;
, Some writers call it ""shutting off the internal editor."" This allows you the freedom to produce page after page of words without evaluating them immediately. You'll have plenty of time for that later. Once you're written enough and time has passed, you'll be a better judge of your work.

, You may be working on a novel or memoir, but if you feel like writing a haiku, go for it. Once you've started pen to paper or fingers to keyboard, your mind may take you on a different road that is productive for your book or other project.

, Like sunlight? Sit by a window. Need company? Write in a coffeehouse. Must have absolute quiet? Turn off the phone and shut the door.

, Word counts are the typical gauge writers use to determine productivity. For you, it might be the number of pages you write per session or the number of lines in your notebook. Choose a way to keep track and chart your progress. In a few weeks, looking back on your output levels will strengthen your resolve to continue.

, Writers are human. You are human. Expect that your schedule will take unproductive turns because of life's curve balls. If you develop a well-established routine, it will be easier to return to it when the ups-and-downs even out.

When you read a book, you should split your attention between the actual events in the book and the way the author composed that piece of literature.Reading helps you develop a firm grasp on how stories are structured.
By reading, you're also studying how published authors use language in creative and inspiring ways.
Reading may also give you new ideas for your own writing, or illustrate to you how a skilled writer handles a certain subject.;
, While you don't need to study writing in college to become a writer, it can certainly help. Studying writing allows you to receive instruction and feedback on your work and may open you up to new authors and genres that you hadn't explored before.Find out whether a given school offers creative writing as a major, minor, or an area of study within the English major. There isn't necessarily one right or wrong approach; it's more a question of what you would prefer to study.
Check course catalogs to see what types of writing classes have been offered over the past few semesters.
Look into the genres offered by a given program. Some only focus on poetry and fiction, while others include creative nonfiction, drama, and/or screenwriting.
Find out what types of literary opportunities are available at the school itself and the community it's in.
Many schools host literary readings, guest authors, and may even offer students a chance to work at a literary journal.

, A master of fine arts (MFA) degree isn't necessary to practice writing. However, an MFA program will build on the fundamentals you learned during the course of your undergraduate studies and help you connect with other writers who are just as dedicated as you.Websites like Poets & Writers offer comprehensive MFA program databases that let you compare the genres offered, location of the program, and core faculty.Being in a master's program helps you build a sense of community. You'll meet and study closely with a small group of likeminded individuals, and you may end up becoming lifelong friends/colleagues.
Going through an MFA gives you the time to practice your writing and to receive extensive feedback over the course of the program. This will be invaluable if you plan on writing beyond graduate school.
Some programs are very expensive. However, many programs offer scholarships, grants, and opportunities to teach.
As you look into graduate programs, ask a program representative from each school about what types of funding they offer and what opportunities (teaching, working at a literary journal, etc.) are available.

, There are many writing classes available, both online and in-person. You can find classes and writing workshops for beginners, intermediate writers, and advanced writers through your local community college/university, your local bookstore, or even online.


Decide whether you're more comfortable taking a class online or in an actual classroom.
Look into who is teaching your class. For most writing classes, you should be taught by a published author who has experience in that genre.
You can find massive open online courses (or MOOCs) through many colleges/universities around the world. Many of these courses are free or very cheap to join, since you won't receive any college credit or diploma for the coursework.

, Whether you formally study writing in college/graduate school or pursue it on your own, it's important to have dedication and work ethic. How you approach writing can determine whether it will remain a lifelong pursuit or something you never seem to pick back up.


Make and stick to a schedule. Even if you can only find time for an hour a day, set aside that time and use it to write every single day.
Network with other writers. If you graduated from a writing program, this will be easy; if not, you can meet other writers through social network options like Meetup, or through local writing groups (which you can find online).
Keep reading authors you like and exploring new authors you're not familiar with.
Push yourself out of your comfort zone. Try writing in other genres, or experimenting with hybrid genre work.

, The first step to becoming a writer is choosing a genre. There are some talented authors who specialize in two or more genres, but most authors stick with one genre of writing and work to perfect it. There's no right or wrong answer, and no genre is more published than the others, so go with what you love the most.Think about which genre you like the best. Do you tend to lean towards poetry, works of fiction, or nonfiction essays/memoirs?
There are many sub-genres you can work within, such as comedy, drama, and so forth. However, first you'll need to choose a primary genre.
One factor that may help you choose a genre is to consider who your target audience is.If you want to write stories for children or adolescents, for example, you might choose young adult literature.
Sometimes the idea you have for your story may determine the best genre for your piece of writing.If you attempt to hybridize (combine genres), you'll need to choose a primary one. It's okay to blend poetry and nonfiction, for example, but your readers will appreciate some clarity on what it is they're reading.
Ultimately, you'll have to go with the genre you're most comfortable writing in. Try out multiple genres, read some noteworthy publications from various genres, and decide which one you would enjoy writing the most.

, Once you've chosen a genre, you should strive to become an expert in that genre. Read as much as you can by published authors working in your genre of choice, and take a look at some craft books that discuss the finer elements of writing within a certain genre.Search online for the most popular works of the genre you're considering. For example, if you're thinking of writing poetry, you might use Google or Bing to search for famous/influential works of poetry.
Read as much as you can by as many authors as you can. Many writers believe that you have to be an extensive reader and know the genre well before you can attempt to master that genre.
Try reading craft books on your genre of choice. You can search online, in a bookstore, or at your local library for books on writing poetry, fiction, or nonfiction.

, Writing takes a lot of practice. It doesn't come easy, but it does get more familiar the more that you practice it. Set aside some time every day, every other day, or every week to work on your craft without interruption or distraction. Remember that you won't pick it up overnight, so be patient with yourself and keep working until it all comes together.Some writers set a minimum word count or page count for themselves. Others simply set aside the time to write and work at their own pace.
There is no right or wrong way to practice writing. The important thing is that you set aside time for writing and put your pen to the paper (or your hands on the keyboard).

, Journals are a writer's best friend. If you're out at a coffee shop, in a bar, or riding public transportation, you will witness all kinds of fascinating displays of humanity. By watching other people in their day-to-day interactions, you can generate plenty of ideas for characters. You might also have a sudden and brilliant realization, in which case you'll want to write it down right away so you don't forget it.Write down observations you make, people/places/things you see and hear, and the thoughts that occur to you every day.
You can fill your journal with ideas as they come to you, or simply use it as a place to gather your thoughts when you're outside the house.
When you keep a detailed journal, it's much easier to jump into writing during your designated writing time. You'll have ideas, snippets of conversation you've overheard, or thoughts that struck you, and you may be able to turn those items into stories or poems.

, Researching people, places, and things that interest you can be very productive for writers. You may generate ideas, or simply have researched information at your fingertips if you decide to write about that subject.A research file allows you to compile bits of historical texts, literary texts, and newspaper columns in one place.
Research is valuable for genres outside of nonfiction. You may use a research file to develop a piece of historical fiction with accurate details, or even in poetry as a sort of ""word bank"" to draw unusual phrasings from.

, Writing prompts are a great way to get your writing wheels turning. Prompts can help you break through writer's block, generate ideas, or just stay in practice with your writing.


You can buy books of writing prompts or rent one from your local library.
There are many, many writing prompts available online for free. Search for ""writing prompts,"" or check Writer's Digest's writing prompts page at http://www.writersdigest.com/prompts.

, Every piece of writing, no matter what genre you choose, will need certain elements. Fiction will require elements that may not be required or essential in nonfiction and vice versa, but as a general rule, a good piece of narrative writing should have enough components to engage a reader in a logical and interesting reading experience.

Every piece of narrative writing (fiction and nonfiction) needs a strong central premise. This is not necessarily the plot of your story/essay, but rather, what that plot means (for example, that power corrupts people or that adversity makes you stronger).
Narrative writing also needs dynamic characters. These should be realistic, imperfect characters who change with time and experience (just like real people).
To keep your narrative from spiraling out of control, it's best to work within a confined space. It can be a temporal, physical, or situational space, but the writing should make clear to the reader why each character is involved in the story and its setting as the work unfolds.
Every piece of narrative needs a protagonist (usually the main character). It's essential that readers identify with him/her, or at least find the character interesting and engaging enough to keep reading.
A good piece of writing should have an interesting antagonist whom the protagonist struggles against. It's important that this character (who is not necessarily a villain) is well-developed, because liking the protagonist may not be enough of a reason for readers to want him/her to defeat the antagonist.
The antagonist doesn't necessarily have to be a person. An antagonist can be the main character (struggling against himself, his memory, his desires, etc.), God/gods/goddesses, nature, or more abstract concepts like time.
There has to be change in the main character(s)' situation. Someone who starts out aggressive should become more understanding/calm, a drunk should find (at least) moments of sobriety by the end, and so forth.
Conflict is essential in any narrative piece of writing. Conflict is often person against person (usually the protagonist against an antagonist), but it can also be a person against him/herself, or even a person against his or her situation.

, If you're writing poetry instead of prose, the rules of narrative won't apply to you so much. Instead, you'll want to focus on what makes a poem succeed as a piece of writing.Make sure the poem has a lyrical quality that is pleasing to hear. Common sound devices include alliteration (repeating initial sounds in a line of verse), assonance (repeating vowel sounds), and meter (patterns of stressed/unstressed syllables).
Strong poems often incite an emotional response. This was historically done with irony (having the unexpected happen, often without a character's knowledge) and other elements of tragedy, but today a poem can elicit any type of emotion.
Imagery is one of the most important components of a poem. Your descriptions, symbolism, and metaphors/similes (comparisons) should evoke a clear and unique visual picture in the reader's mind.
Make sure your poem is clear and concise. Clarity and concision in poetry means saying as much as possible in as few words as possible.
Any time you describe something familiar, strive to describe or depict it in an utterly unfamiliar way.

, The first line of a story, poem, essay, or book needs to be engaging and interesting. It should deliver enough of the tension or theme of the rest of the work that a reader will want to continue reading through to the end.There are many ways to start a piece of writing, but some of the most common include opening with:


an aphorism
a concise fact that relates (either directly or indirectly) to the events about to unfold in your piece of writing
a deceptively complex statement/observation
a striking image that will be further developed throughout the poem, story, or essay

, Once you've got a good idea of your premise and you've decided where/when/how to begin your piece of writing, you'll need to outline your work. Some writers avoid outlining, while others find it invaluable to the writing process. The goal is to sketch out the who, what, when, where, why, and how of your story/essay/poem.Try writing out how you envision your piece of writing unfolding from beginning to end.
Knowing how a piece of writing begins and ends (as well as its premise) can make writing the body of your work much easier and more well-developed.
Think about specific details. It's better to have too much information about a character, scene, or series of events and omit those details than to have a bare-bones story that isn't complete.
Get to know your characters. Whether you're writing nonfiction (and interviewing them) or fiction (and making up the details), you should know as much as possible about each character before you begin to write about him or her.

, Your working draft should expand on your outline and fill in all the details. This doesn't necessarily have to be a publishable manuscript - in fact, for many writers, a working draft is just one of many drafts that involve rewriting, rearranging, and reworking the characters, story arc, and series of events. However, your working draft should be as fleshed out and as close to being ""complete"" as possible.A functional draft should have a clear protagonist, situation, opponent, conflict, and resolution of conflict.
Your scenes should be well developed, and the imagery should be evocative and unique.
There should be nothing left unanswered in your draft, and all loose ends should be tied up. Everything should be resolved, and if something is deliberately left unresolved, it should be clear and explicit for the reader to understand why.
There should be no gaps in the plot. Each scene should transition smoothly into the next, the dialogue should follow a logical order of conversation, and all bits of vital information should be clear and present in your draft.

, Once you've finished your working draft, you might think that it's all finished. However, during the editing and revision stages, your writing will need to be fine-tuned, and it may need to be totally broken down and built back up from scratch. During editing, you'll look for errors in grammar, syntax, structure, tone, voice, and of course spelling. The revision process should be much more thorough. You may need to rewrite some sections of your work and leave out parts that you really liked for the sake of greater clarity and stronger content.Try setting aside your writing for a few days, a couple weeks, or even a month.
It's best to approach your work with fresh eyes so that you'll catch any obvious gaps that might have been missed. It's possible that you mentally filled in those gaps without realizing it when the story was actively fresh in your mind.
Consider having a friend or trusted colleague read through your work. Ask for honest, direct feedback: what isn't working, what was confusing, whether anything was left unresolved, etc.
Read through your draft and ask yourself if the current phrasing is how you wanted to express the emotions, images, and premise.
Think about whether a reader will understand what you're saying and walk away with the same premise you had when you wrote it.
Smooth out any missing or rough transitions. You may need to rearrange certain sections of your story/essay/poem, or cut them out altogether.

, Once your writing is well-polished and ready to be shared, you should begin by showing it to your closest friends and/or family members. Start out with a small group so that you limit how many people read your story. That way if you need to make any changes, you can do so without other people knowing the details that might cause rifts in your friendships/family/relationship.It's a good idea to show your work to your friends/relatives before publishing it - especially if they are mentioned in your writing in any way.If you reveal damaging truths about your friends/relatives or portray them in an unflattering manner, consider changing the characters' names so that no one is offended.
Remind your friends/family that the story/essay/poem is about your perspective (or an entirely fictional perspective), not an absolute.
If your friends/relatives ask you to leave something out of your writing, you should.

, Reading your work aloud to an audience that wants to hear it is a great way to get feedback on your work and put your writing out there for others to enjoy. You can find literary events and open mic nights near you by searching online or looking through the events section in your local newspaper.


It's important to attend other writers' literary readings/events, in addition to performing at your own events.
Going to literary events to hear other writers read their work can help you build a stronger community or even network with likeminded individuals.
Virtually every town has some type of literary events on a regular basis.
You don't need to move to New York City just to be part of a writing community. You can find out about local readings online or ask someone at an independent book store in your town about upcoming events and opportunities.

, Whether you're in school, are a recent graduate, or never attended school, you may benefit from joining a writing club. Writing clubs help you meet other writers in your area, spend time talking about writing each week, and get feedback on your work.


You can find writing clubs near you by searching online, or by reading posters at your local bookstore.
There are also many writing clubs available through social media outlets like Meetup.

, If you've written a book-length manuscript, you may be thinking about ways to get it published. You can always self-publish your book, but if you're interested in reaching a larger publisher, you may need an agent.An agent can help you with editing your manuscript, negotiating contract agreements, explaining the terms of a contract, and selling/promoting your work.
Compile a list of authors you admire who write in a similar style and genre as you, and search online to find out who those authors' literary agents are.
Send a query letter to each agent you're considering. Each agent will have different requirements for queries (including how long of an excerpt to send from your manuscript), so read their websites and familiarize yourself with what each agent wants.
Keep your query letters brief - no more than three pages, and under one page. Make sure your letter is well-written and free of any typos.
The first paragraph of your letter should let the agent know why you've chosen him/her to reach out to. Mention any authors you admire that that agent has represented, and let the agent know you share similar tastes.
The second paragraph should include a three or four sentence summary of your book (without too much detail).
The third paragraph should include a short biography of yourself, including any relevant information about your work (which literary journals have published your work, for example).
If the agent's website requests an excerpt, send one with your query letter. If not, wait for a response.

, Finding the right market for your writing can help you get your writing out to a larger audience, earn publication credits to your name, and may even help you get a book deal. That's because many agents and publishers read through literary journals and other publications to find writers who shows potential and promise.Know your audience. If you're writing sexually-explicit science fiction, for example, you may need to work within a more specialized market.
There is a market for any type of writing. It just takes some searching to find literary journals and other publications that are the right fit for your style, content, and general premise.
You can find literary publications online by searching for ""fiction literary journals,"" ""nonfiction literary journals,"" or ""poetry literary journals.""
You may also find copies of literary journals at a small, independent book store. This can help you become familiar with the type of writing typically published by those journals to see if your work would be a good fit.
When you go to a journal's website, they should have a section with writing guidelines, and may even post excerpts from published pieces. This can also help you determine if your work fits with their aesthetic.
If you're ever in doubt, try sending a query letter. This is a professional letter/email sent to the editor(s) in which you pitch your piece of writing, summarize it or quote a small section of it, and ask the editor if she thinks it might be a good fit for that journal.
You can also try sending out your work and seeing what the response is. There's no harm in trying, but be aware that some literary journals do charge a small reading fee for submissions that you send them.

, Once you've found a journal that you think would be a good fit for your work, it's time to send your work out. Every journal has different specifications for manuscripts, so it's important to read the journal's submission guidelines and follow them precisely if you want to make a good impression.Make sure your word count falls within the desired word count.
Check whether you should include any identifying information (like your name or the piece's title) on the actual manuscript, or just in the cover letter.
Some journals prefer numbered pages, while others don't care either way. They may also request that physical copies be stapled or unstapled, so make sure you're sending an acceptable manuscript.
If you're sending your story/essay/poem by mail, make sure you include a self-addressed, stamped envelope so they can send you a reply. You should also make sure you don't send in your only copy of a manuscript, as many journals recycle or discard them after reading.
Write a strong, courteous cover letter. Include your contact information, the title and genre of your submission, a short biography of yourself, and a brief writeup of why you're interested in that journal and what makes your submission a good fit.
Note that some journals take six or more months to respond, while others respond within days. Some accept simultaneous submissions (submissions sent to more than one journal at the same time), while others strictly prohibit the practice.
Don't be discouraged. Take rejection and feedback with a thick skin and keep submitting your work, no matter what anyone else tells you.

Don’t do it for the money.,
Give speeches at career day activities.",How to Become a Mentor to Young Aspiring Writers1," Achieve a level of expertise in your own career. You don’t need to be a seasoned veteran or a particular age to be a mentor, but you should have at least some writing experience under your belt. Working professionally as a writer and gaining experience in the publishing industry gives you credibility as a mentor.


Established mentorship programs may ask for at least two years of experience writing professionally; they may or may not require you to have published work.;
, You can find writing mentor courses online and at local colleges or universities. Alternatively, you can find books on how to be a writing mentor. Buy the books online, or borrow them from your local library in-person or as e-books.Look for courses or books that address your specific style of writing. For instance, if you are a technical or scientific writer, a course or book for fiction writing mentorships wouldn’t be the right one for you.

, Speak with current mentors of others to get ideas, tips, and best practices. Consider getting a mentor yourself; learning from a talented mentor will show you how to be useful to a protégé. Joining a writer’s group locally or online is a good way to find a mentor. When you find a mentor, be specific about what you’d like help with. Bring a list of questions with you to the meetings so that you can make the most of the time.Try to be flexible with time when meeting with your mentor. Don’t try to take up more of their time than you asked for.

, Search online for writing workshops in your city or county. College campuses host workshops, and there are also online conferences and group retreats. If you’re interested in travelling, you can search the destination you’d like to travel to for writing conferences.Writing workshops and colonies help writers to sharpen their skills. You will also be able to discuss your craft with other established authors and potentially get feedback on your own writing.

, Working for free, especially early in your career, can give you valuable experience. Become a mentor because you enjoy sharing ideas and reading other people’s writing. If aren’t passionate about other people’s stories, becoming a mentor probably isn’t for you.For example, if you give a mentee twenty hours of your time, and your mentee subsequently writes several books that you read and enjoy, you receive a return on investment that isn’t a dollar amount., Speak about your experience as a writer, what it was like to be a beginner and your success. Afterward, let students know that you are willing to help out if anyone is interested in pursuing a career as a writer. Look for career day events at local college campuses and through industries that are relevant to your field of writing.


Try saying to students, “I know what it’s like to be just starting out as a writer. I’d like to help you by giving you constructive, nonjudgmental advice that I would have appreciated when I was in your shoes. Please feel free to contact me.”

Many academic institutions already have programs in place that match mentors to students looking for writing tutors. If you qualify, these programs may even offer monetary compensation. If not, you can volunteer.Ask school officials, “Could you use a mentor for any writer's programs, workshops, or other creative writing outlets?”
Look at schools’ websites. Search each website for keywords such as “writing tutor,” “mentor,” and “fellowship” to locate their application process.

, Authors and writers often put a section on their website indicating that they accept applications for one-on-one mentoring. Include as many details in your offer as possible. You may also want to indicate that you are open to participating in already-established mentorship exchange programs, in case a recruiter for such a program comes upon your site.


Specify the types of writers you are looking for. Does it matter where they are in their career path, and if they’ve ever written before? What language should they be fluent in? What expectations do you have for them?
Outline what you will offer. Will you coach them by phone, email, in person, or another way? List the cost if you plan on charging mentees.

, There are many mentor/mentee coordinators online who serve as go-betweens to match up mentors with mentees. Search online for mentorship exchange programs. When you find a mentor coordinator or program, review their qualification process carefully before applying to make sure you are a match for what they’re offering., If you already know or meet young people in the same field as you, approach them and offer them guidance. Joining a book club or volunteering at a library are good ways to meet young aspiring writers.If your book club has an aspiring writers in it, let them know you would be willing to help guide them along their writing career paths.
Writers are avid readers. The odds are very high that you will meet aspiring authors just by working at the library. Engage them in conversation and discuss writing.

, Mentorships don’t have to be live in person. You can develop a mentor/mentee relationship over email or by meeting someone through an online writing forum. If possible, put in your online profile that you are available as a mentor. Look for existing threads where young writers are seeking a mentor, or create a new thread and summarize the type of experience you have.Look for a mentee that shares your views. For example, if you write science fiction for young adults, try to find a mentee who is interested in pursuing the same field. Screen potential mentees and find someone who can benefit from your particular skill set., Look within and outside of your community for non-profit organizations, companies and associations that have mentoring programs. Trade programs that help people communicate or develop skills are a good place to look.Contact the human resource department. Try saying, “I am interested in mentoring young aspiring writers. Do you have any system in place for setting up mentorships?”

, Attend conferences and meetings where there will be young people starting out in their education or career. Talk with people and make yourself available to answer questions. Hand out your business card or exchange social media contact information.Follow up and show an interest in what your contacts are working on. Give compliments and support on their work.
Look for talent and ability. When you come across young writers who are starting out and recognize that they have talent and enthusiasm, convey to them that your door is always open for advice., Get to know the person a bit. Are their goals, communication style and overall temperament compatible with your ability and coaching style? Do you have knowledge about their current path?Review at least one piece of their work and provide feedback. Then have a discussion together about it. Are they active listeners who are receptive to your suggestions and encouragement? Do they seem to digest and appreciate your advice in a beneficial way?
Does your potential mentee have professional goals that are related to the history of your career?
If your potential mentee is outside of your geographic location, will a phone, email or online mentorship work for both of you? Exchange details on the availability and preferred communication style of each of you.

Be dependable.,
Help your mentee build confidence.,
Listen and guide.,
Help your mentee network.,
Re-evaluate the mentorship.",How to Become a Mentor to Young Aspiring Writers3," An essential part of being a mentor is making yourself available to your mentee on a regular basis. If you join a mentorship program through a school, you will probably need to commit to a set amount of hours per week mentoring.Be honest with your mentee: you won’t have all the answers, so if your mentee asks for something you can’t help them with, don’t mislead them.Form a one-on-one relationship with your mentee. Give them your preferred form of contact, and let them know if it’s okay to contact you as they encounter obstacles in their work.

, Be a reliable mentor who is both professional and punctual. Your mentee will depend on your assistance and advice, and you don’t want to let them down. Remain consistently available to work with your writers, and you can help them grow and expand their talents.Keep track of meetings. Use a CRM, app, or calendar to schedule reminders and appointments., Young writers can be insecure about their abilities and will look to their mentors for reassurance. Take care to avoid hurting your protégé’s ego. Prioritize ideas over grammar; encourage your mentee’s innovative skills. Convey to your mentee that you enjoy discussing writing with them and that you learn from them as well!Deliver critiques with encouragement. Present your feedback as suggestions instead of criticism. Keep them impersonal, unless you are using “I” terms. For example, try saying, “I got confused here. Does this mean…?”Let your mentee know that they have potential. Say something like, ""Every writer started somewhere. You are capable of being a successful, professional writer: the more you practice, the better you will get!"", Focus on listening and guiding rather than teaching. Ask what stumbling blocks they have encountered while writing, and address their obstacles with helpful tips. Offer to review articles, stories or manuscripts they have written. After reading them, provide a constructive critique that focuses on positive feedback.Convey the main areas in need of more work. Limit feedback to helpful information you think your mentee can absorb. Identify errors using questions, such as “Could there be more information here?”.Feedback isn’t the same as editing; try to provide clear direction for improvement. Give suggestions in a positive way but without being too vague or general.Ask for feedback. Getting regular feedback from your mentee will help you become a better mentor.

, One of the most difficult parts of establishing a writing career is finding a way to become published. Offer to help them build a portfolio so they can pursue their writing careers. If you trust and believe in your mentee, utilize your connections to help your aspiring writers get their work published if possible.

, How much of a role natural talent plays in writing is a subject of debate.However, writing certainly takes a passion for the craft as it requires studying and a lot of hard work.The mentorship will have to taper off at some point when either there is no improvement shown, or the mentee is ready to stand on their own two feet.


Gradually reduce the amount of feedback you’re providing.You might say something like, “Writing can be a fun hobby. But if you feel this is your career path, it will take a commitment of a lot of time and hard work. Only you can decide where your true calling lies. I recommend that you start assessing your own work by self-regulating and gauging whether you’re improving.”"

Research the people and the issues that play a part in your assigned beat.,
Introduce yourself to the people on your beat.,
Maintain a strong sense of ethics by being discreet and trustworthy in how you handle information you obtain from your regular sources and contacts.,
Develop a reputation for accuracy, fairness and thoroughness with your audience by being the most dedicated beat writer you can be.",How to Be a Beat Writer," Beats could cover anything: health and wellness, sports, government, politics, education, entertainment, fashion or environmental issues. If you are the new education reporter, for instance, read previous articles about the school board in your area, about new hirings in the district you are covering, awards people within the district have won, and even state and national issues that could affect your area.


If you are hired by a small publication or broadcast entity with only a few reporters, you may be expected to cover more than one beat. It's a challenge, but it can be done.;
, Meet officials at the school district's main office, city hall, the law enforcement office, local sports team offices and even buyers at your large retailers, depending on your beat. Call ahead if possible to make an appointment or spend the day making cold calls based on the size of your market. (The smaller the news market, the more acceptable drop-ins are.) Take plenty of business cards with you, and make sure to receive cards or take notes about the primary people who'll be your contacts.Encourage them to contact you, so they become sources.


At the police station, for instance, your contact will generally be the Public Information Officer, but it's still a good idea to at least meet the police chief.

, They need to know they can trust you because they may need to tell you something as background information to explain something current, but they don't intend for it to be repeated in the media. If this occurs, file it away in your brain and notes, but don't divulge it to anyone and by all means, don't include it in a story.


Being discreet includes not badmouthing those with whom you deal. For instance, a sports reporter for the Washington Post with a reputation as a solid beat writer for his assigned team complained to another writer and was quoted in that writer's publication. He did eventually change beats, but not until after he endured harsh comments from fans, some players avoided him and he faced overall embarrassment.

, Know Associated Press (AP) Style (or the style guide your employer wants you to follow) and keep a style book with you when you write. (The most recent copies of those on the market should include standard guidelines for handling social media, something you need to understand)


A beat that is covered well will develop a solid following that may even strike up a relationship of sorts with you. They may make comments to online articles, write letters to the editor and send you tips or story ideas. Respond to them in a timely and professional manner. Beat writers can often even take their following with them when they move to a new media outlet, a real boon and selling point to a potential new employer considering you for their staff.

Each day, for the next thirty days, create an artwork with doorways as a focus. It could be a painting, drawing, mixed media collage, short film, photograph or another media that you enjoy using., A simple time limit can be useful. Put down ten pieces of newsprint on your studio floor or use small pieces of watercolor paper. Set your timer for ten minutes. Paint one sheet a minute., Give yourself some time to draw something. Then, make fifty photocopies. With each photocopy, make a new sketch overtop of the old drawing. Try to find as many ways to alter the original drawing as you can imagine. You should redraw each of the fifty photocopies so that it looks like a completely new artwork., If you have a mentor you trust, consider asking them for a creative assignment. It is important to ask somebody you know and trust, since they will be most likely to come up with an assignment that will challenge you., Search for workshops that introduce techniques or media that you don’t know, but which could help you build your art practice. By challenging yourself to try a new technique or process, you may find a way out of your artist’s block.If you are an abstract paper, try a workshop on realist painting.
If you normally paint in acrylic, try a workshop on oil painting.
If you normally shoot digital video, try taking a workshop on super 8 film.

, Take photos of everyday things around you. Then go back through them and doodle aspects of those photographs. You could also try reframing photographs with a viewfinder or small frame. Zoom in on small parts of an image.Find a muse. It can be a person or an animal or whatever inspires you.

, You may have spent too much time stuck in your studio. Give yourself a few minutes to take a walk around the block. Take your eyes off the pavement in front of you. Enjoy the sights, sounds and smells. A short walk can be energizing., If you have been spending a lot of time in the studio recently, you may simply need to expose yourself to a new place or environment. You don’t need to necessarily go far to find inspiration. You could go to a new garden, find a lookout or a park you’ve never visited in your city. Take some time off in an inspiring place.

, A roadtrip might be what the doctor ordered. Get in your car or book a flight to someplace you’ve always wanted to visit. Take your camera, sketchbook, journal and a few other art materials. Absorb and record your experience of the journey., There are many artist residencies available that offer the opportunity to work in a new place and with new people. Look into the qualifications and timelines. Find one that you feel is a good fit and send in an application. You may get the chance to spend time in a park, a new city, on the high seas, in a hotel, a gallery or an artistic community.


For instance, the National Parks have an artist-in-residence program., Spend some time outside in a park or garden. Go for a hike or arrange some flowers in your garden.If you can’t leave the city, spend some time in urban nature, such as a local park or garden.
If you have some vacation time coming up, go to a wilderness area. Get away from all the noise and find inspiration in nature.

, In order to overcome artist’s block, you need the time and the space to do it. First, make sure you have a place to work. It could be a gorgeous loft but, if the resources for a nice studio are unavailable, it could also be your kitchen table. Then, make sure you have the time to work. Set aside a specific amount of time and commit to it on a daily basis.If your studio is messy, it is important to clean it up. However, don’t spend time cleaning as an excuse not to work.
If you are unhappy with some aspect of your studio space, it makes sense to address it. For instance, if you don’t like the wall color, perhaps you should paint your studio.

, If you tend to spend a lot of time in front of a computer or answering emails on your smart phone, you may benefit from a timeout. Take a day away from technology and just focus on your creative practice., If you feel stuck with one creative project, you could switch to a different project. Perhaps spending time with a different project will give you inspiration for the project that is making you feel blocked., If you paint, start working with clay. If you create collages, try pen and ink. Explore new materials and tools. Look at shapes, rhythms and color in your life and outside your studio walls. Take a camera and just shoot what you find appealing., Browse through the nice books. Do some research on a topic you’ve been wanting to explore.Visit a big book store and go to the art or photography books section. Sit on the floor and peruse to your heart's content.

, Neglecting your bodily, emotional and spiritual needs cramps creativity. Spend a little more time on the masterpiece of you. Get your body moving and eat a solid meal.Work-out at a gym or take a run at a park.

Sleep and you may find yourself energized to make work in the morning.

, There will always be excuses to avoid making time for your creative practice, such as fear of making “bad art” or everyday chores that get in the way. At the end of the day, you need to give yourself permission to make something. It may take a little courage and persistence, but you need to start somewhere!


Throw some paint on a canvas. Release any emotional stress that might be in you.
The important thing is to wake up in the morning and jump into something.
Start with something easy, such as preparing a canvas.
Persistence is the key. As artist Chuck Close says, “Inspiration is for amateurs – the rest of us just show up and get to work.”"

Go letter by letter.,
Look at the author’s first name or title.,
Treat hyphenated names as one name.,
Skip punctuation and spaces.,
Ignore unimportant words.,
Use the author's last name to alphabetize.,
Alphabetize the editor's name on anthologies.,
Look at the title if the book has no author.,
List works by the same author according to style guidelines.,
Get your citations in order.,
Alphabetize manually.,
Sort with the word processing software.,
Use a bibliography generator.",How to Alphabetize a Bibliography," The first letter indicates where it goes generally in your bibliography. For instance, in ""Smith,"" ""S"" tells you it goes with the ""S""s. Once you get to the ""S""s, though, you need to know where ""Smith"" goes among the other ""S""s, so you move on to the next letter, ""M."" You continue going letter-by-letter until you figure out where it fits in with the other entries.


For example, say you have ""Sheldon,"" ""Smith,"" and ""Sherry"" as last names you need to alphabetize. ""Sheldon"" and ""Sherry"" both have the same first three letters, so you keep going until they are different. The fourth letters in each name are ""L"" and ""R,"" respectively. Since ""L"" comes before ""R"" in the alphabet, ""Sheldon"" comes before ""Sherry"" in your bibliography. Therefore, these names would be alphabetized in order in this way: Sheldon, Sherry, Smith.
""Smith"" comes last because the second letter in ""Smith,"" ""M,"" comes after ""H"" in the alphabet, which is the second letter in both ""Sheldon"" and ""Sherry."";
, If you have two or more works by two authors with the same last name, then you would use their first names to alphabetize your list of entries. If you have two or more works by the same author, then you would use the title of the work to alphabetize.For example, if one author’s name is Robert Smith and the other is Cynthia Smith, then the entry for Cynthia Smith’s work would come first.
If you have two books or other sources written by Cynthia Smith, then you would look at the titles of these works. For example, if one of the works is called Bird Tales and the other is called Zoo Life, then “Bird Tales” would come first in the list and “Zoo Life” would come second.

, In other words, use the first letter of the hyphenated name to alphabetize the name. Therefore, if you have the name ""Sheldon-Meyers,"" the name would be alphabetized under ""Sheldon.""If you have a ""Sheldon"" and a ""Sheldon-Meyers,"" the shorter name always comes first, so ""Sheldon"" would come before ""Sheldon-Meyers.""

, When alphabetizing, you don't pay attention to things like accent marks, spaces, or capitalization. You just continue going letter-by-letter to alphabetize.As an example, if you have the name ""Mc Murry,"" you essentially treat it as ""Mcmurry"" for alphabetizing purposes.

, Sometimes, you will be alphabetizing by title. When that's the case, you skip unimportant words at the beginning. The main unimportant words are articles, such as ""the,"" ""an,"" or ""a.""In other words, if the title is ""The Cat Who Couldn't Sleep,"" you would file it under ""Cat."" One of the reasons for this rule is that so many titles begin with articles that if they were alphabetized under those words, those sections would have too many titles to be useful for finding it later.

, In most style guidelines, the main way to alphabetize is to use the author's last name. If your book has more than one author, use the author whose name is listed first to alphabetize, though you will list all of the names in the citation.For instance, most citations begin with the author's last name, followed by the author's first name or initial, like this: Smith, Josie.
Therefore, you use ""Smith"" to place this citation in it's proper place in the bibliography.
If your book had two authors, it would be cited as ""Smith, Josie, and Roberta George."" Therefore, it would still be alphabetized under ""Smith,"" unless Roberta George was listed first in the book. Use the title page as your guide., Certain works, such as anthologies, will have editors as the main attribution in place of author. In other words, the editor or editors put together a work by many authors, so when you're listing the complete work, you use the editor's name or editors' names in place of an author's name.For instance, if the editor's name was Jess Jacob, you would alphabetize the entry under Jacob, Jess.

, Sometimes, a resource will not have a named author. If that's the case, you use the title of the resource to alphabetize the book in place of the author's last name.For instance, if the title of the resource is ""Cats and Their Sleeping Habits,"" you would file it under ""Cats.""

, Sometimes you may end up with more than one work by the same author. If this happens, then you will need to list each work in a separate entry, but the way you go about doing this depends on the documentation style that you are using for the assignment. If you are not sure which style your instructor prefers, then make sure that you ask.



APA style. Create a normal APA style bibliography entry for each of the works, but place them in the order that they were published. For example, if one work was published in 1993 and another in 1997, then the 1993 work would come first.MLA style. Start with a normal works cited page entry for the author’s work that comes first in the alphabet. For example, Pride and Prejudice would come before Sense and Sensibility in a list of works by Jane Austen. Then, start a new entry right after this entry, but begin it with two hyphens instead of listing the author’s last and first name again., Before you can alphabetize, you need to make sure you have your citations correct. To know exactly how to do a citation, you need to know what style guidelines your teacher or school requires. Some of the main styles are the Modern Language Association (MLA) style, the American Psychology Association (APA) style, and the Chicago Manual style.


For instance, a basic citation in MLA will look something like this one: Smith, George. How Cats Behave. New York: Cat Publishing House, 1989. Print.In this instance, the author's name is George Smith. ""How Cats Behave"" is the title. ""New York"" is the city it was published in, and ""Cat Publishing House"" is the publisher, while ""1989"" is the year it was published. ""Print"" is the format it was published in.
In Chicago Style, this citation would look this way in the bibliography: Smith, George. How Cats Behave. New York: Cat Publishing House, 1989. The basic style is fairly similar to MLA in the bibliography.The same citation would look like this in APA: Smith, G. (1989). How Cats Behave. New York: Cat Publishing House. Notice that this citation only uses the first initial of the author's name and moves the publication date closer to the beginning., The easiest way to alphabetize manually is to start with the ""A""s. Find all the citations that start with an ""A,"" and pull them to the top. Sort them out so that they are alphabetical, then move on to the ""B""s. Keep going until you've sorted all your citations.


Apply the alphabetizing rules as you go., Another way to alphabetize is to let your word processing software do the work. Put your citations in as separate paragraphs, meaning you just have a line between each citation. Highlight the text. In Microsoft Office, click on the button under the ""Home"" ribbon that says ""AZ"" with a little arrow.You might also need to look under the ""Table"" menu to find the sort button. It will ask you how you want them sorted. Choose by paragraph and text in ascending order.
The list will be sorted alphabetically, but you will need to format the citations with proper indentations and such still.

, A final option is to use a bibliography generator. You put all the information for your citations into a generator. It makes sure the citations are correct in the style you need, then it spits out an alphabetized list ready for you to use.However, it's important to check your citations when it's done, as these systems are not perfect.

For fantasy and science fiction writings, initials work best, such as J.K. Rowling and J.R.R. Tolkien.
For literary works, ""flowing"" names work better, such as Nicholas Sparks and Barbara Kingsolver.

, The amount of syllables must be easy to spit out, unlike Billie Letts (too many L's) or 2-syllable names.

, It sounds silly, but write each name out in easy print and give the names a bit of space on the paper. Keep working on what looks good and cross out the rest.

, Discard the ones that are being or have been used.

, Just about anything will work, such as, ""I have to read newest book!"" or ""Is coming for a book signing?""

, There's no formula for deciding the best one; if you like one better than the others, go with it!

, That always gives you an interesting new name, and you can choose the origin of the name, like Irish, English, African, or even mythology.

Review.",How to Pick a Topic to Write About," Do you need to write an essay topic for a class? Are you choosing to express your creativity through writing a short story? The reason why you want or need to write will determine the form and content of your writing. Knowing how much freedom you have in choosing your topic is also essential for planning.;
, Do you like the thought of writing stories? If so, consider writing fictional works. This means that your stories are not fully true. Although there might be true parts in them like the setting, you make up your basic storyline. There are several sub-genres within fiction, including:


Romance
Science fiction and fantasy
Historical fiction
Horror
Thriller
Mystery/Crime, If you prefer to discuss concrete facts, non-fiction is the genre for you. Within non-fiction you can focus on politics, science, current events, history, historical and contemporary people, and myriad other topics. You also can write theoretical works that discuss philosophy or social theories. Academic writing is normally non-fiction.


Creative non-fiction is a sub-genre of fiction. It combines facts with literary prose so that you are tell a story in an engaging style while painting the scene. This contrasts nonfiction that primarily states information or argues ideas., Do you prefer to write for children or young adults? Perhaps you would rather write literature for adults. Are you intending to pen a bestseller or share some thoughts with a smaller audience? Understanding for whom you plan to write will help you choose your eventual topic.


For example, teen audiences might prefer science fiction stories. That could be the right genre to use.
If you are writing a speech, for example, whether you are addressing your fellow classmates, parents, or your community will impact the content and style of your writing.

, Where do you want your writing to go? Do you prefer to write novels or newspaper articles? You could become a popular blogger. You also could write poetry. Deciding in what form (print, digital, book, newspaper, article, email newsletter) you want your work to appear can also help you pinpoint a theme.


Some mediums are better suited for certain types of writing. For example, if you want to write in a casual style about your daily life, a blog might be perfect for you. Writing a print novel about your vacation, on the other hand, would make less sense.
For non-fiction writers, consider starting with newspaper articles or blog posts. Then, once you gain momentum and experience, move up towards having journal articles or books.

, Taking about twenty minutes, write down what themes interest you.Do you like to read about immigration to Ellis Island? Perhaps you are a huge Minnesota Vikings fan. Write down anything and everything that piques your interest. The key is to identify what subject will keep you motivated. Writing is a long process so it makes sense to invest your time in an area that excites you. Upon looking at your list, pick your top three favorite themes.


If writing an academic paper, keep in mind the requirements of your assignment. In that case, focus your brainstorming on matching the areas you must investigate. Even though a topic might seem boring, how can you investigate it from an interesting angle? For example, if you must write an essay for a music class on Mozart, is there something related to him you do find intriguing? Perhaps you are interested in Salzburg, the city of his birth. You could write an essay examining how Salzburg impacted his musical development.
If you feel stuck on finding a good topic for a class assignment, talk to your teacher. He might be able to help you find a good theme. Ask your classmates as well for tips.

, Is there an area in which you are interested about which you already know? For example, are you interested in jewelry and already sell your products on sites like Etsy? If so, consider choosing this topic. Having prior knowledge on one of your favorite themes will expedite your writing process. It helps your confidence too if you already feel a bit like an expert.

, Do a bit of background research on your favorite theme. For instance, if you decided you wanted to write about equestrian training, see what books already exist on the topic. If you wanted to write children’s literature and use animals as your main characters, look at popular sources like the Berenstain Bears or Peppa Pig. What topics are these authors covering? Is there a missing area in this market segment?


Although it is smart to check your market, if you are writing solely for personal satisfaction, you can put less weight on this step. For example, if you are going to write children’s stories for your children using penguins, it matters most that you and your children like the final product.

, After doing your research, pick the topic that makes the best candidate for writing. After finding that topic, narrow your focus so you have one key idea. For example, instead of saying, “I’m going to write a story about penguins,” think, “I’m going to write an instructional tale about how two young penguins got lost on the way home from the market and used their thinking skills and cooperation to find their way to safety.” Consider making a mind map to help you think about possible, specific ideas.For example:


Draw one large circle with your topic, e.g. penguin fiction
Draw lines to smaller circles with subtopics, e.g. family life, education, home, playtime, work activities
Draw lines from your subtopics to new circles to keep narrowing your focus. For example, family life could lead to sibling relationships. Already, with this point, you have a much more specific focus: fiction about sibling relationships of penguins.

, If writing fiction, begin to jot down potential story-lines and characters. If writing nonfiction, start finding facts from sources that will help your writing. Begin to see how your topic works as a writing theme. Use this moment to be creative and not worry about perfection or identifying the best way to explain something. Think big and broad.

, Map out where your piece is starting. Describe where it is going and how it will get there. Think of your points as road signs that keep your story moving.


If writing a fictional story, craft a storyline with a beginning, middle, climax (turning point), and end. For example, if writing the penguin sibling story, chart out their journey to the market and their journey back home. When do they get lost? When do they access help? What is the turning point?
If writing nonfiction, create a structured outline that proves your point. Also, include an introduction, thesis statement (what you are proving and why), body paragraphs or sections, and a conclusion.

, After you have a finished outline, it is best to start writing. Understand that it might take a while to get in “the groove.” This is normal. Relax and continue writing. You always can revise later. The key is to have something on the page to revise.

, After you have completed your initial writing, read what you have written. How is your topic working? Are you able to write naturally about, for example, penguin sibling relationships? If not, what could you change? Maybe your characters need more refinement. Perhaps, you need to switch the setting. Oftentimes, small changes can make your writing feel better. If writing non-fiction, do your paragraphs lead logically to one another? How is your flow? Check to see if you are proving your thesis or main argument.

Use adverbs sparingly.,
Get rid of unnecessary adjectives.,
Avoid nominalizations.",How to Avoid Using Purple Prose when Writing1," Adverbs are words that modify a verb, an adjective or another adverb. They often end in “ly” and tell you when, where, why, or how something happened or is happening.Though adverbs can be useful in writing, they should be used sparingly. Using too many adverbs in one sentence or one passage of text can lead to purple prose.


For example, the sentence, “He moved slowly, at length, and carefully on tip toes through the room with an entirely unnecessary gaze trained on the purple, wooden front door” is purple prose because it is difficult to read and understand. It also contains three adverbs, too many clarifying phrases, and too many adjectives.
A more clear sentence would be, “He moved carefully through the room, training his gaze on the door.” This sentence uses one adverb and very few modifiers and adjectives.;
, Sometimes your sentences start to feel a bit cluttered with adjectives that do not add meaning or depth to what you are trying to say. You should be careful not to try to stuff your sentences with too many adjectives to make them sound richer or more sophisticated. Often, sentences with too many adjectives can end up confusing your reader.


For example, you may have the sentence, “I watched the beautiful, stunning, resplendent sunrise as it crested the battlefield, casting shadows and hues.” There are three adjectives in this sentence that are used to describe the sunrise. But rather than communicate to the reader the beauty of the sunrise, the three adjectives end up cluttering the image of the sunrise.
You can revise the sentence so it does not contain purple prose by picking one adjective. You may write, “I watched the stunning sunrise as it rose over the battlefield.” Sometimes, using just one adjective in a sentence can be more effective.

, Nominalizations occur when you take an adjective, noun, or verb and add a suffix to the end of it, such as “-ity,” “-tion,” or “-ism.” Many academics use nominalizations to discuss complex topics or ideas. But you should avoid using nominalizations in your writing, even if you are writing an academic paper. They are often more confusing than they are useful.


For example, you may use the nominalization “proliferation” (the noun “proliferate” combined with the suffix “-tion”) in a sentence: “The proliferation of thoughts in my mind was causing me to experience brain freeze in the middle of science class.” The use of “proliferation” only serves to confuse the reader and makes the sentence sound pompous. The nominalization does not add meaning or depth to the sentence.
You can rephrase the sentence by removing the nominalization and moving the subject to the front of the sentence, “My mind was crammed with too many thoughts, which is why I had a brain freeze moment in the middle of science class.”

Choose which character/s you want to kill off.,
Decide how the character will die.,
Write the first draft of your story.,
Put yourself in the other character's shoes.,
Edit the story, otherwise known as the spit-n-polish method.",How to Make Deaths in Your Story Seem Real," These are called 'Fate' characters. The most common Fate characters are antagonists, contagonists, and protagonists. Example: in 'Bridge to Terabithia' Leslie, one of the two protagonists, dies. Dorian Grey (The Picture of Dorian Grey) is also an example of a Fate Protagonist. Also, don't be afraid to kill off more than one character, several characters can die in a story or series. Choose a character that the reader will likely never guess will die. This creates suspense, and a few sensitive readers who were fond of the character might even cry (this is a good thing, which means they'll have the name of the author, that's you, so they'll want to read other books you might publish). Timing has to be perfect. The Fate Character could die at a turning point in the story, disrupting the entire plot or plans of other characters. Most commonly, characters die near the end of the story.;
, This is crucial because it could also affect the entire plot. Maybe another character accidentally killed the Fate Character, maybe they committed suicide. Be creative, and don't kill them off on a commonly used 'Kill' Method, such as car crashes. These will be overly predictable and readers will quickly get bored if they figure out how the character will die. If the person is going to get murdered, carefully choose who murders them, since this is a common 'kill method'.

, Don't rush and don't stress. This is your first draft so you can mess up the whole thing and write it again later.

, Now your other characters are going to be sad for the rest of the story. Try to imagine that this character was your best friend, a parent, a sibling, cousin, anybody you once cared about (note: you might cry if you do this, that's a very good thing). How would you feel? Sad? Angry? Scared? Remember, nobody would be happy after losing somebody they love, even the overly-cheerful characters.

, Go through your story. Make sure all of the previous events lead up to the Fate Character dying (unless they die unexpectedly). After the character dies, have every different character react in a different way. Temperamental characters would probably be furious.

Consider what you could do if you were not afraid.,
Consider what rebelling means to you.,
Think about how much your inability to live fearlessly is based in reality and how much of it is based in fantasy.,
Consider how to face that fear.",How to Live Fearlessly1," Ask yourself this question. It is a question you should pose to yourself as often as you can. To many people, it seems simple until they have to really answer it. Fear pushes a lot of of people in a corner. There seems to be more bravery in dreaming about doing things they most desire than actually being practical about life. Is this the case for you?


Write down what is holding you back.
Go over the list. Are those fears real, imposed from elsewhere or not even of substance?
Who or what is holding you back? What would happen if you challenged that person or set of circumstances?;
, From early childhood, being known as rebellious is considered sinful, failing to fit in, a troublemaker. Why is this? There is a very simple reason––people who are already set in their ways do not like change. And any person who is thought of as rebellious is usually a source of change. Perhaps switch out the term ""rebel"" for ""change maker"" or ""change bringer"". Is that more palatable in revising people's comments when you want to make changes in your life?


Why don't you live to your full capacity?
What are you most afraid of? Other people's expectations, loss of income or status, loss of routine, loss of freedom? What things have led you to believe that any of these things are real possibilities?
See the word ""rebel"" as a way to express freedom. A lot of people understand the dictionary meaning of freedom but fail to take in the depth of living life as fearlessly as they can; the reality is that most people meet their grave having had only half lived their lives.

, Fantasy is what people want but reality is what we need. It is easier to pretend we're going to have a great life than to actually implement it. Most dreams, ideas and plans die out because we let them die. We need to learn to act on whatever dreams, plans or ideas we have, we need to learn that fantasy is just that fantasy! Reality is essential.

, It's terrifying acting on your dreams. However, no one ever promised us any easy life. Your harvest is yours, so making its possible is in your hands––no one else's. Go ahead and make those plans; you will start to find that your life is going to fit around the plans.

Stay away from obscure language.,
Use concrete descriptions.,
Revise phrases you love a little too much.,
Write with your audience in mind.",How to Avoid Using Purple Prose when Writing2," Though you should always try to be creative in your writing, you do not want to use language so obscure your reader will end up getting confused and overwhelmed. Try to use language that is accessible and digestible to your reader. You do not want to use a more complex or obscure word in a sentence when a simple, clear one will do just as well.If you do decide to use obscure language, do so rarely and with intention. Try not to pepper every sentence with an obscure word or phrase that may confuse your reader or make it seem like you are showing off. No one enjoys reading a sentence that seems like it is trying too hard.
For example, you may have the sentence, “It was a howling, torrential night in December, the coldest month of the year, and the wind ripped through the cedar rafters of the house until the walls were ribboned and diced.” Though this sentence is descriptive, it uses language that feels overwrought and cluttered.
You may revise the sentence by adjust the word choice so it is concise and clear. You may write, “It was a stormy night in December and the wind howled through the house.”

, Purple prose tends to crop up when we use descriptions that are abstract and vague. You should create descriptions that are concrete and specific in your writing so you do not fall into abstraction and confuse your reader. Try to attach descriptions to the senses, describing how something or someone smells, tastes, sounds, looks, or feels. This will help to keep your descriptions concrete and avoid purple prose.

For example, you may use the following description in your writing, ""She was as swift as a bird and as smart as a whip."" This description uses cliches and comes across as vague and unclear.
You may revise the description so it is more specific and concrete,""She moved fast across the room, smelling of crushed flowers.""

, There is a common phrase in writing: “Kill your darlings.” This phrase suggests that sometimes you have sentences you love so much you do not realize they are full of purple prose. Go through your writing and consider if phrases or sentences that you absolutely love may not be as clear or concise as they could be. You may need to revise these phrases or get rid of them to make your writing stronger.


You should also consider if a phrase you love may be lovely on it’s own but does not fit with the voice of the character. Including phrases that you like for the sake of liking them can be jarring to your reader and make your character’s voice seem less genuine on the page.

, When you are deciding how you are going to phrase an idea or describe a scene, you should always consider who you are writing for. Ask yourself, “Who is my audience?” “What is the reading level of my audience?” “Will my audience understand my sentences?” If the answer these questions is “no”, you may be using purple prose in your writing. You should then consider how you can simplify your word choice so it is more appealing to your audience.For example, if you are writing a story for young adults, you should avoid using words that will alienate or confuse your audience. You may substitute complex words like “utilize” or “proliferate” with “use” or “grow.”
You may also consider how your teenage characters might express themselves and talk to one another. This can help you use language and word choice that is appropriate for your audience and for the characters in your story.

"
Break up your sentences.,
Keep your sentences active.,
Read your sentences out loud.",How to Avoid Using Purple Prose when Writing3," Purple prose tends to happen the most in sentences that are overly long or rambling. You can avoid purple prose by breaking up your sentences into digestible chunks. Doing this can help you write sentences that are clear and easy to read, without sacrificing any meaning or depth in your writing.For example, you may have the long, rambling sentence, “I wondered to myself how I was going to escape my predicament as I had royally screwed up once before in Mr. Medina’s class and he wasn’t the most lenient teacher at school so I realized I was to be in store for a several rounds of dull, boring detention and this meant I was going to miss Rory’s annual party so Rory will surely hate me for it.”
You can break up this sentence into a series of short, concise sentences. Breaking up the sentence can also help you recognize when the sentence starts to become confusing or not as strong as it could be.
The revised sentence would be, “I pondered how I was going to get out of this one. I had royally screwed up once before in Mr. Medina’s class. I figured I would earn a few rounds of detention for my screw up, which meant I would be a no show at Rory’s party. Rory will surely hate me for missing it.”

, Using the active voice in your sentences, as opposed to the passive voice, can help you avoid purple prose. Purple prose often appears in sentences that are in the passive voice, partly because we tend to lean on unnecessary words and phrases in the passive voice. Keep your sentences active, with lots of active nouns, and avoid the passive voice.For example, you may have the sentence: “The steering wheel spun dramatically out of my hands and continued spinning until I could no longer see clearly out of the windshield into the pitch dark night.” This sentence is confusing because it is in the passive voice and it uses adverbs that pile on top of one another, rather than add meaning or depth to the sentence.
You can rephrase the sentence in the active voice to make it easier to understand and digest, “I lost my grip on the steering wheel in the pitch dark night. The car spun around and around until I could no longer see out the windshield.”

, Get into the habit of reading your sentences out loud to help determine if they are full of purple prose. Listen to how your sentences sound when you read them out loud. Ask yourself, “Does this sentence sound confusing?” “Does it take me more than one full breath to read this sentence out loud?” If the answer to these questions is “yes”, you may need to rephrase or revise the sentence.


Writing for the ear can help you avoid purple prose, no matter the type of writing you are doing. Listen to how each sentence sounds and be willing to cut or adjust any sentences that seem wordy or unclear.

Do one thing every day that scares you.,
Map out what you'd do if you didn't live in fear all of the time.,
Start developing and implementing that fearless life you wish to lead.,
Expect to make mistakes.,
Talk openly to family and friends about what you're doing.,
Stop dreaming, start doing.",How to Live Fearlessly2," Eleanor Roosevelt once suggested this and it is a good guide to pushing you out of your comfort zone. Comfort zones may feel comfortable but they aren't always the best for you.

, Life looks very different when you ask yourself what things fear ties you down to. It may be a job you cannot stand, a relationship you've outgrown, a pattern of bad habits you feel you cannot break or a constant need to be in control, no matter the cost to you and others.


Would you rather a different job? If yes, how can you go about this? Do you want to change the parameters of the job you're doing within the existing organization or do you want to leave and work for another one? Maybe work for yourself and toss the J.O.B. right out of your life.
Would you rather better relationships? Are you fighting a lot, whining a lot, sucking up to people or running from them? What changes can you make to stand your ground, stop complaining and start enjoying the relationships around you? Be aware that you can't change them; they'll still be the whining and fearful people you know but you, you can change and shine above it all.

, It is simple even as it is hard:


Decide what is to change. Start making the changes, however gradually or immediately.
Have talks with your fears, regular sit-down sessions in which you argue back and throw spanners in the works of fear. ""Everything will go wrong"" is a common thought; answer is with ""Well, what if it does? I will pick myself up and try again and again.""
Do things differently. No matter how weird, irregular and uncomfortable at first, just start doing the changes you have imagined. It is in the doing that you will make the real changes and shift yourself from old you to new you.

, You will probably err, stuff up and fall flat on your face at times. Good. That means you know how to avoid those ways and start finding the ways that work. Do not see failure as oppressive; see it as action and learning. Real failure is staying stuck and refusing to move forward, refusing to allow your next stage of life to fully blossom.

, Many of them will be scared. You will need to reassure those most closest to you and most affected. But also help them to see that by your ability to live fearlessly, you will all benefit. You are setting them an example from which they can trust themselves to live larger too.


Avoid the negative people. They are the most afraid and they are the most averse to change. They will insist that whatever you're doing will fail, is doomed, will end up in a total mess. Tell them not to worry, you won't be asking them for a hand up or a handout. Stick to the people who support what you're doing instead. Find kindred spirits who wish to free themselves from socially and culturally condoned strait jackets too; together you have strength.

, Fear holds many a person back, stuck in the hoping stage without committing to doing. Dreams are useful to inspire you but when you stay stuck them out of fear, they cannot come into fruition.


Make yourself a series of motivational notes. Call them whatever you like, they must be action statements that give you the inspiration to get off your backside and keep the momentum going.

Accept that you have writer's block.,
Write about anything.,
Get some ideas on paper without worrying about how they sound.,
Try a change of pace.,
Decide when to give up on an idea.,
Decide whether the situation truly feels real.,
Try starting from another part of your story.,
Write something totally different.,
Use prompts.,
Use the world around you.,
If you can't possibly think of something to write about, just name a bunch of object or ideas.",How to Get Over Writer's Block1," When you have writer's block, no ideas spring to mind when you are writing and you are stuck for what to write. Understand that writer's block is easy to overcome, and there are many ways to get over it. Do not stop to the idea that you will never write again.;
, Anything in the world - even write about pineapples. It gets your brain to think more and be creative. This works the best for many people. Once you've thought of a paragraph or a few sentences about your topic go back to your story.

, The writing does not have to be polished; writers often have writer's block because they worry about the quality of their writing. Remember that nobody has to see a word you've written except you. You can show it to the world when you're ready.

, For example, if you have a long, action-packed sequence, try going over to a reasoned conversation. Be sure that the changeover makes sense. You don't have to write in one speed or one tone all the time. Something completely different can really end up inspiring you to reach new depths. If you tend to write dramatic scenes, switch to something a bit more lighthearted, or vice versa.

, Look over what you have written and ask yourself, ""Does this seem to be leading up to anything?"" If you feel like it's going absolutely nowhere, then it may be time to move on from it.

, You may have writer's block because the situation doesn't seem realistic to you. Don't be afraid to rewrite parts of the story to make it more natural.

, If you are having trouble with the beginning, write the middle or end. After you have written another part of the story, things may start to fall into place where you were before.


Writing out of order may require more familiarity with the plot so that everything makes sense from start to finish. At the same time, it may help you think out the details when you cannot decide what to do with your story. Writing a good ending while you think of about the rest of your story will help structure it.

, It may surprise you how much you like it! A monologue, song, poem, or even taking a short amount of time to write a scene from a completely different story will get your writer's blood flowing again.

, Out of all writers block stoppers, using prompts is one of the most effective ones. Use any random word or sentence to help you come up with a plot and start writing your story. For example if you asked a friend to give you a prompt and they said the words ""Forever"" and ""Passion"" you would most likely think of a romance. And if they were to give you the phrase ""Bite me"" then you would most likely think of a vampire or werewolf. (Twilight anybody?)

, Use the people around you and the personalities. Use the nature, atmosphere and scenes that surround you to build up your story/plot. The best possible way to do this is to use a diary. Jot down your daily life,random thoughts and feelings.

, Even if you think one won't work. It's a simple way to cure writer's block. To make it easier, say everything you're thinking about out loud. You'll bump into something. Good luck!

Set goals to determine your inspiration.,
Break it down into small parts.,
Make a list of what you’ve already achieved.,
Do something that makes you happy first.,
Identify and eliminate obstacles.,
Set incentives for yourself.,
Join a community of similar people.,
Find a friend and share with him or her.,
Study others you admire.,
Take breaks.,
Keep things new and fresh.,
Continue to monitor your progress.,
Tell people about your successes.",How to Inspire Yourself," Ask yourself what you want to achieve, and write it down clearly and in as much detail as possible.


Also write down what inspires you to make this change in your life, i.e. why you want it. Keep this around throughout your process of achieving it as a positive reminder of why you wanted to start in the first place.
Include what you think the positive outcomes for your life will be if you achieve this goal, but also the great things you already have to fall back on in case you don’t achieve it.
For example, you could write down: “Getting better at soccer will give me a good chance at getting a college scholarship, which would make me happy and allow me to keep playing it at the next level. But I’m already really happy with my performance on the junior league, and I love my team.”;
, Take a big goal or project and break it down into several smaller ones that seem more manageable and easier to find daily inspiration for, like “Exercise for 30 minutes three times a day this week.""


Use smaller goals to build up to something larger. Set a goal for each day or week (and it doesn’t have to be the same from one to the next), like producing one new piece of art or writing. Soon, you'll have enough work for the portfolio you're ultimately working towards.
Try breaking down smaller goals even further by setting time limits, like “work on this for one hour” instead of the more general “work on this today.”, Picture yourself completing your goal more easily by reminding yourself of all the things related to it that you’ve already achieved, or even accomplishments that are totally unrelated but have brought you great joy or inspiration.


Try making a list of the hardest things you’ve ever done, whether physical, intellectual, or emotional. This may help you recognize that your current task is achievable after all you’ve done, and it may not be so hard to handle after all.
If you’re having trouble coming up with specific achievements to write down, simply make a list of things that make you happy or feel good when you do them.You can use this to remind yourself of things that inspire you, or do those same things later as incentives for your work.

, Listen to your favorite song, talk to your best friend or family member, or do something you know never fails to make you happy, right before you embark on a step of your plan or goal.


Your positivity and happiness is scientifically shown to improve productivity and avoid procrastination.Try practicing gratitude for more happiness in your life: every day, write down three good things that happened to you, that you are grateful for, or that you can appreciate in some way. This has lasting benefits for your happiness over time.Try exercising before working on your goal. Even if it’s difficult or you don’t particularly enjoy a workout, a quick one will get your heart rate up, your blood flowing, and release mood-boosting endorphins in your brain.

, Ask yourself what the excuses or hurdles are that prevent you from feeling inspired to work on a goal or plan. Then address those obstacles, by either working on them first or dismissing them as unimportant.For instance, if an excuse of yours is that you can’t find the time to commit to working on your goal, try cutting away something in your day that is less important and takes up time, like watching TV or surfing the internet. Maybe you find that you are only finding other things to do to avoid work toward your goal.
If your goal is to organize rooms in your house but you have more stuff than you have the space or time to deal with, focus first on removing the obstacle by setting a separate goal of sorting through items and either donating, giving away, or throwing out what you don’t need.

, Come up with a reward you can give yourself after you complete each part of your goal, whether it’s simply setting aside a block of time to do something fun, buying yourself a treat, or getting that item of clothing or a gadget you’ve been wanting.


Also useful is de-incentivizing procrastination or other unproductive behavior. Try a “commitment device” by giving a friend or family member a sum of money, your phone, or something else that is valuable to you, and tell them they can’t give it back until your task is completed, or even get to keep it if you aren’t done by a certain time., Surround yourself with people who are already achieving what you want to achieve, or working toward the same thing. You are more likely to do something if you are around others who do it too.If you’re trying to get healthy or fit, join a fitness club, a gym, or dieting group that meets regularly. If you’re a writer or artist, join a workshop or work in the company of other creatives. If you’re learning something new, study with a group that has to pass the same test or goal.
Don’t be afraid of a little peer pressure to create a positive motivating effect. Tell others about your goal so they hold you accountable for your success in completing something, whether you promise someone you’ll send them a new piece of writing or art every week, or you simply have someone regularly ask you how you’re doing with your goal.

, Get together with a like-minded person who wants to achieve something similar as you, or has a different goal but wants to work with someone to motivate and inspire one another.


Try working on a part of your goal at the same time that a friend works on hers. Set a schedule and a place that you both have to be, and you’ll be more likely to show up and put in the work.
Don’t forget to include the friend in your reward for completing something! Double your enjoyment of the incentives you’ve set for yourself and you’ll be even more likely to keep up the inspiration for your plan. You and a study buddy can make it a tradition to go get ice cream after your study session, for example.

, Read work by authors whose writing you love, observe athletes who are the best at the sport you want to do, or watch inspiring videos about people who have achieved your same goals. Research these people and their work for inspiration.


Check out books on inspiring people in your field from your local library, or ask people you know what their favorite person or resource for a given topic is. You can even find websites and forums dedicated to finding inspiration from those that have come before you.
Try a quick and easy way to get inspired by others by looking up inspirational quotes or proverbs. Find one that sticks or that seems to speak to you and your current task. Then copy it and display it somewhere you will see it often., Take at least 15 minutes out of every hour you are focused and working on something to stop or get up and move away from where you’re working to do something else.Breaks are a great time to renew your sense of purpose by reviewing your goals, the reasons you’re inspired to achieve them, and the list of things you’ve already achieved as a reminder of success.
Use a break to drink water or eat a healthy snack like an apple. You’ll be much sharper and more focused mentally and physically when you’re hydrated and have nutrients to run on. Avoid caffeine, sugar, and energy drinks that give you a quick boost of energy but make you crash and dehydrate you in the long run.Try taking a walk on your break, ideally outdoors if possible. The natural habitat can inspire you, and this allows you to think and refocus by restoring your brain’s ability to block distractions., Find new places to work on achieving parts of your goal. Study in a new room of the library, run or workout in a new park, or go to a coffee shop or other public space to work in a notebook or on a laptop. Even wear something new that makes you feel good while you work.


Even if you have to stay in the same office or other space, mix it up by going to sit at a desk or in a room that isn’t being used. You can even sit next to somebody who appears very focused to feed off his or her energy as well as benefitting from the new scenery and physical space that may lend inspiration.If you start associating a space or any particular conditions with procrastination or other unproductive habits (either because you’ve done a lot of procrastination in that space or it negatively affects your mood), change your surroundings right away if possible.
Also keep adjusting your incentives. If the rewards you’ve been giving yourself after achieving each step toward your goal have become too routine or are no longer inspiring you, change them to something new that will keep you going.

, Check items off, cross them out, or chart your progress and celebrate your collective success to inspire yourself to keep at it till the end.


You can even schedule a weekly check-in with yourself, during which you evaluate exactly how far you’ve come, address any new obstacles that may have come up, and determine what has been working to inspire you and what has not., Just as you may have used friends or a community to inspire you to complete tasks or achieve goals, you should also tell other people when you are successful at getting through even a small part of it.


Keep others updated on your progress. Making your plan or goal a part of your identity helps you stick with it, and also is likely to create admiration and praise from others, which will help you keep moving forward.Teach people about what you’ve learned in the course of achieving your goal, whether it’s a new skill, technique, or fact. Teaching another person helps solidify the knowledge in your own brain, not to mention brings the happiness that comes from helping someone else.

Break down large goals into smaller targets.,
Be prepared to change course.,
Be brave enough to ask for help.,
Know how you will deal with a lag in motivation.",How to Harness Motivation to Achieve Any Goal," You’ll find that visualization is often included in the methods that motivational speakers use to help their clients. The difference between visualizing and thinking is that visualizing allows you to use all of your senses. When you can see, hear, smell and feel your goal, it becomes more real to you. The vividness of the goal makes you strive for it more.


For example, visualizing your victory in a game, climbing a high mountain or finishing a work of art can help you work towards your objective.;
, What’s your reason for having the goal you’ve set for yourself? It’s easy to get distracted by the world and sometimes you can forget why you’re even attempting to achieve a certain objective. These distractions can cause you to feel less motivated. By writing down the reasons why you want to reach a goal, you can relive the passion you once had when you first set the goal.


It’s recommended that you create your list using pen and paper because it provides more of a mental connection, compared to typing on a computer.

, When you try to tackle a large project head on, you’ll likely feel overwhelmed rather quickly. This can bog down your mental faculties, causing you to feel less motivated to complete the assignment. By breaking down a large job into a bundle of smaller tasks that you can quickly finish, you will feel less stressed. Each time you complete a task, the reward center of your brain will trigger the release of dopamine, which is a feel-good chemical. This will help to keep you moving forward because you feel a sense of accomplishment after reaching each milestone.


It’s important that you set deadlines and milestones realistically, so that they can be easily attained.

, When you’re trying to achieve a goal, having a plan is helpful for getting there. However, things do change, which can, at times, prompt you to give up. Instead, be prepared to try a different route that can steer you towards the same outcome, just in a different way. Don’t get lost in the maze of life!

, It’s your goal and you want the gratitude of knowing that you accomplished it on your own. But sometimes, a little help can go a long way. Just because you receive help doesn’t mean it takes away from you achieving your objective.


Make sure that you seek help from the right people. Just as you need the right tools for a construction job, so do you need the right people to complete certain tasks. If someone says no, either ask another person, or try the same person again later.

, Planning ahead to have in place solutions for dealing with a lag in your motivation isn’t negative thinking. Motivation has its peaks and valleys, which makes it a smart idea to plan for the valleys. When your motivation starts to dip low – which is more than likely to happen at some point, especially for long-term goals – what are you going to do about it? This is important to know because it will help to keep you from quitting altogether.

Look over what you've written.,
Play the ""and then"" game.,
Write a backstory about your main character.",How to Get Over Writer's Block2," Or use your computer, if that works better. This is the first thing you need to channel a character -- a blank canvas.

, It can be the name of a person you know, a person you read about, or just something that randomly pops into your head.

, Under the name, start making a list, ask yourself questions like: Who is this person? How does he/she look like? Does this person have any siblings, if yes then who?

, Allow the character to form in your mind, see the character in your head, become the character.

, What is it like when the character wakes up in the morning? Does he/she go to work or school? How does he/she feel about his family? What does he/she like to have for lunch? All of these details add up to a life.

, When you are done with the list, read through it and hopefully you will be able to place this character in a scenario, that might spark the idea for a story… maybe just one detail you came up with can spark your interest in an entire story.

, Surprisingly, this game is a great way to cut yourself out of writer's block. Start with any random sentence, for example ""One day there was a girl named Destiny"" then you continue the story with ""and then"" after every sentence. ""And then she met a guy named Daniel. And then she found out he was a vampire"" etc. That might not be how you write a story, but, the deeper you get, you end up finding a plot.

, Create tons of info about your main character -- why is her hair so short when all of the other girls have long plaits? Her hair was like that too, but an evil man tried to cut her neck in a chase and she ducked, her hair flying up, causing him to slice it, instead.

You can even plot the book, or write down what it is about the characters or scenes that really inspires you. Try picking something in the genre you're writing in, whether it's Sci Fi, Romance, or a Thriller, to get ideas about your subject matter.

, If you reread your story or other previous stories, it might spark something in your brain. Inspiration is a mysterious thing; it can come back at any time.

, Read a story about someone who you like or admire and make a character based on that person, include their personality traits and hobbies so if you do write a story on them it makes it easier when you're knowing almost everything about them.

, Poetry can also inspire you to write fiction -- or to write some poetry of your own! You may be surprised, but an image in a poem, whether it's the ""Silken, sad, uncertain, rustling of each purple curtain"" in Poe's ""The Raven,"" or the line, ""You, my father, there on the sad height,"" from Dylan Thomas' poem, ""Rage, Rage Against the Dying of the Light,"" that brings an image or an idea to mind, soon enough, you'll be inspired by a completely new idea!

, Hey, picking up a book about a historical event, such at the Montgomery Bus Boycotts or the Siege of Leningrad, can also help you come up with a new vision or idea that took place during that time. Soon, you'll have new characters, plots, or lines of dialogue floating through your head.

, Find a newspaper and rewrite the article -- that murder last week was a ghost getting revenge on her evil grandson, and... (this can help get ideas flowing).

Take a break.,
Don't be hard on yourself if you can't think of anything.,
Don't edit while you write.,
Don't panic.,
Don't compare yourself to your favorite writers.",How to Get Over Writer's Block4," Sometimes a nap helps (you never know what you'll dream about, plus sometimes, while you're lying in bed, you'll have a sudden flash of inspiration. You should write it down instantly, even if it's in the middle of the night.) or you can watch a movie or go for a walk. Seeing new things can help stimulate your brain and thus giving your imagination a boost. Cook a meal, clean the house or play with your pets. Completely forget about your story for a while.

, If you really can't write a word and would rather lie down and relax or do something else, don't punish yourself. Even the world's best writers can sometimes only write for an hour or a few hours a day. Gustave Flaubert, the author of the classic, Madame Bovary, was said to only write a single sentence per day!

, You can obsess over every sentence or every line later. If you are telling yourself that each paragraph absolutely must be absolutely perfect then you'll never get to the next paragraph!

, Everyone gets writer's block at least once in their lives as it's perfectly normal. You can even say that going through writer's block and breaking through it, will help you be an even more imaginative and creative writer.

, Okay, so maybe you don't feel up to speed with Stephen King, Louis Sachar, Emily Bronte, or Dostoevsky. That doesn't mean you should feel inadequate or like you're the worst writer on the planet. Use these writers for inspiration, as a standard you'd like to achieve, one day, not as benchmarks for your own failure or success. Once you take the pressure off, you'll be able to write much more freely.

, For example, ""The flying turtle ate the talking pineapple, even though he knew it was the unicorn's best friend."" You can generate several crazy sentences and pick the best one, if you're really in the groove. Don't judge yourself or hold back. Just write whatever comes to mind.

, Repeat this until you have a list of three or more ideas.

, Make it as crazy as possible. If you are typically a sensible and serious person, you should take a break and attempt to write the most boring story ever. Once you've found at least 5-6 ""good"" crazy sentences, you should have something to work with. Read them over. They'll make you laugh, feel more loose, and feel less restrained about always writing the most perfect sentence in the world.

, Use that one sentence as the opening of a short story, or even a short short story. Don't let it hold you back. Maybe even just pick one or two phrases or words from that sentence, and use them for inspiration. Keep writing until you feel relaxed and like you have something to work with!

, Okay, so maybe all of your sentences were too crazy or ridiculous to work with. That's okay. Let the process itself inspire you and make see that it's easy to let loose and generate crazy sentences once in a while -- it's not about achieving perfection!

If you do not already have a goal in mind, make a list of the things that you would like to accomplish in the next 3 to 5 years. Once you have made your list, try to narrow it down to one thing. It is much easier to stay focused on one goal instead of three.;
, Once you have narrowed down your goal, type it out in big words. Then print your goal and post it on your bedroom wall, bathroom mirror, or refrigerator. You can also post it at work or put it on your computer desktop. These reminders will help you keep focused on your goal.Make your goal just a few words long like a mantra. Try repeating your goal at least once a day to yourself, preferably in front of a mirror or while meditating.
Posting pictures of your goal will also help. For example, if your goal is to hike to the top of Half Dome, pin up pictures of Half Dome around your room or at your office to motivate you to stick to your goal.

, Don’t think of your goal as this big giant thing that you want to accomplish. Try to scale down your thinking by taking baby steps toward your goal. For example, if you want to exercise, you may be thinking that you need to workout intensely 5 days a week. Instead, start small by exercising once a week for 20 minutes, and then move on from there.You can’t fail if you start with something very easy and doable.

, Let your mind wander and you may find yourself ending up with some great new story ideas!

, system. What if _____? What if _____ happened to _____? What would happen if _____?

, You should always analyze your story and re-read it. You might get ideas from actually re-reading your own work!

, Sometimes writer's block can be caused by lack of inspiration, fear, or anxiety whereby one loses the craving to write and gives up. Therefore, if you think you lack inspiration you can try visiting the library and picking up some books that interest you and get your inspiration back!

, Maybe you will discover some inspiration from doing that! You may even think of any words that you like, and they may inspire you. What about 'survive', 'love', 'betrayal', 'harsh', 'cruel', 'kind'?

, Your parents divorcing, moving to a new country, whichever want. But only whatever that has happened to you that’s worth reading!Write about an important event in your life, but twist it around. What if you did something differently? Write about what could have happened.

Figure out your themes.,
Write your key message.,
Make your quotes pithy.,
Use imagery to communicate meaning.,
Use metaphor.,
Integrate data into the quote.,
Revise a famous quote to suit your topic.,
Address a life virtue.,
Make it personal.,
Write ten drafts of the quote.",How to Make Good Quotes1," Brainstorm a list of the top themes you want to address with your quote. Give yourself fifteen minutes to jot down the themes or issues you want to address with your quote. You can use point form, such as single words or short phrases that indicate a theme.If you are writing a sports quote, your key themes might include: performance, athleticism, endurance, perseverance and nutrition.
If you are writing a business quote, your key themes could include: competition, new markets, collaboration, opportunity and strategic planning.
If you are creating a quote about charity or politics, you might be focusing on a particular issue such as homelessness, poverty, environmental degradation or health care.;
, Consider what you want your audience to understand about the theme or issue you have identified. If there is a key message you want your audience to walk away with after reading your quote, you should write it down. At this point, you can write your communications goal as a short paragraph.For instance, you could write: “I want my teammates to understand the importance of diet and nutrition for athletic performance. Specifically, I want them to understand the importance of eating enough protein.”
If you are writing about homelessness in your city, you could write: “I want my audience to understand the scope of the homelessness problem in our city. I also want them to understand that homelessness is connected to poverty and income.”

, You want your quotes to be pithy, which means packing a lot of meaning into a short phrase. Your quote should be like a headline that grabs attention, rather than a long story at the back of the business section.The following examples illustrate how one can pack a lot of meaning into a short quote:


Anne Frank’s Diary of a Young Girl includes the line: “How wonderful it is that nobody need wait a single moment before starting to improve the world.”John F. Kennedy said, “As we express our gratitude, we must never forget that the highest appreciation is not to utter words, but to live by them.”, A vivid image can help you pack a lot of meaning into a short phrase. Good quotes are often evocative and memorable because of a particular image that the quote calls to mind. So, you could start by brainstorming various images or pictures to anchor your quote.John Berger wrote: “In Degas’s compositions with several dancers, their steps, postures and gestures often resemble the almost geometric, formal letters of an alphabet, whereas their bodies and heads are recalcitrant, sinuous and individual.”, Try using metaphors in your quotes by saying that something is like something else. If you attach a name or image to one thing that belongs to something else and do not use “like” or “as” to make the comparison, you are making a metaphor. Metaphors allow your writing to be more economical and concise. If your metaphor is apt, people will remember it as a great quote.For instance, you could write: “His eyes were moonlight.”, People may be more likely to remember your quote if it references important or surprising data. However, instead of integrating actual numbers and decimal points, you should use approximations and ratios. For instance, you could use phrases like, “twice as many” or “one third of Americans.”The CEO of the Institute for Sustainable Investing observed: “Really significantly, twice as likely to invest in a stock or a fund if sustainability is part of the value-creation thesis.”, Take a famous quote and tweak it to your own specifications and beliefs. For instance, you could find a famous quote by searching on Google. Then, use your sense of humor to revise the quote so that it speaks to the topic you are discussing.


For instance, you could revise John F. Kennedy's 'Think not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country!'. Insert a different topic in place of country, such as ‘safety’. So, the revised quote would read: 'Think not what safety can do for you, but what you can do for safety!'

, For instance, consider making a quote about patience, kindness, good judgment or decisiveness. Then, use a simile or analogy to show a correspondence between two things that are relevant to this virtue. For instance, the act of making a decision in the game of chess is analogous to making a decision in life itself. This analogy can be the basis for a quote:'Life is like a game of chess. There are many moves to take, but you ultimately have to take one nonetheless.'
Oscar Wilde used simile to create memorable lines about love: “Keep love in your heart. A life without it is like a sunless garden when the flowers are dead.”, Find something that relates to your life and experience. Rather than using images or metaphors that have no correspondence with your own life experience, you should try to integrate a personal perspective into the quote. Otherwise, you could just grab a quote from a book of quotes or a quotations website.


If you are in high school, you could write: 'Life is a road, and high school is just a pothole'

, Using imagery, metaphor, simile, data references and other techniques, compose ten distinct drafts of your quote. Once you have ten drafts, you can review them to find the most memorable version."
"
Read a blog, book, or magazine.,
Read success stories.,
Surround yourself with successful people.",How to Get the Inspiration & Motivation for Success2," Learn about your goal by doing an Internet search on your goal. Chances are that other people have had similar goals and have since figured out how to accomplish it. Also find books or magazine articles talking about the different ways other people have accomplished similar goals.For example, if your goal is to get into a graduate program, look into books like “Strategies for Getting into Graduate School” or “Applying to Graduate School.”


Go to your favorite local bookstore or library, and ask someone at the reference section to help you find books relating to your goal.

, Read success stories about people who have accomplished similar goals. These stories are often inspiring and motivating, and will show you that it only takes focus and determination to reach your goal.


In your Internet search bar, type in your goal and search for specific people who have accomplished the same or a similar goal. Knowing that others have successfully accomplished a goal will motivate you to keep going.
You can also post inspirational quotes by people who have accomplished major goals in their life around your room or on your bathroom mirror as well.

, Surround yourself with people who have goals and plans; people who are going somewhere with their lives and have high aspirations. At the same time, try to stay away from toxic people; people who complain and whine all the time.Join a club or a community group with individuals who have similar intentions as you: to realize their goals.
Be willing to let go of old friends. For the majority of people, this is the hardest part. But it is a necessary step if your friends are negative or if they just don’t inspire you."
"
Make a timeline.,
Practice positive self-talk.,
Don’t give up.,
Read a book or a blog about your goal.,
Ask for support.",How to Get the Inspiration & Motivation for Success3," Sit down and write out a timeline for your project or goal. This will help you to stay on track, and you can refer back to it when your motivation wanes. For example, if your goal is exercising, on your timeline state that you would like to be able to run a mile in one month. Then make a mini plan for how you will accomplish that goal between now and your one-month mark. Cutting up your goal into increments of time will help you stay focused and keep you from becoming overwhelmed.

, Control your inner dialogue and practice positive self-talk. Replace negative self-talk such as, “I can’t do it,” “I’m not the best,” “I’m not smart enough,” with positive self-talk such as, “I can do it,” “I am the best,” and “I am smart; if they can do it, I can do it.”, Stick with your goal by realizing that every process has an ebb and flow. Motivation is not a constant thing. There will be times when you are doing a great job of sticking to your timeline and your goals. However, other times, your motivation will wane, but know that this feeling is not a permanent, lasting feeling. Stick it out and wait for that motivation to come back., When your motivation is low, read a book or a blog about your goal. For example, if your goal is to publish a book or a journal article, read a book about writing for journals and publishers. These books have great tips for staying focused.

, You can also ask for support when having trouble sticking to your goal. Join an online forum, ask a friend, mentor, or a family member. Remember that talking it out will help you resolve the issue.

Make it bold.,
Cut extraneous references.,
Aim for resonance.,
Do a soft launch.,
Share your quote.",How to Make Good Quotes2," Consider how you could make your quote bold and definitive. A memorable quote draws clear distinctions and offers clear judgments about an issue, rather than making vague remarks.For instance, the following quotes are good examples of boldness:


John F. Kennedy said, “My fellow Americans, ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country.”Robin Sharma said, “Leadership is not about a title or a designation. It’s about impact, influence and inspiration. Impact involves getting results, influence is about spreading the passion you have for your work, and you have to inspire teammates and customers.”

, Your quote should not require a long explanation for people to get it. You should be able to say your quote and get an immediate response from an audience. If you find any references that your audience might not understand, you should cut them.For instance, if your quote includes acronyms or technical jargon, you might want to cut it.
If your quote contains references to specific programs that your audience might not be familiar with, you should consider cutting those references.

, Your quote should resonate with people’s ideas or feelings about the issue or theme you are addressing. When you say your quote, you want people to remark that they have the same idea or that they were thinking the same thing but didn’t know how to put it into words. This is sometimes called the “amen” factor., If you want to use your quote at a big talk, speech or include it in a publication, you should test it with a few people first. Say it to friends or colleagues to see whether it resonates with them. At this stage, you should try to get some constructive feedback. Ask your friends and colleagues what they like and dislike about the quote. Then, work on revising it until you find something memorable., Share your quote with friends, colleagues or online. If it resonates with folks, you can use it as part of your personal branding. It is good to have a few quotes, however, so you avoid overusing a particular phrase."

Some of the programs will give you one text box to include both the quote and the author, whereas others will give you a text box for the quote and another box for the author attribution., Once you have your image and your quote in the text art program, you can play around with the formatting.

Think about the variety of people's personalities, think about how two people may react to abnormal circumstances.,
Build characters.,
Describe.,
Try writing a scene from the viewpoint of several characters to get a feel for their personalities and for whether their perspective would be better for the story.,
Recheck.",How to Get Ideas for a Story3," Many writers go for a theme of particularly gritty characters and situations.

, Think of characters for your story. Stories typically contain protagonists, antagonists. Some stories have a lot of perspectives, some only a few or one. Decide on what you want your characters to be. Don't cram too many personality traits into one person but don't invent a new character every couple of pages either. Remember to keep your characters ""in-character"". Would they really do that? Would anyone? What are the motivations behind what they say and their choices.

, When is the story set, where, why. How does it look, smell, feel. Does it feel different to different characters and why. Describe all the senses but be sparing. Too much detail can be more exhausting.

, See if you need to strengthen or eliminate the character or work them in somewhere else.

, Read back through your story and see what you still like, keep doing this. Don't be afraid to abandon an old concept which seemed good at the time but is weakening your story.

Ensure proper time and consistency.,
Nail the ending.,
Write a lot.",How to Get Ideas for a Story4," It would be nice if our ideas came in the best chronological order but typically they don't. Shift events around and experiment with different time frames.

, Writing the beginning and middle of a book is somewhat easier to approach sometimes and you are unbound in potential. By the end of your book though you will need something really good to seal the deal. It really does make the difference. Be sure to read your story like you've never read it before. Read the details, think like the reader. What does the reader think is interesting?

, Splash out on a new pad and pen and take it everywhere with you. Survey, interrogate and observe the people that are around you and write as much as possible every day, write about everything then go back and sift out interesting bits that can be used as starting points for ideas.

Edit and fill in story details only after your rough draft is complete.,
Get feedback!,
Make the finished product.",How to Finish the Story You Started," Keep the idea in your mind, never let go of it. You don't have to know the entire story in advance, but try to write at least a few notes in any format you want. Notes will help to keep you focused and on track.


Know your audience. Is it preteens, teens, adults? Adjust your vocabulary and tone for that audience.
Name your genre, if you know it. This will provide further focus for your story and give you a better understanding of your audience and your purpose for the story.;
, List the main idea and supporting ideas, or write a high-level time line.

, Don't worry about names yet. (Open the phone book and put any first and last names together if you can't think of any.) Especially for longer works, it can be difficult to keep track of many characters, and it can interrupt your flow if you have to stop and read back to find out what somebody's name was.

,


Don't worry about punctuation and spelling at this stage.
Write in larger chunks. If you get up for a drink, or wait a day to continue, you may lose your flow and your ideas will be lost.
Write every day. If you are writing a longer story, write it daily and in large pieces. Give yourself a daily target word count, perhaps 1000 to 2000 words and a deadline based on that pace.
Write first, then edit. During this first draft, give your inner critic some time off. Reread just enough to pick up where you left off if you are writing in multiple sessions.

, For ideas to pour out freely, you'll need to have time alone. Close the door, go to the coffee shop or the library if you can tune out passing traffic (or draw inspiration from it).

, If you can touch type quickly and comfortably (and avoid going back to tinker with the previous day's work until you're done), then write on the computer. Otherwise, dig up a typewriter or a fountain pen, if that is what you prefer. You can always type up a manuscript later.

, Especially in a longer story, you may find yourself wondering what to do next. Don't get too hung up on these decisions. Talk it over out loud if you have someone who will listen. Write a few more notes to explore a theme. Flip a coin. Then, choose some direction and take it. There are no wrong answers, and you can change the story later if you need to.


Don't be too nice to your characters, and don't make them too perfect. As you get to know them, you may start to like them, but for the story to be interesting, they must have flaws (or at least quirks or weaknesses) and they must encounter challenges.

, Details make a story interesting. Send your audience into the unknown and make it feel real.

, You need to let others read it, listen to their comments. Don't feel criticized, they're just being helpful.

, Re-edit it. Does it look nice? Send it to an editor.

, For example, if you live in a nature filled place, take a look at the leaves and how they sway in the wind and those small, delicate butterflies that flutter from flower to flower. Writing down notes of what you see, touch, taste, hear and smell will help you on the road to coming up with a new story idea.

, It may seem strange, but you never know where doing this might lead by way of a character leading a curious life. If there aren't people around, try Googling up pictures of random people and using them instead.


Try people watching when at your favorite coffee shop or while waiting for a bus.

, You can find plenty of topics that you would have never thought of by searching websites, search engines and article sites.

, The plotlines for numerous famous stories and novels were hatched in the dreams of their author's. It may seem unlikely, but your dream could become a bestseller someday!


Keeping a journal and pen on your night stand right before you go to sleep is helpful. If you have an insane dream that you must write down, grab your journal and start writing.






The dreams don't have to be recent. They can also be ones that you remember from your childhood or many moons ago.

, For example: a secret diary, a squishy banana and a sneaky babysitter. Take your three phrases or words and try to make a story out of it. You'll never know how it will turn out if you don't try!

, The type of story you choose to write about must be developed around a certain genre and is the most important part of coming up with a story. Whether it's a romance, teen fiction or a thriller, selecting the genre may be a good source of inspiration for more ideas.

Each story was probably inspired from the author's own exploration of other books or tales and things that happened to or around them in their daily lives.Try re-reading a favourite story or a new book that you may enjoy.
Read as much and as often as possible.

, Each time you are artistic doesn’t need to be a professional drawing or piece of artwork. Instead you should try activities, such as doodling or sketching, as a way to be creative without the pressure that can come with creating art. If you are not comfortable drawing, but still want to express your creativity you could try colouring. People find inspiration in all sorts of creative activities. Have fun and get in touch with your artistic side."

Explore the world around you.,
Change your work environment.,
Engage with nature.,
Go for a walk.",How to Find Your Muse2," This is something that is often overlooked, simply because we go to and from the same places everyday. Try and pay closer attention to common places in your life, such as home, work, the grocery store, a local park, etc. So many interesting things happen around us - a bird flies into a door, a girl accidentally steps in dog feces, a woman two aisles over slips on water that wasn't properly wiped up, a guy parks his car halfway onto the grass at an odd angle - but we rarely take note of them. Spend more time thinking about and watching your local environment in order to find something that inspires you. Try out these fun ways to make your daily routine more engaging and inspiring:Walk around your house and try to find 5 to 10 items that you forgot about. Re-engage with them and remember the story of how they came to be in your possession.
Take a new route to work. If you normally drive or take public transit, try riding a bike or walking.
While on public transit don’t spend the entire time listening to music or reading the paper. Instead, try listening to the conversations of the people around you. These stories may help to promote new and creative thoughts.

, If you normally work from an office or studio try changing your work environment to help inspire you in a variety of ways. For example, work in a coffee shop or library to mix up the scenery. Alternatively, if you typically work inside, try relocating to an outdoor environment, like a park or garden. You may find inspiration from the scenery, scents, and sounds that surround you in an unfamiliar space., Walking through nature and observing animals, plants, stars, and clouds has often been a source of inspiration for many artists throughout history. Spend some time outdoors each day learning how plants and animals live. It is easy to find inspiration in the natural beauty of the world. You can also try travelling to different parts of the world to experience unique landscapes.If you are an artist bring your supplies with you out into nature and try and capture the landscape.
Similarly, if you are a writer bring a notebook and write down some of the feelings and words that come to mind while you are consumed by the natural world.

, Sometimes people have creative blocks because they are struggling to find new ideas. Let yourself relax and try and allow your mind to go blank. One way to do this is by taking regular breaks from your work. Go for a walk and let your mind wander. You are more likely to have an epiphany while you are away from your workspace and allowing yourself time to relax."
"
Socialize with people frequently.,
Seek out other creative people who share your passion.,
People watch in public spaces.",How to Find Your Muse3," A great way to find a muse or inspiration is by socializing with a variety of people. Surround yourself with several personality types in your daily life and observe how each of them respond to both normal and unique situations. These observations can help to inspire creative stories. For example, think of a time when your friend did something that was hilarious or interesting. Can you find inspiration in these stories? There are unwritten tales all around you.


You may find inspiration in stories about people overcoming adversity.
You could also find inspiration in stories of hardship and loss.

, Often people will find a muse in other creative people who inspire them by creating art. For example, if you are a musician you may get inspired by other musicians who are creating new and unique sounds and music. Try seeking out and surrounding yourself with other creative people. Ask them where they get their artistic inspiration from and how they create art on a daily basis.Collaborating with other artists, writers, or musicians can also help to inspire you. Sometimes your muse is a person with similar interests to yourself.
Family and friends can also provide you with inspiration when they achieve success.

, Sometimes you will find a muse in a complete stranger. Make sure that you are present when you are out in public. For example, avoid spending too much time on your phone. Instead, look around and watch other people as they go about their daily lives. What motivates them? How do their lives differ from yours?


Sit on a park bench and watch people interact
Go to an airport or subway station and watch people as they come and go.

Keep track of your paper.",How to Write a School Newsletter," Before you get too far in planning your newsletter, it can be a good idea to consider the goals you have in mind for it. Thinking about the goals that you want your newsletter to achieve can help you build a successful newsletter. Consider some of these aspects of a newsletter and decide what you want your own newsletter to achieve:Should your newsletter focus on events or policies?
Are you going to create and publish the newsletter on your own?
Do you plan on building a team to publish the newsletter?
How big do you want your newsletter to be?
How many people do you want to reach with your newsletter?
What should the newsletter be called?

, You will need to decide how often you want to publish your newsletter before you begin creating it. Having a publication schedule can help you determine how often you'll need to work on the newsletter and when new issues are due. Decide on a publication schedule before planning the rest of your paper to help make it successful.If your school is either very large or very active, you may want to publish more often or publish larger papers, less frequently.
If you are unsure of how often to publish, you may try publishing monthly to begin with.
You probably won't need to publish any editions over the summer months if your school isn't active during them.

, When planning and creating a school newsletter, it can be helpful to keep your audience in mind. The goal of your newsletter will be to inform and engage your audience. Knowing your audience will allow you to write articles and content that is tailored just for them. You'll likely want to include some sections or content for the students in the community.
Your main readers are likely to be the parents and adults in the community.
Your newsletter should also keep staff informed, describing current events at the school.
You might also want to include content that supports your local community.

, Once you have an idea of what your newsletter will include, it's time to think of how you will deliver it to readers. Having a plan in place for distribution will help you reach as many people as possible after your newsletter has been completed and printed. It can also be helpful to think about the size of the school. How many people do you need to reach? Consider some of these distribution methods when deciding what's best for your newsletter: It's important to remember that not everyone might be able to receive digital newsletters. You will likely want to print out physical copies as well.
Physical copies will either need to be delivered or placed in a public space that allows for people to easily pick up a copy.
Digital copies will likely be the most cost effective option and will allow you to reach a large number of readers.

, Today, most school newspapers are created digitally. Because of this, you will need to download and install some publishing software. There are many different options available when looking for desktop publishing software. Check out some of these examples of desktop publishing software to help get you started:Adobe InDesign, Corel Draw, and QuarkXpress are all professional publishing software.
Scribus is open-source desktop publishing software.
You can make a newsletter using Microsoft Word or OpenOffice
Some people find Google Docs to be a good solution, as it allows many people to collaborate on-line.

, Templates will allow you to quickly create the first edition of your newsletter. A good template will also help you create new editions and give your newsletter a sense of cohesiveness. You can either start with a pre-made template or create one of your own.Most publishing software will include a number of templates for you to choose from.
You can try searching on-line for free school newsletter templates.
Templates allow you to easily add your own information or update old information.
A good template will have spaces for both your articles and photos to go with them.
You might want to make templates for specific months. For example, you might have a template for February that has a heart theme because of Valentine's day.
For text areas, it's a good idea to have predefined spaces for your title, headings, and the main body of text.

, Once you've built or found a template, you will want to customize it. Customizing a template will let you add elements that you want to continue across all editions of your school newsletter. Take a look at this list to discover some of the things you might want to add to your template:Place the school name at the top of the front page.
Add in a footer with page number, date, edition, or other information you might want to include.
Putting your school logo somewhere on the front page can be a good idea.
Include clip-art to give your newsletter an appealing and interesting look.
You might want to have dedicated pages for certain content. For example, you could put contact information for school staff on the last page of your newsletter.
You'll likely want to decide the basic layout for articles and pages. A simple two column layout can be a good way to start.

, After you've created and customized a newsletter template, you can begin to create content for it. The content you create should strive to meet the goals of your newsletter and be appealing to your audience. To help get you started, try reading over these examples of what a school newsletter might contain:A calendar of the year and upcoming events.
Current news.
Upcoming activities or programs.
Birthdays.
Community news.
Changes in school policy.

, It can be a good idea to add in fun things to your newsletter, such as puzzles or games. However, the majority of your newsletter should be informative content. If a piece doesn't seem to convey any information to the reader, you may want to consider rewriting it or removing it. Always try to deliver the most information possible to your readers when publishing your school newsletter.An opinion piece on the quality of cafeteria food might be nice. However, it's probably a better idea to include a lunch schedule instead.
Detailing the repair process of a restroom might be too much information. It might be better to focus on things like how long the renovation took or how much it cost.
Updates on school policies should always be included.
You might want to highlight student achievements in your newsletter.
It can be a good idea to have small articles that introduce new staff members.

, You don't have to create an entire school newsletter yourself. Involving others can be a lot of fun for everyone. With more people working on the newsletter, both the content and the quality can be improved. Try asking students, staff or others to help create content or design the layout of your school newsletter.Asking students to write articles can be a good way to let them express a student's viewpoint and get in some writing practice.
Having staff write articles can result in more detailed or informative pieces. For example, asking a math teacher to write about the new high-level math course would be a good idea.
You might have students form a club around creating and publishing the newsletter.
Asking for help with printing, publishing, or distributing might be necessary. You can check with local school staff, send a request for volunteers, or check with local businesses.

, If you are offering printed copies of your newsletter, you will want to make them easy to find. Placing them in an area that doesn't see much traffic will likely result in less people reading the newsletter. Sending them home in certain ways can work better than others. Always make sure that your newsletter is easy to locate or is likely to be delivered successfully.


You'll likely want to create a list of people who want to subscribe to your newsletter.
Try leaving it near the entrances to your school or local businesses.
Bring some copies to your nearby library to put out for people to take.
Leaving some copies on the front desk of the main office can be a good idea.
If you have the budget, your school may mail printed copies to the community.
Give the paper to students to take home. Some have found that giving the newsletter to younger children increases the chances of it getting home., Digital publication can lower costs and increase the size of your reader base. There are many methods that you can use to easily send your newsletter digitally to your readers. Try using some of these methods to send your newsletter out digitally:You can use group emails to send out your newsletter.
You might post new editions on your school's homepage.
Use your school's social media accounts to let people know about new editions of your paper.
You could build a dedicated website or blog to post new editions of your newsletter.

, It can be a good idea to record and track some information about your newspaper. Collecting this data will tell you how many people are reading it, how many copies are actually being used, or even what information people prefer to read about. This information can help you create a better paper and will allow you to meet the needs of your readers.


Keep track of how many paper copies are taken by readers. This can tell you if you need to print more or less copies in the future.
Counting how many copies are taken from different locations will tell you where the best places are to distribute the paper.
For digital versions, you can track how many people download the paper and from where. This can help you learn if people are finding the paper on your school's homepage or from social media.
You might include reader surveys that would allow for constructive feedback.

Come up with a clear, overarching objective for your proposal.,
Try to incorporate your project into your everyday life.,
Conduct preliminary research.,
Deepen your research.,
Identify supporting arguments for your project.,
Identify opposing arguments for your project.,
Create a Title Page.,
Write a table of contents.,
Insert your abstract.,
Explain your methodology.,
State your plan of operation.,
Explain the budget.,
Explain how you plan to disseminate the project, or information, gathered by the project.,
Know to whom your proposal should be addressed.,
Check the submission deadline.,
Check your sponsor's mailing instructions.",How to Write a Proposal for Sponsorship," Make sure that you know exactly what you'd like your project to accomplish. Remember that if you only have a vague or broad idea, it'll show in your writing. To start:


Compose a well-defined idea, such as Creating A More Effective Curriculum For K-12 Instructors, or Creating A Better Way To Assist Lab Technicians.
Talk to people who are knowledgeable on your topic. Their statements and answers can deepen and help your own thinking.
Run your central point by someone who is unfamiliar with the subject. Doing so can give you a sense for how clearly you formulated your intent.;
, Keeping it at the forefront of your mind might help you refine it.


When you encounter a problem, try asking yourself if your idea would be a helpful solution. The point of this exercise is to expand the scope of your project, but also to realize its potential limitations.

, Get a feel for what's already out there on the topic. A web search can be quite useful at an early stage - but be discerning of what you read, and keep an open mind.


Run a web search with your central claim in the subject line.
Stay away from blogs, forums, and sites that are primarily advertisement driven.
Mark new or useful information, and remember where you found it so you can easily go back to it.

, The library is always a good choice, but Google search can be your friend here, too - as long as you discern between reputable and non-reputable sources. This step is very important as it lays the foundation for an effective or ineffective proposal.


Look for government-sponsored sources. In web searches, these website addresses end with .gov.
Scholarly sources are always a good choice. In web searches, these website addresses usually end in .edu.

, See what other like-minded people think, and zone in on their most useful points for your cause. Think about questions such as:


How did they tackle the issue?
Did they effectively solve the problem you're presenting?
What were some of the difficulties they encountered when dealing with this issue?
How is their approach similar or different from yours?
How do you agree or disagree with their research and conclusions?

, Sometimes, understanding your opposition can be even more helpful than knowing your supporters because it can strengthen or highlight your argument's weak spots. Think about such questions as :


What approach did they take?
Why did it work for them, and how is it different from yours?
What do they criticize about approaches like yours, or similar ones?
How do you agree or disagree with their research and conclusions?

, This is the first thing your audience sees, and you want it to contain the basic information about you, the author. Make sure to include the following pieces:


The name of the organization seeking funding.
Contact information for the official representative, most likely you (address, telephone number, fax number, and e-mail).
Name of institution or organization to which you're submitting the proposal.
Title of project.
Total amount of funding requested.
Timeline for project.
Signature of official representative, most likely you.

, Your reader should know exactly where to find information on the various parts of your project. Include:


List the sections, and subsections, of your proposal with page numbers.

, This should be a concise and explicit explanation of what you're trying to accomplish. Remember to keep the abstract at a one page maximum.Things to consider when writing your abstract might be:


Emphasize your objectives.
Why is your idea necessary? Why would it be a marked improvement to existing practices?
Who will benefit directly from your project?
How will you conduct the project? What methods will you use?
What is the timeline for the implementation of your idea(s)?
How much will it cost?
Outcomes, and possible future applications.

, In other words, in which manner will you approach the issue? This section can and should include a clear review of the research you've conducted. Some things to consider:


Mention who else has worked on the problem before you.
Explain what the pros and cons are of your approach.
Explain the positions taken by supporters and opponents of your, or similar methods.

, This is the part where you provide lots of detail about the steps to be taken according to your methodology. Consider the following:


Clearly identify how and where your project will have an impact.
Document the significance of your project for its target population, or for the research questions it seeks to address.

, If cost is involved, you need to provide a lot of detail. Put together a detailed budget for categories that involve funding. You want to give your potential sponsor as much information as possible about where her/his money will be going. Think about categories such as:


Materials and supplies
Personnel
Equipment
Travel
Direct and indirect costs

, This could occur in a variety of ways, as for example:


Through publications in scholarly or professional journals.
Through presentations or talks.

, This is very important as you don't want your hard work to go to the wrong person and potentially get lost.

, The last thing you want is for your project to be disqualified just because it's late. Check and check again.


Ask your potential sponsor for the submission timeline to also get a better idea for when you'll be notified of your proposal's status.

, Some places might not be open to an electronic submission, and might prefer you to physically mail it.

Listen to your heart.,
Don't settle.,
Be prepared to make changes.,
When you see happy couples, feel free to ask questions.,
Think in terms of principles and qualities, rather than specifics.,
When you've pondered all these points, start writing.,
Store your mission statement in its own file on your computer.,
Print out the mission statement and put it in a place where you'll see it often.,
As you learn more about yourself and more about potential partners, don't hesitate to do a few ""course corrections"" and revise your mission statement.,
Prepare yourself to live that new life.,
Have fun.",How to Write a Relationship Mission Statement," Fred Rogers (children's TV host) said that the beautiful thing about an imagination is that it allows you consider potential futures and then decide if that's a future that you want. Before you write your mission statement, take a few moments (or a few days) and really listen to those ""whispers of the soul."" If all potential restrictions were removed, what would you want in a romantic partner?;
, Remember the movie ""Thelma and Louise""? Some of the best advice for romantic partners can be found in that movie. Thelma told Louise, ""Remember, you get what you settle for."" When you're imagining your potential future, think big. You'll have time and opportunity for minor course corrections later on.

, The large passenger airplanes that criss-cross our skies are guided by computers and satellites and other gee-whiz gadgets, but the fact is, they're off course 90% of the time. Constant minor course corrections and adjustments insure the planes end up precisely where they're supposed to be. Your mission statement is not going to be written in stone. Most likely, you'll revise it every month or even every day.

, ""What is his best quality?"" is a question that will make a wife beam with joy. What is it that you want in a man? What is it that you love most about your nearest and dearest friends? What are your own best qualities? Think about these qualities and then make a list of what you want in a romantic partner.

, Instead of saying, ""I want a husband who earns $138,000 a year,"" you might say, ""I want a spouse who has achieved some financial stability and demonstrates wisdom, patience and intelligence in all his financial affairs.""

, Writing is a skill and an art form and the practice of writing will help solidify some of these ideas that have been taking up space on your mental hard drive. Writing is also a discipline and writing your ideas on paper will force you to hone them down a bit. Think of it as a mental housecleaning. You're taking everything out of your mental home and putting it in the front yard where you can see the bigger picture and make some choices about what to keep and what to ditch. The mission statement starts in your imagination. There are no limits. None. Proceed from that basis and do your fine tuning later on.

, Create a new file called, ""Mission Statement"" and label each file with a date. For instance, MSN_STMT_1.23.2010. This will help you keep track of revisions, and it's fun to go back a few weeks or months later, and look at the changes you've made.

, This is vital. Your mind is a powerful resource and this mission statement needs to be something that you see and read at least once a day. Prepare yourself to be changed. Dig into your mental garden and see if there are any impediments to your mission statement becoming your reality. For instance, are you envious of others? Stop. When you see a happy couple, ditch the envy and replace it with gratitude. Tell yourself, ""If it happened for them, that's a sign that it'll happen for me too.""

, You might have a column of ""can't live with"" and another column of ""Can't live without.""

, If you think you're not lovable, change the way you think about yourself. If you think *anyone* is too good for you, ask yourself why you're harboring such thoughts.

, Enjoy the process. You *can* get there from here, but you need a road map and a compass. The mission statement is both the map and the compass. It's a good starting point, that will get you where you need (and want) to be.

Understand the kind of immigration proceeding.,
Talk to the requestor.,
Find samples.,
Insert the date and salutation.,
Include an introduction.,
Describe the applicant’s character traits.,
Explain work ethic, if relevant.,
Conclude with a heartfelt recommendation.,
Add your contact information.,
Sign the letter.",How to Write a Reference Letter for Immigration," The first step in writing the letter is to find out what kind of proceeding the letter applicant is involved in. For example, reference letters may be used during immigration deportation or removal proceedings. The letter may also be used as part of a person’s application for naturalization.Other reasons for a letter include:


To prove a relationship, such as a bona fide marriage
As confirmation of employment or residence
As evidence of abuse (emotional or physical)
To confirm a credible fear of persecution held by a person seeking asylum;
, You should feel free to ask the requestor to put together a list of points they would like you to highlight in the letter. For example, the requestor may want you to share an experience working on a specific project, their passion for U.S. history, or specific personal anecdotes.


Additionally, you may also ask the requestor for a resume or other background information. You can use this information to guide the writing process.

, You can find examples of immigration reference letters on the internet using a basic search. Be sure to revise whatever sample you find to fit your particular purposes. You must convey sincerity and credibility in your letter.


A sample Employer Support letter can be found on the Hashdoc website at https://www.hashdoc.com/documents/14183/employer-support-of-immigration-application-sample-letter.

, At the top of the letter, you should include the date. A couple lines down, include the salutation. If you do not know who you are addressing, then you can state “To whom it may concern”.If you are the applicant’s employer, then you should put the letter on company or organizational letterhead.

, Use the first paragraph to introduce yourself. State your name, profession, and relationship to the requestor. Also include your own citizenship status.Also state how long you have known the requestor, referencing dates, locations, job titles, etc.
Sample language might be: “My name is Reverend Michael Smith. I am a U.S. citizen and a pastor at the United Methodist Church of Boston, Massachusetts.”Alternately, if you are an employer, you would state, “I am Carol Smith, assistant director of human resources at ABC Corp., where I have supervised Andrea Smith for the past three years, from April 2012 to present.”

, In the second paragraph, you should provide specific examples that illustrate whatever the applicant is trying to prove to immigration officials. For example, the applicant may need a testimonial of good character traits to support naturalization or to avoid deportation. Alternately, the applicant might need you to establish that his or her romantic relationship is not a sham. Or, the applicant might need to prove that persecution in their home country caused trauma. Regardless of the content, try to be as concrete as possible.


You could write, “I have met few people with as much compassion as Rosa Martinez. After attending my church for only two weeks, she volunteered for the soup kitchen and within two months was the lead volunteer on the weekend shift. It was in this capacity that Ms. Martinez found herself alone with a man who was deeply depressed and suicidal. After calling me, she stayed with the man for two hours until I was able to summon medical personnel to assist.”
You may also be called upon to write a letter about the requestor’s relationship with a spouse. Sometimes, immigration officials claim that a marriage is a sham perpetrated to help one party get a green card. In this situation, you would want to write about the requestor’s relationship. Accordingly, you could state, “The bond Kelly Smith shares with her new husband, Adam Crouch, is impressive. As their friend and neighbor for the past two years, I have seen them gardening together, going for long walks, and sitting down to dinner nearly every night. When they came to my wedding anniversary party, they held hands and talked easily with the guests. It was as if I were seeing me and my husband in the early stages of our marriage.”
If you are writing to offer evidence of abuse, then you should explain why you think the applicant suffered trauma in his or her home country. You should translate medical diagnoses into layperson’s terms. Provide specifics. For example, you might report that the person suffers from nightmares, weight loss, and other signs of anxiety.

, If the requestor is an employee or volunteer, then you will want to include the requestor’s job title as well as their skills. Include information about the dates and location of employment.


It is also important to give an opinion on the requestor’s honesty and trustworthiness, using specifics.For example, do not simply state, “Mr. Alcott has a fine moral character and cares about people.” That is too vague. You will need details to show the reader why you believe the requestor has the character traits you say he does.
Instead, you could write: “The first six months Mr. Alcott drove the shuttle bus from the homeless shelter to the soup kitchen across town. He was timely and always friendly with both the staff and our clients. Once, a client lost his wallet on the bus. After Mr. Alcott found it, he immediately turned it in to me. No money was missing.”

, The letter should close with a strong recommendation that the requestor get the relief that he or she is requesting.If the requestor is trying to avoid deportation, then you would want to state, “Based on my close acquaintance with Mr. Alcott, I strongly recommend that he not be deported.”


If the letter is in support naturalization, then you could state, “In my opinion, Mr. Alcott would be a credit to the country. Accordingly, I recommend that he be naturalized as a citizen of the United States as soon as possible.”

, You need to give the government official who reads your letter a means of contacting you. You should add your work phone number and email at the end of the letter. If your mailing address has not been included as part of the letterhead, then include the mailing address here as well. Also state what times are good to contact you.


After adding the contact information, insert “Sincerely” and then space down a few lines and type your name.

, Use blue or black ink. You do not have to have the letter notarized, but you may want to consider doing so. Having the letter notarized will remove any doubt as to your signature. If the requestor is in the middle of deportation proceedings, then you should get the letter notarized.If you want to have the letter notarized, then hold off on signing and take the letter to a notary public. Be sure to bring sufficient personal identification. A valid driver’s license or passport should be sufficient.
To find a notary near you, use the locator from the American Society of Notaries. Notaries may also be found at most large banks as well as at courthouses.

, Get information for the requirements document from business leaders, engineers, developers, sales reps, customers or anyone else with important information about needs for product development.

, One of the important elements of requirements is the system requirements, or how the product will interact with a given system for a workstation or network.

, Explaining restrictions or constraints within the requirements document will help further guide those who are working on the software or IT product.

, Interface requirements are an important part of this document because they determine how the end-user will view the product. They often have a critical influence on the user-friendliness of a product.


Identify color schemes, command button requirements and any other part of a successful interface.
Keep in mind the programming tools that will be used to develop the project or product when listing interface requirements. This will provide more guidance for developers and others.

The topic is a broad area of study that you want to write about or research.Your topic isn't as broad as an entire subject such as history or sociology. Rather, you're going to list a specific aspect of that subject, such as ""The Causes of World War II"" or ""The Impact of Globalization in Latin America.""
This topic generally would be far too broad to write a single paper (or even a single book) about and even begin to cover it in a more than superficial manner.
In a shorter prospectus, such as for an undergraduate research paper, you typically won't need to devote more than a sentence to your topic before moving on to your research questions.;
, The questions you list will get to the heart of your research. All of your questions should fall within the topic you described, but focus on a specific aspect of that topic.Before you start formulating your questions, you may want to look at other research projects in your discipline to get a good idea of the types of questions typically asked.
For example, a history question may involve extensive research and synthesis of that research to discover any patterns that may emerge.
In contrast, questions in the social sciences such as political science may be based more on data gathering and statistical analysis.
In a short prospectus, this may simply be a bullet-point list of specific questions you expect to address through your research.
A longer prospectus, such as a grant proposal or dissertation prospectus, typically devotes several pages to discussing the specific questions that your research will address.

, The next part of your prospectus will explain how your answers will have an impact on the scholarly research in the field. If there is already an active discussion of the issues you raise, you should describe how your research will contribute to that discussion.The more advanced you are in your discipline, the more crucial this portion of your prospectus is going to be.
If you're writing a prospectus for a research project in an undergraduate course, your professor likely won't expect you to contribute something new or profound to the field. However, graduate research and dissertations typically attempt to make a unique contribution to the area.
You may need to do some preliminary research before you can write this portion of your prospectus, particularly if you believe you are the only person ever to do research seeking specifically to answer the questions you've listed.
Any statement you make regarding the importance of your research should be supported by research, and you should be able to defend those assertions to the people reviewing your prospectus.

, Your answers to the questions you've posed is the thesis statement for your research. It is the statement that will guide your research and define what your research will prove.You want your thesis statement to be as clear as possible. If you find it difficult to craft a clear answer to the questions you've presented, it may be that your questions aren't as clear as they could be.
Keep in mind that if your question is vague or muddled, you're going to have a hard time coming up with a clear, definitive thesis statement.

, This portion of your prospectus may not be necessary if you're writing a shorter prospectus for an undergraduate project. However, for graduate projects, dissertations, or grant applications, you typically are expected to explain why you're the right person to complete this project.At this level, you're not just selling your idea, you're also selling your own knowledge, passion, commitment, and skills as a researcher to find the answers you seek.
For grant applications, information about yourself as a person and your personal interest in the topic you plan to research also can be important. When deciding which projects to fund, having a personal commitment or dedication to a particular issue may give you an edge.
Depending on the type of research you plan to do, you also may have to outline your position and your access or ability to gather various types of information, such as archives or classified documents.

, For longer papers or books, your prospectus should provide a summary of how the whole project will come together and what your finished product will look like.Keep in mind that this is just a plan – nothing's set in stone. At this early stage, your paper likely will change as you get into your research or start gathering the data and crunching numbers to work on your project.
You can create specific paragraphs or an outline, or you can write this section in a single seamless narrative. For shorter papers, that's probably all this section will be – essentially a couple of paragraphs that tell the readers how you anticipate you'll organize the final report on the project.

, Particularly in social science or hard science research projects, you'll have a specific order in which your work must be done. If you're not doing any experiments or data collecting on your own, this section may not be applicable.For example, if you're doing a statistical analysis, you must first gather the data, then compile statistics from that data, then analyze the statistics you create.
For scientific experiments, this is the place where you'll describe the steps in the experiment.
If you're doing a project in the humanities, the stages of your research may not be as clear-cut as they would be if you were doing a research project for a more scientific discipline.

, If you're writing a prospectus for a class research project, your time may not be flexible – you must complete your project by the end of the class.For graduate research projects or dissertations, the timeframe may be more open-ended. In these situations, you should provide an estimate in your prospectus of when you believe your project will be completed.
Coming up with a timeline and ultimate deadline of when the research will be completed is particularly important if you're applying for a grant.
How long you think it will take to complete your research affects the feasibility of the project, which is ultimately how your prospectus will be evaluated. Be realistic in what you can do within the time constraints you have.
Keep in mind that while you may be able to get an extension if your research ends up taking longer than you anticipated in your prospectus, you also may be expected to justify the reasons you need more time or explain why the initial estimate in your prospectus was incorrect.

, Particularly for larger research projects, you'll need to describe all of the costs of performing your study, and how you arrived at any estimations.This is especially important if you're applying for a grant, as the people who review your prospectus will want a detailed breakdown of what you intend to do with the money if you're awarded the grant.
Typically you'll need to include expenses such as fees for access to archives or for copying, any costs for data collecting, and rentals of lab or other equipment.
You also should include a list of any resources you plan to use for which you anticipate there being no cost, such as use of the university library or computers and employment of student volunteers.

, If you're writing your prospectus for a university project, your professor or department likely will have specific guidelines you must follow to format and submit your prospectus.The guidelines also typically will include details on which citation method you should use, and may include details on using a particular style guide that will govern word usage, grammar, and punctuation rules.
Your assignment information also may specifically state how long each section is supposed to be, and which sections must be included.

, Unless you're told otherwise, you typically want to format your prospectus the same way you'd format any other research paper or assignment you are turning in for a class in the same department.Type your prospectus in a standard, legible font such as Times New Roman or Helvetica.
Typically you'll have one-inch margins on all sides of the paper, and your text will be double-spaced. Include page numbers if your prospectus is more than one page.
Follow the guidelines from your professor or department in regard to creating a cover sheet or using special formatting or headers on the first page.
If footnotes or end notes are required, set these up in your word processing app before you start working on your prospectus.

, If you're writing a prospectus for a research project that will generate a book-length report or manuscript, you typically must include a table of contents with your prospectus.The table of contents essentially is a list of chapters for your final report, and gives the readers of your prospectus an idea of what the final report will look like and how long it will be.

, Your bibliography lists the books, articles, and other resources you plan to use in your research. You aren't necessarily committing yourself to using these resources specifically and only these resources, but at this stage you should at least know what your primary source material is going to be.Some professors or departments require an annotated bibliography, in which you not only cite the sources you plan to use but provide a detailed description of what the source is and how it fits into your research.
Check the guidelines from your professor or department to make sure you're using the correct citation method for your bibliography.

, The people who review your prospectus will be evaluating it on the basis of whether it seems like a valuable, important research project. If your prospectus is sloppy and poorly written, they'll be less likely to look upon it favorably.Reading your prospectus backwards is a good way to proofread and catch errors you might have missed otherwise.
In addition to editing for grammar and punctuation, you also should check your language carefully. Make sure everything is written in a formal, professional tone.
Keep your audience in mind as you edit. While you may be writing your prospectus for professors or a department committee that has full understanding of your project's topic, you shouldn't assume any particular level of understanding. Rather, your prospectus should be written so that it can be understood by a generally intelligent person without any special knowledge in your field.

Always proofread for errors.",How to Write a Problem Statement," There are lots of different ways to write a problem statement — some sources will recommend jumping right to the problem itself, while others recommend providing background context first so that problem (and its solution) are easier to understand for the reader. If you're ever unsure of how to begin, opt for the latter option. While conciseness is something every piece of practical writing should aim for, it's even more important to be well-understood. Start by describing how things should work. Before you even mention your problem, explain in a few sentences how things would be if the problem didn't exist.


For instance, let's say that we work at a major airline and that we've noticed that the way passengers board our planes is an inefficient use of time and resources. In this case, we might begin our problem statement by describing an ideal situation where the boarding system isn't inefficient that the company should shoot for, like this: ""The boarding protocols used by ABC Airlines should aim to get each flight's passengers aboard the plane quickly and efficiently so that the plane can take off as soon as possible . The process of boarding should be optimized for time-efficiency but also should be straightforward enough that it can be easily understood by all passengers.""

, In the words of the inventor Charles Kettering, ""A problem well-stated is a problem half-solved.""One of the most important goals (if not the most important goal) of any problem statement is to articulate the problem being addressed to the reader in a way that's clear, straightforward, and easy to understand. Succinctly summarize the problem you intend to solve — this cuts to the heart of the issue immediately and positions the most important information in the problem statement near the top, where it's most visible. If you've just stated an ""ideal"" state of affairs as suggested above, you may want to start your sentence with phrasing like ""However, ..."" or ""Unfortunately, ..."" to show that the problem you've identified is what is preventing the ideal vision from being a reality.


Let's say that we think we've developed a quicker, more efficient system for getting passengers aboard our planes than the typical ""back to front"" seating system. In this case, we might continue with a few sentences like, ""However, ABC Airline's current passenger boarding system is an inefficient use of the company's time and resources. By wasting employee man hours, the current boarding protocols make the company less competitive, and by contributing to a slow boarding process, they create an unfavorable brand image.""

, Soon after you state your problem, you'll want to explain why it's a big deal — after all, no one has the time or resources to try to solve every single minor problem. In the business world, money is almost always the bottom line, so you'll want to try to highlight the financial impact of your problem on the company or organization you're writing for. For instance, is the problem you're discussing keeping your business from making more money? Is it actively costing your business money? Is it damaging your brand image and thus indirectly costing your business money? Be as exact and specific about the financial burden of your problem — try to specify an exact dollar amount (or a well-supported estimate) for your problem's cost.


For our airline example, we might proceed to explain the problem's financial cost like this: ""The inefficiency of the current boarding system represents a significant financial burden for the company. On average, the current boarding system wastes roughly four minutes per boarding session, resulting in a total of 20 wasted man-hours per day across all ABC flights. This represents a waste of roughly $400 per day, or $146,000 per year.""

, No matter how much money you claim your problem is costing your company, if you can't back up your claims with reasonable evidence, you may not be taken seriously. As soon as you start making specific claims about how serious your problem is, you'll need to start supporting your statements with evidence. In some cases, this may be from your own research, from data from a related study or project, or even from reputable third-party sources.


In some corporate and academic situations, you may need to explicitly reference your evidence in the text of your problem statement, while in other situations, it may be enough to simply use a footnote or another form of shorthand for your citations. If you're unsure, ask your boss or teacher for advice.
Let's reexamine the sentences we used in the previous step. They describe the cost of the problem, but don't explain how this cost was found. A more thorough explanation might include this: ""...Based on internal performance tracking data,on average, the current boarding system wastes roughly four minutes per boarding session, resulting in a total of 20 wasted man-hours per day across all ABC flights. Terminal personal are paid an average of $20 per hour, so this represents a waste of roughly $400 per day, or $146,000 per year."" Note the footnote — in an actual problem statement, this would correspond to a reference or appendix containing the data mentioned.

, When you've explained what the problem is and why it's so important, proceed to explain how you propose to deal with it. As with the initial statement of your problem, your explanation of your solution should be written to be as clear and concise as possible. Stick to big, important, concrete concepts and leave any minor details for later — you'll have plenty of opportunities to get into every minor aspect of your proposed solution in the body of your proposal.


In our airline example, our solution to the problem of inefficient boarding practices is this new system we've discovered, so we should briefly explain the broad strokes of this new system without getting into the minor details. We might say something like, ""Using a modified boarding system proposed by Dr. Edward Right of the Kowlard Business Efficiency Institute which has passengers board the plane from the sides in rather than from the back to the front, ABC Airlines can eliminate these four minutes of waste."" We might then go on to explain the basic gist of the new system, but we wouldn't use more than a sentence or two to do this, as the ""meat"" of our analysis will be in the body of the proposal.

, Again, now that you've told your readers what should be done about the problem, it's a very good idea to explain why this solution is a good idea. Since businesses are always trying to increase their efficiency and earn more money, you'll want to focus primarily on the financial impact of your solution — which expenses it will reduce, which new forms of revenue it will generate, and so on. You can also explain non-tangible benefits, like improved customer satisfaction, but your total explanation shouldn't be too much longer than a few sentences to a paragraph.


In our example, we might briefly describe how our company could conceivably benefit from the money saved with our solution. A few sentences along these lines might work: ""ABC Airlines stands to benefit substantially from the adoption of this new boarding program. For instance, the $146,000 in estimated yearly savings can be re-directed to new sources of revenue, such as expanding its selection of flights to high-demand markets. In addition, by being the first American airline to adopt this solution, ABC stands to gain considerable recognition as an industry trend-setter in the areas of value and convenience.""

, After you've presented the ideal vision for your company, identified the problem keeping your from achieving this ideal, and suggested a solution, you're almost done. All that's left to do is to conclude with a summary of your main arguments that allows you transition easily into the main body of your proposal. There's no need to make this conclusion any longer than it needs to be — try to state, in just a few sentences, the basic gist of what you've described in your problem statement and the approach you intend to take in the body of the article.


In our airline example, we might conclude like this: ""Optimization of current boarding protocols or adoption of new, more-effective protocols is crucial for the continued competitiveness of the company. In this proposal, the alternative boarding protocols developed by Dr. Right are analyzed for their feasibility and steps for effective implementation are suggested."" This sums up the main point of the problem statement — that the current boarding procedure isn't very good and that this new one is better — and tells the audience what to expect if they continue reading.

, When you have to write a problem statement for school, rather than for work, the process will be largely the same, but there may be extra items you'll need to take into account to assure a good grade. For instance, many composition classes will require you to include a thesis statement in your problem statement. The thesis statement (sometimes just called the ""thesis"") is a single sentence that summarizes your entire argument, boiling it down to its bare essentials. A good thesis statement identifies both the problem and the solution as succinctly and clearly as possible.


For instance, let's say we're writing a paper on the problem of academic essay mills — companies that sell pre-written and/or custom works for students to purchase and turn in as their own work. As our thesis statement, we might use this sentence, which acknowledges the problem and the solution we're about to propose: ""The practice of buying academic essays, which undermines the learning process and gives an advantage to rich students, can be combated buy providing professors with stronger digital analysis tools.""
Some classes explicitly require you to put your thesis sentence at a certain place in your problem statement (for instance, as the very first or very last sentence). Other times, you'll have more freedom — check with your teacher if you're not sure.

, Not all problem statements are going to be for documents dealing with practical, tangible problems. Some, especially in academics (and especially in the humanities), are going to deal with conceptual problems — problems that have to do with the way we think about abstract ideas. In these cases, you can still use the same basic problem statement framework to present the problem at hand (while obviously shifting away from a business focus). In other words, you'll want to identify the problem (often, for conceptual problems, this will be that some idea is not well-understood), explain why the problem matters, explain how you plan to solve it, and sum up all of this in a conclusion.


For instance, let's say that we're asked to write a problem statement for a report on the importance of religious symbolism in The Brothers Karamazov by Fyodor Dostoevsky. In this case, our problem statement should identify some poorly-understood aspect of the religious symbolism in the novel, explain why this matters (for instance, we might say that by better understanding the religious symbolism in the novel, it's possible to draw new insights from the book), and lay out how we plan to support our argument.

, If there's one thing to keep in mind when writing problem statements, it's this. Problem statements shouldn't be any longer than they need to be to accomplish their task of laying out the problem and its solution for the reader. No sentence should be wasted. Any sentence that doesn't directly contribute to the problem statement's goals should be removed. Use clear, direct language. Don't get bogged down in minor details — problem statements should deal only with the essentials of your problem and solution. In general, keep your problem statement as short as possible without sacrificing its informativeness.


A problem statement is no place to add your own personal commentary or ""flavor"", as this makes the problem statement longer for no practical purpose. You may or may not have the opportunity to be more long-winded in the body of your document, depending on the seriousness of your topic and audience.

, When making a problem statement, it's important to remember that you're writing for someone else, not for yourself. Different audiences will have different sets of knowledge, different reasons for reading, and different attitudes toward your problem, so try to keep your intended audience in mind as you write. You want your problem statement to be as clear and easy for your audience to understand as possible, which means you may need to change your tone, style, and diction from one audience to another. As you write, try to ask yourself questions like:


""Who, specifically, am I writing for?""
""Why am I addressing this audience?""
""Does this audience know all of the same terms and concepts as I do?""
""Does this audience share the same attitude as I do towards this problem?""
""Why should my audience care about this problem?""

, As noted above, your problem statement should be written so that it's as easy for your audience to understand as possible. This means that, unless you're writing for a technical audience that is likely to be knowledgeable in the terminology of the field you're writing about, you'll want to avoid using technical jargon too heavily and to make sure that you define any pieces of jargon that you do use. Never make the assumption that your audience automatically has all of the technical knowledge that you do or you risk alienating them and losing readers as soon as they encounter terms and information they're not familiar with.


For instance, if we're writing for a board of highly-educated physicians, it may be OK to assume that they'll know what the term ""metacarpal"" means. However, if we're writing to an audience made up of both physicians and wealthy hospital investors who may or may not be medically trained, it's a good idea to introduce the word ""metacarpal"" with its definition — the bone between the first two joints of the finger.

, The best problem statements aren't sprawling, rambling pieces of writing. Instead, they're focused on a single, easily-identified problem and its solution. Generally, narrow, defined topics are easier to write convincingly about than large, vague ones, so whenever possible, you'll want to keep the scope of your problem statement (and thus the body of your document) well-focused. If this makes your problem statement (or the body of your document) short, this is usually a good thing (except in academic situations where you have minimum page limits for your assignment).


A good rule of thumb is to only address problems that you can definitively solve beyond a shadow of a doubt. If you're not sure of a definitive solution that can solve your entire problem, you may want to narrow the scope of your project and change your problem statement to reflect this new focus.
To keep the scope of a problem statement under control, it can be helpful to wait until after completing the body of the document or proposal to write the problem statement. In this case, when we write our problem statement, we can use our actual document as a guideline so that we don't have to guess about the ground we may cover when we write it.

, Problem statements should be as informative as possible in as few words as possible, but shouldn't delve into minute details. If you're ever in doubt of what to include in your problem statement, a smart idea is to try to answer the five Ws (who, what, where, when, and why), plus how. Addressing the five Ws gives your reader a good baseline level of knowledge to understand the problem and solution without treading into unnecessary levels of detail.


For instance, if you're writing a problem statement to propose a new building development to your local city council, you might address the five Ws by explaining who the development would benefit, what the development would require, where the development should be, when construction should begin, and why the development is ultimately a smart idea for the city.

, Problem statements are almost always used for serious proposals and projects. Because of this, you'll want to use a formal, dignified writing style (the same as the style hopefully used for the body of the document) in the problem statement. Keep your writing clear, plain, and direct. Don't attempt to win your reader over by taking a friendly or casual tone in your problem statement. Don't use humor or jokes. Don't include pointless asides or anecdotes. Don't use slang or colloquialisms. Good problem statements know that they have a job to accomplish and don't waste any time or ink on unnecessary content.


The closest you can usually get to including purely ""entertaining"" content in academic writing in the humanities. Here, occasionally, it's possible to encounter problem statements that begin with a quote or epigraph. Even in these cases, however, the quote has some bearing on the problem being discussed and the rest of the problem statement is written in a formal voice.

, This is a must for all forms of serious writing — no first draft has ever existed that couldn't have benefited from the careful eye of a good proofreader. When you finish your problem statement, give it a quick read. Does it seem to ""flow"" properly? Does it present its ideas coherently? Does it seem to be logically organized? If not, make these changes now. When you're finally satisfied with the structure of your problem statement, double-check it for spelling, grammar, and formatting errors.


You'll never regret re-reading your problem statement before you turn it in. Since, by its very nature, the problem statement is usually the first part of a proposal or report that someone will read, any errors here will be especially embarrassing for you and can even reflect negatively on your entire document.

When you've reached your goals, set new ones.",How to Write a Professional Growth Plan," Some employers require that you create a professional development plan with the human resources department. However, the only way to create a truly effective growth plan is to take the time to do it yourself and on your own time. This way, you can create a growth plan that doesn't necessarily need to involve your current employer.Create a special folder in your computer for recording your growth plan.
Spend at least 30 minutes following through these steps and recording your answers.;
, Many people never stop to take a good, hard look at their current situation. However, this part is crucial in determining why you want to set a new professional goal. Look at your career and its progression over the past three to five years. Think about whether you are making progress as quickly as you would like to and whether that progress has been in the right direction. What aspects are you succeeding in and which need work? Any negative assessment can be a strong reason to begin developing a professional growth plan., Your general assessment of your career may have revealed some areas in which you could improve or your situation could be better. Now, take time to think about what, specifically, needs to change. Are you under-appreciated at your current position/company? Are you in the wrong industry? Understanding what could be changed to improve your situation will help you figure out your goals and the steps you'll need to take to achieve them., Transferrable skills are those skills that can be applied to different jobs that you might have in the future, like interpersonal or organizational skills.Understanding your transferable skills will help you plan your future career moves and give you the ability to effectively communicate your strengths to future employers. Identify these skills by thinking back over your career to what you have excelled at. Write down specific actions or tasks that you have done well and then group these into three or four categories. These should not be attributes, like ""hardworking"" or ""integrity,"" but skills, like data processing or financial analysis.


Expand on each of your skill categories with a few concise sentences that describe what exactly you excel at in that category. Include notable examples in which you demonstrated that skill.
Doing so will help you better describe your skills on your resume or in future interviews.
Your transferable skills can also be a jumping-off point for figuring out where to go next professionally., Think about your ultimate goals for your career. What do you want to eventually achieve? Be as specific as possible by using the SMART method for defining goals. This means defining goals that are specific, measurable, attainable, realistic, and time-based. Doing so ensures that you can actually tell when you have reached your goal.For example, it's difficult to gauge your progress towards ""have a higher salary,"" but easy to see how close you are to ""earning $20,000 more annually.""
Include intermediate goals between now and your larger professional goals. For example, try considering where you want to be in two years as you work towards your five-year goal.Alternately, you can start from your main goal and then work backwards from there to identify intermediate goals.Make sure your goals actually mean something to you. That is, choose and focus on careers that motivate and inspire you. For example, you may be working as an administrative assistant, but feel excited by the idea of managing your own projects for the same company. Or maybe you are a marketing manager for a large company and are energized by the thought of starting your own marketing firm.

, Determine if there are specific gaps in your knowledge, technical skills or other expertise that might prevent you from attaining your desired position. Try looking at a job posting for the position that you want and comparing the required competencies of your own. Make a list of the skill areas in need of strengthening. Include any additional degrees or certifications that you might need., Find experts in your intended career and ask them to mentor you. Your mentor may be a professor at your university, your supervisor at work or a friend of a friend. Ask your mentor to guide you in writing your professional growth plan. This person can help you work through the steps you need to take and give you an assessment of how realistic your goals and timeline are. They also tell you how to gain the competencies you need., Research how you can bridge the gap between your current skills and expertise and those required by your goal position. Look into education, intermediate roles, and other ways to gain these skills. Then, turn this knowledge into actionable steps that you can take. Make sure your steps follow in order; that is, make sure you can do each step without having already completed the step or steps after it.Specify the required actions and steps for achieving your career goals. For example, becoming a project manager at your present company may require asking your supervisor if you may take on more project responsibilities. If you are a new graduate, getting a job at an engineering firm may involve sending out resumes to local firms, speaking to your social network and/or cold calling the firms.
Identify any professional obstacles, fears or concerns. Reflect on any challenges that may be slowing your progress. For example, if your intended career requires you to speak in public and this is a fear, make a note of this concern.
Address obstacles by strengthening your skills. For example, if you are afraid of speaking in public, plan to take a public speaking course. If your desired career requires proficiency in a specific computer application, sign up for a class at the local college, study online or learn by reading the application manual. Be specific about the steps you will take to gain new skills.

, Look into what educational courses, books, people, and other resources you will need to achieve your goal. Be sure to factor in the cost of these resources when determining your timeline. You may need to work and save for a time before you can afford to make a change., Setting a specific time by which you must complete particular tasks helps to minimize distractions by keeping you on track. If you plan to take a particular course, give yourself a deadline for completing it. Your professional growth plan also should include a time line by which you will achieve your ultimate career goal., Start completing the goals listed in your growth plan and following the schedule you created. Stick to your plan as closely as possible, especially during the first few months. Remind yourself of your goals and the benefits that come with them when following your plan becomes difficult., Keep a journal to record your thoughts throughout the growth process. Record any doubts, setbacks, or difficulties you run into and write out how to overcome them. Celebrate any milestones you reach, no matter how small. Checking in on your progress regularly will keep you focused and motivated to move forward., Be constantly re-evaluating your goal based on new information and opportunities. Situations, people, and the economy change over time, and your goals can change with them. If you find yourself wanting something different than your original goal, make a change by shifting around your steps and timelines to fit the new one. It's impossible to predict your situation in ten years, so keep your plan open to revision., If you happen to luck out and achieve your highest original ambition, immediately set to work on defining a new growth plan. The successes of your first plan can be applied to a new one and allow you to reach higher heights than you previously thought possible. The main point is to not become stagnant in your career growth just because you've gotten to a good place. You should continuously learn and grow throughout your entire career, not just in the beginning."

Choose a theme.,
Start with a greeting.,
Explain your connection to the nominee.,
Compile a list of reasons that your nominee should be selected.,
Share your faith in the candidate.,
Provide your contact information.,
Ensure you have met the criteria.,
Review your writing skills.,
Proofread your nomination letter.,
Make final changes.,
Submit your letter.",How to Write a Nomination Letter," Nominations can be for a position, scholarship, or award. It is important to learn as much as you can about it so you can create a stronger case for your nominee.Consider things such as:

What are the criteria for nominating someone?
What characteristics are the reviewers looking for?
How will they select the winner?
Who has won in the past?
When is the deadline?;
, You may already have an individual in mind for this nomination. If not, brainstorm potential nominees. List individuals who have the qualities the reviewers seek to reward.

, This might provide you with information about their background that you do not already know. It also gives you a starting place for writing the letter. Look at their education, job experience, awards or honors received, and special skills or talents., Though you may know the nominee in a professional capacity, speaking with them personally can give you additional material to include in the letter. They may surprise you with new information about their background and experience.

If you don’t want the person to know you’re nominating them, just have a casual chat without mentioning the nomination. If you think that could give you away, skip this step and talk to one of their family members instead, making it clear you want to keep the nomination a secret for now.

, The nominee’s friends and acquaintances can provide you with further information about them. You can talk with them in person or request that they email you. Ask if they have a story or example they can share.

For instance, say, “I’m nominating Jordan for a scholarship. Do you have any information or examples that explain why he’d be a great candidate?”

, It’s a good idea to organize your nomination letter around one big idea. This helps the reviewers follow along. It also helps them remember your nomination because everything will point back to a single theme instead of a lot of disconnected information.


If you’re nominating someone for employee of the month, the theme of your letter could focus on how the nominee helps others in the workplace.

, Begin your letter with a personal greeting to the people who will be reading it. If you aren’t sure who is on the committee, research it on the Internet or call the organization and ask. Be sure you spell the name properly to avoid embarrassment.As a last resort, begin your letter with “To whom it may concern.”

, Share how you know the person you are nominating, and include a brief anecdote about them. You should also directly state that you are nominating this person for an award.For example, say “While teaching second grade together, I learned that Mary Drake is a shining example of patience and kindness, which is why I’m nominating her for the Heartwarmer Award.”

, Reasons could include examples, stories, illustrations, and statistics about an individual's work. You should be as specific as possible. Bring this person to life in order to help the reviewers visualize this individual.For example, write “Edward has received five letters of recommendation from customers since joining our company and his customer feedback performance is the highest within the estate.”
You could also say something like, “Even though he didn’t have to, Dan used his own money to purchase art supplies for the after-school program.”

, Explain to the committee that you have the utmost faith in this person to continue to do well. Make it clear that they are an excellent candidate for the award.

For example, say “Susan continues to strive for excellence and maintains a 4.0 GPA, which is one of the reasons I know she deserves this scholarship.”

, Let the reviewers know they can contact you if they need additional information or if they have questions. Include your full name, title or position, email address, and phone number.Be sure to type your name and also leave room to add your signature.

, It’s a good idea to read over the details of the award so you can make sure your letter meets the nomination criteria. Remove unnecessary or inapplicable material, as well as anything that doesn’t fit the theme you have chosen. If you haven’t followed the guidelines, your nominee may be disqualified., Make sure you have varied the sentence structure, formatted your paper into paragraphs, and used appealing language. Also check to make sure you have used concrete examples.The more specific and detailed you can be when sharing a particular story, the better your chances of the review committee remembering your nomination. Keep the examples concise, but detailed.

, Read your letter and check for spelling and grammatical errors. Ensure that the format is consistent and clean. Ask others to look it over, as well. They will be able to provide more objective feedback, as well as a different perspective.Make sure you spelled the nominee's name correctly and listed their appropriate title. Spelling the name or title wrong is embarrassing for you and the nominee, and it gives the deciding body the impression that you don't know the nominee that well after all.

, Decide what you need to cut, what you need to modify, and what you might need to add. Take the ideas and suggestions of others into consideration.

Keep your nomination letter under two pages. Anything longer than that is unlikely to be remembered in a positive light.

, Follow the submission guidelines provided by the committee. You may be asked to email the letter or drop it off in person. Be sure you do so before the deadline, or your nominee won’t be considered."

Showcase policy successes.",How to Write a Privacy Policy," This is more than saying you sell widgets or are a widget-repair company. Defining the scope of your business means identifying all of your customers, both internal and external, and evaluating your relationship and exchange of information with them.


External customers are generally those who pay you for your goods and services. These are the customers outside your business.
Internal customers are the different divisions and organizations inside your business as well as the outside vendors and service providers. For example, payroll, maintenance, human resources, and production are all internal customers. These different parts of your business all exchange information and you need to consider the privacy needs of these entities.;
, Modern businesses thrive on data and information. Whether it is customer identification, product specifications, sales data, or personnel files, every corner of your business has information streaming in and out every day.


You can divide your information streams as customer (contact information, purchase history), financial (profit, loss, sales, taxes), business (vendors, products, pricing, competitors), and human resources (employee records, salaries, pay scales).

, The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 strictly regulates what kind of health information is protected from disclosure. If your business is even peripherally associated with the medical industry or patient care, consider consulting with an attorney well-versed in HIPAA for instructions on protected health information., If your business is, in any way, connected to the legal profession or the court system, you may come in contact with confidential client information. If so, consider consulting with an attorney on how to handle and protect this data., Besides HIPAA, your business may be covered by other laws. It is your responsibility to know and comply with these laws as you interact with your customers and potential customers.


If you communicate with customers and market via email, then the CAN-SPAM Act may apply to you.This law requires that your emails be identified as advertisements, include an opt-out provision for recipients, and clearly display your mailing address. Failure to comply can lead to fines and even criminal charges.
Your business and website, or mobile app, may appeal to and target children as potential customers. If your target audience is children under the age of 13, you must comply with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). This law requires that you clearly state your policy, have provisions for parental consent, and provide parents access to the data you collect. It also has strict information retention requirements., A breach in customer trust can irreparably damage your business. On your website and print advertising you need to clearly state you have a privacy policy that includes what personal information you collect and how you use it.The privacy policy for external customers should be written in plain and simple language that is easy to understand. Keep the technical language to a minimum.
At a minimum, your customer privacy policy should state if your site uses cookies (small programs that store customer information to make the site run faster) and how you use their data.For websites that use cookies, add a phrase to the effect of ""This website uses cookies for . By using our site, you consent to the use of this technology."" Be explicit about your reasons., If your business model includes selling or distributing customer data, this must be clearly stated in your terms of service. A typical policy includes language that by the customer using your site, they are consenting to the collecting and distribution of their contact information. For example, ""By entering this site, we will collect data such as and this data may be shared with our business and advertising partners. Use of this site is your consent to this data collection and distribution.""


Far more common is a statement that you will not sell or share any customer data. This statement is far more likely to earn the trust of your customers. ""We will not sell your personal information to anyone, for any purpose. Period."", If your business or website collects email addresses as a normal course of business, such as requiring an email to complete a transaction, you must have a policy where customers can unsubscribe or stop receiving advertising email from you. This is required by the CAN-SPAM Act. Your email advertisements should all include the opt-out information as well.The opt-out language must be explicit and easy for customers to use. Most email mailing list and advertising programs include an automatic opt-out process. ""If you do not want to receive future emails, click here, and your name will be removed from the mailing list."" If you manually manage your mailing list, add a hotlink to your email address and delete the customer from your email database., Your website and business advertisements must include a contact point and a complaint procedure.If you receive a complaint about misuse of customer information, you must follow up on it and resolve it to the customer's satisfaction. Otherwise, you could find yourself under investigation by the Federal Trade Commission.Your complaint procedure can be as simple as a link to your email address with a statement, ""If you don't want to receive communication from us or believe your information has not been handled correctly, click .""

, As technology continues to expand and improve, so do the laws and procedures for protecting customer privacy. The companies that you know and respect are continually refining and updating their privacy policies. Their terms of service can be a guide or template to creating your own.If you have any doubts about the adequacy of your external customer privacy policy, consider consulting with an attorney.


Review your privacy policy and terms of service either annually or when you launch a new website program, advertising campaign, or mobile app.

, If your business does not have a website, you still need to reassure your customer that their names, addresses, and credit card information is secure. This can be a simple document or flyer that you give to a new customer, include in mailers, or have on-hand if a customer requests it.


A statement that you will not sell or distribute their data.
A way to sign up for your mailing list of flyers, catalogs, emails, and other advertisements, along with a simple method of removing names from the list.
A statement on how credit card sales are processed and that information isn't maintained on the premises.
You will also need a privacy policy complaint process. Request your customer put her concerns in writing and submit it by mail or email. This protects you and ensures you understand the customer's concerns.

, As part of hiring and during the course of employment, companies gather a lot of private information about their employees. Not just contact information, but in this age of heightened security and scrutiny, companies may also collect background reports, credit information, and medical data. To protect yourself from legal actions and to foster goodwill with your employees, you need to have an internal privacy policy that addresses security of employee information.


Physically secure your hard copy files. Employee records should be kept in locked file cabinets with limited access.
Make sure the computer access is password protected, has limited access, and adequate software security.
Create a clear records retention policy and stick to it. Pre-employment records such as credit reports and drug tests should be purged as soon as possible. Keep a notation of the results, but dispose of the hard copies unless required by law for the position.

, Older or poorly installed wireless networks may create unintended wi-fi hotspots in and around your business. An unsecured network could allow someone access to your records. If you don't have anyone on staff who can evaluate the security of your network, consult with an IT professional and upgrade as needed. Your network security protocols should be referenced in your privacy policy.


If you are installing a new network or contemplating major upgrades, consider bringing in an IT professional to install, secure, and test the network. Even if you installed for first network yourself, you may not be up to date on the newest threats and vulnerabilities of your network and software.

, In an era of smartphones and instant connectivity, your business needs to have a clearly defined policy for use of social media during work hours. Many companies have a vague policy about using company computers for personal purposes. The truth is, the average phone or tablet is likely faster and has a better Internet connection. An employee may be tweeting about lunch and the photo catches the name of your biggest client or recent sales figures on a document next to his sandwich.


Forbidding any social media usage during work hours is going to affect morale and be difficult to enforce. Unless the employee is in a high security area, understand that email and social media usage is going to happen and craft policies to keep that usage minimal and non-disruptive.
A well-crafted social media policy explains the need to respect clients' privacy and work processes by setting out specific consequences for breaching that respect. Also stress how complaining about work and bosses on social media reflects poorly on the company and, if it happens during work hours, could subject the employee to disciplinary proceedings.
Your social media policy should also list out anything that is forbidden and the potential consequences. Examples of this would be activity that breaches patient privacy, client confidentiality, or violates rules against revealing information about minor children and students. Detailing and enforcing this policy could help the company defend itself against a legal claim.
Best practices for social media policies include The Gap's requirement that employees contact the social media team if they make an error, and Hewlett-Packard makes it clear that they reserve the right to review, edit, and even delete blog and social media posts made on its behalf., The businesses who deal with your company should be able to trust that information including bids, estimates, price lists, contact information, customer lists, and internal processes are respected and kept secure. Your internal privacy policy should have a process for marking vendor information confidential and keeping it secure both in hard copy and electronic form.

, Not all business leaders might recognize that even these kinds of documents are an opportunity to point out what a business has done right. Include any statements of fact that reflect well on the company or business.

Verify that a cause for petition falls under your local government’s jurisdiction.,
Find out how many signatures you need.,
Learn how people must sign the petition for it to be valid.,
Research your topic so you understand the various positions fully.,
Consider which medium for circulating your petition is ideal.,
Develop a very specific statement that identifies what you want people to support.,
Make your petition brief.,
Add body paragraphs supporting your first, declarative paragraph.,
Read over your summary carefully.,
Edit your petition for spelling and grammar errors.,
Get someone else to read your petition, preferably a friend or relative who is uninformed about the situation.,
Create a signer’s form on a separate sheet of paper.,
Prepare the form using a spreadsheet program.,
Photocopy or print multiple copies of your original.,
Talk to people in person.,
Use the power of e-mail.,
Create an online presence for your petition.,
Get media coverage.,
Be polite.",How to Write a Petition," Contact the administrative office of your local government or check out your local government website. You might need to petition on a county or state level. Have the office direct you to the department that handles matters related to your cause. Then request petition guidelines.

, This is very important. It would be horrible to set a goal of 1,000 signatures, reach it, and then realize you need 2,000. Also look up whether or not your petition needs approval before being circulated.

, If you are trying to get a candidate's name added to the ballot, and the law says you must show an address for each name, ask your signers for this information.

, Researching your topic is also a good way to find out if someone has already started a petition about it.

, Regardless of your choice, you will still need to write the petition properly. (See below for more advice on this.) Paper petitions can be more effective for local petitions, but online petitions can reach broader networks much faster. Consider sites like ipetitions.com, Petitions24.com, or GoPetition.com, which offer a higher level of accountability than some competing petition sites. Facebook Causes can also be a great, accountable way to collect a large amount of online support for an issue. The details matter just as much for online petitions as for paper ones.


If your cause requires people to take action and not just agree to a position, consider collective action alternatives to petitions. For example, you could start a campaign on an online forum like The Point. Online forums and similar sites gather support in the same way a petition does, but they are centered around eventually taking an action to force a change---not just passively asking for it.

, It should be precise, concise, and informative.


Weak: We support more funding for a park. This sentence is far too general. What kind of park? How much funding?
Strong: We demand that the Commissioners of Nature County allocate funds for a new park in the Adventure District. The precise details are clearly written in this sentence.

, People will be less likely to support you if they have to spend a great deal of time reading what you have to say. No matter how long your petition is, you must put your specific goal at the very beginning of the first paragraph. Then follow it up with your reason(s) for petitioning. This will be the paragraph that most people read.


Example of the first paragraph of a petition: We demand that the Commissioners of Nature County allocate funds for a new park in the Adventure District. This district does not have any parks. Our children need to have a place where they can experience nature and play outdoors.


, These paragraphs should contain information and specific examples showing the importance of what you are fighting for. Write as many body paragraphs as you like, but just be aware that most people you speak with on the street will not read all of them.

, Make sure it (1) describes the situation, (2) suggests what is needed, and (3) explains why it is needed. Is it clear? If you did not know about the situation, would you understand it by reading your petition?

, If errors litter your petition, it is very unlikely you will be taken seriously. Use spell check and proofread your petition for obvious mistakes. Read it out loud to determine whether or not it flows and makes sense.

, Does the person understand your goal? Can they tell why you're petitioning, what you're demanding, and why you're demanding it?

, Put the petition title on top. Your petition title should be concise but descriptive.


Example of petition title: Petition for New Park for Adventure District


, It will look much more professional and will be easier to change if need be. (See the sample template at the top of this page.) Divide the page into five columns labeled Name, Address, E-mail Address, Phone Number, and Signature. (In some cases and in some states, you may have to add a column for Voter Registration Number.) Allow plenty of room for the Address column. Add ten to 20 lines per page.


If you do not have a computer or a spreadsheet program, go to your local library, where a librarian or volunteer can help you use the library computers to make your petition. If this is not practical, use a ruler to divide a sheet of 8.5"" x 11"" or A4 paper into the five (or six) columns listed in the paragraph just above and follow the rest of the directions there.

, Make enough pages for the number of signatures you need. Number the pages so you can keep better track of them and the signatures you have. You may also want signature gatherers to initial the pages they have used or overseen so you can ask them any questions about what is written on a particular page. Initialing pages also increases overall accountability.

, Go where you can speak with large numbers of people concerned about the issue or open to information about it. Maybe the public needs to know about your petition, if so, write a speech. Go to the public place where the people you want to inform will be to listen. Make sure you have the permission first thing. If your petition is about a school, speak to people at or near the school. Spread the word about your petition through your office. Hang posters on community bulletin boards about your cause.

, Create an online version of your petition and send it to your family, friends, and acquaintances. Try not to flood them with e-mails, though---sending an e-mail every day for a month will not get you the results you want. Instead, follow up a first round of petitions with two or three reminders over the period when you are petitioning.

, Create a blog or online forum where you can discuss your petition and answer the questions of potential signers. Media platforms like Facebook and Twitter are great ways to get the word out and could help make a movement large enough to get a nationwide following . Good websites make it simple. They also notify the people you made your petition about when people sign it so they know what people think.

, Contact local media about your cause; try for a local radio station or newspaper first. As your petition gains momentum, so will the coverage.

, Nobody trying to get to work on time likes an angry petitioner in their face. Even if someone believes in your cause, they might not have the time or funds to support you at the moment. Don't take it personally! It's always better to be polite---they may contact you or help fund your cause when they have the time and resources.

Look over the requirements for your personal statement.,
Gather materials.,
Brainstorm possible themes and answers.",How to Write a Personal Interest Statement1," Each school or organization has its own guidelines for length and font. While some personal interest statements ask specific questions they want you to answer, others are wide open for you to write whatever you wish.


These kinds of formatting requirements usually aren’t very complicated. Typically, they mandate the use of a common font in a specific size, with an additional specification for the margins around the page. It’s important to follow these instructions—they’re not always nitpicking—because the admissions team wants the document to easily transfer across platforms.;
, Transcripts, resumes or CVs, job histories, and applications are all important documents to have in front of you. This will help you remember extracurricular activities, personal experiences, work experiences, classes, and more.


Avoid making your personal interest statement a restatement of your resume. Over the course of application season, the admissions officer will read hundreds of personal interest statements, most of which will be poorly written and interchangeable. The point of gathering these documents is to jog your memories of your successes and failures and what you learned from each, not to provide a narrative account of your academic career., There are a few consistent ways personal statements are organized. They are organized around a single event, a series of events to illustrate a theme, or an account of the general personal journey that put you in a position to send in an application.Single event narratives recount something in your life that was the proximate cause (or but-for cause) of your academic goal. For instance, “After my grandmother was swindled out of her house, I knew I wanted to be a lawyer” recounts the event that spurred you to go to law school--but for your grandmother getting swindled, you wouldn’t have pursued a legal education.
Series of events narratives use multiple occurrences to illustrate a personal quality you think is important or the proximate cause of your goal. Perseverance, for example, is not a quality that can be demonstrated by simply writing about one event. You’ll have to tell the story of more than one event in order to show how you persevere.
Try to avoid general personal journey narratives if you can. They have a tendency to slip into a restatement of your resume. Instead, try to turn those narratives into series of events narratives, sticking to milestones and highlights.

"
"
Write your first draft.,
Rewrite.,
Edit.,
Finalize.",How to Write a Personal Interest Statement2," Creating the first draft of your personal interest statement isn’t about getting everything perfect. Focus on getting your story onto the page and finding the important details that bring it alive.


Remember, securing an admission to a college or university is a competition between you and dozens of other aspiring students. It is crucial that you stand out. NEVER begin your personal statement with “I am Janie Higgins, and I’m applying to the college of engineering to become a better chemical engineer.” They already know who you are and where you’re applying, and presumably, already know that an education in a subject will make you better at it., This time, focus on making your personal statement stronger and more concise. In particular, take some time to craft your introductory hook, which is going to determine whether or not your essay gets read or merely skimmed. Make sure your essay is clear, readable, and easy to follow.


A good hook doesn’t waste time with a lot of background information. It starts right when the action starts, and fills in the background information as needed. For example “We had just sat down for Thanksgiving Dinner when Grandma told us she was going to lose her house,” is starting right at the beginning of the action.Cut out unnecessary words and phrases. Avoid repetition and introductory phrases that could easily be left out without losing any meaning or impact.

, Check spelling, grammar, and sentence structure, but also look over your content. Make sure your personal statement meets the requirements of your application and vividly illustrates the themes you want to impart.


Vary sentence structure and word choice. Good spelling and grammar and your choice of words demonstrate the writing skills colleges seek in a candidate.
Edit your paper over a period of several days. The time in between edits allows you to get a fresh perspective.
Ask other people to read your personal interest statement. They can often catch mistakes you might miss. They can also bring a different perspective to what can make your essay stronger. If you can, ask people who don’t know you well to edit your essay. It’s easier for a passing acquaintance to be objective than it is for a close friend.

, Consider the advice of others and make any final corrections to the essay. Remember, suggestions are personal opinions and ultimately you need to decide what to change and what to keep. You know the themes you want to impart and the stories you want to tell, you just need to make your essay tell those stories and impart those themes.


Unless your editors are English professors, their suggestions don’t need to be taken as gospel. Do keep in mind, however, that when multiple people identify a passage that doesn’t work for them, it probably doesn’t work. Novice editors are typically better at identifying problems than they are offering solutions.

Determine the audience.,
Follow the guidelines.,
Develop a theme.,
Write a strong introduction.,
Highlight relevant information.,
Give it a strong conclusion.,
Proofread.",How to Write a Personal History1," Depending on what you are applying for, the information you include in your personal statement will differ, often significantly. In order to ensure that you address pertinent subjects, you will want to know who you are writing for. You should consider whether your application will be read by a medical or law school review board, or a graduate committee. Is it an application for a scholarship or an internship? Reflecting on your audience will help you determine what life stories to highlight.For example, if you are applying to get into medical school and a graduate program in English somewhere else, you will want to avoid spending a lot of time highlighting your extensive medical knowledge in the English application or your remarkable writing skills in the medical school application. Although a review committee might be impressed that you have such diverse interests, they also want to make sure that you have the requisite knowledge to be in the program.;
, Generally, an application will give you guidelines to follow when writing your personal history. These tend to include things like page length and font size. However, they can also include specific questions that the review committee wants answered. If you are asked specific question, be sure to fully answer them. It is important that the committee sees that you are capable of following directions. However, this does not mean that your statement should be formulaic or bland. Follow the guidelines, but give your readers something exciting or memorable to take away from your letter.
In general medical and law schools ask for a more open-ended personal statement. One the other hand, business and graduate schools tend to ask specific questions. However, each application is different and has it owns guidelines, so be sure to follow those.

, Think about the overall story that you are trying to tell the people who will read your application. What impression of you do you want them to take away from it? If you want to them to think that you are intelligent and capable, discuss moments in your life that demonstrate your intelligence and capability. Determine what you are trying to convey and stick with it throughout the essay.Avoid going off on tangents. Consider whether or not a certain topic fits in your overall theme. If it does not, do not include it.

, Depending on what you are applying for, a review committee may receive hundreds of applications a year. You will want your application to stand out, and the best way to do that is by writing a compelling introduction. The initial paragraph should grab your reader’s attention and hold it. One method might be drawing the reader in with an interesting tidbit about yourself that relates to what you are applying for. Find what works for you and feels appropriate for the application.Briefly introduce yourself and then provide the framework that the rest of the essay will follow. Allude to things you will discuss later, but do not give it all away.
Avoid clichés like “my names is Steve and I’m applying to join your program” or “Allow me to introduce myself…”

, The middle section of the essay is where you detail your interests and experience in the field. Discuss you educational background and any pertinent classes you took. List any practical experience that you have, such as internships, conference attendance or previous employment. These things tell the reviewers that you have the knowledge and the experience necessary to succeed in the field.For example, if you are applying for medical school, list any experience you have volunteering in a clinic or specific pre-med courses that you found particularly interesting.
If you are applying for graduate school, be sure to discuss any relevant scholars you like or books you find particularly interesting.

, Once you have highlighted all of your important education and experience, wrap up the essay with a strong yet concise conclusion. Tell the reader how all of the events listed in your essay have collectively impacted you and shaped you into a strong candidate for what you are applying for.Avoid clichés like “thank you for taking the time to consider my application” or “It is my sincere hope that you will grant me the opportunity to attend your school.”

, Before you send your materials, be sure to give them a final read. Check for any spelling errors or typos. Make sure that you fully answer the questions asked and meet all of the guidelines. A personal statement full of errors will make it appear as if you do not care and are unprofessional.


You can also ask someone else to proofread your essay for you. It is often hard for most people to adequately proofread their own writing, so finding someone to read your statement will likely make it better.

Determine whether to accept an invitation to review.,
Read with a pen.,
Analyze the originality of the manuscript.,
Ask yourself whether the argument convinced you.,
Assess the quality of the writing.,
Analyze references.,
Look at the publisher’s guidelines.,
Summarize the article in a few sentences.,
Provide an overview of the manuscript's importance.,
Identify flaws in the argument.,
Be constructive.,
Point out the strengths of the manuscript.,
Critique the organization and writing.,
Recommend publication or rejection of the manuscript.,
Review your own report.,
Hear back whether the manuscript was accepted.,
Review a new version of the manuscript.,
Maintain confidentiality.",How to Write a Peer Review Report," When a publisher reaches out to you, you should only accept an assignment if it is appropriate. Analyze the following to make sure you are an appropriate reviewer:Do you have the required expertise? You need to understand the subject matter well enough to analyze whether the author has made an original and meaningful contribution to the field. If you can’t accept the article, ideally you will recommend a reviewer with sufficient expertise.
Do you have the time? There’s no reason to accept an assignment if you can’t complete it by the deadline given.
Is there a conflict of interest? There are many kinds of conflicts. A conflict exists when you are collaborating with an author of the paper. A conflict also exists if you are friends or a direct competitor of an author. Your journal or publisher should have specific conflict of interest rules.;
, Once you get the manuscript, you should take out a pen. Underline any sections that seem important and correct mistakes as you are reading. If you have a question, write it down in the margin of the manuscript., A manuscript should make an original contribution to the field. Analyze whether the contribution is significant or only incremental. Determine whether the research would interest other researchers in the field.Also check whether parts of the manuscript have already been published.
No matter how original the research, remember that it must fit the general scope of the publisher. For example, a journal may focus on eighteenth century British literature. If the article focuses more on nineteenth century visual culture, it might not be appropriate.

, A solid manuscript should lay out a problem or question and answer it. You must assess how convinced you are by the answer. Did you find it compelling? Intriguing? Unconvincing? Drill down and assess the following:Does the data properly support the thesis? Would additional data make the argument stronger?
Is the argument free of obvious errors? Were there mathematical errors made when computing data?
Were the techniques or methods appropriate for the field? Could you recommend different ones?
Was important information missing from the paper? If it was supplied, do you think the argument would be stronger?
Has the author synthesized the current literature properly?Does the manuscript need more background information as context?

, A manuscript should be properly written. A poorly written manuscript can impede understanding of the argument and may exhaust the reader’s patience. Note the following as you read:Can you understand the English? Some authors might have English as a second language. In certain scientific fields, this is common.
Is the tone appropriate for the publisher?
Does the manuscript need a good copyedit?

, The manuscript should come with a list of references. As you read, you should note the works being cited. However, take out the list of references and give it close scrutiny. Ask the following:


Are there too many references or not enough for the publisher? Some journals might set limits.Are the references to reputable sources?
Is there a work the author has neglected to cite?
Is the citation format accurate and standard for the field? For some journals, you may need to check the formatting of citations.

, Many publishers offer guidelines on how your peer review report should be structured. Be sure to follow any guidelines given or available on the publisher’s website.You may have been given a reviewer form to use.This makes structuring your report very easy.

, You might want to summarize the work immediately after reading it or wait a day.Summarizing the article is helpful because it lets you know whether you understand the work.In particular, identify the question presented and the goals, approaches, and conclusion of the manuscript.If you can’t write a brief summary, go back to the work and try to identify why. Perhaps the argument is internally inconsistent, or the author is a poor writer who cannot make points clearly or logically.

, You should follow with a high-level summary of the article. Summarize your overall impressions with the work. For example, you should mention the following:Is the main question interesting and important?
How large of an advance in the field does the manuscript make?
Is the conclusion well-supported with data?

, Some manuscripts are fatally flawed. For example, the author’s evidence might prove the opposite of the thesis. Alternately, the author might use a method that is no longer considered credible.However, even strong manuscripts have assumptions or theoretical errors the author should address.
Make sure to put all of your criticisms in the report. If the author revises and resubmits, you shouldn’t make new criticisms when assessing the revision.

, Even if you are reviewing anonymously, you shouldn’t trash someone or offer pointed, personal criticisms.A good rule of thumb: don’t say something in a peer review that you wouldn’t say to someone’s face.For example, don’t write “The author has never read a work of feminist art history, obviously.” Instead, you can write, “The author’s summary of feminist art history is not as detailed as it should be.”
Ideally, criticisms should be couched as actionable steps the author can take to improve the paper.For example, you can point to other research or primary sources that could bolster the author’s argument. Suggest they read this research and explain how it will help strengthen the argument.
Clarify whether the suggestions are optional or mandatory.Generally, you should list the mandatory corrections first, since they are probably the most serious.

, A reviewer does more than merely criticize. Also identify what is good or interesting about the work.Some manuscripts might be undeveloped and poorly argued but nevertheless contain glimmers of insight that could be strengthened.

, A manuscript might have great ideas but need to be reorganized or carefully rewritten. Note the following and suggest improvements:


Whether the title accurately captures the content of the article.Suggest a different title.
Whether the section headings accurately describe the material.
Whether the abstract is complete or needs to be revised.
Whether the paper is too long or too short.
Whether the paper needs to be reorganized for clarity.
Whether the writing is poor. Some journals won’t require that you copyedit the manuscript but some smaller journals might.Check with the publisher.

, The reviewer’s job also includes making a recommendation for or against publishing the manuscript. Support your recommendation with specific reasons.For example, if you think the manuscript merely repeats prior scholarship, you should provide a list of works that contain the argument already.


You can also recommend rejection but possible publication after revision. If you make this recommendation, go back to your suggestions for improvement and make sure they are sufficiently detailed and helpful.

, Set aside your peer review report and let it sit for a day or two. You will have fresh eyes when you come back to it. Make sure to do the following before submitting:


Develop any thoughts that are skeletal or not well-supported. Provide as many specifics from the manuscript as possible.
Clarify your argument.
Proofread. Eliminate typos, missing words, and grammatical errors.

, Sometimes, editors will override the suggestions of their reviewers. This can happen for a variety of reasons. For example, the reviewer might have expected too much of the paper, especially if solid data is missing.Don’t be offended if the editor overrides your suggestion. So long as your review was solid, you should be sought out as a reviewer in the future.

, A manuscript might have been weak but nevertheless contained enough valuable material that resubmission was warranted after a revision. It may be sent back to you for review.


Ideally, the author should have adopted most of your suggestions and strengthened the manuscript accordingly. However, an author might have dismissed a recommendation or criticism. Analyze whether the author has reasonable grounds for rejecting your suggestion.Do you think the paper is still weak without the author making the changes requested? If so, don’t feel like you should recommend publication.

, The manuscript is confidential before publication, and you shouldn’t discuss it with the author or with anyone else.You also shouldn’t reveal your identity to the author even after publication.If you reveal your identity, you might be perceived as currying favor with someone by telling them you were their reviewer.
Be careful not to take advantage of the research provided in the unpublished manuscript. For example, you can’t incorporate it into your own scholarship until the manuscript has been published. It is an ethical violation to do so.

Find important documents.,
Interview people.,
Review your documents.,
Decide on how to organize the history.,
Begin writing.,
Edit your history.",How to Write a Personal History2," Before you begin writing your personal history, you will want to research and find all of the necessary documents you will want to use. Although your memory will supply much of the material, documents from your past might provide further information or insights. Talk with your friends or family members about any materials that might be useful, such as pictures, government documents, or family papers.Some examples of important documents might be your birth certificate, photographs or videos of you, correspondence (letters and emails) with other people, and old social media posts.

, Talking to the various people in your life is another excellent way to find information to include in your history. Your family members will be particularly valuable sources since they have known you the longest. Be sure to record the interviews for later use.Many cellphones have a recording function that will help you save your interviews.

, Once you have conducted your interviews and gathered your materials, you will want to begin reviewing them. Read through the documents you have collected to find important pieces of information that you would like to include in your history. Listen to the recordings or read the transcripts of the interviews you conducted. Use a notebook or word processor to keep track of this information for later use.Try creating a spreadsheet that lists all of the sources that you would like to use. This will help you find them quickly and not lose them.

, Once you have all of your documentation, you will want to begin thinking about how you would like to organize your history.Ask yourself what events you would like to highlight and which are less important. Determine whether you would like to write about your entire life or a specific period. Answering these questions will help you get a better idea of how to organize your story.You can organize your story thematically to emphasize important interests or life lessons. For example, if you want to highlight your skills as an athlete, you may only mention the life events that are relevant to that subject.
You can also chronologically format your history to tell a sequential story. Start with the earliest relevant event and move forward in time from there.
Ultimately, it is up to you how you organize your story, find a style that makes sense and tells your history.

, Once you have a structure for your history, you will want to begin writing it. Initially, this can be an intimidating prospect. In order to make the process of writing your personal history more manageable, try to write a little every day. If you focus on achieving small goals, over time you will finish your history.Try setting a timer for 45 minutes and write until it goes off. Then, take a 15 minute break and start writing again once those 15 minutes are up. Repeat this process as long as you feel fresh and engaged in your writing.
Find a writing schedule that works best for you., When you have finished writing your history, you will want to edit it. Initially, read it yourself to clean up any typos or errors in the writing. After you have given it a glance, find someone to edit it further. This can be anyone who you trust to do a thorough job of editing. If the story has any juicy details, it should also be someone who you feel comfortable reading it. Although you do not have to accept their edits, it is important to give them a good consideration.If you are publishing your personal history, you will have to work with an editor to get your manuscript ready for publishing. In this circumstance, the editor’s comments often need to be addressed in the manuscript.

"
"
Brainstorm and freewrite.,
Organize your materials.,
Create an outline or timeline.,
Develop a schedule.,
Find a place where you feel creative and motivated to write.",How to Write a Personal History3," Before you begin writing your history, think of what things you would like to discuss in your personal history. Try discussing those ideas with a friend or family member. You can also freewrite them in order to better flesh out the ideas on paper. Just sit down and start writing about yourself. There are no limits when it comes to brainstorming and freewriting. Just be creative and explore different organizational and thematic options.A journal might be useful for freewriting. It will allow you to jot ideas down if you are on the go.

, Once you finish brainstorming, gather any materials you might need. These can include letters of reference or your grades for your personal statement, or historical documents for a larger personal history. Since you will likely have to consult them regularly, make sure that these materials are easily accessible during your writing process.Keep your documents in a digital spreadsheet for quick reference. You could also organize them in folders if that is more convenient.

, Before you begin the writing process, write down an outline or a timeline of your history. An outline may be more useful for a personal narrative and a timeline for your personal history. Be sure to highlight any important events or relevant information. Think of the activity like a brainstorming exercise where you are trying to promote creativity, except that your trying to impose more structure on the project.Consider sharing your outline or timeline with someone who you believe will give you good feedback.

, If you have a solid deadline for completing your writing, it is important that you plan for meeting that deadline. The best way to do that is to create a schedule and stick to it. Set aside a certain amount of time each day for writing. This will help you meet your deadline and stay motivated., You space significantly impacts your ability to write. Be sure to find a space where you can focus and concentrate on your work. Try finding somewhere that is quiet, secluded and inspires your creative juices.Avoid loud and busy spaces. These can be audibly and visibly distracting. Although it might be cool to work in a coffee shop, it is not an ideal place to write.

",How to Write a Medical School Recommendation,"


Decline the student's request and suggest seeking a recommendation from another professor if you feel your recommendation would be negative or tepid, or if you simply don't feel you know the student well enough to write a well-informed, comprehensive recommendation. In a situation as competitive as medical school applications, where 60 percent of applicants are not accepted, a qualified or unenthusiastic recommendation is damaging.;
,


You may also want to ask the applicant for something distinguishing from a course taken with you, such as a graded exam or paper or a project evaluation.
Obtain the student's signed waiver form stating whether the recommendation will be confidential. Many admissions committees give higher credibility to confidential references.
Most American medical schools encourage or require use of the American Medical College Application Service (AMCAS) or the American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine Application Service (AACOMAS) Letter Service for electronic submission of letters. The AMCAS websites Frequently Asked Questions page (https://www.aamc.org/students/applying/amcas/faqs/63226/faq_amcasletters.html includes a list of medical schools using the service for recommendations, with specific information about each school's requirements.

",How to Write a Microbiology Lab Report," It’s essential to understand how you will be evaluated on your report because each instructor has a different set of standards for grading. An instructor may:

Add/subtract/merge certain structural elements of a report.
Focus on one part of a report more than another.
Require reports to be typed out. For typed reports focus on REVIEWING and EDITING.
Require reports to be handwritten in a research notebook.




  Written Lab Report Preview

;
, You are more likely to execute the experiment successfully and save time during lab by obtaining a clear understanding of the experiment before entering lab. To do this:

READ the lab manual for the experiment ahead of time.




 Lab Manual Example



, Items that maybe required:

Lab Manual
Lab Research Notebook
Notebook (For Notes)




 Research Notebook






 Notebook (For Recording Notes During Experiment)



, Sometimes your instructor may deviate from the original experiment., This is vital to constructing an effective lab report.

ACCURATELY and DESCRIPTIVELY record ALL of your results and observations.
Even if your experiment didn't go according to plan RECORD your observations and results. In addition RECORD where you think you made a mistake.




 Record Your Observations & Results



, The structural components of microbiology lab report typically contains:

Purpose
Introduction
Materials
Methods
Results
Observations
Discussion
References

,
The purpose can be to practice or learn a new technique, test, or characteristic of a microorganism.








, This information can be found in the lab manual or related microbiology textbook.







State all TECHNIQUES or TESTS used. Include an explanation of any new technique or test that was used.







State a HYPOTHESIS. This is an educated guess about the outcome that you expect to reach by conducting the experiment.








,
If you have an unknown microorganism RECORD the number, letter, or identifying characteristic of the microorganism.







Example: If agar was used list the type, if a KNOWN microorganism was used list the name, or if a test tube was used list the size.

,
If the procedure for the experiment is found in your lab manual SUMMARIZE the steps in this section.
If your instructor deviated from the original experiment make ADJUSTMENTS as needed.







An instructor may require you to do this in a paragraph or a list form.

,
Include drawings (if beneficial).







Include charts and tables (if beneficial).








, Focus on trends, differences, and unique characteristics that you notice.
Be CONCISE!! This IS NOT where you elaborate/explain your results.







This section is frequently combined with the results section for consistency.

, Interpret the results and determine if this data is consistent with the experiment. Does it make sense? Why does it make sense?







State if you have FULFILLED the purpose of the experiment. State if your results SUPPORT your hypothesis.







If your results DON'T SUPPORT your hypothesis, why don’t they? Was there any error during the experiment? Did you miss a step? Did you use proper techniques? Was your results accurate?







This is usually the MOST IMPORTANT section of the lab report.

Edit your photograph before placing it within your press release.,
Begin composing your press release in a word processing program.,
Type the heading ""For Immediate Release"" at the top left corner of the page.,
Include your contact information just below the bold heading.,
Write your headline.,
Write a subhead that describes the newsworthy nature of your release in more detail.,
Write the body of the press release.,
Edit your press release, especially the body, so that it is clean and uses no more words than are necessary.,
Place your photo with your press release according to the type of distribution channel you are going to choose.,
Submit your press release.",How to Format a Photo Press Release," The size should be more than 200 x 200 pixels. It should also be in jpg format with at least 72 dots per inch (dpi).


Save the image with a name that describes what the photo and press release are about in 4 to 5 words. For example: ""John Sturgeon discovers new planet.""
Write a caption for the photo that credits the photo to the person who took it, explains what it is about and includes the correct spelling of all the people featured in the photograph. You can place this below the photo near the end of your press release formatting.;
, Even if you intend to send your press release by email, it will be easier to proof and edit in Word or a similar program.

, Bold this text. Do not put a date in the future for this document's release, or it is likely to be ignored in favor of current news.

, You should include your name, address, email address, phone number, fax number and website. This is essential should anyone want to research your release or write an additional story.

, In a short phrase, between 4 to 8 words, the headline should describe the subject of the release in an exciting way. Bold the headline. For example: ""John Sturgeon discovers a new planet.""

, Put the subhead in italics. For example: ""Scientist calls the new planet ""Aurelia"" for its golden rings.""

, Aim to write 400 words. The body should give the benefits of the subject and encourage journalists to contact you for more information.


The introductory paragraph should announce the most newsworthy elements of the story. Additional paragraphs will go into detail, stating evidence, circumstances and other information. Each paragraph should be between 3 to 5 sentences long.
If you plan to submit online, you may want to further limit your word count. Most electronic press releases are shorter than those that are mailed.

, Look for grammar and spelling errors, and ask someone else to proof your work.

, This includes mail, email and fax.


Submit the photo or photos on a separate page if you plan to send a media kit. Most mailed press releases include reviews, photos and biographies along with their press releases. Print your photo on a glossy or semi-glossy photo paper and attach it to your press release. The media outlet can scan the photo, if they plan to use it. This is the best plan if you are submitting a press release about a band or a specific person.
Place the photo between the headline and the body, if you plan to fit all the information onto 1 page. This may be preferable for a fax. To help it fit better, you can justify it to the right near the top. In this case, it may help to attract the attention of the reporter, but it is not likely to be high enough quality to place in a newspaper or online.
Place a photo in the body of the email, if you plan to send it electronically. Do not attach it to the email, as most news agencies will not open large photographic attachments.
Some agencies also provide online forms where you can upload your photo for review. In this case, you do not need to include it directly along with your text. However, make sure you include caption information at the bottom of your text.

, As well as using traditional channels, like newspapers, TV stations and magazines, you can also use paid and free online distribution channels.

Start with the nouns.,
Learn about verbs.",How to Learn Norwegian Grammar," In Norwegian, there are two (technically three) genders a noun can have: common, which consists of both masculine and feminine, and neuter. As with German and French, you will have to learn the nouns with their respective articles. #*The articles are: en (for common) and et (for neuter). 'Ei' is used for the few feminine nouns out there. For example, ""et dyr"" means ""an animal"". This is what is known as the indefinite article, equivalent to the English ""a"" or ""an"".


Form the definite article, equivalent to ""the"" in English. Simply add the indefinite article as a suffix to the noun. For example, ""et dyr"" (an animal) becomes ""dyret"", meaning ""the animal"". ""En stol"" becomes ""stolen"", or ""the chair"". ""Ei mark"" becomes ""marka"", or ""the field"".
Form the plural form of Norwegian nouns. For common ('en') and MOST neuter ('et') nouns, you add -er (or just -r if the noun already ends in an unstressed 'e'). Thus, ""stol"" becomes ""stoler"", or ""chairs"". For the definite plural, you add -ene or just -ne to the end. No exceptions. ""dyrene"", ""stolene"", ""markene"": ""the animals"", ""the chairs"", ""the fields"".
Note that a lot of monosyllabic neuter nouns (meaning neuter nouns with just one syllable) have no ending in the indefinite plural, such as ""dyr"" (""animals""). Sadly, there are quite a few irregular plural nouns (too many to cover in this little paragraph). You must memorize these via a grammar book or class;
, This is extremely important in any language, as it is the floor beneath your ability to properly communicate. Verbs aren't quite as simple as nouns, but don't be alarmed. With proper study, time, and practice, you will achieve your goal.


In Norwegian, there are strong verbs (whose conjugations are completely irregular) and there are weak verbs. While there is no foolproof way to identify whether a verb is weak or strong, there are some hints within the verb that can help you classify them. #*Weak verbs have four classes: the -et class, the -te class, the -de class, and the -dde class. How can you tell which verb belongs to what class? Well, look at the verb itself! For example, if a verb's stem end in 'mm', 'nn', or 'll', it probably belongs in class II (e.g. spille becomes spilte).
The infinitive of verbs end with -e. To find the stem, just chop that -e off! Example: kaste (throw); kast (stem, inf.).
This also serves as the imperative form of the verb (kast! ""Throw!"").
Visit a website or book for more in-depth practice on Norwegian verbs.

Deliver your memo in a timely manner.",How to Write a Memo for Building Renovations," You can get a feeling for the tone and formality of your organization by looking at examples of past notices. Ask your superior to only provide those samples that they have been pleased with.;
, You will need to send each party a copy, and it can take a few days or weeks to obtain all the necessary addresses or emails.

, If a housing or apartment board has passed a motion approving the renovations, ask for a copy of the motion, so that it can be requested or distributed. The larger the renovation, the more proof you will need.

, For major renovations, you may want to send the memo well in advance so they can make the necessary accommodations. If the renovation is last-minute, decide the date and time that it will occur, including time for people to make their accommodations.

, Any piece of business writing is used to convince the reader of something. Under headings, make a draft that includes the memo topic, the description, the deadlines and dates, the proof and the contact information for a follow up.

, Use the company's logo and structure, if it will be a memo produced under the name of a company. The following are guidelines for formatting a memo:


Place the addressee name in the upper left hand corner of the word processing document. It can be a general or specific name, but it should be easily recognizable, so the person knows the building renovation memo relates to them.
Next, type in the person, people or company who is writing the memo. If you are writing the memo for a department or company, you may need to request approval before sending the memo out under someone else's name.
Place the date below. Memos should be produced fairly quickly, because they usually ask someone to take notice of something in a timely manner.
Write the subject of the building renovation memo, using the best descriptive words possible. For example, instead of writing ""Subject: Building Renovations,"" write ""Elevator Repair, August 30 6am to 8am.""
Write the body of the message. Write the purpose, why the renovation is necessary, why the renovation benefits the reader and the necessary proof, such as the building code or safety issues. Be direct; try not to include writing that does not support your message.

, People are more likely to read memos that are not blocks of text. Since memos are fairly informal, you can create bulleted lists or use bold text to highlight a certain section of the renovation deadline or purpose.

, If you are giving a memo to a lot of people, the best way to ensure they will read it is to keep it short. If it is too long and the purpose is not immediately clear, they may put it away until they have free time.


This is not true of legal memorandum and some company memos that include building reports or board motions. Make sure you know what length your audience is expecting.

, If your writing skills are not strong, give it to a superior or colleague who can edit it.

, Once it is approved, you will want to sign and date it to make it official. Include your contact information, and the contact information of anyone they can direct questions to at the bottom of the memo.

, Print out copies of the memo and attachments for each of your contacts. Staple them to the memo before delivering them.

, People will need time to make plans during renovations, so try to get the information out to them when it is announced.

Post your comics online and use social networking sites to direct readers to your work. Check with local weekly papers to see whether they use local comics.;
, Individual publishers often sponsor contests and talent searches, as do organizations. Many of these contests offer publication in an anthology as a prize, which can help establish your credibility as a comic book artist.

, You can do this through online research, browsing at a comic store or attending a convention. Many publishers hire writers and artists to work on existing projects, rather than publishing those writers’ and artists’ books. If the publisher offers a limited number of characters and styles in its offerings, you’ll have a more difficult time getting your book published with them. Instead, seek out a publisher with diverse offerings and comic approaches.

, Publishers receive so many manuscripts that if you fail to follow their guidelines, you may not be able to get a comic book published, because they may not even review your work.

, Most publishers require a submission of sequential pages long enough to reveal your storytelling skills, so choose a sample with a clear plot or one that reveals your characters. Make sure, too, that it demonstrates your artistic skill. Photocopy the sample once you decide on it.

, If the publisher does accept unsolicited manuscripts, you’ll want to write a cover letter.


A query letter should introduce your work; highlight your accomplishments, such as any contests you’ve won and how many readers you have; summarize the comic book you hope to submit to them for review; and discuss why you believe your work is a good match for the publisher.
A cover letter should also introduce your work, highlight your accomplishments and discuss why your work is a good match for the publisher. Instead of fully summarizing your work, briefly set the context for the sample and discuss where in the book it appears.

, Send the cover letter and your sample to those publishers that do. Be sure to include your email, phone number and physical address.

, This usually takes a minimum of 4 weeks, but check the submission guidelines to find out how long the review process takes the publisher.

If you’re planning to travel to Norway, look into the regional dialect spoken in the area you’re visiting. Regional dialect and pronunciation vary slightly, and you should practice the pronunciation used in the dialect region you’ll be visiting.;
, One of the first things you’ll need to do when learning Norwegian is to pick up a few common phrases related to greeting individuals you meet. These are listed below. The English word is on the left, followed by the Norsk word (and its pronunciation) on the right.


Hello – Hallo. It’s pronounced like: “Hollow”
Hi – Hei. It’s pronounced like: “Hi”
My name is – Heg heter. It’s pronounced like: “Yay hitter”
How are you – Hvordan har du det. It’s pronounced like: “Hvorden har doo day”
Goodbye – Ha det bra. It’s pronounced like: “Haad bra” (Or you can say “Ha det.” That means “bye.” It sounds like: “Hade” ).

, Especially if you are traveling in Norway, you will likely not have time to master the language before you need to speak it. In order to effectively communicate about basic daily needs, focus on first grasping and pronouncing words and phrases such as:


I come from ... – Jeg kommer fra. It’s pronounced like: “Yag komer fra”
I’m sorry – Beklager. It’s pronounced like: “Bak-log-et”
Excuse me – Unnskyld meg. It’s pronounced like: “Un-shiel my”
I love you – Jeg elsker deg. It’s pronounced like: “iej elsker deij.”

, Once you can greet individuals in Norwegian and are able to begin a basic conversation, it’s time to learn some beginning questions. You’ll likely need to develop a specific list of common questions relevant to your pursuits in Norway (whether they’re related to business, tourism, or academic studies). Where are you from? – Hvor kommer du fra? It’s pronounced like: “Vor komer do frah?”
Do you speak English? – Snakker du engelsk? It’s pronounced like: “Snacker do Ing-isk?”
I speak English. – Jeg snakker Engelsk. It’s pronounced like: “Yag snacker Ing-isk”
What did you say? – Hva sa du? It’s pronounced like: “Va saw do?”
Can you speak more slowly? – Kan du snakke saktere? It’s pronounced like: “Kon do snak-ke sock-tera?”
Where is the bathroom – Hvor er toalettet? It’s pronounced like: “Hvor er toalette?”

, Study as much as you can: learn pronunciation, sentence structure, verb conjugations, and as much vocabulary as you can. If you are serious about learning Norsk, buy a dictionary and a phrase book as well.


A store that specializes in languages should be able to help you to choose a suitable book.
If you are more interested in learning to speak Norwegian, you should focus on expanding your vocabulary and learning word pronunciation.
If you are more interested in learning to read, write, and translate Norwegian, you will need a understanding of regular and irregular verbs, noun cases, and other complex grammar rules. Fortunately, Norwegian has relatively simple grammar rules, especially compared with other Germanic languages.One of the books series made specifically for foreigners learning Norwegian is “Ta Ordet” by the publishers CappelenDamm.

, Look for sites that teach Norwegian, along with pronunciation and tests.Online resources are especially valuable because they will contain audio clips to help you pronounce words correctly.


Look for websites like: Learn Norwegian Naturally, My Little Norway, or Babbel.

, This is a simple and effective way to learn parts of a language. If you’re struggling to learn a part of Norwegian—for example, if irregular verbs are tripping you up—write the verb on a note card, and all of its conjugations on the back. Then quiz yourself by reciting as many of the conjugations as you can remember, before you flip the card over. You can put a variety of information in Norwegian on various sets of flashcards. Consider creating distinct sets to quiz yourself on:


Vocabulary.
Verb conjugation.
Articles and pronouns.

, This approach is similar to the flash cards; you will remember more Norwegian vocabulary and grammar rules if you see it regularly throughout your day.Coordinate the specific sticky notes with locations in your house. For example, put food vocabulary in your kitchen, and verb conjugations on your writing desk.

, You might look for a tutor in your local area, or find online Norwegian friends who are willing to “chat” with you in beginner’s Norwegian.This should be a safe space for you to make mistakes and ask questions about pronunciation and grammar.


If you know any Norwegians who are trying to learn English, you can help them with English after they help you with Norwegian.

, To really test how well you speak Norwegian, consider going on a trip to Norway. This is the most in-depth way to immerse yourself in the language. You will be surrounded by Norwegian language and culture. You’ll also experience Norwegian language in the context of daily life, rather than through online learning exercises.


If you have some friends who also speak Norwegian, it’s a good idea to bring them along as “translators” of sorts.
You will need to be intentional about speaking and learning the Norwegian language, as English is commonly spoken in Norway.

, Practice your Norwegian by subscribing to a magazine written in Norwegian. It doesn’t matter what kind of magazine it is: fashion, political, news, celebrity gossip, etc., as long as it’s written in Norwegian.


Although a magazine will not help you with word pronunciation, it will help you to recognize and read written Norwegian.
Look for widely distributed Norwegian magazines, including Vi Menn (a men’s lifestyle magazine), Allers (a women’s lifestyle magazine), or Hytteliv (a magazine on cabin living).

, This is an easy and entertaining way to immerse yourself in Norwegian, and to pick up elements of Norwegian pronunciation and culture. Watching films allows you to hear the language as it is naturally spoken, in real-life contexts.


At first, it will be helpful to keep the English subtitles on, so you can follow along.Over time, you should come to rely on the subtitles less and less, until they’re finally off altogether.
Well known Norwegian films include: Trollhunter (2010), King of Devil’s Island (2010), The Man Who Could Not Laugh (1968), and Kon-Tiki (1950).

Use free online applications that don't require subscriptions or sign-ups to check electronic documents.,
Try the poor man's plagiarism scanner — Google.,
Sign up for a subscription service if you intend on searching for plagiarism consistently and en masse.,
Check the timestamps of all instances of duplicate text to determine which text is original and which is plagiarized.,
Look for sudden changes in diction or overly complex language.,
Look for text that doesn't fit the assignment or content that doesn't fit the scope of the article.,
Keep an eye out for unnatural shifts in tone.,
Look for multiple fonts, hyperlinks in physical papers, and other formatting errors.,
Be on the lookout for outdated information.,
Trust your gut.",How to Detect Plagiarism," Google ""plagiarism checker"" to come up with a host of free web apps that contain boxes where you paste the suspected text. Hit the verify button and let the app scan the internet for instances of duplicate text.


If you want to convert PDFs to text, you may do so. Someone turning in a PDF document, while not inherently suspicious, may be a sign that they're trying to avoid being caught. (PDFs often scan as picture documents instead of as text docs.)
Good plagiarism checkers will give you a ""compare text"" function. This function may differ in details across various apps, but the idea is the same: After clicking the verify button, the app will show you highlighted portions of text that are duplicate. This allows you to see what portions of text were copied instead of simply telling you ""this article/text/content was copied.""
Free plagiarism checkers include:

;
, Look for statistically improbable phrases (SIPs) and then plug and chug them into Google to search its massive database for similarities.First, try selecting SIPs (statistically improbable phrases) and bracketing them in quotation marks in the search bar. Quotation marks simply command Google to search for exact replicas of text. If that doesn't turn up anything, take off the quotation marks and hit the search button again to look for plagiaristic similarities.
Note that Google does have its limitations. If you're looking for plagiarism on private message boards and social networking sites, Google is less likely to spot instances of plagiarism as it often won't index those sites.

, Subscription service like Plagramme and Turnitin are becoming increasingly popular for teachers who want to head off plagiarism by letting their students know that each and every paper they write is going to be analyzed for duplicate content. Of course, you'll probably have to pay for a service like this, but it's money well spent if it gives the teacher peace of mind, allows her to focus on teaching, and sends the students a message about educational integrity.

, Knowing that two texts have are duplicate often isn't enough; you'll want to know who plagiarized whom. Although it's rare, it could be that the content you thought was plagiarized has been plagiarized from. There's a big difference, of course. Weeding out who plagiarized from whom will save you the embarrassment of accusing someone of plagiarism who, in fact, did nothing wrong.

, The plagiarist will often lift phrases or whole sentences from others' work because they think it sounds or looks especially good — e.g. fancy. Often, what the plagiarist thinks sounds good is overly technical or academic language. If words like ""recondite"" ""sibilant"" or ""antepenultimate"" suddenly start cropping up out of nowhere, check the text for plagiarism.

, If you're a teacher and the student turns in a paper that's not quite on topic or maddeningly tangential, it's a sign that the words could have been plagiarized: Because most original content has ""spins"" — opinions or angles that distinguish it from the rest of the herd — it's very hard to lift large portions of content directly from other sources and still make it apply to your given topic or angle.


If you're a teacher, give out very specific, unusual, or adventurous prompts to your students. This has two advantages. It makes plagiarism much harder because there's less content to pilfer from, and it encourages your students to think about ideas they're not usually exposed to.

, Much like changes in diction, shifts in tone can be a red flag. If one sentence reads ""I do not think the death penalty is a good thing"" and the next sentence reads ""Disproportionate numbers of black men are subjugated under the so-called 'legal' yoke of deterrence in what baldly amounts to racism,"" the shift in tone probably merits investigation.

, If a student is asked to turn in a paper, and there are multiple fonts, hyperlinks, quotes within quotes, or other formatting errors, it could be a sign of plagiarism. Though none of these in and of themselves clearly spell plagiarism (they could simply be oversights or honest mistakes), they are often cues that some text has been lifted without attribution.

, Writing is a snapshot locked in time. That snapshot stays the same even as time moves on. If someone's writing mistakenly names the current president as ""George W. Bush,"" that's generally cause to be suspicious. It seems like an egregious oversight, but it happens more often than you might think.

, Often, what will tip off a plagiarist is an intangible feeling you have about their writing. Something just doesn't fit. There may be nothing that you can lay your finger on, but if it appears ""off,"" trust your judgment. It never hurts to check.

Receive your certificate of registration.",How to Copyright a Logo," You can’t copyright names, colors, or design. For example, you can’t copyright familiar symbols or typographical ornamentation.To qualify for copyright protection, your logo must be sufficiently creative that it could qualify for a copyright as an artwork.


For example, the NFL Baltimore Ravens were able to get copyright protection for the image of a raven, which was found to be sufficiently creative.You also can’t copy someone else’s logo, so research whether the logo has already been registered. Search the U.S. Copyright Office website.Include “logo” as a search term.;
, The copyright symbol is the letter C within a circle. You can also type “Copyright” or “Copr.” Include the symbol on the logo or right beside it., Use the date your logo was first published.For example, if you created the logo in 2015, then use that date.


If you haven’t used the logo yet, be sure to write “Unpublished Work” before the copyright symbol.

, Only the creator of the logo can have the copyright, unless they transferred their rights to you. Include the name of the copyright holder. You can also use an abbreviation or generally known alternative designation.Unless your business owns the copyright, use your legal name.


A complete copyright notice will read like the following: “Copyright 2017 Jill Anderson.”
If the logo was unpublished, then the notice will read: “Unpublished Work Copyright 2017 Jill Anderson.”

, As the copyright holder, you can prevent other people from reproducing your logo or distributing or displaying copies of the logo to the public. However, you must register your copyright with the USPTO before you can bring a lawsuit for illegal copying (infringement) in a U.S. court.This requirement applies to U.S. copyrights.

, It’s cheaper to register your copyright online through the electronic Copyright Office.You’ll pay a lower filing fee and have your copyright processed faster. You can pay with a credit card, debit card, or electronic check.You’ll need to create a user ID and password before you can register online.
You must submit copies of your logo to the Copyright Office as part of your application. Generally, you can do this online, though you may have to mail copies to the office instead.

, You may still register your copyright using Visual Form VA. You can download it from the Copyright Office website.Enter your information directly into the form or neatly print your information.


If you have a question, call 202-707-3000 or toll-free at 1-877-476-0778., Make a copy of your application and submit it along with your deposit copy to Library of Congress, U.S. Copyright Office, 101 Independence Avenue SE, Washington, DC 20559.If your logo has been published, include two deposit copies. Only one copy of an unpublished logo is required.


The fee schedule changes regularly, so check the Copyright website to find out the current fee.Make your check or money order payable to Register of Copyrights. All payments must be in U.S. dollars.
You won’t be notified when your application has been received. Send it certified mail, return receipt requested if you want notification.

, Generally, it can take six months or longer for your application to be processed. Electronic submissions are processed about two months faster., In the U.S., copyright protection lasts for the author’s life plus 70 years. After this time period, however, it expires. For this reason, you might want to get trademark protection. A trademark is a phrase, word, symbol, or design that identifies the source of goods or services, and logos may qualify.Trademark protection isn’t as broad as copyright protection. For example, trademark rights won’t prevent other people from using the logo if they are selling different goods or services.The main benefit of trademark protection is that it lasts indefinitely.

, Your logo can’t be “confusingly similar” to an existing trademark. Search the Trademark Electronic Search System database for free.Consult the Design Code Search Manual for which code to search.


Remember that similar trademarks are okay if they are used to sell different goods or services. In that situation, the similar marks won’t create confusion in the mind of the public. For example, “Delta” is used by both Delta Airlines and Delta Faucets.

, The USPTO prefers that you register your trademark online using the Trademark Electronic Application System (TEAS).You can pay the fee and upload a specimen of your logo online. There is a tutorial available to walk you through the process.You aren’t required to register your trademark. Instead, you can gain trademark rights by using the mark in connection with the sale of services or goods.However, there are many advantages to registering. It provides the public with notice that you hold the trademark, and you need to register before you can sue in federal court., If you’ve registered the trademark, then include the registration symbol: the letter R inside a circle. However, if you haven’t registered it yet, then use either “TM” for a trademark or “SM” for a service mark.Use your logo consistently in connection with the sale of your goods or services. If you don’t, you can lose your trademark rights.

, The USPTO will publish your trademark for 30 days in the Official Gazette. If there is no public opposition, you will receive your certificate. Because of the high volume of applications, it might take a year or more to receive approval."

Register photographs with the U.S.,
File online, if possible.,
Save your proof of copyright.",How to Copyright Photographs1," Copyright Office. Technically speaking, any photograph that you take automatically belongs to you for a minimum of 25 years.In practice, however, you will need to formally register your images if you want to bring a lawsuit for infringement upon your work. A copyright will provide solid legal evidence of your ownership, which can make it much easier to fight back against intellectual property infringements.You can register your photographs online or through the mail.


If you register your photographs, you are eligible to collect statutory damages of up to $150,000 for each copyright infringement.Avoid third-party, non-governmental copyright registration services. You might be able to avoid fees with these services, but your claim to the copyright will not hold up so strongly in a court of law.;
, If you are going through the U.S. Patent Office, it is generally cheaper, quicker, and more straightforward to register your photographs electronically rather than sending your work through the mail. You can register just one photograph, or a whole body of published work.Visit the U.S. Copyright Office website to get started.It will cost you $35 to register online, and $50 to register through the mail. The cost may vary depending on how many photos you're filing at once.The processing time for electronic copyright filing is usually up to 8 months. The processing period for paper filing may take as long as 13 months.If you go through the mail, then you may need to save your pictures on a disc and send it in.

Decide whether you want to reveal your name to the Copyright Office.,
Consider pre-registering your work.,
File your registration with the Copyright Office.,
Deposit a copy of your work with the Copyright Office.",How to Copyright a Book With a Pen Name," You do not have to give your real (legal) name to the Copyright Office to register your copyright. If you choose not to give your real name when registering your work, it receives copyright protection for either 95 years from when it was published or 120 years from when it was created, whichever period ends earlier. If you choose to give your real name, it remains part of the Copyright Office's records and cannot be removed later. However, the length of time your work receives copyright protection becomes the same as if you had written and registered it under your real name, the author's life plus another 70 years.


If you choose not to give your real name at the time you register your copyright, you can provide it to the Copyright Office at a later time. If you register a subsequent work using your real name as well as your pen name, previous works written under that pen name are then given copyright protection for the author's life plus 70 years.;
, Preregistration does not replace registration, but it permits you to sue for copyright infringement while your work is still in development if you feel there's a likelihood of someone doing so before you complete it. (This would be most likely if you're writing a book in a genre made popular by the phenomenal success of a particular work, such as the Harry Potter or ""Twilight"" books.) Preregistration is also available for works of music, sound recordings, computer software, motion pictures and photographs used in marketing or advertising.


You can only pre-register a work online by submitting a description of it no more than 2,000 characters (about 330 words) in length and a filing fee, which can be paid by credit card, through the Automated Clearing House (ACH) network or through an account you previously established with the Copyright Office. (You do not include the work itself.) For more information about preregistration, see http://www.copyright.gov/prereg/help.html#how_to.

Once the Copyright Office processes your preregistration application, they will notify you by e-mail. The e-mail notice will include the information you sent, a preregistration number and the date on which preregistration became effective. You can get a certified copy of the notice from the Copyright Office's Certifications and Documents section.
Once you pre-register your work, you must register the copyright within 3 months of publishing it or within a month after you learn someone has infringed your copyright. If you don't register within this time, you'll be unable to bring suit against an offending party until more than 2 months have passed since you published your work.

, You may do so in 1 of 3 ways: using the online electronic Copyright Office (eCO), downloading fill-in Form CO and completing it on your personal computer or obtaining a paper registration form from the Copyright Office. Whichever method you use, you must fill in the ""Copyright Claimant"" space and also check the ""Pseudonymous"" box to indicate that you're using a pen name. You must include the required payment with your application.


To access the electronic option, select ""electronic Copyright Office"" from the Copyright Office website (http://www.copyright.gov/). You'll be asked whether you intend to submit an electronic or a hard copy of your work. (You may submit either an electronic or hard copy of any unpublished work with this option.) Filing electronically lets you file for less money than the other 2 options, and also provides you with faster processing, the ability to pay electronically, e-mail acknowledgment of your submission and online tracking of the status of your application.
Fill-in Form CO can be obtained by selecting ""Forms"" on the Copyright Office website at http://www.copyright.gov/. This form includes a barcode that permits the Copyright Office to process the form with its scanners; because each barcode is unique to the registration application, you can only use Form CO to register the work for which you requested it. After completing the form on your computer, you then print it out.
Requests for paper forms must be addressed to the Library of Congress, U.S. Copyright Office-TX, 101 Independence Avenue SE, Washington, DC 20559-6221. (The relevant form for a book is Form TX.) Use the same address to submit a copyright registration and your payment by mail; a completed Fill-in Form CO is sent to the same address. (You may also print out your electronic registration form and send it by mail if you wish, but you then pay the higher fee for non-electronic processing.)

, If your work is unpublished, a complete copy of the manuscript is required. If your work has been published since 1978, the Copyright Office then requires 2 complete copies of the best edition. (If it was published before 1978, the requirement is 2 copies of the first edition.)


If you filed your registration electronically, the Copyright Office will prompt you to print out a shipping slip to go with your hard copy deposit. It is only good for the work you are registering.

Post an official copyright notice along with your images.,
Add a watermark with photo editing software.,
Be smart about how you post your photographs.",How to Copyright Photographs2," First, write the © (the letter “c,” circumscribed), the word “Copyright,” or its abbreviation, “Copr.” Then, include the year in which the photograph was first published. Finally, display your name – the owner of the copyright: e.g. © 2016 Joseph Bustamante.Consider posting the relevant copyright information along with your photograph. Include the title, the name of the photographer, and the name of the copyright owner.
Posting copyright information next to a photograph can discourage Internet users from stealing your work. It's a warning: essentially, ""I have copyrighted this work, and I'm not afraid to protect that copyright with a lawsuit!""

, Use Photoshop, Paint Shop Pro, or whichever program you are accustomed to using.The watermark can be as simple as your name, the name of your photography company, or a personal logo. This can be a great way to display and market sample photographs on the Internet without opening up the risk that people will steal them.


You can also use online resources. Use free online watermarking services like PicMarkr and Watermark-Images., The Internet can be a wonderful way to share your work with the world, but it is also full of people who are happy to download and reproduce your pictures without giving you due credit. When you post your photographs, be aware of the implications of the medium you're using. Take careful steps to discourage people from stealing your work.


Carefully read the terms and conditions. If you post your photographs online or enter your work into a contest, always read the fine print to make sure that you aren't giving up any rights.
Disable “right-click” when you post an image. This way, it will be slightly more difficult for Internet browsers to copy and save your images."

Create an online version.",How to Create a Magazine," Magazines usually have a theme or topic for all of their content. A good theme is general enough for you to write plenty on but specific enough that it caters to a specific audience. Some themes have more magazines than others, and you may want to break out into your own niche. As you come up with your theme, ask yourself:


Is this an art or literary journal? A lifestyle journal? Is it about a certain hobby or fashion? Will I be reporting news or trends?
Do other magazines cover this topic? How could I uniquely present this topic? What makes my idea different?
What kinds of articles could I write for this magazine?;
, You should determine what kind of person will be reading your magazine. By focusing on your audience, you will refine your magazine towards a specific niche.Try to determine the following:


Who would be interested in this topic?
Am I marketing to a specific gender, age, religion, cultural background, or sexual orientation?
Would people in certain industries or careers be more attracted to this type of magazine?
What kinds of concerns does this audience have?
How would this audience relate to my magazine?
How often would I publish this magazine? Monthly? Weekly? Every two weeks?

, Once you know what your theme is, it is good to do some research on it. You may already know the basics, but you should know what people expect of a magazine like yours. Research can help you generate ideas, and it will help you understand what to avoid in your niche.


What are the most recent trends, fads, gadgets, apps, and fashions that relate to my topic?
What kinds of articles do people need or want?
What kind of tone do I need to set for this topic? Is it a highly technical subject? Can I use humor? Does it require high academic language or casual writing?

, The best kind of research you can do is to look at magazines that are similar to what you to do. While you should not steal their content, you can look for inspiration. These magazine can show you what does and does not work in a print medium. You can also find out if your idea has been done before or if the market is already saturated with that type of magazine.


You can also contact the editors of these magazines to find out what printers they use, what their costs are, and how they sell advertisements.

, Write out a sentence or two that outlines what you want the purpose of your magazine to be. This statement should include who the targeted audience is and why they should read your magazine.


For example, if you wanted to make a lifestyle magazine for young women interested in knitting, your mission statement could be: “This magazine seeks to explore the world of knitting for women 20-30 years old by fostering networks of creativity and offering the latest product reviews, fun and unique patterns, and monthly knitting contests.”

, The title should relate to your theme. It should be fun, catchy, and memorable. Good titles tend to be one to three words. It should clearly express what your magazine is about.

, Come up with as many ideas for articles, features, stories, and sections as possible. Aim for thirty to forty ideas, but come up with at least twenty articles. You may only use a couple of these in your first volume, but this will give you plenty of material for future issues. If you cannot come up with at least twenty ideas, you may want to refine your theme or topic.Some ideas include:


Top ten lists
Product reviews
Interviews
Photo galleries
News blurbs

, Making a magazine by yourself can be difficult. You can divide the workload by forming an editorial team that handles different parts of the magazine. You can ask friends or family members to help out. You can also advertise on a job board or through a local newspaper. Positions you can fill include:



Editor-in-chief: the head of the entire magazine.The editor-in-chief approves each issue, comes up with issue ideas, and manages the business side of the magazine. You may want this position for yourself.

Features editor: person in charge of the major story (or feature) of each issue. They come up with ideas, assign stories, and design the layout of the feature article.Copy editor: the person who edits and proofreads all of your articles.

Art director: person in charge of all art and media for each issue.

Production manager: person who oversees the publication and printing of each issue.

, It may be difficult to write all of the content yourself. Place a call for papers for your new magazine on social media, blogs, and in newspapers. You can also go to local writing conferences or post notices in coffee shops. Writers may contribute their own ideas based on the theme, or you can assign them a topic from your list of article ideas.If you cannot pay your writers, be sure to advertise your magazine as an amateur magazine.
If you can pay your writers, place the rate in your advertisement. Professional magazines typically pay about three cents per word., Make sure that your articles are of varying lengths. If this is your first magazine, you may want to start small with a short magazine of five to ten articles. Try having a variety of articles with one long article and several smaller snippets.

, Magazines usually have plenty of visuals. These should be high resolution images that relate directly to the content that you provide. You can hire a photographer to scope out local events. You could also find a graphic designer to produce digital art. You could include cartoons, portraits, caricatures, or diagrams.


You can hire freelancers by advertising on online job boards. You can also hire a design agency for your art.
In addition to paying artists, you can buy stock photographs on the internet. Be careful, however, about lifting pictures from the internet without paying. You can be sued for copyright infringement if you do not have permission to use them.

, Decide how you want to arrange your text and images. You may choose to have a clean, white space for your articles, or you may fill the space with images. If you will be placing ads in your magazine, decide where you want them to go and how big they will be.


Certain computer programs can help you design your layout, such as Adobe, Quark Xpress, Adobe PageMaker, Corel Ventura and Adobe FrameMaker.Alternatively, you can hire a professional designer., Put fun colors and eye-catching pictures on the front cover. You can use an image from your main article or use a more general image that conveys the theme of your magazine. Place plenty of bold headlines to grab your readers’ attention.


Use a legible font in big letters for your title. You may want to use a contrasting font for the smaller headlines.Choose a cover image that reflects the content of the issue.

, A prototype is an early sample of your magazine that will help you shop around your magazine to potential advertisers. It will also show your printer exactly how you want your magazine to look. Put together the different pieces that go together best. Make sure the pictures and articles match each other in tone and content. Print your prototype using a local printing service.This is not the final copy of your magazine! After you visit advertisers, you will have to re-edit your magazine to include their ads, and you may make more changes during editing.

, Advertisers are the primary source of funding for magazines. It may be difficult to find advertisers for a new magazine, but you can want to ask local small businesses if they would like to buy ad space in your new magazine.


Bring your prototype with you as you meet with advertisers so they can see what kind of magazine you have.
On average, most magazines are 50-60% advertisements, but you can include as many or as few advertisements you want based on how profitable you want the magazine to be. More advertisements will give you more money, but it may turn off readers who want more articles. Fewer advertisements give readers more content, but it makes your profits more dependent on subscribers. You do not want more than 70% of your space taken up by advertisements., For a more professional looking magazine, you will want to work with a printer that specializes in magazines and periodicals. Many will have websites where you can upload your files. Local small scale printers may be able to do small runs while professional printers may have minimum print runs of 5,000 copies.You can contact magazines you enjoy to find their printers. Be aware that large magazines may hire more expensive printers.
A local print shop may work for you if you want only a small run of about 100 copies or less.

, There are many different factors that determine the cost of printing. Before you print, you should consider what features you want your magazine to have. Ask potential printers for a quote for these features.These include:


Will your magazine be in color or black and white?
How many pages will it be?
How many photographs and images are included?
What kind of paper do you want it to be printed on?

, Calculate all of your expenses. Be sure to include the operational expenses, the salary for your editorial board, payments to writers and artists, and printing costs. From this amount, subtract the money you made from advertisers. Divide this new number by the number of magazines you are circulating. This will give you an idea of what you might need to charge per magazine. Compare this cost to similar magazines, and tweak until you have a competitive price.


Most magazines lose money on their first issue. Be aware that not all of your magazines will sell on their first run.
Magazines typically charge less for subscriptions than they do for issues sold on the stand. Keep this in mind as you decide the cost of your magazine., You can start by asking your friends and family if they would like to buy subscriptions. Advertise on social media, and ask blogs if they would be willing to advertise your new magazine.


Advertise directly to your audience. If you know you have a targeted audience, find other publications and websites that they use, and place an advertisement there.

, If you have a large print run, you may want to invest in a distributor. Magazine distributors will sell your magazine directly to stores for you so that you do not have to handle the sale of thousands of magazines.


Many distributors will not give you your earnings until the magazines have sold in stores. You will also have to pay them for each magazine sold. Consider the costs carefully.Distributors are not suitable for small print runs. If you have a small run, you will need to handle distribution yourself.

, You can distribute your magazines yourself by contacting local stores. Ask the managers or owners if they would willing to carry your magazine.


They will want to know how much your magazine costs and how much they get to keep from each sale. Determine the cost of the magazine, and subtract the costs of printing, writing, and art per magazine. From that amount, negotiate how much money you will get to keep from each purchase.

, Most magazines have an online presence. An online version of your magazine will let potential readers access free articles to entice them to subscribe. It will also allow your articles to be shared on social media, which will give you free advertising. Consider whether or not you want to create a free version.

You also should publish the first page of your contract on letterhead, so leave enough room at the top of the page.;
, You should title it something like “Book Publishing Contract” or “Publishing Agreement.”Center the title between the left- and right-hand margins, at the top.


You can make the title bold and in slightly larger font so that it stands out.

, In the first paragraph, identify the parties and the date of the contract. If you intend to use this contract over and over, then you can include blank lines for information that will change with each contract, such as the name of the author and the publication date.


Sample language could read: “This Agreement (‘Agreement,’ ‘Contract’) is made on , between (‘Publisher’) and (‘Author’).”, Your recitals summarize why the parties are entering into the contract. These are often fragment sentences. Your consideration is what you each promise the other.


Sample recitals could read: “Whereas, Author desires that Publisher publish the Author’s work titled (‘Work’), and Publisher desires to publish the Work.”
A consideration clause could read: “Now, therefore, in consideration of the promises set forth in this Agreement, the parties agree as follows.”, The most basic rights you will want as the publisher is the exclusive right to publish and distribute the book. Make sure to discuss electronic versions of the book as well. Sometimes, authors want to give only a non-exclusive right to eBooks. You should also identify how long the right to publish and distribute lasts.


Sample provisions could read: “Author grants to Publisher the exclusive right to publish, distribute, sell, and license the rights to all editions and/or formats of the Work, in whole or in part, in the English language.”You can include a clause specifically about eBooks: “Author grants to Publisher the non-exclusive right to Electronic versions of the Work.”
Also state the duration of the right to publish: “Author grants these rights to Publisher for a period of ten (10) years from the effective date of this agreement.”

, Authors will probably want an explicit statement that they retain any rights they haven’t signed over in the contract. You should include a clause to this effect.


For example, you could write, “All rights not expressly granted to Publisher in this Agreement are reserved by Author. In the day-to-day course of business, Author may use the ideas and concepts contained in the Work.”, Contracts might apply only to specific regions, such as North America. Alternately, you could get worldwide rights to publish and distribute. Make sure to identify the territorial scope of the contract.


For worldwide rights, you could include: “Publisher may exploit the rights granted in this Agreement throughout the world.”, An advance is a sum of money that publishers give authors before publication. The amount is then deducted from royalties earned. You do not have to give an advance. However, if you do, then you should state the amount and how it will be paid.


You might decide to divide the advance into thirds. You would then give the author one-third when they sign the contract, one-third when you accept the manuscript, and one-third when you publish the manuscript., You should lay out in detail how much you will pay in author royalties. You should do some research on other small publishers to find out how much they pay. Typically, the royalty is a percentage of each sale. A typical royalty scheme might look like this:10% of net revenues for the first 5,000 copies of all editions other than eBooks
15% of net revenues on the next 10,000 copies of all editions other than eBooks
20% of net revenues for any sales over 15,000 copies of all editions other than eBooks
25% of net revenues for the first 5,000 copies of eBooks sold
35% of net revenues for the next 10,000 copies of eBooks sold
50% of the net revenues on sales in excess of 15,000 copies of any eBooks

, Authors will want to know how many copies they have sold and how much they have earned in royalties. You can explain in the contract how often you will send them a royalty statement. It will probably be easier to disburse royalties at the same time that you deliver the statement, so you should state if you are paying them at the same time.


If you want to send a statement every six months, then you can write: “Every six months following publication, Publisher will provide Author with a statement of monies received from sales of the Work along with payment of any moneys due to the Author.”, You might sign a publishing contract with an author before he or she gives you a completed manuscript. In this situation, you need to make sure that the author agrees in the contract to deliver you a manuscript. Include the deadline for delivering the manuscript.


You could write, “Author agrees to deliver the manuscript to the Publisher by .”Also tell the author how the manuscript should be delivered to you. You could request: “The manuscript shall be in the form of a Microsoft Word document sent via e-mail, CD-ROM, or USB drive.”

, The book might contain art work or other material that is under copyright. You should have the author get permission to use this work. By having the author do this work upfront, you save yourself time and money.


Tell the author to provide you with copies of the written permission to use the artwork signed by the artist.

, The book might be in terrible shape when it is delivered to you. Accordingly, you should reserve the right to reject the book. Include a provision telling the author how you will inform him or her of the rejection.


You could write: “If, at its sole discretion, Publisher deems the manuscript unacceptable, then Publisher shall advise the Author promptly by written notice. Author shall fix any defects and revise and/or correct the manuscript to the reasonable satisfaction of the Publisher, and shall deliver a fully revised and corrected manuscript after receipt of Publisher’s notice.”, You also want to give yourself the right to terminate the contract if the manuscript isn’t delivered by the deadline or if acceptable revisions aren’t made to the manuscript. Tell the author how you will inform him or her, and also explain what will happen to any advance paid. Typically, publishers require that authors return the advance to them when a manuscript is rejected.


A sample provision could read: “If Author fails to deliver the manuscript or other materials required under this Agreement, or if the revisions and corrections requested by Publisher are not satisfactory, then Publisher has the right to terminate this Agreement. Publisher shall inform Author of termination by letter sent certified mail, return receipt requested, to the address of the Author set forth in this Agreement. Upon termination, the Author shall immediately repay Publisher any advance. All rights will then revert to the Author.”, You might want to give the author the right to terminate the relationship, even after publication. You would need to explain the steps that the author must take in order to effectively cancel the contract. Be sure to explain the following:


How the author should notify you. Typically, they should send written notice to the address provided in the notice provision of the contract. State that the author must explain why they are unhappy with the relationship.
Reserve a right to fix the problem. For example, you might want to give yourself six months to try and fix the problem so that the relationship can continue.
Explain that the author has to repay any sums (such as an advance) before the termination can take effect., Many authors want to get their rights back to books that are no longer in print. Your contract should explain how authors can terminate the contract when a book is out of print.


A sample provision might read: “If the Work is out of print in the United States, then Author may send a written demand to Publisher, who has 90 days to agree to bring out a new printing within a year. If Publisher does not agree to bring out a new printing, then Author may, after repayment of any overpayment of royalties or other sums due to Publisher, terminate this agreement without further notice.”, In this provision, tell the author that all rights will revert to the author after the contract is terminated. If you’ve already printed copies, then you might want to give the author the right to buy unsold copies.


You might write: “In the event this Agreement is terminated, the rights granted to Publisher shall revert to the Author. For sixty (60) days after termination, the Author shall have the right to buy from Publisher all copies on hand at the cost of manufacture. After 60 days, the publisher shall have the right to sell the remaining copies not purchased by the Author for the best price the Publisher can obtain.”, Warranties are promises the author makes to you. If the warranty turns out to be false, then you can sue for any damage you have suffered. Think about having the author make the following warranties:The work is not in the public domain.
The manuscript hasn’t been published before.
The work doesn’t infringe on anyone else’s copyright, trademark, or intellectual property rights.
The work does not contain obscenity or defamatory statements.
The author has engaged in diligent fact-checking and all statements of fact are true.
If the book contains instructions or advice, then those are sound.
The author won’t enter into any agreement that conflicts with the rights granted to you, the publisher.

, Let’s say the author’s manuscript contains defamatory statements and he or she is sued. Because you published the statements, you can also be sued. However, if the author promises to “indemnify” you, then the author will pay to defend you in the lawsuit and absorb any costs you suffer.You should include an indemnification clause—however, you should expect the author to push back on including this clause in the contract.


A sample indemnification clause might read: “Author shall defend, indemnify, and hold harmless the Publisher, its parent company, subsidiaries, and affiliates, from any and all claims, suits, debts, actions, demands, proceedings, and/or other claims which would constitute a breach of any of the warranties or representations or any other obligation of the Author under this Agreement, and any and all expenses, costs, losses, liabilities, and damages in consequence thereof.”, You should have insurance as a small publisher. This insurance will protect you in case you are sued for copyright infringement, defamation, invasion of privacy, or some other claim. You can tell the author whether or not you have named him or her as an insured on your insurance.


If you have, you should include a provision like this: “The Publisher, at its own expense, shall name Author as an additional insured on any insurance policies Publisher maintains during the term of this Agreement.”, You can spell out how each side is to give written notice. Explain how much advance notice they must give and the method of giving notice.For example, you may want all notices sent certified mail, return receipt requested to a certain address.

, You might want to waive some provision of the contract. For example, you could extend the deadline for the author to get you a completed manuscript. However, you don’t want the author to think that because you waived one provision of the contract that you are automatically waiving all others. Accordingly, you should include a provision explaining this fact.


You could write, “No waiver of any term or provision of this Agreement, or of any breach of this Agreement, shall be construed as a waiver of any other condition, provision, or breach of this Agreement.”, You get to decide what state’s law will be used to interpret the contract. Typically, businesses choose the state where they are located. You can include a provision to this effect in the contract:


“This Agreement is subject to the laws of the State of .”, If you go to court with a contract dispute, then the judge might say that one provision in your contract is illegal. You want to clarify that the rest of the contract will remain in effect even if any provision is found illegal.


Insert this clause: “In the event one or more clauses of this Agreement are deemed invalid, void, illegal, or unenforceable, that shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions of the Agreement.”, You need to make clear that the signed contract contains all agreements between you and the author. You don’t want the author claiming that there were prior oral agreements that contradict or supplement the written contract. You can include a “merger clause” to explain that the contract represents the entire agreement.


A merger clause should read: “This Agreement reflects the entire understanding between the parties and it may not be changed except by a writing signed by both Author and Publisher.”, You should include lines for the author to sign as well as for a representative of your publishing house to sign. Be sure to include lines for address, telephone number, and email address.


Just above the signature lines, include the language: “In witness whereof, Author and Publisher have executed this Agreement as of the Effective Date.”, This article describes a basic publishing contract. However, your press’s needs might differ. Accordingly, you should show your draft contract to your lawyer and get his or her opinion as to what should be added or revised.


If you don’t have a lawyer, then you can find one by visiting your local or state bar association and asking for a referral. You can you’re your nearest bar association by visiting the American Bar Association’s website., The author and his or her agent (if there is one) will want to look at the publishing contract before signing. They also might want to negotiate changes to it. You should give the author a couple of weeks to review the contract.


You shouldn’t sign any contract unless you agree with everything in it. If you and the author cannot come to agreement on all provisions, then you shouldn’t sign a contract with the author.

, Once you and the author sign, you should make a copy of the contract for the author. If the author has an agent, make a copy for the agent as well. You should keep the original in a secure location, such as a safe or fireproof filing cabinet.


You can also scan and create a digital copy of all contracts so that you can easily access them.

If a publisher doesn't accept your story, don't give up.",How to Become an Author As a Teen," Any idea you get, jot it down quickly on some paper. It is good to consider keeping a small agenda that you can take everywhere with you, in case you get an idea. You never know when or how you will be inspired. It can be at the mall as well as at a school dance.;
, Just a basic, general view of the story. If you get several ideas and want them to happen in a certain order in your book, write it down in your agenda.

, You might add them a physical description or not but it is better if you do. Not a too detailed description though, otherwise the reader won't have much to imagine.

, Open a fresh page and let the words come to you. Now that you have your plot, let your characters come to life.

, If you are blocked try to get inspiration or just do a brainstorm on a paper. That usually helps me a lot. Write with no worries of the amount of words or the grammar. Just focus on writing.

, Once your story is finished are you are satisfied with the plot (this usually takes months, sometimes years depending on the length of your story), edit. Correct all spelling and grammar mistakes, using the option you have for this on your word processor. However, don't fall into the mistakes these programs often make. Then read your story, changing all the sentences that you don't like. Polish your story over and over and over until you can no longer make it better.

, If you want to publish your story, you must make sure first, that your story is as perfect as it can be. The publisher won't take interest in your story if it isn't as good as it can be. Remember that age had nothing to do with your chances of getting published. If your story is good, then you have more chance than an adult who's story isn't as well written as yours. Of course you'll need your parent/guardian to accept your story getting published.

, Find out first what the publisher wants. Some only want a synopsis, others the first few chapters... Publishers won't look at your story if it isn't presented the way they want it to be. Remember that they get thousands of works everyday from people just like you.


It is better to have a literary agent, because they know what they are doing as it is their job to find a publisher that will accept your story and help you improve it.
If you decide to go with a regular publisher, accept that you won't earn as much money. However, the benefit of this option is more marketing. Be sure you don't submit your book to scams. Research, research, research!
Get your book on Amazon. This is essential. Just being able to say ""search my book up on Amazon"" is easier than sharing the name of the publisher, their website, AND your book's name.

, Send your story to many publishers and try improving your story as much as you can. And no matter how many rejection letters you get, don't give up. Even the best books get rejected dozens of times before publication.

Authors also reserve film and TV rights to their works, so if you want to turn a book into a movie or television show, then the owner of the copyright should own those rights.;
, An author might already have been approached by a producer to turn a book in a movie. If so, the author might already have assigned those rights to someone. You can check with the U.S. Copyright Office.</ref>https:


You can search the U.S. Copyright Office online at http://www.copyright.gov/records/.
Search for both pre-1978 and post-1978 records. You will be able to find more post-1978 records, but it’s important to search both time frames.
If you see that the author has already assigned the rights to someone else, then you are out of luck.

, You should call the author to confirm that they own the rights and that the rights are available.There’s no point negotiating for the rights with someone if they are not available.


If you are a producer, then you will need to find a telephone number. Look at the copyright registration. If you can’t find a phone number, then contact the book’s publisher.

, You will need to negotiate with different people, depending on who you are. Accordingly, you should figure out who to contact about making an offer for rights:


If you are a publisher, then you should negotiate with the author’s agent or, if there is no agent, then with the author directly.
Foreign publishers will probably need to contact the publishing house which published the book initially. They typically have specialist rights staff that you work with. Alternately, you may need to work with a subagent., Book publishers often offer the author an advance, which is an amount of money. The advance is usually deducted from future royalties.For example, if you offer a $10,000 advance, then the author doesn’t begin to receive royalties on each book sold until they have earned at least $10,000 in royalties.


There is no easy way to determine how much an advance should be. If the author is unknown, then you might not need to offer any advance.
Advances are also broken up and paid in installments. For example, one third may be paid upon accepting the manuscript, another third when the author delivers the manuscript, and the final third on publication.

, Royalties are standard and don’t vary much from contract to contract. However, you need to understand royalties before going into negotiations. Consider the following:Book royalties are typically calculated as a percentage of the retail price. For example, if a hardcover sells for $25.95 and the royalty rate is 15%, then the author gets around $3.90 per book.
As a publisher, you might try to get the royalty based on the net price. This is the amount you receive as publisher after the book is sold.
Royalty scales can be graduated. In other words, the royalty percentage increases as the number of books are sold.

, An author will want to know quite a bit of detail before agreeing to sign on with you. Accordingly, you should determine the following information before going any further:expected first run (e.g., 10,000 copies)
proposed publication schedule
local retail price
your marketing plans
the amount of your advance

, Call up the appropriate person (author, agent, publisher) and express interest in the work. You should be prepared to discuss how much you are willing to offer as an advance, as well as your expected first run. If what you are prepared to offer is far from what the author wants, they can decline to negotiate with you.


You also should be prepared to talk about your publishing house. Ideally, you will have a brochure or a list of published works that you could share with the author or agent. This is particularly important if you are buying foreign rights, because the author might not be familiar with your reputation in a different country.

, Before moving on to draft a contract, you should reach agreement with the author on the details of publication. This will make the contract drafting much easier. Talk about the following:proposed formats for publication (e-book, paperback, hardback)
whether the copyright will be in the author’s name or the publisher’s
the applicable currency
publication schedule
length of license
any additional rights (such as the right to relicense in your territory)
proposed changes
price and availability of electronic files
who will obtain permission to reproduce illustrations or other images

, Movie and TV producers don’t initially agree to buy book rights because they don’t know if they will be able to get the financing to make the movie or television show. Accordingly, they buy options, which give them the exclusive right to purchase the film or TV rights within a certain amount of time.

, After you perform your copyright search, you should have the book’s publisher sign a Publisher’s Release. This form confirms that the publisher doesn’t own any of the rights you are seeking., An author won’t give you an endless amount of time to publish a book or turn it into a movie, so you need to come up with a length of time. Generally, 12-18 month is standard, though you should push for 18 months.You can try to negotiate rights to one or two extensions at the same price as the original term.

, The price you pay for an option will depend on the book’s popularity and whether others are bidding to option the book. If the book is not well known, then you might pay $0 but promise to use your best efforts to get the picture made.Alternately, if the book has been moderately successful and has been out for a while, you might pay $5,000. You should talk to other people in your industry if you have no idea how much to offer.
Generally, the option price should be set off against the price you pay for the rights, should you exercise your option.

, After you come up with what you’d like to offer, you should call up the author or agent and negotiate. Express interest in the work and be prepared to go first when making your offer. You generally will need to negotiate the following:The ultimate purchase price. Don’t leave this until later. Instead, include the price in your option agreement. Generally, the purchase price is tied to the budget for the movie. For example, 2.5% of the final, written direct budget is standard. You also should negotiate a floor and ceiling (minimum and maximum amount).
Net profits. It is standard for authors to get a percent of net profits, though if you are making a film for school then these might not be an issue.
Right to acquire the same rights for any sequels. If a book is a big hit, then the author might write a sequel. You will need to buy rights to the sequel, and you can secure your right to purchase them before anyone else.
Reversion rights. The author might want a right to reversion to protect against you sitting on the rights but never making the production after you exercise your option.

, If you secure financing, a screenplay, and a cast, then you might be prepared to exercise your option and purchase the rights. You should exercise your rights according to the procedure spelled out in the option agreement.


Your option agreement might state that you can exercise the option by sending written notice or simply by beginning principal photography., As a publisher or producer, you prepare the contract.You should work with a lawyer, who is an integral part of any business.

All of these specializations impart the skills needed to fulfill the functions of public image management.Employers will look for potential hires that have are organized, can process large amounts of important information, are able to think critically and can write and communicate effectively; a large percentage of a publicist’s work involves writing detailed press releases, employing problem-solving to think up new campaign strategies and speaking publicly in support of the client.A few of the colleges with the highest rated public relations and image management programs include Georgetown University, the University of Southern California, the University of Florida and Boston University. These school are rated based on test scores and project success, the sophistication of their curriculum and the satisfaction of former students seeking employment within the field.;
, Whatever major you choose, sign up for many different classes within the same basic focus that will give you a more comprehensive understanding of the business and how to succeed in it. For instance, classes like principles of marketing, public relations and advertising copywriting will all translate to the type of work you will be doing as an official press agent.Some colleges with large public relations programs feature courses that deal directly with explaining the duties of professional publicists.

, While you’re working your way through school, be on the lookout for internships in public relations or a related field. This will provide you with valuable real-world experience and will also give you something to add to a resume when you begin looking for jobs. Many degree programs require internship participation and will help you find one that suits you and begin the formative stages of business networking.Even if an internship isn’t a requirement to graduate, it is advisable to try to secure one as an undergraduate student. Those with the practical experience offered by an internship will have a leg up on those without it., Keep any press releases, newspaper features or other files you generate during your college coursework and internship and compile them in a portfolio you can show off to potential employers. This will show the employer that you already possess the know-how required for the position and have experience beyond simply studying in the classroom.Always carry your portfolio with you to job interviews to have physical documentation of the types of projects you’ve worked on at hand to give to employers.

, Once you’ve completed your degree, begin searching for jobs in the public relations or communications field. Websites like journalismjobs.comand prsa.orgare great places to share your resume or search through job listings, but many area businesses will also advertise openings in your local newspaper. Contain your search to positions specified as ""entry level"" or ""assistant"" if you don't have any professional experience; employers understand that the applicants for these positions are often straight out of college or just breaking into the career field.Relate any major projects, rewards or achievements you garnered for yourself through your education or internship to prospective employers during the interview process.

, After all, your intended career is based around promoting a positive public image. Whether it’s your first interview or your first day of work, be sure that you’re dressed appropriately and professionally, you’re ready to meet and share ideas with new people and you have everything you need to get to work. Publicists often speak for their client in front of the cameras as well as in print, so many employers demand a personable attitude, friendly demeanor and professional bearing.How you carry yourself reflects on your capabilities as a public relations expert every bit as much as the image you manage to construct for your clients. You are your own first PR project!
Publicity can be an excellent career choice if you consider yourself a “people person,” as the type of work it entails is centered around establishing and maintaining positive relationships and interactions between a single person or group and the public at large., Attaining one of the more coveted and high-earning publicist positions, like public relations director, can take many years of taxing work. Be prepared to spend your first few years writing press releases and taking care of basic administrative tasks before you make it into the big leagues being trusted with high-profile projects. Stay focused and put your best ideas out. If you work hard enough for long enough, you’re bound to be noticed and rewarded for your efforts.


Don’t be discouraged if you don’t land your dream job right away. Publicity is a complex and evolving profession that can often be very competitive, and as you gain experience, you’re sure to move ahead in the runnings for bigger opportunities, more important assignments, and higher wages.

, Returning to school to pursue a master’s level degree or higher can help keep you marketable and make you a sought-after commodity after a few years in the industry. Many publicists who represent important entertainment and business luminaries got there by furthering their education and gradually taking on bigger, more important assignments as their expertise grew.Should you ever wish to teach public relations courses at a university level or operate your own PR firm, having a graduate degree may give you just the advantage you need.
In general, the higher the level of education you’ve achieved, the more qualified you will seem to employers heading the field.

, Don’t be content with simply landing a job in the publicity field—avail yourself of every resource available to you to hone your craft and continue advancing. Accept challenging projects graciously, form beneficial connections with as many industry heavy-hitters as you can and always look for new ways to make your work stand out. Where you end up depends entirely on how willing you are to keep learning new things.


Periodically attending workshops and seminars can give you fresh ideas and motivation to stay at the top of your game., When engaged in public relations work, you need to know how to present compelling addresses and written materials that frame your client in the best possible light. This falls under the heading of rhetoric (the art of being convincing through language) and it is arguably the most essential skill any publicist or marketing specialist should possess. Even when you’re not actively trying to convince the public of any one particular fact, every strategy should be formulated as though you were making a logically-supported, directed appeal. Your credibility as a public relations expert will be assured with an understanding of the central tenets of rhetorical discourse.Use the “rhetorical triangle” model to structure your statements and press releases: understand the relationship between yourself (the presenter), the audience and the context of an argument. This will help ensure that argument takes hold in the minds of your audience.Always have a clear goal in mind whenever you begin a project, no matter how minor or routine. The language of your press materials should be centered around this goal.

, A good deal of public relations work involves taking negative or confusing circumstances and recasting them in a positive light. This requires you to be able to call upon your creative faculties and make them a well-worn tool in your arsenal. Study the habits of creative people, take notice of even the smallest details and learn to improvise. The better you are at thinking up ways to elevate your client in the public eye, the more status you’ll gain in your profession.Try incorporating brief creative mental exercises into your daily routine, such as concocting fictional histories for people and places you’ve never seen before, or highlighting one word per line in a newspaper column to tell a short story.
The term “spin” deals with changing the appearance of circumstantial details to preserve one’s reputation, not fabricating those details. You should never lie or alter the facts in order to make your client look better., As a publicist, you haven’t done your job unless you’ve enhanced the visibility, demand and public approval of your client. For this reason, how well you yourself do is primarily a matter of what you’re able to accomplish for the people you serve. Though you may sometimes be called upon to speak on behalf of your client or act as a mouthpiece for a publicity campaign, much of your work will be done behind the scenes and will help inform the actions of your clientele. Every evolving situation, good or bad, should be viewed as an opportunity to improve your client’s standing.Work closely with the client or their manager or agent to devise guided and effective PR strategies.

, Generally the less well you know the person, the more unbiased the feedback will be. Some of the feedback will be excellent: other parts of it you should discard. Trust your instincts on this.

, Cut out or combine characters if possible. Too many characters is boring for the reader. If in doubt about whether any piece of writing is necessary, cut it out. Your work will be much more interesting because of it.

If possible, take coursework that include mass media and cross-media studies.Some institutions even offer programs focused specifically on editing and publishing.A business and marketing degree is very relevant to the publishing world, but you'll need to supplement it with writing experience.;
, Programs such as Adobe InDesign or Microsoft Publisher are common in the book publishing world.Teach yourself how to use these on your own time, and you'll have an advantage when applying to editor jobs. Your future job will also likely include heavy use of Microsoft Word's ""track changes"" feature.


Many editors work on digital multimedia projects. Additional training in content management systems and graphics or video editing software will open up more job opportunities. Your eventual goal is book editing, but it helps to have other options when entering the field.
Students may be eligible for discounts on this software.

, Editors are experts at language and communication. Working on your own blog, novel, or other writing project provides hands-on experience shaping style and form. Many future editors begin their careers as writers, so a portfolio of finished work can help you enter the field.A writing or editing position with your college newspaper or a student magazine is a great way to gain experience.
If you would like to edit fiction or memoirs, personal experience writing in this genre is invaluable. Consider enrolling in relevant writing courses if this is your dream., During the summer or after you've graduated, seek an internship at a publishing house. Look for these opportunities on websites such as Bookjobs, Publishers Marketplace, MediaBistro, and Publishers Weekly; and in the print publication Writer's Market.Most publishing internships are unpaid, and concentrated in a handful of cities (about 20% of all U.S. editors work in New York).There are exceptions, but prepare for a thorough search if finances limit you to paid or local opportunities.

, Most U.S. publishing companies rely on the latest editions of the Chicago Manual of Style and Merriam Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary. Refer to these often as you write or edit to improve your grasp of spelling, punctuation, and stylistic rules.


Outside of the U.S., look at job listings from publishing houses to identify which style manuals are used in your area.

, Proofreading for a temp agency is one of the easier ways to gain editing experience with no prior work history. You may be working for law firms rather than your dream publishing house, but you'll build your resume and skills.

, Competition for entry-level editing jobs is high. Unless you're lucky enough to land a permanent job right away, you'll need to rely on freelance work or even volunteer projects. Word of mouth (or ""word of email"") is supremely important at this stage. Put effort into an active, professional online presence:Showcase your work on a personal website, built with search engine optimization techniques.

Promote yourself on social media.
Contribute to discussions in online editing groups on LinkedIn, Facebook, or professional editor association websites.

, Universities and academic presses publish books intended for small audiences accustomed to dense, difficult language. Many of their copy editing jobs focus only on basic grammar and spelling. This makes it a good choice for novice editors, who may not yet have the experience for structural or stylistic editing.

, As your list of edited works grows, you'll meet more people in publishing and develop the experience you need for a permanent job. Check your dream publishing companies' websites often for job postings, and attend editing and publishing conferences where you can meet employers face to face. When one of them hires you, it will probably in the role of editorial assistant. The job may include proofreading manuscripts (performing the final review after the main edits are complete), gauging whether unsolicited manuscripts are publishable, and assisting the rest of the staff in day-to-day organization., This often takes five to seven years in the industry. During this time, you'll move from editorial assistant to assistant editor, then associate editor, then finally to a full editing position.There are several different roles you could steer yourself toward, although not all publishing houses separate them completely:


Acquisitions editors or commissioning editors recruit authors for the publishing company, seeking new bestsellers.
Developmental editors work closely to improve the overall structure of the book, assisted by line editors who work on a smaller scale.
Technical editors use specialized knowledge to edit works related to science, mathematics, and technology.
Production editors oversee the final stages of the manuscript, managing copyeditors and typesetters.

Be aware of common symptoms that go along with a food allergy.,
Write down the time that you experience your symptoms.,
Note the activity you were doing before and during your allergic attack.,
Look for a pattern.",How to Keep an Allergy Food Diary," When you are trying to figure out what is causing your allergic reaction, it is important to always have a notebook handy that you can write down observations in. Unless you always carry around a large purse or briefcase, its probably in your best interest to buy a small notebook that can fit in a pocket of your pants or jacket. That way, it won’t be a hassle to carry it around, but you’ll still be very aware that you have it (which will help you remember that you need to write stuff down).You can also download an allergy diary to your smartphone, if you have one. There are many to choose from--just open the app store and browse the topic ‘allergy diary’. Most of them cost between $1 to $3 dollars.;
, Keep track of everything thing you eat--from breakfast, to dinner, to everything in between (including snacks). On top of that, write down all of the ingredients in each dish.For example, rather than writing down, Lunch: Sandwich; apple; glass of milk, you would write down Lunch: Whole-wheat bread with honey ham, cheddar cheese, and mustard; apple; glass of milk.

, As strange as it seems, some people are allergic to things when prepared one way and not another way. This is because they are actually allergic to the ingredients used to cook the food, rather than the food itself. Keep track of whether the food is fried in vegetable oil, sauteed in olive or coconut oil, or cooked with butter.


For example, rather than writing down Dinner: Stir fry of carrots, snap peas, and water chestnuts; rice; glass of white wine, you would write down Dinner: Stir fry of carrots, snap peas, and water chestnuts; rice; white wine. Type of cooking method: Stir fry sauteed in olive oil with salt, pepper, and garlic.


, If you are eating something from a box or something that has been pre-made, look at the list of ingredients on the box or package. While doing this, be aware of ‘hidden’ ingredients like dyes, flavorings, and preservatives. Food companies are required to list all of the ingredients that have gone into a product. Write all of these ingredients down with your meal.For example, if you ate Kraft Mac and Cheese, you would list: the noodle ingredients (wheat flour which contains B Vitamins, Niacin, mononitrate, folic acid, thiamine, riboflavin, iron) and the ingredients in the cheese sauce (whey, milk, milk fat, milk protein concentrate, salt, cheese culture, sodium tripolyphosphate, sodium phosphate, calcium phosphate, yellow 5 , yellow 6, citric acid, lactic acid)., If possible, go to restaurants that list the ingredients they use in their meals. Or, if you are going out to a place that doesn’t list the ingredients, don’t feel afraid to ask your waiter for a list of the ingredients used in the dish. They will be happy to help.

, While this may be hard to do, it is important to try to keep track of the amount of each type of food you eat at a meal. Doing this will help you to figure out whether or not your allergy is dependent on the amount of food you eat.


For example, if you ate some pineapple and some carrots, you should try to write down Snack: Ate four large slices of pineapple and roughly 20 carrots.


, Like food, you should be writing down all of the drinks you have and the ingredients that go into them. You should also keep track of how much of each drink you have and when you have it.


For example, you could write down Snack: 5 ounces of chocolate milk (2% milk and Hershey’s chocolate syrup).


, Sometimes, you may get a bad cut of meat or a slightly rotten fruit. If you are eating with others, ask them if they are experiencing the same symptoms that you are. Your symptoms may be related to something other than allergies if your whole family is going through what you are going through.For instance, if your whole family eats pizza together and you start feeling nauseous, ask others if they are also feel nauseous--your nausea may be caused by food poisoning, rather than an allergy to pizza.

, While everyone will react differently when they are experiencing an allergic attack, there are still some common symptoms that you can look out for. These symptoms include:


Irritation: Itching of the neck or face; flushing of the neck or face; rash; swelling of the face; hives.
Gastrointestinal problems: nausea; vomiting; diarrhea; bloating.
Other symptoms: fainting; difficulty breathing; low blood pressure; wheezing; pain in the ears.

, It is important to keep track of the things you experience while they are happening. While you might be super uncomfortable, try to write the symptoms down during the attack or immediately after. Information you should include in your description of the allergic attack include:


Time the attack started.
How long each symptom lasted for.
The intensity of the symptoms.
When all of the symptoms went away.

, Some allergic reactions can be caused by a specific food combined with a specific activity. For example, a person who is allergic to eggs might not have any symptoms if they just eat the eggs, but will start to itch and have a hard time breathing when they go for a run after eating eggs.

, After you have been writing in your diary for at least a couple of weeks, you might be able to see a pattern forming. For example, you might notice that every time you eat peanut butter, you develop a rash on your arm. To help you find your pattern, its good to know the foods that most people are allergic to. These foods include:

Wheat, soy, shellfish, fish, peanuts, eggs, milk, and tree nuts.

When in the beginning stages of forming a secret organization, only plan it with people you know and trust.,
Choose a name.,
Have a code of conduct and a list of rules.,
An initiation process is a good idea, but do not make it humiliating, painful, or anything of the sort.,
Making any and all members swear to keep this a secret.,
Do not give someone special treatment just because you like them better than the others.,
Follow your own rules.,
Do not recruit, or try to recruit, anyone who you know will disrupt the group.,
Keep your organization quiet.,
Avoid suspicion.,
Don't admit anything.,
If a member decides to leave your organization, make sure they won't tell anyone about it.,
Do not publish anything about your organization on the internet.",How to Keep a Secret Organization Secret," Including someone that you've just met is not a good idea. No matter how long you've talked to someone, if you've just met, you do NOT know them.;
, Your organization's name should not depict your ultimate goal, as it is a secret organization, and having someone figure out what you're all about based on your name would be a bad scenario. Try to be original as well, choosing a name that is a copy or, or similar to, the name of a band, movie, or non-secret organization shows a lack of creativity. Anagrams and Initials are overused, so try to steer clear of those.

, Make sure it's clear that all members, including the leader, are to follow this code of conduct, and list of rules. Have a policy in place for breaking these rules, such as the three strike rule, each strike deserving of a different penalty.

, You want your members to be happy and healthy, not afraid and in pain.

, This means no telling, no hints, no 20 questions-style interrogations. Have a harsh punishment in case they break this rule, such as demoting them within the group, evicting them from the group, or worse, depending on your organization and it's level of importance to you and your members.

, If they break a rule, assign them the same punishment you would had it been anyone else. This includes yourself. If you break a rule, give yourself the same punishment you would the other members. Just because you lead this organization, does not make you exempt from messing up.

, Don't hint that you have a secret to anyone. If you want to try to recruit someone, it should be done in a manner that has already been pre-discussed by the group.

, Talk it over with your members before trying to recruit anyone to make sure no one else has a problem with it. If someone does have a problem, request them to give you reasoning as per their answer.

, There should be no advertisements for it whatsoever. If you and another member(s) are determined to talk about it outside of your designated meeting area, do it in a setting where you would be unheard by others.

, If someone has noticed you and your fellow members together more than you would normally be, take a break. Spend time away from each other and with other people. On this note, however, do not just suddenly stop spending time with each other, do it in increments.

, Someone may call you on having a secret organization either based on a wild guess, or true suspicion. Never say, ""Yes, I'm in one."" or anything of the sort, not even 'Maybe.' This will make them more suspicious. Try not to get defensive, as when someone is defensive, it is a dead giveaway that they are either lying, or truly care too much about the subject at hand. Alternately, you may admit in a sarcastic manner; ""Duh, of course I'm in a secret organization - isn't everyone?"". This often works well towards putting off further questions and is, on occasion, hilarious.

, Try to make their leaving a process that harbors little to no hard feelings, as when people are hurt, they tend to do things they later regret, such as becoming a loudmouth.

, It can, and most likely will, be found. Keeping records of what happens during meetings is a great idea, but it should be done in hand written, or typewriter, form only. Keeping your records stored on a computer that is unacceptable to the internet is fine, as long as you prohibit flash drives, floppy disks, and any other item that can store information from a computer on it, within your meeting area.

Get the necessary equipment.,
Consider special niches.,
Research a good deal of your time in industry is going to be in the area of research.,
If you are new to the grant writing industry, consider these several ways to enhance your ability to make a living form grant writing:


Take a course or two on grant writing from your local community college or university.,
Research how much money you can make as a freelancer.,

Whichever one you choose go with either a Notebook or laptop style computer. Either one will make your life easier when you start to make trips to your local library to conduct research or to call on clients.


If you choose a Windows based computer, get one that has either Windows 8 or 8.1 as the operating system. If you decide to wait on a new computer you might like the new Windows 10.0 operating system. If you choose to go with an Apple computer get one with the OS X  Snow Leopard operating system.
Regardless of which computer system you choose, make sure you keep up with the latest updates for either model. In addition to the software that comes installed on your computer it is essential that you have a solid word processing package like MS Word and an accounting package such as Excel.
Most nonprofit organizations use MS Word and Excel. This will make your life, as well as that of your clients, much more pleasant when sending documents, attachments and spreadsheets back and forth.
Get a solid laser printer (many grant makers specify all printing be laser printing), a land-line telephone as well as a cell phone, a reliable Internet provider and both a fax machine and a separate fax telephone number, business cards and a viable website.

, Most successful grant proposal writers have a specialized niche or industry for which they write grant proposals.A niche is generally based on something that you have experience with, such as employment, or a cause or project that you may have volunteering experience with.


Write in the area of Children’s Sports, Public Safety and Homeless Veterans causes. Regardless of what niche you choose, it is always a good idea to remain available to write on just about any subject matter that presents itself. You do not have to be an expert on all aspects or causes, just be able to conduct research on the topic and take good notes.
Learn as quickly as possible all of the key terms associated with the topic, read as much as possible about the subject on the internet and take as many notes as possible so that you can talk intelligently with your client about the subject.

, Researching your client, the subject matter of the grant itself, who are the grant makers, what grants are available and how much grant money is available for a certain type of grant and many other topics. This will be a very large part of your billing to your client.


Decide to bill for research independent of the actual grant writing, or you may decide to include it all together, but it will behoove you to keep a record of the actual time you spend on research and make sure you bill accordingly.
If you take the time to engage in a grant proposal writing service then contact someone in your area, like the Y.W.C.A. or American Red Cross and ask them if they may have several older copies of grant proposals that you could have to read and study.
Explain to them that you are new to grant writing and would like to read complete and funded grant proposals. If you have a college or university in your area contact them for additional grant proposals that you might read. Almost any non-profit organization will have copies of older grant proposals that they will gladly give you copies. From these you will learn more of what makes a winning grant proposal than from most books.

,
Volunteer at any nonprofit organization in your area, ask to volunteer in the grant department.
Read the book Grants for Dummies, available at your local book store. Make sure to get the latest edition.
Go on line and watch any number of grant writing seminars

, For those individuals who are just entering the grant profession as a novice freelancer you are probably wondering how much money you might expect to make.


As a freelancer you can expect, depending on how well you market yourself, on your writing skills, and if your website if you have one. The national average for a novice proposal writer is about $39,000 per year. Those individuals with 3-5 year experience may expect a yearly income of approximately $69,000. (wageindicator.org).
At the same time there are conditions that you have little or no control over, such as the time of year you enter the field, the local and national economy, how much money Congress has set aside for government grants and just how generous foundations are feeling from one particular year to the next.. For example, Google the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, one of the largest foundations in existence and see how much they give from year to year.
Also try any of the larger foundations such as Walmart Foundation, the National Football Foundation or any others you may be curious about. After you have checked out some of your favorite foundations, congratulate yourself, you have just started to learn the lesson of grant research. A skill that is vital to your Grant Proposal Business.

, The final, and for some, the hardest step is marketing yourself This means contacting nonprofit organizations in your area to start with. As you grown in experience you may choose to take on clients nationally.


If you do not have any grant proposals that you have written that you can show potential clients, but have volunteered and been a part of grant writing team, ask that non-profit organization to write you a recommendation that you can present to potential clients.
Remember not to take it personally if you get turned down by a potential client. Take time to thank them, once you have more experience you may approach them again.

, Some diary keepers like to offer a prize to the person who found it. This makes it more likely for the person to return it. You may want tell a person you trust to keep it safe and not look at it.

, Say something like: ""Today I got up, lived my day, and went to bed."" Write it again and again, and soon people will get bored in reading it and give up.

, Or you can just buy a notebook that comes with a lock.

, Of course, this is a secret diary, and secrets should be interesting. Even if you can't spot an interesting part of a day straight away, there is always fun in even the most boring of days! Perhaps you want to complain about a strict teacher? Or maybe you want to write about your crush? It's up to you, but you will need to keep to your commitment.

, It's natural, and blank pages mean something too! They mean you were feeling very lazy on that day, or you really couldn't find anything interesting about that day (which is almost impossible, but is possible!) and there was no point in writing. If you have found you have seriously forgotten to write a lot, and missed about three months, don't try to write and catch up. If you do, you are not writing your true, present feelings and your diary will no longer be a true diary.

, This just shows you don't keep a diary so people won't go looking. If a teacher asks in class: 'Who keeps a diary?', don't raise your hand! Students will look round and will know who's diary to look for.

, If you are not enjoying your diary, carry on until the end of the year, but just don't do one next year! Simple as that!

Know the seriousness of the secret before you hear it.,
Ask how long you must keep the secret.,
Find out if you are allowed to tell anyone else.,
Stop the person from telling you.",How to Keep a Secret1," If someone tells you ahead of time that they are going to tell you a secret, ask for more information first.


Find out if it is a “little” secret or a “big” secret. This will tell you how important it is that you keep the secret. It will also tell you if you need to give the person your undivided attention while they disclose their secret (looking at your phone while having a serious talk is poor etiquette).
Prepare yourself to listen to the secret, knowing if it is something that you can handle.;
, It might be easier to keep a secret if you know you only have to keep it for a certain length of time. If you are expected to keep the secret forever, that is good to know up front as well.

, When you are told the secret, ask if it is okay to tell anyone else, like your sibling or a partner/spouse.


Asking if it is okay to tell can help you avoid an uncomfortable situation in which the person is upset with you.
If you know you will tell someone, like a spouse, be up front with that information and warn the person that you are going to tell someone else. You may want to warn them about this before they tell you the secret.

, If you know that you are really bad about keeping secrets, tell the person not to tell you the secret.


The person will appreciate your honesty and still has the option of telling you, knowing that you may tell someone else.
Suggest that the person tell you the secret right before they tell other people, so you do not have to keep the secret very long.
Some studies have shown that keeping a secret puts undue stress on a person. If you wish to avoid added stress, just say no to secrets."
"
Decide how long you want to keep the secret.,
Make a plan for telling someone.,
Push the secret out of your mind.,
Think about the benefits of telling your secret.,
Entrust your secret to one person.",How to Keep a Secret2," Depending on the type of secret, it may have a built-in end point.


Something like a pregnancy or a surprise gift will have a natural end date.
Other secrets might not have a natural ending point, and you will just have to decide when you will be ready to tell people.
Try waiting a few days if you feel very emotional about the secret. You may regret telling someone immediately, and giving yourself a few days to calm down may help you make more rational decisions about when to tell people and who to tell.

, If you know that you will be able to tell someone in the future, making a detailed plan about how and when to tell may help you keep the secret in the meantime.


If it is a “fun” secret that you’re going to surprise someone with, planning a fun way to tell will help occupy the time before you tell her.
If it is a serious secret, make a plan to give yourself and the person you’re going to tell uninterrupted time alone to talk and discuss the secret.

, Stay busy with other things, and try not to think about the secret too much. If you think about it constantly, it will be much more difficult to keep yourself from telling someone.

, If you are keeping a secret that is upsetting you, you may be standing in your own way. Telling someone may give them the opportunity to help you in a way that you may not expect., If you absolutely must tell someone, be sure you choose the right person.


Think about your past experiences with that person. Have they been trustworthy and discreet in the past?
Be explicit about your expectations when you tell the person your secret: are they allowed to tell anyone? Who and when can they tell?
Know that telling anyone opens up the possibility that the secret will get out.

"
"
Do not bring up the topic to anyone.,
Change the conversation topic if necessary.,
Pretend you do not know anything.,
Lie if you have to.,
Be honest.",How to Keep a Secret3," If you bring up the topic of the secret in a conversation with someone, you will likely be tempted to tell the secret. You may (consciously or subconsciously) bring up a related topic hoping that you will have the opportunity to tell the secret. Being aware of this can help keep you from doing it subconsciously.

, If you are talking to someone who mentions something related to the secret, you may need to change the topic of conversation.


Continuing to talk about something that reminds you of the secret will put it in the front of your mind and may tempt you to tell.
Try to change the subject casually so that the person does not notice that you are avoiding telling her something.
If necessary, find a reason to leave. Sometimes removing yourself from the conversation is the only way to keep quiet.

, If someone suspects that you know a secret, try to be vague if she asks you about it directly.


You may be able to pretend you don’t know by asking questions about the secret.

, You may need to lie about knowing the secret. If you do lie, be sure you remember what you told the person so you don’t get “caught” in the lie. It’s better to just lie and say you don’t know (even though you do) than to make up an elaborate detailed lie.

, If someone keeps pressing you for information, tell them “I cannot talk to you about this at this time.” Even though you’re admitting that you know something, you are not telling the secret.


If the person is persistent, politely tell them to stop asking you.

Write it down and destroy it.,
Find an anonymous place online to tell.,
Tell an inanimate object.,
Tell yourself in the mirror.,
Get the secret energy out of your body.,
Tell one person who is very trustworthy.",How to Keep a Secret4," Writing about the secret in detail on paper, then destroying the evidence, can be a good way to “get it out.”Be sure you thoroughly destroy the evidence. Consider burning it (safely) or shredding it in a paper shredder.
If you put it in a trash can, tear it into pieces and bury it underneath the trash. Consider putting the pieces in separate trash cans and/or taking the trash out to the curb or dumpster immediately after throwing the paper away.

, There are some forums for posting secrets so you can get it out but remain completely anonymous.


Be sure you are truly in an anonymous environment.

, Telling the secret to a stuffed animal, a pet, or a collectible item may help you feel like you have told someone. If you feel like you’re going to burst because you haven’t told anyone, this may help get the immediacy of your urge to tell out.


Be sure that there is no one nearby to overhear what you are saying.
Be sure your phone and computer are not connected to calls or audio chat before you speak aloud to an object.
You may also consider telling a baby who cannot speak yet. You might feel like you are telling a person, but the danger of the secret getting out would be very low.

, If you need to feel like you are telling another human, try telling yourself the secret in the mirror. Pretend you have a twin brother or sister and talk to yourself. This may seem silly, but it might help.


Again, be sure that there is no one nearby to overhear what you are saying.

, Sometimes, hearing a secret makes you feel like you’re going to explode. There is a physical connection between your body and keeping secrets.Get the jitters out by yelling or dancing around—anything that will get that excited energy out of you so that you don’t run and tell someone the secret instead.

, If you absolutely must tell another human, be sure that it is someone who can keep a secret.


If you are keeping a secret about another person, try telling a third party who doesn’t know the original person.
If you do tell someone, be sure they understand that the matter is a secret and they should not tell anyone.
Know that telling anyone opens up the possibility that the secret will get out, and that people may find out it was you who told.

"
"
Evaluate whether the secret is dangerous.,
Know if there is an end point or deadline.,
Weigh the risks and benefits of telling.",How to Keep a Secret5," If the secret involves one or more people being hurt, you may need to tell someone who can help, particularly if there are children involved.


If someone is harming or has harmed herself or another person, you may need to report it.
If someone is involved in criminal activity and tells you about it, you might be held legally responsible for not reporting the action.

, If you asked about telling the secret when you found out, double-check to see if it is still an appropriate time before you start telling people. Some events, like surprise parties, will have an obvious “secret” deadline.


Ask if your “reward” for keeping the secret can be getting to tell someone yourself when the time is right.Whatever you do, do NOT text the secret to anyone because then they have proof that YOU told them. Tell the person in person.
Depending on the secret, you may not want to tell other people that you knew before they did. This may hurt the feelings of the person’s close friends or family.

, Any time you decide to tell a secret to someone else, you must evaluate the risk of many people finding out and you being thought of as untrustworthy against the satisfaction you will feel when you tell someone the secret.


If you are considering telling a secret, write down a list of pros and cons to telling.This can help you make a well-reasoned decision.

Send a screenshot of secret documents.,
Choose a news outlet that uses a secure leak platform.,
Clear the cookies and turn off the wifi.,
Power down the laptop before you leave.",How to Leak a Secret2," One mistake that’s easy to make is sending original documents that could be easily tracked. If you have documents on a computer, take a screenshot and make it into a separate document. Send this document so the original doesn’t create a trail., If you send an email to a news outlet’s general email account, it will be easily tracked. Make sure that the outlet has a system in place to protect both of you from detection.

Handle the document and envelope with gloves.,
Print an address label.,
Leave the return address blank.,
Drop the envelope in a public mailbox that is not near your home.",How to Leak a Secret3," You leave fingerprints on everything that you touch. When you print and pick up the documents, wear gloves. Also be sure to wear gloves when you put the documents in the envelope and any time you handle the envelope.

, Since your writing has a distinct trademark, it can actually be studied and traced back to you by professionals. For this reason, you'll want to avoid address the envelope by hand. Printing a label is a quick way to avoid your writing giving you away.


If you don't have access to a printer, write the address with your non-dominant hand or alter your typical writing style as much as possible.

, It may seem obvious, but you don’t want anyone to know who sent the secret document, so don’t write your address on the envelope. Make sure that you still paste a stamp on the envelope, though, or the letter might not get where it’s meant to go., Never mail secure documents from your house because it may be traced back to you. Drive somewhere that’s relatively far from your house and leave the envelope in a public mail collection box."

Make sure your diary reflects your personality.,
Write in some basic information about yourself on the first page.,
Start your first entry by labeling the top with the weekday and date, the time, and possibly where you were when writing that entry.,
Don't be afraid to even give your diary a name.,
Write your frustrations and celebrations, but also write everyday things about your schedule, your friends, and the things you like to do.,
Start again if you have a break from writing.,
Read your old entries every so often and see what you think now in comparison to then.,
Make sure you hide it too.",How to Keep a Diary and Stick to It," Some of the ways people personalize diaries are:


Adding scraps, like movie ticket stubs, receipts, flower petals, etc.
Gluing in photographs
Making sketches and drawings
Writing poems
Choosing a quotation or a goal of the day

, You could include your name, your age, your best friend, your occupation or school grade, and a few of your hobbies and favorite things. Sometimes people include a ""reward if found"" note, just in case it gets lost.

, Write your entry as if you were talking to your best friend, or even to yourself, with enough detail to remind you what was going on at that time. Remember that things may be different in the future.

, Pretend it is a real person, not a non living object. This one day may become your best friend!

, People forget things they think they will always remember, and these everyday things will be very meaningful to you later. Try to write positive in there too. Being positive can help you in the darkest of times.

, If you do skip a day, days, or even weeks, don't worry about it. Just start in again from the current day. Obsessively trying to catch up with all your past events is the quickest way to lose interest a diary. If you're still remembering something weeks later that you didn't write about, it will come up again in your mind later and you can write about it then. Don't worry if you skip a day, week, or even a month. No one's keeping score.

, But do this when you are in an accepting mood of yourself! It does not help to be mean and judge your former self and then throw away your diary in disgust. Be nice to yourself and treat your old diaries like letters from your former self to your present self. More importantly, see how much you have grown and learned from your experiences. At the end of the day, that is the true beauty of a diary, of your own personal and emotional growth as you strive to better yourself every day.

, It's a personal diary so it needs to be safe! A hollow book is a good place to hide a diary.


You can also hide your diary in other places like between the mattress and the bed frame, stuck up under a table/chair, in a video case, in a shoe packet, or in your jacket.

"
"
Hide it anywhere no one will find it:


Find an old book and cut a hole in it so your diary will fit.,
Put your diary inside a desktop computer.,
Put your diary online.,
Tape it to the underside of a chair, desk, table, or interior of a drawer.

,
Put it under a loose floorboard in a hardwood floor (best for old houses).

,
Make a hollow book and put your diary inside.

,
Act natural when anyone comes into your room as if you have nothing to hide.,
Make a decoy.,
See if there is enough room to stick the diary between the back of a framed picture and the wall.,
Lift a removable ceiling panel (if you have one) and place your diary (or anything else you have to hide) on one next to it.,
Slip your diary inside a newspaper roll, and set the newspaper next to your chair, on the shelf, wherever a newspaper looks natural but discreet.,
Hide it under a chest of drawers, under the bottom drawer, where the floor is.,
Find an old tissue box.,
Hide it in an old Bible case.",How to Hide Your Diary1,"
In a jacket hanging up
In your pillowcase.
In a fish tank where people will never look
In your handbag/purse/old backpack.

Behind your TV, or computer.

Under a pile of stuffed animals.
In your underwear drawer.
In the little space under your bureau.
Inside a shoe box (make sure you keep shoes in there too!)
Inside your computer
In the pet carrier box.
Under your cushion.
If you have a pile of cushions on your bed, then you can unzip one of the covers, slot it in and re zip it. No one will ever know! Just make sure no one sits on it and gets a nasty surprise!!
Under a pile of cans that you don't usually drink.
If you have an opening blanket, hide it under the cushion inside.;
, Most computers have lots of empty space inside the case, and very few people think to look inside them. People, and parents especially, may not be very good at dealing with technology and not even realize it can open or that there is any space inside. Just be sure not to store it somewhere where it will damage your computer, start a fire or block airflow to components that need cooling.

, Don't use things like LiveJournal. That isn't as anonymous as making a separate email address and emailing entries to yourself or just saving all your entries as drafts on that email.

,,,, This way, that person will be less likely to look around for your diary!

, If a nosy person comes into your room and starts snooping, get a little notebook and quickly write my diary on it and then drop it onto your bed. Casually leave the room. Maybe they will read the decoy diary and, finding very little there, simply leave the room and you will have nothing to worry about. Add bogus entries every so often, as if they had really happened, but that the snooper can recognize as fantasy (such as your fantastic trip to San Francisco, or how you spent two years in a foster home, or how you rescued a dog from the pound and now it is your best friend). This will make them wonder if other things you wrote were true or fantasy, and you can tell people that you want to be a writer so you make up a lot of things. Later, when you're done with that diary, go back and put a code by the fantasy entries before you hide it permanently. The famous writer Anais Nin did this for years!

, Nobody looks behind pictures.

, Why would anybody look in your ceiling?

, An example of a bad spot is on an end table, where it may seem to invite someone to pick it up, open it, and find the diary by mistake.

, Remember to put the drawer back on. Some sets of drawers have a base, with a space between the base and the bottom drawer, this way people won't find your diary, even if they're moving the furniture around!

, Slip your diary inside, and then cover it with a few sheets of tissue. The only problem is that if someone wants to take a tissue they may find the diary underneath, so use quite a few tissues and replenish them after anyone uses them.

, Also put one of your old Bibles in it to cover up your diary. It works great!

"
"
Conceal the cover of your diary with a book cover (make it look like a very boring book so that if anyone finds it, they won't want to read it!),
Write your diary in a completely ordinary-looking school notebook (you might even put school notes on the first few pages) and keep it with other school stuff.

,
Consider the alternatives.,
Try considering one of those Password Journals.,
Hide it inside an old video case if it fits, then set it among the rest of your videos.

,
Get a diary with a lock, and carry the keys around your neck or hide the keys.,
Instead of a paper diary, you could try blogging.,
Write your diary as a word document and lock the document with a password.,
Hide your diary in bookshelf among storybooks.,
Hide your diary in an old shirt/top and put it somewhere in your dresser where nobody claims to look.

,
If you have a computer, look up a boring wikipedia entry and then copy it and paste it on your diary (make your diary a word document) and label your diary the article name.,
Overall, the best place to hide a diary on a computer is inside the system folder.",How to Hide Your Diary2," and hide it amongst your other books.

,, If there are absolutely no good hiding spots you can access easily or your nosy person has already discovered them all:


Consider writing your diary in a shorthand or code that only you understand, so that even if intercepted no one will know how to read what you have written. Note, however, that almost any code that isn't generated by a computer can be broken by someone with enough time and experience, and that if you write in a code that doesn't look like normal English, it will be obvious to everyone that you're hiding something. Also, the more complex the code, the longer it will take to write out and the longer it will take to decipher when you want to read it. The more practice you have with your particular method, the quicker your writing/reading will become.
Or, as a twist to the above, consider writing in a language with a script different from your own; for example, Japanese. Greek and Korean are a good shortcut because you only need to learn the alphabet and not the actual language (Korean and Greek characters have different shapes from the English letters, but share very similar sounds). Try to choose a language few people know and/or you have an interest in (if anyone finds it, you can always say it's practice or something).
You can also create your own language or variation on English. English has a lot of room for condensation. For example, consider dropping the definite article and using a symbol instead. Then take that symbol and place it somewhere that isn't grammatically correct in English. For example, use a '?' symbol for ""the"" and attach it to the end of a word. That way 'the word' becomes 'word?'
Consider instead keeping an electronic diary on a computer. Write in MS Word or a similar program, and then put a password only you know on the file when you save it. Then, put it in a folder and put a different password on that folder, giving an extra layer of security. For even better hiding, place the password folder in a directory on your computer that people would be unlikely to look in. For example, name the folder something innocuous, like ""data3"", and then place it in a directory called ""utilities"", instead of naming it ""diary"" and putting it in ""My Documents"".

, It is an electronic device where you voice activate or pin code open. Then it opens up to a notebook, LED light, pen holder, picture frame and all sorts. The prices for these are very low for something that is very high technology!

,, Just keep in mind that your parents might ask you why you have the key.

, If you have a video camera, and are willing to spend time and money getting cassettes, you can record your feelings out loud!

, When you have a word document to put a password on it you need to go to tools, options, click the security tab and type in the ""password to open"". Also make sure not to name it ""My Diary"" but name it something normal like ""page 27 homework"" or ""Today I....""

, Truly the diary seems to be a story-book.

,, Type out your diary under the article.

, Navigate to C:\Windows, and pick a folder. No one will ever look in there, or know which of hundreds of folders you have put your file in.

Use the powder method.,
Use the temptation method.,
Use the hair method.",How to Hide Your Diary3," Put a little powder (flour, powdered sugar, etc.) in one of the covers or on the page you think might be most likely read. The powder will fall out when the page is opened, and you will notice either powder on the floor near your diary, or that the powder in the book is missing.

, Write a false entry in your diary saying that if your brother does your chores for you every day for a week, you will give him a piece of candy. Or say that if your sister cleans your room you will let her borrow your laptop, for example. When your brother miraculously starts doing your chores or your room is suddenly spotless (and your sister claims it to be her work), you know you've got readers.

, Find one of your hairs on your jacket or shower or something. Place one end of the hair in one of the covers of your diary and the other end in the other cover of the diary so the hair is facing the side of the book that opens. When someone opens the diary, the hair will snap or will fall out or loosen a lot.

Buy a diary or journal.,
Decorate the outside.,
Remember to write.,
Take care of it.,
Know the idea of a diary or journal.,
Be careful where you place your diary.",How to Keep a Diary or Journal (for Teenagers)," This is only necessary if you don't have one already. If you want to keep a journal, buy a nice looking journal or you can even use a spiral notebook. Try book stores and regular grocery stores in the section with books or school supplies for the spiral notebooks. Consider how you are going to decorate the book when you are buying it. Also consider the size, shape and colors.

, Do this to your liking. It should reflect your personality! Draw something, write your name and/or write ""My Diary/Journal"". Decorate with stickers or similar, and you can even spray perfume on to give it a special scent.


On the first page, you should write something, if you lose or forget the diary somewhere, to notify those who find it that it is yours, to please return it to you, and to ask them kindly to not go snooping in your private journal. Write down your: Name, E-Mail, and Telephone number but never your address.
On the first page, you can also write down a little about you, like: Age, interest, favorite food, color, music, TV show, and friend. This will remind you in the future of how you were like.

, Write regularly in your Journal or Diary - this does not have to be every day. When something different or exciting happens, write it down. If you feel too tired to write, remember to do so the next day. It's the special days and feelings that counts the most.

, Keep the diary/journal at hand most of the day so you won't forget it at home, school, the park etc. Have it in your bag or similar, and remember a pen, so you can write if you get bored. It's also very good to write down ideas, poems, lyrics or drawings. Having your book on you will make your creativity grow, and keep boredom from taking over your day.

, The idea of a Diary/Journal is fairly simple: Write down whatever you want! What happened today, how you feel, ideas, poems, short stories, anything. It's yours! Diaries can be useful to let out your anger, also. You can also use a journal to take down useful notations about some of your interest, like what animals you have seen, where, what time, and in what condition. Doing this often will give you a chance to overlook a situation, which can be useful.

, In or under your pillowcase, in your desk, anywhere you feel it is safe. Nosy or curious friends/family might want to take a look at your diary, and it's advised not putting it anywhere they might find it.

Remember a good hider is creative.,
Make sure your hiding places are not incredibly complicated to get to.,
Be uncomplicated - don't make it so that you can't find it again.,
Don't place anything you wish to hide near anything that's around/in used heaps.",How to Hide Things in Your Room1," Look around your room for creative hiding places. Innocent looking things are usually best. Note that sock drawers, back of wardrobes and shoe boxes are quite obvious to someone who is looking. Perhaps try looking in someone else's room for stuff and think about where you look.

, People are going to ask questions if, say, a series of loud thumps are coming from your room and that is immediately accompanied by you sneaking off every Tuesday afternoon. Creativeness must have boundaries.

, Try to make it something you'll remember... maybe you could write it down if you had to, but then there's the whole hiding the piece of paper...

, That is just a bad idea.

"
Choose a good book.,
Find a good placement inside the chosen book.,
Remove any signs of disturbance around the shelf.,
Remember the book.",How to Hide Things in a Book1," The following requirements are essential:


The book must be thick to make it harder to spot anything stuffed into it.
It should be inconspicuous. Choose a book that belongs on the shelf amid other books; don't choose one that looks obviously out of place.
Spacious and of adequate size to conceal your goodies. You could hollow out a book but that's more work and is often noticeable. If you're just looking to hide flat things, a normal book works just fine.;
, Try to put your stash about 3 quarters of the way into the book. People will see it in the middle and it'll fall out if it's in the end. And the beginning is just too obvious.

, If you have disturbed any dust or fluff bunnies in doing this, you'll just have to clean the whole shelf or else it will look obvious.

, Work out a way for reminding yourself which book or books you have chosen to hide things in. If you own a lot of books, it is not unknown to forget where you hid that ""money for a rainy day"", only to have a pleasant surprise many years later!

Remnants of childhood are good places to start.,
Phones.,
Another good place for hiding small items is in battery compartments and/or other things like that.,
If you want your room to seem normal, you can hide secret items such as notes or letters or candy in places like inside a picture frame behind the picture, inside the pocket of an old jacket in your closet, or in a fake trash can.,
You can also use your radio.,
A great place to hide something small is to get a waterproof container, available at any dive shop or online.",How to Hide Things in Your Room2," For instance - your Grandmother made you a sewing basket when you were four? Hide your money in there! There's a bunch of children's books in your bookcase? Chuck all secret notes between the pages! A jewelry box you painted when you were six? Hide small candies or money in it! You can even hollow out a big book and hide stuff in there! Here are some other good places people might think to look, but wouldn't expect you to hide stuff there;


Vents (just make sure the stuff won't burn and start a fire when the heater goes on.) Also be careful of dust.
If you have a box of unused stuffed animals, use that!;
, If you have a cell phone with a cover on it, that could be a great hiding place. Just put anything thin like money or notes in between the back of the phone and the cover.


Inside of your desk, behind the drawers.

, For instance, most game systems such as Play Station 2 (the thick one) and Game Cubes have places that open up. You can put things in them.

, If you have an old board game box, you can throw away the stuff inside it and hide your things in there.

, This works if you have one that is plugged into the wall, but one that runs on batteries can do just as well. Most of these either take a few large batteries or many smaller ones. Just take the battery cover off and put whatever small thing you need to hide in there, then close the battery cover back up. Be careful in case you might need to use the radio on batteries. If you know when it'll need to be on batteries, move your stuff prior to use. Also, if it's a hard object, it may rattle inside should the radio be moved. This can arouse suspicion. To test, put the object in, and close it up, then shake the radio a little. If you hear any noise, take the object out and wrap it in some tissue or cloth or something similar, and then replace it in there. Or if you have an old one that doesn't work, take out the insides and place your item in there and then screw the back on again but make sure you don't take off the buttons, otherwise it will be obvious!

, Then bury it in your fish tank, assuming you have one. No one would think to look in your fish tank with all your fish around. Plus there is no chance of any smells getting out for someone to discover. You can also hide rolled up notes in an empty lipstick.

Find a thick and very large book that you won't ever want to read again.,
Open the book.,
Draw a rectangular shape on the next page from the ones flipped over.,
Carefully cut out the rectangular hole with the Exacto knife.,
With the hole now in the book, use an old painting brush to start coating the inside edges of the hole with glue.,
Weight the book down with a few heavy books.,

If you are hiding a diary inside it, measure the ability of the book to cope with this object before cutting it.

, Flip over the first 20-40 pages or so, depending how much room you want inside the book.

, Make it the size you want, leaving an inch (2.5cm) allowance as borders around the hole space, or it will look too obvious when completed.

, Repeat the last two steps if your book is particularly thick.

Make invisible lemon-juice ink.,
Write your note.,
Disguise your note.,
Pass your note.",How to Hide Secret Notes1," Fresh lemon juice goes onto paper clear, but turns dark when heated due to oxidation.Squeeze about half a lemon into a bowl and add a few drops of water. This will be your ink.;
, This is easiest done with a paintbrush or a small cotton pad like a Q-tip. Be careful not to use so much ink that it splashes or soaks the paper, as this will make your note impossible to read.

, Since passing a blank piece of paper would be suspicious, you'll need to hide your note in plain sight. Write an innocuous message on the piece of paper, preferably in a colored ink that will contrast from the dark brown that your message will appear in.

, If your note is intercepted, never fear. It is disguised and the true message will be hidden from prying eyes. The intended recipient can hold the note close to a light bulb or hair dryer for warmth. This will cause the message to appear. "

Make invisible ink from corn starch.,
Write your message.,
Disguise your note.,
Pass your note.,
Decode the note.",How to Hide Secret Notes2," Corn starch ink is used in similar fashion to lemon juice ink, but is a little more complicated. Heat two tablespoons of corn starch and 4 tablespoons of water in a pot over the stove. Stir it into a smooth paste. Heat for 3-4 minutes. This method is harder to detect. Anyone trying to discover your message using heat will be foiled.

, A fine point should be used for this, such as a toothpick or the back of a paint brush. Dip the point into your ink and write your message. When it dries it will look almost completely clear and normal.

, Since passing a blank piece of paper would be suspicious, doodle, sketch, or write an unrelated note on your piece of paper. Preferably this will be done in a color that contrasts with purple (your corn starch ink will appear purple). , Pass your note as you would any other. Try to be discreet so you don't draw attention, but if you are caught it is fine. Anyone scrutinizing the note likely won't know how to unlock the message. Your intended recipient obviously should be informed of the decoding method in advance.

, A mixture of 1 teaspoon of iodine and 10 teaspoons of water is necessary to unlock the note and show the message. Dip a sponge or paper towel in the solution and wring it out so that the sponge or towel is damp, but not dripping wet. Wipe it over the page to cause the note to appear! Don't use a sponge or paper towel that is too wet. It can make the paper soggy and cause the note to run and be illegible!

Open your pen or marker.,
Remove the ink stick or cartridge.,
Hide your note insider.,
Close the pen or marker back up.",How to Hide Secret Notes3," With markers, one of the easiest ways to do this is pry the back (non writing end) off with a staple remover. You can also use a knife, your teeth, or any other implement than can get under the back of the marker. Pens can usually just be unscrewed. This also works (and is often easier) with highlighters.

, Inside of the pen or marker there will be an ink stick. You'll need to remove this. Keep it and place it to the side.

, If you have a larger note, you might just put the note where the ink stick used to be. If it is smaller or if your paper is thin, you can wrap it around the ink stick and replace the ink stick.


If you don't replace the ink stick, you can either discard it or save it for use later.

, Put the part that you unscrewed or pried off back on.Gently try to close it evenly without crushing it. Causing damage to it can make it harder to open. Pass it to the recipient.

Place it under your mattress.,
Hide it in your pillowcase.,
Pack it away deep in your closet.,
Wedge it in between books.,
Put it behind a picture frame.",How to Hide Your Diary from Parents1," Do not place the diary under your mattress if you think it will be turned over or replaced soon. If you don’t think it will be handled anytime soon, slide it under your mattress. To make it even more hidden, lift your mattress and place it under the center of your mattress.Make sure your bed is made when you leave the house. Your comforter should hide your mattress.;
, Slide the diary into your pillowcase when you are finished using it. Put it in the part of the pillowcase that touches your bed. Placing it in the front of the pillowcase will expose the shape of the diary. Make sure to remove it when it comes close to the time your pillowcases need to be washed.If you sleep with more than one pillowcase, you can put it in the pillowcase that you’re not using while you’re sleeping.

, Closets are typically filled with clothes, shoes, and other miscellaneous items. This makes it a great place to hide your diary. The extra stuff in your closet can act as camouflage for it. Put it in an old bag, like a backpack, inside of a jacket you don’t usually wear, or in between some other things that aren’t used often or not used at all. Don’t put it near things you use often because your parents are more likely to go into your closet to retrieve those things for washing or other reasons., If you have a bookcase filled with at least one row of books, put your diary in between two books. Wedge it between two larger books. This way, you won’t see the spine of your diary. This is ideal if you have a diary that looks similar to a book.


Only put your diary between books if the bookshelf is in your room. It is more likely to be discovered in a shared bookshelf., Your parents will likely look through obvious spots first, like your drawers and closet. A picture frame is a less obvious place to look. Look for a picture frame that is larger than your diary. Ideally, look for a frame that has a stand at the bottom or at the corners. Stand the diary up behind the frame.A picture frame that hangs on a wall may not work unless there is space between the back of the frame and the wall.

You can password-protect the document, or hide it in a folder.
If you have phone of your own, you can also use a journaling app. Diaro and Flavo are a couple of apps you can download on your smartphone.
Some websites have a minimum age for signing up. You may have to consult with your parents if you are under thirteen years old.

, Don’t make up a password that can be easily figured out. For example, don’t create a password that contains your name, birthdate, favorite band, or your pet’s name. Think of a password that no one would guess. Choose a random assortment of letters and numbers to be extra cryptic.Make sure your password isn’t automatically saved on the log in page of whatever website you’ve chosen.
Write down the password on a small sheet of paper if necessary. Keep it with you, or hide it in a book or drawer. Don’t write down what it is used for.

, Usernames can often be looked up on journaling websites. To prevent being found, choose a username that has nothing to do with your name, age, or favorite interests. Think of something that no one would suspect. It shouldn’t be vulgar or inappropriate, but it shouldn’t be something your parents would think to type in.


Use random numbers if your username has to include numbers.

, It will be easy to find your journaling website if it shows up in your browser history. If you’re using a shared computer, don’t delete the entire history. Instead, delete only the journaling website. Get rid of your browser history even if you are using your personal computer.To delete browser history, you typically go to whatever browser your using. For example, it might say Firefox, Chrome, or Safari. Then, click on it, go to history, and hit “Clear browsing data, or “Delete browsing history.”
It’s also an option to use a private browsing window. A private browsing window does not save any of your history. The option for a private browsing session will usually be near your browsing on the menu where your history is located.
If it’s not against your parents’ rules, set up a password to get into your computer.

It will make a person with prying eyes think the diary hasn’t been used yet, unless they flip the page a couple of times.You can also choose to write a message on the first page. It can be a warning message, or a message asking for the person to not read the diary.

, Use a code for your journal. This way, if your parents do find it, it will take effort to figure out what has been written. Some common codes to use are Morse and Pigpen cipher. Pigpen cipher exchanges letters for symbols based on a grid design. You can also make up your own code or write in another language that your parents don’t know.Don’t keep a guide to the code near your diary.

, Find a string that won’t be easily noticed. A thin piece of thread will do. A strand of hair will work too. Wrap it around the diary. You can also choose to just wrap it around the lock. You will know that someone has opened or attempted to open the diary if the string has moved or broken.


It is also an option to put a small object, like a pebble, on top of the diary.

, You can use the same fabric or colored paper you used for the front to cover the back if you want a cohesive, beautiful book. Or, you can go radically different on the backside, showing off another facet or your personality to make the book unique.


Keep in mind that the back of your diary will be touching the surface of whatever you are writing on, so it might not stay as clean as the front cover.

, Draw a pattern on the inside, front, or back cover with glue and sprinkle glitter onto the pattern. You can draw glitter hearts, stars, or even write words and cover them with glitter.


If you don't have glitter, you can even use a smudge of eyeshadow to create a shimmering effect.
Draw rainbows, music notes, clouds, puppies, or anything else you like!

Hide your diary keys in the battery compartment at the bottom of a clock.,
Hide your keys behind your drawer.,
Hide your keys in a book.,
Hide your keys under a mattress.,
Hide your keys in your lamp.,
Hide your keys inside of your pillow case on your pillow.,
Hide your diary keys in your shoes.,
Hide your diary keys under a dresser.

,
Roll up your keys in newspapers and tape both ends closed.",How to Hide Diary Keys," This is the last place someone would look to find your diary keys. This is also a very good and simple place to put your keys if you have nowhere else to hide them.


Keep in mind that this only works with battery operated clocks and the standard clock you would put on a shelf, rather than a clock you would hang on a wall. Clocks like these can be found at a local store near you.;
, Tape a small square piece of foam on the back of your drawer. Push a tack into the foam and hang your keys on the tack.


People will only think to check in your drawer rather than behind it, so this is a great way to hide your keys.

, Take an old book (a thick one is recommended). Open up to the center of the book and cut a square in the center of the page, making sure the square is slightly bigger than your key. Do this to the following pages until you have a nice, thick hole in the book to store your key.


Be sure to place a book mark at the opening of the hole so you will be able to easily find the opening where your key is stored.
Do not cut square holes all the way to the back of the book. If you do this, your key will fall out of the book when you try to place the book away. Be sure to save at least 30 untouched pages at the back and front of the book. If you can save more untouched pages, that would help.
If you have an old dictionary, that would be much better to use.

, Lift the tip of the mattress from your bed and tuck your key under it. If you can, tie a piece of thread to the key. Then tuck the key under the mattress, letting the thread hang loose from the side of the mattress. That way it would be easier to pull the key from under the mattress. If you can, use a thicker piece of string so it won't snap.

, At first, this might seem like the most idiotic place to hide diary keys. Really, it isn't.


Push a tack in through the inside of your lamp shade. Hang your keys on the tack inside your lamp. It's that simple!
Make sure that your lamp shade is made of cloth or at least has some type of cloth on it!

,


Be sure that a relative doesn't like to come in and do your laundry for you. This is a very big concern. If you do have someone do your laundry, you might want to skip this step.

,


This sounds like a weird place to hide diary keys, but it does the trick. Find yourself a shoe and put your key in it.
If you want to, stuff some old paper, wrapping, or bubble wrap into the shoe to cover your key.

,, Then store the newspaper somewhere unnoticed, usually places like these:


On a chair in your room
On a window panel
In an old backpack
Poking out from being a pillow.

Pay attention to the initial sounds.,
Pay attention to the beginning syllables.,
Alliterate consecutively and nonconsecutively.,
Distinguish alliteration, assonance, and consonance.,
Alliterate to achieve a humorous effect.,
Alliterate to make a phrase memorable or catchy.,
Alliterate to persuade.",How to Alliterate," Alliteration occurs when the same initial sound is repeated in a phrase.For example:


“Dastardly deception and depravity” all share the same first letter and sound, “d.” This is a classic example of simple alliteration.
Remember, alliteration has to do with sounds and not letters. Therefore, “cracked center” is not alliteration, even though they both share the same first letter. However, “frank phonetics” is alliteration, because they share the same initial sound—an “f” sound.;
, Alliteration can also occur when the same initial syllable is repeated. For example:


“Booming boomsticks boomeranged on the boomtown.” The “boom” sound is repeated throughout. Since more than the initial letter is repeated, this is a more complex example of alliteration.
“Alluring allusions of aloofness” all share the “alu” sound. Remember, the sounds and not the letters create the alliteration.

, Consecutive alliteration, or immediate juxtaposition, occurs when the all of the words with the shared sound occur one after the other, or consecutively. Nonconsecutive alliteration, or non-immediate juxtaposition, occurs when they are separated.For instance:


“Dunkin Donuts” is consecutive alliteration, while “do or die” is nonconsecutive.

, Alliteration only refers to shared initial sounds and syllables. When the shared sounds occur later in the word, they are either assonance or consonance.Assonance describes repeated vowel sounds.“Row the boat slow” is an example of assonance, because the words share the “o” sound.
Consonance describes repeated consonant sounds.“Pick a book of jokes” is an example of consonance, because the words share the “k” sound.
Assonance, consonance, and alliteration can all be combined in various ways. “The cold bowl was sold” is an example of assonance and consonance combined, because they all share the “ol” sound.“Cold coal” is an example of all three combined, because they all begin with the “k” sound and share the “ol” sound.

, Through some quirk of the human thought process, alliteration can create a humorous effect where a non-alliterated phrase would not. It is not clear why this is. For example:


“Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers” is funnier than “Peter the lute player gathered some peppers soaked in vinegar and other miscellaneous spices.”

, Alliterative phrases are more memorable than non-alliterative phrases, which is why so many brand names are alliterative.Examples include:


Coca-Cola
Frosted Flakes
Stanley Steamer
Krispy Kreme

, Alliteration works very well as a persuasive rhetorical device, and shows up in speeches and sales pitches all the time.Some famous examples include:


John F. Kennedy’s inaugural address: “Ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country.”The “y,” “k,” “d,” “w,” “f” and “a” sounds are all repeated. In fact, the only non-alliterated word in the line is “not,” which serves to emphasize the force of the command.
One of the many examples of alliteration in Martin Luther King Jr.’s “I Have a Dream” speech is “I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.”The “c,” “L” “n” and “d” sounds are all repeated.
“The Ballot or the Bullet,” by Malcom X. The “b” sound is repeated.In Franklin Roosevelt’s speech about the bombing of Pearl Harbor, alliteration is used over and over, to great effect.Examples in include a “date which will live in infamy,” with the repetition of the “d” and “in” sounds. Later on in the speech, the phrase “last night, the Japanese forces attacked…” is repeated three times in a row.

Decorate the inside covers with paint or drawings.,
Write messages to yourself throughout the diary.,
Create a simple flip-book in the corner of the pages.,
Stick on some stickers!,
Add a ribbon bookmark.",How to Decorate a Diary2," If you'd like, you can use the same paper you used for the outside cover to glue to the inside. You can also draw, place stickers, or even paint the inside covers, as they are usually a much easier surface to work with. Now that you are working on the inside of your diary, you can decorate it with some of your more personal interests. For example:


Print out a favorite picture of you and your friends and write your full name and the full name of each of your friends under the picture. Draw speech bubbles and write a phrase each of your friends likes to say.
Cut out a picture of a movie star you think is cute and glue it onto the inside cover.

, Write some personal goals that you want to remember each time you open your diary. Like, ""A day without laughter is a day wasted,"" or ""Follow your dreams."" They can be on the inside cover or along the tops of several pages. These little surprises will make it fun to write in your journal, as you'll likely forget some of them by the time you get to that page., Flip books are small drawings on every page. Each page, you slightly move the drawing around. When you flip through the pages quickly, the drawing seems to move, allowing you to animate it. If you're an artistic type, draw a little bit more of your drawing every day you write in the book. When you're done you'll have a full diary as well as your little cartoon.

, Get some stickers from a craft store and stick them anywhere you'd like on your diary. You can even stick them on the diary pages.


You can use puffy stickers, but these work much better on the outside covers of your diary. If you use too many puffy stickers on the inside of the diary, it might not close as well.

, A ribbon will make your diary look more sophisticated. Adding a ribbon to your diary is easy.If you'd like to add a ribbon:


Start with a piece of ribbon about 2.5 inches (6.3 cm) longer than your diary on each side.
Using a bottle of glue with a nozzle, stick the nozzle into the spine opening of your diary and squeeze a small amount of glue inside. Make sure you get a decent sized glob, but don't add so much that the glue will spill out.
Poke your ribbon down that opening. You can use a sewing needle or a sharp pencil to press one end of the ribbon about 1–2 inches (3–5 cm) inside the opening. When you close the diary, the spine will press against the binding of the book enough to hold your ribbon and glue while drying.
Make sure you glue your ribbon to the top of your diary and not the bottom.
Now trim the end of your ribbon into a nice V-point by folding the ribbon in half vertically, and cutting at an angle with sharp scissors.

"
"
Gather your supplies.,
Punch a hole close to the edge of the notebook, halfway down.,
Thread your ribbon through the holes.,
Line up the ribbon so both sides meet.,
Twist the ribbon around so that the knot is closest to the hole.,
Add your padlock.",How to Decorate a Diary3," If you want to keep your diary top secret and make sure no one gets inside it, you can add a lock to your journal if it doesn't have one already. If you want to make a diary lock, you will need:


A hole punch
A short piece of ribbon or thin piece of leather (long enough to go all the way around your diary)
Tape
Scissors
A diary lock.

, Do this on the front and the back cover of the book. If you want to close your diary with a lock, you will need these holes to close your diary with a lock later.

, Flip your diary over to the back cover and thread the ribbon through the hole on the back cover first. This way, your lock will close at the front of your diary.

, Tie a knot at the end at the back and cut off any excess ribbon.

, Tape it down, flip the diary over to the front cover, and bring the ribbon over.

, To lock your notebook, thread the ribbon into the hole from inside the cover and out the front. Slide your lock into the loop you have created.


Make sure you keep your key somewhere secure so that only you can find it!

Take out an ad online.,
Introduce yourself.,
Be clear on what your book will be about.,
State how you intend to publish the book.,
Let the writer know your project budget.,
Describe any other requirements you have.,
Inform writers of your time frame (if any).,
Let writers know how much you already have done.,
Be crystal clear on what you need.,
Be cautious of spammers.",How to Advertise for a Ghostwriter," Craigslist.org is free and there are other sites or writing communities where you can post your ad for a nominal fee.;
, Be personable. Visualize yourself telling the writer who you are and why you're writing a book. You don't have to use sensitive information, just a first name and a quick bio will do.

, In 1-2 sentences, tell the writer what kind of book it is (memoir, autobiography, how-to, romance thriller), what genre it is (fiction, non-fiction), and who you're writing it for (teenage girls, men over 35, dessert-lovers,etc).

, Research and decide whether you want to self-publish or publish traditionally. It is good for the writer to know regarding your financial arrangements.

, If you don't have one, check out other articles on how to publish a book to get an idea of how much investment writing and publishing a book will require.

, Doing this can filter out unqualified writers to save yourself time. For example, you may have requirements based on location, gender, topic familiarity, and so on. Be clear about these upfront.

, The time it takes to write a book varies. An informational e-book can take 1-3 months where a full-length novel can take 6-12 months or more.

, Have you already written an outline? Do you have material in blogs, websites or journals that you want to use? Or is it all inside your head still? This will determine the feasibility of the time frame and help you figure out potential methods for working together.

, Remember, ghostwriters are solely writers. If you need editing, cover design, formatting or someone to upload your book onto Kindle, those are separate job descriptions, and you may have to seek out people who specialize in them.

, If you're using Craigslist, make sure to avoid spammers by requiring applicants to put a specific headline in the e-mail, like ""Rolling Red Thunder,"" to distinguish who's who in your email inbox.

Identify what needs to be indexed.,
Recognize what not to index.,
Identify what will become your entries.,
Review the entire text and mark any keywords or main topics.,
Organize the main headings in alphabetical order.,
Use nouns, rather than adjectives or verbs, for your index headings.Nouns referring to people, places, objects, or concepts, are the most common type of index header.Singular nouns are appropriate in most cases.,
Create cross references for acronyms and initial-isms.,
Do not attempt to say too much.,

Review your headings to make sure they work with the needs of the reader.,
Identify subentries.,
Use subentries if the same header has more than 5 or 6 locators (e.g., page numbers).,
Punctuate properly.,
Do not include prepositions like ‘a’ ‘an’ and ‘the’ in the subentries.,
List the page numbers on which each subject appears.,
Add synonyms for the key terms.,
Add cross-references.,
Review the index for cohesion and accuracy.,
Proofread the index.,
Format the index.,
Trim the index down, if needed.,
Skim or read the text.,
Determine your indexing source.,
Confirm the length of the index with the publisher.,
Check with the publisher about their style guide.,
Check if you have access to indexing software programs.,
Manage your time, based on your indexing experience.",How to Write an Index," There are several elements that must be indexed in any text, including:The entire text of the book, including the introduction and any content notes
If the footnotes and/or endnotes continue or expand on the text, they should be indexed. However, if the footnotes and/or endnotes are source citations, they should not be indexed.
Depending on the field, you may need to index every author named in the text. Check with the publisher about this requirement. It may appear as a separate author index, or be included in your general index.;
, A good index is selective, not exhaustive. Don't index things that are not central or important concepts or keywords.Avoid indexing minor mentions. For example, if a famous person's name has been mentioned in a quote but is not discussed anywhere else in the text, this person's name is not index-worthy. Ask yourself: is there something substantial to read about the word or concept within the text? If the answer is no, it does not need to be indexed.
Do not include title pages, dedications, epigraphs, lists of illustrations and tables, and acknowledgements in the index.
Do not include glossaries or bibliographies in the index.
Do not index names of people, places, things, or concepts that are only used as examples or brief mentions.
In general, do not index illustrative items like tables, charts, pictures, etc.

, The entries in an index are the major concepts and keywords that a reader is likely to search for in the text. Entries consist of headings (or main headings), subentries, cross-references, and locators.For example, a full entry in an index might look like this: ice cream, varieties of: lemon, 54; Neapolitan, 55; strawberry, 56. See also sorbet.
”Ice cream” is the heading, as it is the overall concept that readers will want to locate. The elements after the colon are the subentries, or varieties of the main heading (in this case, specific types of ice cream). The “see also” element is a cross-reference, as it suggests to readers that additional, similar information can be found in another entry.The locators are the page numbers.
The type of headings your index includes will depend on how specific your text is.For example, a book on bicycle maintenance would likely not use “bicycle” as a header, because it would generate a huge list of results. However, good headers for this book could be a parts of a bike you may need to fix, such as gears, bike wheels, or bike chain. Terms that relate to these key terms, such as spoke key, tire pressure, or lubricant, could also be helpful.
A book on methods of transportation could use “bicycle” as a header, since it is a major type of transportation, and so readers are likely to want to locate it.
A biography's index will always include an entry headed with the name of the person who is its subject, often the longest entry with many sub-headings. People who have been known by more than one name may also have separate pointers to the main entry, for instance ""Blair, Eric Arthur, see George Orwell"".
Keep in mind a long list of terms can actually cause duplicates and confusion, as well as hinder your ability to structure and compile an index. So if possible, ask the author to limit the list of terms to only essential ones.

, Pay particular attention to the section headings, the introductions, conclusions and the overall structure of the text.Aim for about two to three index inclusions per key point and main idea, minimum.
If you are using a word processing program that has indexing features, begin tagging any topics or key terms are you read.You can also sticky notes, index cards, or any type of written shorthand that will help you find terms and topics easily. Look at the text chapter by chapter, section by section, to ensure you have identified all the possible key terms and topics.
While copyediting is not the main purpose of building an index, you will be doing a thorough reading of the text so you may wish to use the opportunity to catch and correct any lingering errors you may have missed.

, If you are using a word processor, the program may be able to perform this step automatically for you.Don’t rely on the indexing capacity of your word processing software to create an index. It will actually create a concordance, which will list all of the words in your text and their page numbers. This is much less helpful than a true index, which is focused to only those topics and keywords that a reader is likely to search for.,

For example, a cookbook might have “ice cream” as a heading, but not “lemon ice cream” or “Neapolitan ice cream.” Those would be subentries.
For proper nouns, such as the “American Revolution,” use all words in the proper noun as the heading. Capitalize proper nouns, but leave everything else lower-case.
List all proper nouns separately: for example, “United States Senate” and “United States House of Representatives” would not be subentries under “United States.”You may also use a noun phrase, although you should usually invert it to put the term that the reader is searching for first. For example, “adjusting-height saddle” would be inverted to “saddle, adjusting-height.”, If your keywords will include acronyms, list the acronym and include a cross-reference to the full term.

For example: MTB, see mountain bike

, Good headers are clear and concise. Perhaps your book about comic books discusses Wonder Woman’s influence on the feminist movement of the 20th century. “Wonder Woman’s influence on the feminist movement of the 20th century” would not be a good header: it is long and unwieldy. You have a couple of options in this situation:Put this as a subentry under the header “Wonder Woman,” like so: Wonder Woman: and feminism, 24-48.
Put this as a subentry under the header “Feminism,” like so: Feminism: and illustrators, 45-50; influence of Wonder Woman, 24-48.

, It’s important to remember you are creating an index that will make it easier for the reader to search for key terms or topics they will intuitively want to look for.Look over the headings and consider if there are any key terms or topics that may be confusing for the reader and simplify or adjust any of the headings.
For example, a bicycle maintenance text might discuss derailleurs, but a reader who is new to bicycle maintenance may not know this term and look for more common terms like ""gearshift"" or ""shifter.""

, Once you have your headers, you will need to figure out whether those keywords or concepts need to be broken down into subentries. In some cases, such as a single recipe in a cookbook, you won’t need subentries. In many cases, you will need them. Subentries should be as concise and informative as possible.The most common reason to use subentries is to form subdivisions within big categories.For example, if you have a cookbook to index, you might have “soups, cold” and “soups, hot” as headers, and specific recipes as subentries within those headers. Place a colon after the header, and then list the subentries in alphabetical order (excluding conjunctions), with their locators. For example:
soups, hot:

beef stew, 17; chicken noodle, 12; mulligatawny, 15; split pea, 13.



, For example, if you were writing a political science textbook, “capitalism” is likely a header that readers will search for. It probably also has a variety of mentions with different contexts, so offering subentries that are more specific will help your readers locate the mention most relevant to their needs.Place a colon after the header, and then list the subentries in alphabetical order (excluding conjunctions), with their locators.
For example: capitalism: 21st century,164; American free trade, 112; backlash against, 654; expansion of, 42; Russia, 7; and television, 3; treaties, 87.
You can use both kinds of subentries in the same index., Separate subentries from the header with a colon (ice cream: lemon, 54). Separate subentries from each other with semicolons (ice cream: lemon, 54; Neapolitan, 55; strawberry, 56). Use a comma between each subentry and its locator (lemon, 54)., As well, as a general rule, use ‘and’ sparingly at the beginning of a subentry as it will reduce the reader’s ability to quickly scan the index for a term or topic.You can usually ignore any symbols, hyphens, slashes or numbers in the subentry terms.
Do not repeat main terms in subentries If several subentries contain the same key word, they can be added in a separate header under the keyword, with a cross-reference back to the original header.
If you are using a word processor with indexing software, the subentries can be set to recognize three classes of characters: letters, Arabic numerals, and symbols., Publisher guidelines vary, but in general, you can use the Chicago Manual of Style as a guide to locators.If the first locator number is 1-99, use all the digits for the second locator: 3-10, 99-104
If the first locator number is 100 or multiples of 100, use all the digits for the second locator: 100-109, 200-255
If the first locator number is 101-109 (or multiples), use only the changed numbers: 401-9
If the first locator number is 110-199 (or multiples), use the changed numbers as necessary: 223-58, 112-18
You can use the word passim to indicate that references are scattered over a range of pages: capitalism, 45-68 passim. This is best reserved only for when there are a large number of references in a section.If you have access to a PDF version of the text, use the PDF search feature to ensure you have located every occurrence of a term and have the correct page numbers for each term.

, Consider your audience and the terms they will be more familiar with, especially if you are indexing a beginners manual or guide to a topic.For example, a beginner cyclist may refer to patches on their tires as “tire patches”, when in fact in cycling terms, a tire patch is actually called a “boot”. So it may be important to include both terms so it is easy for a beginner cyclist to look up this information., Cross-references will direct the reader to topics that relate to a specific topic, or offer additional information.“See” cross-references tell the reader to look for a different header, such as “Cycle. See Bicycle”. “See also” cross-references offer additional or related information.

Use the subentries to create “See also” cross-references. Italicize both words, and capitalize “See”.
Separate multiple cross-references with semicolons (See also saddle; kickstand).Ensure the cross-references match the exact wording of the headings.
For example: “Bicycle: maintenance, 4; purchasing, 8; saddles, 22; tires, 16. See also Tricycle”

, Check all headings and subentries to ensure they highlight the key terms and topics in the text.

Go through the text and check it against the index to ensure all major topics and concepts have been covered.
If you used a word processor to create the index, double check that the program hasn't indexed an entire sentence from a section header that has no helpful referencing point. For example, a header might be called ""Repairing bicycles isn't easy"" and the computer index might add the whole phrase. This doesn't tell the reader anything helpful in terms of specificity of words or concepts, so it needs to be broken down into heading and subentry.

, Review the index line by line for any spelling or grammar mistakes.Do not include final punctuation on any line of the index.The spelling in the index should always reflect the spelling found in the author’s text.
Proofing a hardcopy of the index is usually more effective than doing it on a computer screen.
If you are using indexing software, it will have a spell check that can be customized, but checking the hard copy version is also a good idea to ensure you have caught any errors.
Ensure all page number or locators are correct. Carry out a spot check of each page entry to make sure they match correctly.

, Once the index has been edited and proofread, it should be formatted to the dimensions required by the publisher.

In printed works, the indexes are usually set with a smaller font than the main text. So if the main text is twelve point, the index will likely be set at eight or ten point.
The index is usually set in two columns. For large format books, the indexes may be set in three or four columns.
Make sure the index entries are indented properly and consistent throughout.
If possible, have someone try out the index who is unfamiliar with the work.

, If the index seems too long or you are told by a publisher that is it too long, edit or rephrase headings and subentries to shorten them.

Keep in mind minor or trivial entries can often be deleted, as well as some cross-references and acronyms.

, It's best to have some familiarity with the subject you're indexing, so that you know what terms or concepts are important in the text. If you didn't write the work you're indexing, do some skimming or pre-reading before diving in to ensure you are aware of the key terms and concepts in the work.If the text is not yet complete, you can still begin the process of building an index as long as the text has most of its final structure.
If you're collecting page numbers by hand, finish editing and modifying the text first, as an edit could push a particular section or subject onto another page.

, Maybe you are going to be using page proofs to do your indexing, or a printed PDF of the original document, or you may feel comfortable indexing directly from the computer screen. The method you choose will depend on what type of text you are indexing and whether you prefer having hard copies in front of you as you index or are fine working off a screen.If you are indexing a printed book, you must use the final page proofs, in the final layout, to create the index. If the pagination is not final and you don’t use the final page proofs, you may end up having to re-index the entire book.
Using a searchable PDF version of the text will prevent you from accidentally deleting or altering the book’s text or layout. It will also make it easy for you to search additional occurrences of words or phrases elsewhere in the book, ensuring a comprehensive listing of entries.
You may prefer to just index directly from the computer screen, rather than a marked up hard copy, but it may be more difficult for you to comprehend the text on screen and to locate keywords and concepts in the text. So perhaps avoid this method if you are indexing a complex or very long book.

, Before you start to compile the index, you need to know how many pages the publisher has allotted for the index, and how the index is going to be laid out.Many variables can affect the length of an index, such as the average number of index entries per a page, as well as the typography and layout of the index. So discuss these details with the publisher.

, It’s important you understand the style requirements from the publisher of the text so you then know how to format the index.The primary style guide is the Chicago Manual of Style, 16th edition. However, certain publishers may have preferences for page numbers, alphabetizing, handling of headings, pictures, tables and figures in the text, etc. So always discuss these details with the publisher, if possible, before you start indexing.

, Most professional indexers use software to automate certain tasks, but these programs can be expensive and take time to learn and master.Don’t worry too much if you don’t have access to indexing software as you can also use a word processing program like Microsoft Word to enter terms and page numbers.
A word processor with an indexing tool can keep track of the page numbers for you and update the index automatically if the text changes.

, Keep in mind indexing is a time consuming process. How much time you spend on indexing will depend on how experienced you are at indexing. So be prepared to spend a certain number of hours or days on the index, depending on the text, and plan your time accordingly.For example, a 300 page text may take an experienced indexer 7 days to complete and a beginner indexer 2 weeks to complete."

Did the author, speaker, or those involved in the experience fail to address any important issues? Could a certain fact or idea have dramatically changed the impact or conclusion of the reading, lecture, or experience?
How do the issues or ideas brought up in this reading, lecture, or experience mesh with past experiences or readings? Do the ideas contradict or support each other?

, A typical reflection paper is between 300 and 700 words long.


Verify whether or not your instructor specified a word count for the paper instead of merely following this average.
If your instructor demands a word count outside of this range, meet your instructor's requirements.

,


For a reading or lecture, indicate what you expected based on the title, abstract, or introduction.
For an experience, indicate what you expected based on prior knowledge provided by similar experiences or information from others.

, At the end of your introduction, you should include a single sentence that quickly explains your transition from your expectations to your final conclusion.


This is essentially a brief explanation of whether or not your expectations were met.
A thesis provides focus and cohesion for your reflection paper.
You could structure a reflection thesis along the following lines: “From this reading/experience, I learned...”

, Your body paragraphs should explain the conclusions or understandings you reached by the end of the reading, lesson, or experience.


Your conclusions must be explained. You should provide details on how you arrived at those conclusions using logic and concrete details.
The focus of the paper is not a summary of the text, but you still need to draw concrete, specific details from the text or experience in order to provide context for your conclusions.
Write a separate paragraph for each conclusion or idea you developed.
Each paragraph should have its own topic sentence. This topic sentence should clearly identify your major points, conclusions, or understandings.

, Your conclusion should succinctly describe the overall lesson, feeling, or understanding you got as a result of the reading or experience.


The conclusions or understandings explained in your body paragraphs should support your overall conclusion. One or two may conflict, but the majority should support your final conclusion.

, A reflection paper is somewhat personal in that it includes your subjective feelings and opinions. Instead of revealing everything about yourself, carefully ask yourself if something is appropriate before including it in your paper.


If you feel uncomfortable about a personal issue that affects the conclusions you reached, it is wisest not to include personal details about it.
If a certain issue is unavoidable but you feel uncomfortable revealing your personal experiences or feelings regarding it, write about the issue in more general terms. Identify the issue itself and indicate concerns you have professionally or academically.

, A reflection paper is personal and objective, but you should still keep your thoughts organized and sensible.


Avoid dragging someone else down in your writing. If a particular person made the experience you are reflecting on difficult, unpleasant, or uncomfortable, you must still maintain a level of detachment as you describe that person's influence. Instead of stating something like, “Bob was such a rude jerk,” say something more along the lines of, “One man was abrupt and spoke harshly, making me feel as though I was not welcome there.” Describe the actions, not the person, and frame those actions within the context of how they influenced your conclusions.
A reflection paper is one of the few pieces of academic writing in which you can get away with using the first person pronoun “I.” That said, you should still relate your subjective feelings and opinions using specific evidence to explain them.
Avoid slang and always use correct spelling and grammar. Internet abbreviations like “LOL” or “OMG” are fine to use personally among friends and family, but this is still an academic paper, so you need to treat it with the grammatical respect it deserves. Do not treat it as a personal journal entry.
Check and double-check your spelling and grammar after you finish your paper.

, A clear, well-written paper must have clear, well-written sentences.


Keep your sentences focused. Avoid squeezing multiple ideas into one sentence.
Avoid sentence fragments. Make sure that each sentence has a subject and a verb.
Vary your sentence length. Include both simple sentences with a single subject and verb and complex sentences with multiple clauses. Doing so makes your paper sound more conversational and natural, and prevents the writing from becoming too wooden.

, Transitional phrases shift the argument and introduce specific details. They also allow you to illustrate how one experience or detail directly links to a conclusion or understanding.


Common transitional phrases include ""for example,"" ""for instance,"" ""as a result,"" ""an opposite view is,"" and ""a different perspective is.""

, You can incorporate information you learned in the classroom with information addressed by the reading, lecture, or experience.


For instance, if reflecting on a piece of literary criticism, you could mention how your beliefs and ideas about the literary theory addressed in the article relate to what your instructor taught you about it or how it applies to prose and poetry read in class.
As another example, if reflecting on a new social experience for a sociology class, you could relate that experience to specific ideas or social patterns discussed in class.

Think about how they sell to their audience.,

Make use of more than one picture with contrasting messages.,
Use a suitable number of words.,
Convey a message.,
Use satire and irony.,
Use a string of rhetorical questions.,
Use a twist in the tail.,
Use a software to recreate a logo.,
Get creative with the wording.",How to Adbust an Advertisement," Most advertisements only appeal to a specific group of consumers, which may be a particular age group, education level, country of residence, gender, income range or even sexuality. This is especially important as your spoof ad could not appeal to everyone, just like every advertisement.
, It is usually helpful to carefully find out their targeted audience by the presence of colloquial language, their platform of advertising, or the details in the images used. For example, cigarette suppliers evidently target an age group from teenagers to young adults., When choosing the perfect fitting picture, you should keep the original advertisement's target customer in mind. Teens and young adults tend to appreciate humour and follow trends set by celebrities, in other words, the definition of ‘cool’ is what you have to appeal to. They also respond to peer pressure, therefore by successfully influencing a small number of teens would allow you to reach into their whole community., If you use 2 pictures that contrast each other, the idea conveyed through the spoof ad would leave a deeper impression on the audience. Do you want to demonstrate to the audience the harm of the product? Or maybe you are looking to deter them from consuming the product? Continually check back to the target consumer – will they respond to this spoof ad? A carefully created or chosen picture would allow you to deliver your message while scaling down the amount of words you use.

For example, if you are adbusting a cigarette ad, you can put one picture that appeals to the teenagers on how smoking improves their self-esteem but another one to bring out the potential damages to the human body and can be brought along when smoking.

, After inserting an image, you must come up with a body copy. Keep in mind the amount of words used in the original advertisement, and use a similar amount of words in your spoof ad. Fast food restaurants and modern ads tend to have a shorter body copy while cigarette ads and the traditional ads usually bear a longer and more detailed one., As adbusting is supposed to deliver the opposite message from the original advertisement, make sure that you use facts to back up your message to overcome the one brought by the original advertisement. However, make sure that your use of facts doesn’t bore your audience or else you would fail to deliver your message., In order to leave a deeper impression on your target audience, you must find out the problems or debatable potholes present in the original advertisement or the product itself. Then, aiming at these flaws, mock them by using irony or satire. This would allow you to distinguish yourself from the original ads and to point out their weaknesses in a stylish and classy way while promoting the opposite idea of the original advertisement., Apart from irony and satire, introduce a string of 3 to 4 rhetorical questions into your spoof ad. The questions may be used to reinforce of challenge certain knowledge or ideology that prevails in society. It may also be to appeal to the self-esteem of your audience or to challenge them. This can help lure the audience into thinking for themselves the conveyed message and helps your spoof ad achieve its desired effects., Throughout the whole body copy, avoid mentioning the name or detail of the product that you are adbusting. In the last sentence or towards the end of the body copy, reveal to your audience that you are in fact adbusting the advertisement and are deterring them from consuming the product. The building up in the body copy is all down to this last sentence to provide a final show of hand to deliver your message., A picture says a thousand words, and if a logo is effective, it can render text unnecessary. Include a Photoshopped logo of the brand you are adbusting., Ideally, you should change the words in the original ad to words of a similar spelling, pronunciation or even homophones. But bear in mind that the words must have a negative meaning, which contrasts from the usually positive words used in the brand names."

Submit your article by the deadline.",How to Write a Feature Article," Read the news and talk to people to find interesting stories. Think about what phenomena are happening and how you can talk about them in a new and innovative way.;
, Finding out background information can help you figure out an angle and identify subjects to interview. Doing online research is good, but it may only get you so far. You may also need to consult books to make sure you are fully aware of the issues surrounding a topic. A historical article may require a visit to an archive.

, There are a number of ways to write a feature, depending on what you want to focus on. Some of these include:



Human Interest: Many feature stories focus on an issue as it impacts people. They often focus on one person or a group of people.

Profile: This feature type focuses on a specific individual’s character or lifestyle. This type is intended to help the reader feel like they’ve gotten a window into someone’s life. Often, these features are written about celebrities or other public figures.

Instructional: How-to feature articles teach readers how to do something. Oftentimes, the writer will write about their own journey to learn a task, such as how to make a wedding cake.

Historical: Features that honor historical events or developments are quite common. They are also useful in juxtaposing the past and the present, helping to root the reader in a shared history.

Seasonal: Some features are perfect for writing about in certain times of year, such as the beginning of summer vacation or at the winter holidays.

Behind the Scenes: These features give readers insight into an unusual process, issue or event. It can introduce them to something that is typically not open to the public or publicized.

, As you brainstorm story ideas, think about who will read these stories. Ask yourself questions such as Who will be my readers? and What kinds of angles appeal to these readers? For example, you might write a profile about a pastry chef, but you’ll write differently depending on if your readers are aspiring chefs or if they are wedding planners looking to buy a wedding cake., If you are writing for a magazine or blog with a very specific topic, such as gardening, then you will likely need to tailor your feature article to reflect that interest in some way. A newspaper, on the other hand, is meant for a more general audience and may be more open to varied content.

, Ask your interviewee to tell you when and where the best place is for them to meet. If they give you a choice, ask for a quiet place where you will be relatively undisturbed for the duration of the interview.


Schedule about 30-45 minutes with this person. Be respectful of their time and don’t take up their whole day. Be sure to confirm the date and time a couple of days ahead of the scheduled interview to make sure the time still works for the interviewee.
If your interviewee needs to reschedule, be flexible. Remember, they are being generous with their time and allowing you to talk with them, so be generous with your responses as well. Never make an interviewee feel guilty about needing to reschedule.
If you want to observe them doing a job, ask if they can bring you to their workplace. Asking if your interviewee will teach you a short lesson about what they do can also be excellent, as it will give you some knowledge of the experience to use when you write.

, Do research ahead of time to ensure that you are asking the most compelling questions. Have a long list of questions to keep the conversation flowing. Know your interview subject’s background and experience, as well as their views on the subject that you’re interviewing them about.

, The direction of the interview should not be a surprise to the interviewee. Giving them the questions before the interview will help them be able to give more thoughtful answers.

, Your interviewee’s time is valuable, so you don’t want to waste the appointment rushing in and catching your breath. Get to the interview site early. Set up your audio recording equipment and test it out. Make sure you have extra pens and paper.

, Use an audio recorder for the interview, but take notes throughout as well. There is always the possibility that your recorder will run out of batteries or memory.


Be sure to ask your interviewee if it’s okay to audio-record the interview. If you plan to use the audio for any purpose other than for your own purposes writing up the article (such as a podcast that might accompany the feature article), you must tell them and get their consent.
Don't pressure the interviewee if they decline audio recording.

, You don’t want to write a lengthy feature about a person only to find out that you’ve spelled their name wrong. Make sure you double-check the spelling of their name, as well as other details that are important to the story.

, Questions that rely on yes or no answers will not give you very rich information. Instead, ask questions that start with “how” or “why.” These types of questions give the interviewee a chance to tell a story, relate details or give their opinion.


Another good option is a question that begins Tell me about a time when.... This allows the interviewee to tell you the story that's important to them, and can often produce rich information for your article.

, Listening is a key component of a good interview. Don’t give too many of your own observations, but do react to what they are telling you by smiling or nodding. People are more likely to continue talking when their audience is receptive.

, Part of being a good interviewer is determining when someone is finished talking about a particular subject and when it will be helpful to prompt them for further discussion. You can also use your follow up questions to make connections between ideas.

, Make observations and notes immediately when you’re finished with the interview when it is fresh in your mind. These might be observations about the location, what the person looked like, what they were doing or how they were carrying themselves.

, Transcribing, or typing out the entire interview, can be a tedious task. It is essential for getting quotes correct, however, and it can be very helpful to be able to read what your interviewee said. Do this yourself or pay someone to transcribe for you.

, Thank them for their time, and give them an idea of when to expect the article about them. This is also a chance when you can ask a few follow-up questions if you find you need more information.

, Feature articles do not have a particular formula the way hard news articles do. You don’t need to follow the “inverted pyramid” style of writing that conveys the “who, what, where, when and why” of a news story. Instead, choose a more inventive way to write a story. Some possible formats may include:


Start by describing a dramatic moment and then uncover the history that led up to that moment.
Use a story-within-a-story format, which relies on a narrator to tell the story of someone else.
Start the story with an ordinary moment and trace how the story became unusual.

, Newspaper feature stories run between 500 and 2,500 words, while magazine features run from 500 to 5,000 words. Blog features run from 250 to 2,500 words.


Check with your editor to see how long they would like your article to be.

, Start piecing together your article by reviewing your notes, selecting quotes, and drafting a structure for the article. Start with your introduction and decide how you want to build the article. What information do you want to reveal first? As you get to the conclusion, think of the overall theme or lasting impression you want to leave with the reader.Consider what you absolutely must have in the story and what can be cut. If you are writing a 500-word article, for example, you will likely need to be very selective about what you include, whereas you have a lot more space to write in a 2,500 word article.

, Your first paragraph is your chance to hook your reader and draw them into your story. If the opening paragraph is dry or difficult to follow, you will lose your reader and they won’t continue on to the rest of your story.


Start with an interesting fact, a quote, or an anecdote for a good hook.
Your opening paragraph should only be about 2-3 sentences.

, While your lead might draw people in, your second paragraph (and subsequent paragraphs) need to start explaining the reason for the story. Why are we reading this story? What is important about it?

, You’ve drafted your article in outline form, which can help you stay on track to building a good feature article. The outline can also help you remember how details connect to each other and how quotes support certain points that you’re making.


Be flexible, however. Sometimes when you write, the flow makes sense in a way that is different from your outline. Be ready to change the direction of your piece if it seems to read better that way.

, By writing a feature article, you have the chance to describe people and scenes to the reader.Describe a setting or person so that the reader can clearly envision it in their mind.

, While it can be tempting to include the interviewee’s own words in the story, don’t rely too much on quoting them. Otherwise, this becomes more of a straightforward interview. Write around their quotes to give them context, build the story and help the reader interpret what the interviewee is saying.

, Consider the target audience of the publication for which you are writing and write to their level and interest. Do not assume they are familiar with what you’re talking about, so you may need to explain certain things. Be sure to spell out acronyms and explain jargon or slang. Write in a style that is more conversational, rather than stiff and academic., A feature article is a piece that conveys information and detail about a person or phenomenon. It is not an opportunity for you to give your opinion on a topic. Rather, your personality is conveyed through your writing style., Once you finish writing, put the article away for a day to get some distance from it. Come back to it when you are fresh and read through it all the way. Think of ways to sharpen descriptions, clarify points and streamline explanations. What areas do you need to cut out? What areas need additional information?

, The last thing you want to do is write an article that does not have accurate details or information. Double-check how names are spelled, the order of events, and other pertinent details.

, Not all feature writers do this, and in fact, some may argue that this can detract from the journalistic quality of a piece. But many subjects often want to see their article before it is printed in order to make sure they feel they are represented properly and fairly.


You can choose to incorporate or not incorporate their suggestions.

, Do not detract from your feature article with misspelled words and poor grammar. Consult ""The Elements of Style,"" which is the standard for proper grammar usage.Consult ""The Associated Press Stylebook"" for style guidelines, such as how to format numbers, dates, street names, and so on., Ask a friend or colleague to read through the article. Your editor will also give you feedback. Be open to this feedback and don’t take it personally. They want you to write a good, solid article, and will give you advice on how to change, clarify or expand on what you’ve already written in order to make the best article possible.

, Your publication might write headlines for you, but if you want the initial entry into the article to be reflective of your content, write a headline that does so. The headline is short and to the point, using no more than about 10-15 words, if that. A headline should be action-oriented and should convey why the story is important. It should grab the reader and draw them into the article.If you want to convey slightly more information, write a sub-headline, which is a secondary sentence that builds on the headline.

, Make sure your article is submitted to your editor or to the publication on or before the deadline. Late articles usually do not get printed, and then all of your hard work will either be delayed until the next issue or not published at all.

Carefully read their note(s).,
Consider any gifts that your admirer has given you.,
Consider when and where your admirer contacted you.,
Respond and gather more information.,
Look for patterns.",How to Find Your Secret Admirer1," If you received a physical note, like a handwritten letter in your locker, or a note left in your backpack, you can consider clues like the location, the timing, the handwriting, and the tone. If your admirer has approached you online through an anonymous email or a chat message, you will need to consider clues like the screen name or email address, the tone and content of the message, and the timing.


If the note is handwritten, look at the handwriting on it. Compare the handwriting with the writing of people that you know. Think about your friend, your crush, or the person who sits next to you in English class.
If you have gotten an email or chat message from someone that you don't know, look at the email address or screen name. The person may not have used a personal account to send you the message, but you might be able to draw clues from the name that he or she chose.;
, Perhaps you received a bouquet of flowers, a bag of your favorite candy, or a mix CD. You can use clues from the gift to figure out who gave it to you.


If your secret admirer gave you a plate of fresh cookies, they probably likes to bake. Think about the people you know—especially anyone that you suspect might have a crush on you—and whether or not they like to bake.
If your secret admirer gave you a mix CD, they probably care a lot about music. Think about the music lovers in your life. Keep an eye out for people who are always humming, or who always have headphones plugged into their ears. Think about the songs on the mix: they probably include some of your admirer's favorite songs, so you might be able to identify him or her by her music taste.
If your secret admirer bought you something from a store, consider just asking the clerk who bought that item.

, Think about who would have been able to send the message at the time that it was sent. Think about who would've had access to the place that you found a note or gift. Piece together the circumstances to give yourself a clearer picture of how your admirer operates.


If your secret admirer left a note in your locker at school, there's a good chance that he or she goes to your school and has seen you using your locker. If your secret admirer left a gift at your house, he or she either knows you well or found out your address from someone else.
If you suspect that a specific person is your secret admirer, but they were home sick from school on the day that you found the note, then that person may not be the admirer. He or she may, however, have asked a friend to place the note. The note may also have been planted a day or two before you found it.

, If you received an anonymous email or chat message, reply to the message and try to strike up a conversation. If someone left a handwritten note for you, consider leaving a note of your own in the same place in case your admirer finds it.


Get to know your admirer via chat or email. Ask questions. Without being pushy, try to get your admirer to reveal his or her true identity.
Avoid leaving personal notes out where anyone could find them. Not only does this reduce the chances of your admirer actually finding the note, but it opens up the possibility of someone else finding the note and using that information to mess with you.

, How does your admirer write? How does he or she usually contact you? Does he or she have any quirks (e.g. figures of speech, unique spellings, references) that might help you identify him or her? Think about people you know that display those traits. Your admirer might not realize that he is giving himself away by using words that he uses in real-life conversations.


Does your admirer say a certain word or phrase a lot? For example, maybe he or she says ""awesome"" a lot during your chats, or maybe uses the word ""totally"" to emphasize points in a handwritten note. Think about people you know who use that phrase often.
Does your admirer make spelling mistakes? If you can identify any, do you know anyone who makes those spelling mistakes? For example, you might notice that a friend of yours always misspells ""definitely"" as ""definetely.""

Look around you.,
Ask around.,
Consider confronting your admirer.,
Be tactful.,
Respect your secret admirer's privacy.,
Accept or turn down your admirer.,
Don't get too emotionally invested.",How to Find Your Secret Admirer2," Is there anyone who is talking to you more than normal or looking at you in a flirty way? Is there someone who acts awkward around you but looks like they're trying to hide it?


Try to notice whether anyone has been staring in your direction a lot. If so, pay a little bit more attention to them. Look into their eyes and give a sly smile. If this person shows any more signs of attraction, he or she might be your admirer.

, Create a web of information to help you find your secret admirer more quickly. Reach out to your friends for help, and see if they can give you any clues. Even if they don't outright know who your admirer is, they might have heard some gossip that points you in the right direction. Be careful who you tell about your secret admirer—some friends might take the opportunity to give you unreliable information, to gossip about your situation, or even to forge ""secret admirer"" notes of their own.


If someone left a note or delivery at your doorstep, ask your neighbors if they saw the deliverer. If so, ask for the deliverer's physical appearance.

, If you think you have found your secret admirer, the surest way to know is to ask. It may be better to ask and be wrong than to not ask and never know. Keep in mind that if your admirer is keeping her identity a secret, she is probably shy about talking to you directly. Don't confront this person loudly, in public. Be gentle, tactful, and open-minded.


Look at their eyes when you ask. See if you can spot any visible changes. Do you see the person's pupils getting smaller? Any signs of blushing or flushing, or the maybe-admirer moving his or her head back slightly?
If the person repeatedly denies that they are your secret admirer, then they're probably telling the truth. Do not push them. Keep looking.

, You don't need to flat-out ask ""Do you like me?"" Try something more subtle, like ""I've been finding these really sweet notes in my locker this week, with the most beautiful drawings on them. Do you know anything about that?"" Try asking your suspected admirer questions, face-to-face, that might reveal him or her as your admirer. If your admirer added you on social media, ask the suspect whether he or she uses that site. If your secret admirer draws you pictures, ask the suspect whether he or she likes to draw.

, Consider why your admirer chose to keep his or her identity a secret. Your secret admirer may be hiding their identity because they are not free to admire you openly. They could be shy, they could have strict parents, or they could be in another relationship that they are not prepared to risk ruining. It's okay to confront your admirer, but you may not want to be to be too forward. If you are patient, your admirer might reveal his or her identity to you.


Consider whether you really want to know. Deep down, maybe you want them to remain secret so as not to burst the bubble. Sometimes it can be reassuring to have a secret admirer in the background.

, Once you have found your secret admirer, there may be a bit of tension. Your admirer has made his or her feelings clear, so now it's your turn to reveal whether or not you feel the same way. If you like your admirer, get to know each other. Consider asking them out or waiting for them to ask you out. If you are not interested, you will need to be clear about your feelings so that your admirer knows it's time to back off.


If your secret admirer is not who you had hoped, be kind and turn them down gently. They will probably admire you even more for your honesty. Be direct and straightforward. Don't play with their emotions.

, Maybe you will find your secret admirer, you'll fall in love, and you'll live happily ever after. Right now, however, you don't know anything about them. Your secret admirer might be someone that you don't want to get involved with. He or she might even be your friend or sibling playing a prank! Do your best to find your secret admirer, but don't take it too seriously until you know who you're dealing with.


If you are patient, there's a good chance that your secret admirer will get over the shyness and reveal him or herself. You may be the object of their affection, but that doesn't mean that you're obligated to go seek them out.
Try to not to build up a fantasy in your head. Your admirer could be anyone, and you don't want to get your feelings hurt if he or she doesn't turn out to be the person you expect.

For example, it would be appropriate to ask questions about ADHD when interviewing a writer whose memoir focuses on her ADHD. When interviewing an author who just happens to have ADHD, it would be inappropriate, because she never put it on the table for discussion. Follow their lead regarding whether it is open for discussion.;
, ""Differently abled,""""diffability,"" and ""handicapable"" are all euphemisms for a term which some disabled people argue shouldn't need to be avoided in the first place.Keep a factual tone and say ""disabled"" or ""has a disability.""


Many people with disabilities do not appreciate political correctness. It comes across as silly, impersonal, and subjective.
Most people with disabilities don't like the word ""challenged"" in regards to disability, such as ""physically challenged.""This is because disabled people are often pressured to overcome their disabilities, even if it's exhausting, painful, or impossible.
""Special needs"" is disliked by many people with disabilities, as it suggests that their needs are extra or non-essential., ""person with Down Syndrome.""Identity-first language uses the disability as an ordinary adjective, e.g. ""blind person.""When writing about an individual, use the language that they prefer, and when writing about a community, use the community's preferred language.


Ask an individual which language they prefer. It is usually (but not always) the same as the general community preference.
The Deaf, Blind, and Autistic communities prefer identity-first language, such as ""Deaf person"" over ""person with deafness""The Bleeding and Blood Disorder community,and the Intellectual and Developmental Disability (IDD) community (excluding autism),prefers person-first language, such as ""person with Hemophilia"" instead of ""Hemophiliac.""
For a community with no clear preference, try using a mix throughout your piece (e.g. both ""disabled people"" and ""people with disabilities"").

, Say ""people with epilepsy"" instead of ""epileptics,"" ""blind people"" instead of ""the blind,"" and ""people with disabilities"" or ""disabled people"" instead of ""the disabled."" Remember that people have disabilities. They are not the disability.


Some people in the Autistic community are fine with being referred to as ""Autistics,"" just as one might refer to ""artists"" or ""blondes."" This is an exception to the rule.Since autism is a spectrum disorder, to say that a person with autism is ""on the spectrum"" is also acceptable.

, ""Tyrell is Blind"") or to refer to a community (e.g., ""Rainbows are a common motif in Autistic culture"").


Disabilities that involve the last name of the person who discover them are usually capitalized (e.g. Down Syndrome).

, Some language has been turned into an insult or is used in dehumanizing ways. These words have adopted derogatory connotations and are best not to use.Instead, name the disability (e.g. ""uses a wheelchair"" or ""has Tourette syndrome"").


Midget/dwarf(some are okay with ""dwarf,"" but generally ""little person"" is best)Invalid, lame
Cripple(d)Defect, deformity, affliction
Mongoloid
Crazy, insane, maniac
Spaz
HandicappedRetard(ed)
Idiot, moron, dumb, or any term that is considered an insult in popular culture

, A non-verbal woman who waves her arms about may be a self-sufficient, talented writer. An articulate man who ""passes"" for non-disabled may have serious trouble caring for himself and holding down a job.. Avoid judging people on how they look or labeling them as either full of unrestricted potential or severely disabled for life. All people with disabilities have both strengths and needs, and neither aspect should be overlooked.


Don't assume that someone has an intellectual disability based on facial expression, motor skills, disability accent, or other disability symptoms.
People with disabilities, notably in Autistic culture, have rejected restrictive labels like ""high-functioning"" and ""low-functioning.""Describe individual needs. For example, instead of ""Hikaru is low-functioning,"" say ""Hikaru is nonverbal and gets assistance with cooking, cleaning, and self care.""

, Most people with disabilities are ordinary people; they get up every morning, eat cereal, travel to school or work, and pass through an ordinary day. Their disabilities do not make their life unlivable. Stick to factual language, such as ""Ahmed has an anxiety disorder."" Avoid terms such as...


""Suffers from""""Struggles with/is fighting""(unless the person says so themselves)
""Confined/Bound to a wheelchair"" (is also inaccurate; some wheelchair users can stand or walk short distances)
""Victim of""""Will never""
""Stricken by""
""Patient"" (unless they actually are receiving treatment in a medical facility)

, If you refer to non-disabled people by last name, then refer to a disabled person by last name.If you refer to everyone by first name, then do the same for people with disabilities. This shows that you respect them as much as you do other people.


For example, if you refer to Angela Ramirez as ""Ramirez"" and Ryan Black as ""Black,"" then you would refer to Jimmy McCoy as ""McCoy,"" not ""Jimmy"" or ""Jim.""
If you refer to Angela Ramirez as ""Angela"" and Ryan Black as ""Ryan,"" then ""Jimmy"" or ""Jim"" would be appropriate.

, It is acceptable by most communities to use both, but ""Accessible"" is preferred.New York in particular has replaced its universal handicap symbol with a redesigned ""mobile"" accessibility image., ""Non-disabled people"" or ""people without disabilities"" is an easy way to describe people who don't have disabilities. Avoid referring to such people as ""normal,"" as this suggests that disabled people are abnormal.

, A common quip in the disability community is ""Nothing about us without us is for us,"" and non-disabled people should not be the sole authorities on disabled people. Ask real people with disabilities for their thoughts and opinions, and whenever possible, ask a person how they prefer to be addressed.


A good organization has many people with disabilities at all levels of membership, and elevates instead of suppresses their voices.

, A distorted form of pity, inspiration porn glorifies a disabled person for being able to do everyday things (e.g., ""It's so incredible that she can walk around on the prosthetic legs she's been using for 15 years""). The purpose is to inspire people without disabilities, or to belittle their ""excuses"" for not doing something a disabled person can achieve.



Living with a disability isn't automatically courageous, special, or superhuman.
This implies that it is unusual for people with disabilities to have talents or skills, or that their abilities are inherently lesser (the assumption being that if a disabled person can do it, anyone can).

, Disabilities are often lifelong, and a disabled person will experience challenges throughout their lives. Individual problems can be overcome, but disability is usually for life.


People cannot ""recover"" from lifelong disabilities; however, they can adapt and gain new skills. It is possible to be successful and disabled at the same time.

, Just like non-disabled people, disabled people have good days and bad days. Someone who uses a wheelchair one day might use a cane the next, and crutches after that. This does not mean they are faking it or ""getting better,"" just that this particular day happens to be easier.


Exhaustion, seizures, stress, lack of sleep, how hard they pushed themselves yesterday, recent flare-ups (e.g. a person with a blood disorder having a minor bleed), and many other things can play a role in how their disability manifests itself.
People may or may not look different when they are having a hard day. Don't assume that they're feeling okay because they look fine, or that their disability equipment (e.g. crutches) is just for show.
The spoon theory describes how many people with disabilities, from chronic pain to depression, need to budget their energy., People with disabilities can be good friends, sons, daughters, lovers, siblings, and spouses. Many are capable of working. All are worthwhile human beings.


Befriending or falling in love with a disabled person isn't an act of charity. The person with a disability has something to contribute to the relationship.
If a disabled child is murdered, treat it the same way you'd treat the murder of a non-disabled child. Don't focus on how ""difficult"" it was to live with the victim, or portray it as a mercy killing or understandable crime., One of the biggest ways to combat ableism is to use empathy. When you write about a given disability, imagine a person with that disability reading your piece. How would they feel about themselves? Would they feel respected or demeaned? Write in a way that shows disabled people that they are respected, they are valued, and they are not alone.


When in doubt, look it up! There are plenty of writers with disabilities online who share their experiences.

Discuss your personal financial plan with your partner.",How to Write a Personal Financial Plan," Assets are things you own that have value, while liabilities are the values of the things you owe.


Assets may include cash or cash equivalents, such as checking and savings accounts; personal property, including equity in a home and/or a car; and invested assets, including stocks, bonds, and pensions.
Liabilities might include current bills and debts such as car loans, home loans, medical debt, credit card debt, or student loans.;
, Total your assets, then subtract your total liabilities from this figure. The resulting number is your current net worth. Your current net worth represents the starting point for your personal financial plan.A positive net worth means that you have more assets than liabilities, a negative net worth means the opposite.

, Create a filing system of your tax returns, bank account statements, insurance policy information, contracts, receipts, wills, deeds, titles, bills, investment plan statements, retirement account statements, pay stubs, employee benefits statements, mortgages and any other type of document that is related to your financial life.

, Doing so will enable you to more carefully study how you currently spend your money — the habits that have led to your current net worth., Personal financial planning revolves around goals. Consider what you want your lifestyle to be like in the present, near future and distant future, then create an outline of your goals that is comprehensive enough to cover every facet of your life:


You may find that your short-, intermediate-, and long-term goals build upon each other — saving $100 a month, for example, toward a house fund may lead toward your long-term goal of purchasing a home.

, Make sure your goals are Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic, and Time-based. Doing so will ensure your goals can move past the ""dream"" stage into actual implementation., How do you feel about money, and why? Why is money important to you? Answering these questions will help you formulate your financial goals. You may find, for example, that money is important to you because you want to have time and resources to pursue your dream of international travel. Knowing this about yourself will help you develop and prioritize your goals., If you have a partner or a family, make your ""personal"" financial plan a ""family"" plan. Doing so will ensure that you share your values and goals with each other and make financial decisions with these shared ideas in mind.You may find that your priorities differ. Engage in careful discussion to reach agreement on compromises that will help you both feel comfortable with your financial future.
Recognize that some people are more financially minded than others. Determine who will be in charge of a household budget, or consider ways to provide for each partner's need to feel some degree of control.

, A goal of backpacking through Europe, for example, might not initially seem financial, but you'll need to acquire resources to make such a trip possible.


Intellectual goals might include furthering your education, participating in leadership retreats, sending your children to college and attending seminars.
Think carefully about the ways in which you plan to produce income, whether this involves continuing or advancing in your current line of work or switching careers altogether.
Lifestyle goals encompass the things you do for fun and entertainment, as well as the things you feel are necessary to the quality of life for which you aim.
Residence goals might include renting, purchasing a home, or relocation.
Consider the lifestyle you want when you retire, and set personal financial planning goals that will provide for a retirement that meets your standards.

, Generally, your options will resolve into two categories: utilizing existing resources in new ways, or generating new income.For each goal, consider whether you should:


Continue the same course of action.
Expand your current situation.
Change your current situation.
Take a new course of action., To save money for that backpacking trip to Europe, for example, you might replace your coffee shop stops with home-brewed coffee and save $20 per week. Alternatively, you might provide child care for a friend one afternoon a week and apply your earnings toward the trip.

, In addition to identifying alternative courses of action within your financial goals, you should consider how your goals interact. You might consider travel a ""lifestyle"" goal, for example, but after careful consideration realize that pursuing the educational goal of studying a foreign language will enable you to travel more cheaply — or even pursue a career as a translator or businessperson working in a foreign country.

, Take your life situation, personal values, and current economic conditions into account.Consider how you feel about where you're currently positioned financially versus where your goals would take you in each of the categories you've considered. Do you see particular deficiencies in one area? Perhaps you should give this area special consideration.
Remain practical. Step-by-step plans will move you toward your goals without leaving you feeling frustrated or defeated by the scope of your agenda.

, An opportunity cost is what you give up when you make a choice.Saving for that backpacking trip by giving up coffee shop visits might include sacrifices of time, planning, and the conversation you enjoy with your favorite barista.

, Gather as much research as you can, and carefully evaluate your data. If you are considering an investment, for example, you should pay special attention to the correlation between risk and reward — how risky is the investment, and how much reward will you receive if it is successful? Are the benefits worth the risks?, The economy may dip, lowering investment concerns. The new job you opt to pursue may leave you personally or professionally unsatisfied. Do your best and remember that you retain the ability to adjust your decisions later.

, Now that you've developed goals, identified alternatives, and evaluated those alternatives, create a list of the strategies you've identified. Consider your current situation and then start thinking about which goals might be most realistic.


Take your current net worth into account. If your liabilities approach or outweigh your current net assets, you'll want to take steps to change that ratio.
While you may opt to focus on developing your net assets, don't forget that paying off debt can be a great investment. Interest charges mean that even paltry debts can become overwhelming over time. Allocating some resources toward debt reduction now may prevent serious problems from developing later., Strive for a balanced approach toward short-, intermediate-, and long-term goals that will enable you to plan for a few months and a few years down the line.


Focus upon incremental growth. By doing so you will create a road map that will take you toward your goals.
Be realistic. You won't be able to adopt all the great strategies you've evaluated at once, but selecting a balanced range of goals will help you meet the goals you do choose and grow toward a point when you can take on additional projects.

, You already know your net assets and liabilities from your analysis of your current net worth; set these into a framework that includes the decisions you've made. Then hold yourself accountable for these decisions. If you've committed to spending $80 less per month on coffee and placing that money in a savings account, list that in your budget.


Goals such as obtaining a new job may not fit neatly into a budget, but should be listed in an easy-to-reference location as part of your working financial plan.

, You may be fully capable of making financial decisions, but a professional adviser has the advantage of emotional detachment from your financial situation., Personal financial planning is a process. Life changes, and you'll need to update your plan over time as your circumstances and goals change.

, If you find your life circumstances change quickly (as a college student, for example), you may opt to review these goals every 6 months. If your life tends to be more stable (as an adult empty-nester, for example), you might plan on an annual review.

, If you're already in a committed relationship, hopefully you've pursued this process as a couple. When making a relationship commitment, financial discussions should be part of the conversation about your values, goals, and plans for reaching those goals.

Create a title for the contract.,
Name the parties to the contract.,
Describe the property.,
Specify who owns the personal property.,
List any easements on the property.,
Note any liens or encumbrances to the property.,
Describe any covenants affecting use of the property.,
Define the payment terms.,
Assign each of the parties’ obligations and responsibilities.,

Describe how and when the property will be transferred to the buyer.,
Check for additional terms required by your state.,
Include an integration clause.,
Create a signature block.,
Have an attorney check the contract.,
Get the contract signed and notarized.,
Make a copy.",How to Write a Contract for a Deed (Land Contract)," You should put the title in bold type and center it across the top of the page.


Your title should reflect the contents of the agreement. For example, “Contract for a Deed” or “Land Sale Contract”.Provide an area for the parties to provide the date on which the agreement was created.

, When naming a party include his or her name and the title by which you will refer to him or her throughout the contract, such as Buyer or Seller. For example, “John Doe (“Buyer”) and Jane Doe (“Seller”) hereby agree as follows.”
Include the full address of each party to the contract., Because street addresses are subject to change, you should include both the street address and the full legal description of the property.The legal description of a property can be found in the most recently recorded deed or ownership affidavit.
If you do not have a copy of the deed or affidavit, contact the Recorder’s Office in the county where the property is located and request one.The Recorder may charge a small fee for locating and copying the deed.

, A seller may wish to include appliances like washers, dryers, ovens, and refrigerators in the sale—or not. Clarify whether any personal property is included in the sale.You may specify this information in an executed written addendum.Execute it in the same manner as you execute the contract for the deed to land: sign it and have it notarized.

, An easement is a limited right of a third party to use the property, such as a neighbor’s right to use the driveway because it is the only way to reach his or her own property.Check with the County Recorder for a description of any easements on the property. The county should have a record of all easements for any property.

, Because liens and encumbrances give some third party an interest in the property, or limit a buyer’s interest in it, a buyer is entitled to full disclosure of such interests.


Liens and encumbrances may include mortgages or other loans where the property was used as collateral. They may also include unpaid judgments to which the property has been attached.The full name and address of any creditors should be included.

, Covenants are rules affecting what an owner can and cannot do with a property, often resulting from an agreement among residents of a specific neighborhood.


For example, there may be limits on building any additional structures on the property, or on the colors a building can be painted.Covenants are typically managed by a home owners' association in the neighborhood where the property is located. Check with the association to find out if there are any covenants the buyer needs to know about., Be sure to describe the terms fully and in plain English. Your payment terms should cover:


Monthly payments. Include the amount of principle, interest, and the total monthly payment, on what date it is due each month, and where payments should be mailed or otherwise delivered. If there is a final balloon payment due, describe it in this same manner.Interest. State the interest rate and describe how interest is calculated. For example, “Interest shall be calculated at a simple seven and one half percent (7.5%) and shall be compounded annually.”Late payments. Describe clearly when a monthly payment will be considered late and what late fees shall apply. For example, “Payment is due on the 1st of each month, and shall be considered late if not paid by the close of business on the 15th of said month. A late fee of $25.00 shall apply to all late payments.”Term of the contract. State when the payments will start and when they will end, as well as how many payments there will be. For example, “Payments shall be due beginning on the 1st of April, 2009 with a final balloon payment due on the 1st of May, 2019, for a contract term of one hundred twenty-one (121) months.”It should be very clear when the contract begins, as the obligations it lays out will not be in effect until that date.

, During the term of the contract, both the buyer and the seller have an interest in the property. Therefore, each of the party’s obligations toward the property should be described in detail in your agreement. Some common items you may wish to cover include:


Maintenance. The buyer in a contract for a deed is generally responsible for maintenance and repairs to the property. A seller, however, may wish to include language that will allow him or her to come onto the property to make certain repairs if the buyer fails to make them in a timely manner.Property taxes. A seller may bill the buyer each year when taxes come due or she may include property taxes in the monthly payments charged. The contract should describe the method used, e.g., “Property tax shall be the responsibility of Buyer and is included in the monthly payment amount.”Use of the property. The buyer in a land contract usually maintains the sole right to possess or be on the property, with limitations on the right to construct new buildings or demolish old ones. Meanwhile, the seller generally retains a limited right to use the property as collateral and allow liens to be placed against the property, to the extent allowed by state law., A buyer is usually responsible for maintaining adequate insurance on property subject to a land contract, and oftentimes is required to name the seller as the insured. Be sure to include in the contract whoever is responsible for carrying insurance on the property.


If the buyer is responsible, specify the amount of insurance required., Ownership of property under a land contract remains with the seller until the final payment has been made. Once the final payment is made, the seller gives the buyer an executed deed showing the buyer as the new owner of the land.
Even though this is the standard procedure for legal ownership and title transfer under a land contract, you should spell it out in order to avoid any later confusion as to when title will be given to the buyer.

, The laws governing contracts for deeds or land contracts varies from state to state. Check your state statutes, or meet with a real estate attorney to determine if there are any additional terms or specific language required in a contract for deed. Conditions, or clauses, that may be required under state law include:


Right of acceleration. The right of acceleration is the right of a seller to call the entire balance of the loan due upon the failure of the buyer to make a monthly payment or comply with some other condition of the contract.
Warranties. Many states allow a seller to sell property under a land sale contract without making any warranties to the buyer. Some may require an ""as is"" disclaimer when no warranty is being made., State that the contract “includes the entire contract of purchaser and seller.” Also clarify that any modifications to the contract must be in writing and signed.This clause will prevent a party from later claiming that the contract does not contain what the parties agreed to., Your signature block should include a line for each party to sign, plenty of room for signatures, the parties’ printed names, and a place for a notary public to notarize the signatures.Your signature block should also include a place to enter the date on which the contract was signed by each party. This way it will be clear that the contract was signed after it was finalized, and has not been changed since it was signed.

, Ideally, you should have a real estate attorney look over your contract before you have the parties sign it. This can ensure that your contract is legal and that you have not overlooked any key information. Though this may present an up-front expense, it would be far cheaper than an in-court dispute due to a faulty contract.

, You and the buyer will both need to sign the contract in the presence of a notary public to make it a legally binding agreement., Both you and the buyer should have a physical copy of the agreement.


It's also a good idea to create an electronic copy as well, in case something should happen to the physical copy.
Store your physical copy in a secure location, such as a safety deposit box or in a home safe.

Negotiate any differences about the terms of your contract.,
Sign your contract and begin performing.",How to Write a Consulting Contract," A contract is a legally enforceable agreement.You will write a consulting contract if you are looking to hire a consultant or if you are a consultant looking to be hired. A consultant is someone who provides professional or expert advice., You will need to decide if you have the legal capacity to enter into a valid contract, which involves knowing what you are getting yourself into by entering into the agreement.Also, you will want to know what is needed to create a legally binding contract. Those requirements include:


An offer;
Acceptance;
Valid consideration;
Mutual assent; and
A legal purpose., Contract law is always going to be state law, so you will need to make sure you meet your state's requirements.


For example, some states have strict laws regarding liquidated damage provisions while other states allow them more freely., This will include the title of your contract and the parties making the agreement. When writing this section, be sure to include detailed descriptions of the parties.


For example, if the parties are people, you will include first and last names. If a party is a company, you will want to provide the company's name, address, and tax identification number if possible. Be sure to clearly indicate how each party to your contract will be referred to in the rest of your contract as well (e.g., ""hereinafter referred to as consultant"").
Commonly, a consultant will be an individual entering into a contract with a company looking for the consultant's services. For instance, a law firm may hire an individual consultant who has expertise in hiring and firing practices.

, In short, clear, readable paragraphs, explain what each party is providing under your contract. At this point, there is no need to get incredibly detailed. Most of the time you only have to state that one party is providing consulting services and the other party is providing compensation.


For example, an acceptable provision may state: ""The customer is of the opinion that the consultant has the necessary qualifications, experiences and abilities to provide services to the customer. The consultant is agreeable to providing such services to the customer on the terms and conditions set out in this agreement. In consideration of the matters described above...""This type of language is used to ensure that the requirement for valid consideration is met.

, Specify exactly what the consultant will be required to do under your contract. Be detailed in your specifications and include as much information as possible.


This section may start with something like this: ""The customer hereby agrees to engage the consultant to provide the customer with services consisting of (x, y, and z). The services will also include any other tasks the parties may agree on. The consultant hereby agrees to provide such services to the customer.""Common services include litigation support, asset management, process improvement, and second opinions., You must decide how the consultant will get paid. Some contracts may require periodic payments while others may require one lump sum payment at the end of the consulting. Whatever you choose, make sure it is detailed clearly in your contract.


If paying periodically, think about including something like this: ""For the services rendered by the consultant as required by this agreement, the customer will provide compensation to the consultant of $XX.XX per hour.""If paying in one lump sum, try something like this: ""The compensation will be payable upon completion of the services."", This distinction is important and you should spell out how the consultant will be treated in your contract. Most of the time a consultant will be an independent contractor. If you are making the consultant an independent contractor, make that relationship clear by spelling out how and why the consultant will keep his or her independent status. Include language that the consultant will waive his or her right to regular employee benefits such as sick leave, vacation time, health benefits, and anything else you can think of that a full-time employee would receive.


Consultants are most often going to be categorized as independent contractors. This ensures that the company or the individual hiring the consultant has a minimum level of responsibility over the consultant. This can be a good thing and it often means there will be less hoops to jump through in order to start and maintain the contractual relationship (i.e., less tax and reporting responsibilities). For instance, if you characterize the consultant as an independent contractor, the independent contractor may not have to report their income, up to a certain amount, to the IRS for tax purposes.

, Here you will include a section defining when the consulting services will begin and when they will end.


An acceptable provision may state: ""The term of this agreement will begin on the date of this agreement and will remain in full force and effect until the completion of the services, subject to earlier termination as provided in this agreement. The term of this agreement may be extended by mutual written agreement of the parties."", This section will provide information on how you can terminate the agreement before the total completion of services. Include how much notice will have to be given and how termination will affect compensation.


For example, your provision may end up looking like this: ""This Agreement may be terminated by either party, with or without cause, upon thirty (30) days prior written notice to the other; provided that if consultant terminates this agreement, consultant shall, in accordance with the terms and conditions hereof, nevertheless wind up in an orderly fashion assignments for the customer which consultant began prior to the date of notice of termination hereunder. Upon termination of this agreement for any reason, consultant shall be entitled to receive such compensation and reimbursement, if any, accrued under the terms of this agreement, but unpaid, as of the date consultant ceases work under this agreement. In addition, consultant shall be reimbursed for any non-cancellable obligations, any cancellation penalties, and, unless consultant terminates the agreement without cause, any expenditures reasonably made in order to perform the services that were to occur had cancellation not occurred."", Towards the end of your contract you will include any standard provisions that are usually found in contracts. Most of these provisions you can simply take from a form contract you find, but make sure you read over them and ensure they say what you want them to. Some of these provisions may include:


Severability provisions
Modification provisions
Indemnification provisions
Choice of law provisions
Entire agreement provisions

, At the very end of the contract you will make space for all parties to sign the contract. This area should have spaces for your signatures and dates.

, Once you have written your consulting contract you will offer it to the other party. The other party will then have a number of options:


The other party may accept the offer in full. In this instance, you will then sign the contract and start performing.
The other party could reject the offer in full. If this is the case, you will have to write a more acceptable contract to the other party or find someone else to try to contract with.
The other party might try to negotiate some of the terms of your contract. If this happens, you will negotiate with the other party until you both reach an acceptable agreement.

, When you negotiate over the terms of your consulting contract, it will most likely be over payment for services and/or the types of services the consultant is going to perform. These will be common areas of tension because they are the main parts of your contract.

, When you and the other party are satisfied with the document, you will both sign it and begin performance in the manner you both agreed upon.

,How to Quote in a Research Paper1,
"
Understand how to use dropped quotes.,
Understand how to use full sentence quotes.,
Understand how to use block quotes.,
Understand how to use indirect quotes.",How to Quote in a Research Paper2," Dropped quotes are partial phrases taken from the middle of a piece of text. Dropped quotes are comprised of only a few words and give no direction as to who the speaker is or the content it’s referring to. These must always be introduced within a sentence, and cannot comprise a complete sentence on their own.


Use a complete sentence to incorporate a dropped quote. Ex: As Rembrandt’s skill developed, he began painting landscapes that are “romantic and visionary” (Wallace 96).
Use a tag to incorporate a dropped quote: Rembrandt’s landscapes are “romantic and visionary” (Wallace 96).

, As the name implies, full sentence quotes are created by quoting complete sentences that take up less than 4 lines. Although these are complete sentences, they cannot be used as stand-alone sentences in your paper. Introduce them with an additional complete sentence or a signal phrase.


Use a complete sentence to introduce a full sentence quote. Ex: Over the course of time Rembrandt’s work began to change and focus on different themes, but as Wallace points out: ""Rembrandt’s great gift as an etcher lay in preserving a sense of spontaneity while scrupulously attending to close detail” (142).
Use a signal phrase to introduce your full sentence quote. Ex: As Wallace states, “Rembrandt’s great gift as an etcher lay in preserving a sense of spontaneity while scrupulously attending to close detail” (142).

, Block quotes are multiple sentences quoted directly from a source which take up more than 4 lines in your paper. Because these take up a lot of physical space, they should be used sparingly with a maximum of 1-2 for a complete paper. Incorporate a block quote by adding a complete line space between your own content and the quote, and offsetting it by indenting the entire quote to the right a single time.


Introduce your block quote with a colon. Ex: According to Wallace: (add a line break here, and then indent the entire quote).
Block quotes do not use quotation marks. You have already stated who the author is/what is being referred to in the introduction sentence. Add the in-text parenthetical citation after the period at the end of the quote, though.
If your block quote is inside a paragraph, you don’t have to start a new paragraph at the end of it. Simply add another line break and begin writing along the left margin (with no indent)., Indirect quotes, or paraphrasing, is when you use a sentence from a source but change the wording slightly into your own words. This is useful when you cannot meet rubric requirements by quoting, or if you’ve quoted too much. Be careful to avoid plagiarism though by changing at least 50% of the sentence.


Change the structure of the sentence by moving parts around. You can use a thesaurus to exchange words with synonyms.
Paraphrasing should only be done if you are certain that you understand the content you are copying. If you are unclear as to the meaning of the quote, you won’t be able to put it adequately into your own words.
When you write your paraphrase, don’t look at the quote. Keep the meaning in your head and create a new sentence to match."
"
Know where to place commas and periods.,
Know where to place exclamation points and question marks.,
Use ellipses correctly.,
Use brackets correctly.,
Use colons and semicolons correctly.,
Copy the quote exactly.",How to Quote in a Research Paper3," When you’re placing a quote inside your essay, you’ll likely have to use a comma or period at the end. If you’re quoting without giving a citation (because your entire essay is about a single work, for example) commas and periods go inside the quotations marks. If you’ve included a parenthetical citation, the comma or period goes outside the quotation marks after the citation.

, If there is an exclamation point or question mark inside the quote you are using, keep it inside the quotation marks. If you’re asking a question or exclaiming the importance of a quote, add the punctuation outside of the quotation marks. If you are asking a question about a quoted question, use a single question mark inside the quotations.


Example of a quotation that comes with a question mark: Alice said “but where will I go?” (24).
Example of asking a question about a quotation: With so much contention, will literary scholars ever agree on “the dream-like quality of Alice’s adventure” (39)?
Example of a question about a quoted question: At this point in the story, readers communally ask “but where will I go?” (24).

, When you use the majority of, but not all of a quote, or if you begin in the middle of a quote, it is necessary to insert ellipses. These show that some of the sentence is not included in your quote. Use ‘...’ to show that a part of the quote before or after your selection has been excluded.


Ellipses can be used in the center of a quote to leave out words that you feel add unnecessary length to the statement without adding value. For example: As the man stated, “reading the book was...enlightening and life-changing.” This is done rather than: As the man stated, “reading the book over the last few weeks was not only incredibly enjoyable, but also enlightening and life-changing.”
Ellipses should be used only before or after a quote, not both. If you are only use a part of a quote from the center of a selection, it is just a partial or dropped quote.

, The opposite of ellipses (used to leave something out), brackets are inserted into a quote to add information that you deem important/necessary but which is not included in the quote itself. You can include brackets in a quote to give a few words, typically the name of a person or place that the quote is focusing on, to help the reader understand the context.


For example: As scholars have noted, “Rembrandt’s portrait of her was both accurate and emotion-filled” (Wallace 49).

, If you are using a colon or semicolon after a quote, or there is a colon or semicolon at the end of your selection which you are quoting, place the punctuation mark outside of the quotation marks., If you are using a direct quote, it is imperative that you copy it word-for-word. Include all spelling and grammatical mistakes as well, even if you are aware they are incorrect. If your quote has a mistake that you are aware of, put (italicized and in brackets) immediately after the mistake. This signifies that you are aware that there is a mistake in the quote, and that it is not a mistake on your part.


Ex: As Dormer has noted, “his work is much more valuable now then it was at the time of its creation.”

Quote in MLA format.,
Quote in APA format.,
Quote in Chicago style.",How to Quote in a Research Paper4," When citing in MLA format, your in-text citation should include the author’s name and the page number that the information is from. You can include these together in a parenthetical citation, or you can mention one in your writing and the other in a parenthetical citation.


Ex: We can therefore ascertain that “Rembrandt’s decline in popularity may have been his dedication to Biblical painting” (Wallace 112).
Ex: According to some, “another reason for Rembrandt’s decline in popularity may have been his dedication to Biblical painting” (Wallace 112), but not everyone agree on this matter.
Ex: Wallace states that “another reason for Rembrandt’s decline in popularity may have been his dedication to Biblical painting” (112)., Slightly different than MLA format, APA requires an in-text parenthetical citation with the author’s last name and the year the text was published. They must be included together in the parentheses, or you can mention the name of the author in your writing and put just the year in parentheses afterwards.Ex: As Billy’s character is described, we learn “Billy wasn’t a Catholic, even though he grew up with a ghastly crucifix on his wall” (Vonnegut 1969).
Ex: Vonnegut gives a factual statement with a clear opinion thrown in when he says “Billy wasn’t a Catholic, even though he grew up with a ghastly crucifix on his wall” (1969).
Ex: With the knowledge that “Billy wasn’t a Catholic, even though he grew up with a ghastly crucifix on his wall” (Vonnegut 1969), we begin to understand his philosophical standings.

, The Chicago style of formatting research essays uses footnotes at the bottom of your page rather than in-text parenthetical citations. In order to cite a quotation in your paper, add a footnote number immediately after the ending quotation mark (not inside the quotes). This should be paired with a matching citation at the bottom of the page."

Choose the quotations you want to use in the paper with care.,
Avoid summarizing.,
Use quotes to highlight a specific phrase.,
Quote important evidence.,
Be clear when using quotes.,
Include bibliographic information at the end of the paper.",How to Quote in a Research Paper5," Overuse of quotations is considered sloppy in academic writing because it relies too heavily on others to make your point. Show not only that can you write, but that you can also judiciously sift through large amounts of research to glean the most important quotes that will support your argument.

, If you’re quoting something directly, it should be done because you have valuable insights based on that particular phrase or set of information. Quotes should not be used as filler, followed by a long summary or paraphrase of what you copied. Make sure that when you discuss the quote, you aren’t simply repeating what the text says in different words., Often times in academic writing, a very specific phrase or term may be used and described by an empirical source. If there is no way for your to better explain or reword this phrase, use a quotation. When possible, try to paraphrase or use an indirect quote to avoid seeming lazy with your writing.

, Quotations can be particularly helpful for an argumentative or study-based research paper, as you can use them to provide direct evidence for an important point you are making. Add oomph to your position by quoting someone who also backs it, with good reason. Be sure to elaborate on their point after quoting though, rather than just dropping it into your essay without further discussion.

, Although helpful at times, quotes that have not been clearly attributed can be confusing and out of place. Make sure your quote is given context before stating it. Although you should have a citation involved as well, it is important to make it clear to the reader that the ideas you are presenting are those of someone else.

, A ""Works Cited"" page, or other bibliographic source page, is used at the end of the paper to list full publishing information on each quoted source.

Read, listen, see.,

Go by instinct.,

Start!",How to Find Creative Inspiration," Simple - listen to your thoughts, note them down and work on them. Even if something seems stupid, pen it down and see what you can come up with. For instance:


1. I have to buy the milk today.
2. I have to travel by car to the supermarket to do this.
3. While going there, I could have a small car crash
4. This accident could have taken place with a foreign person, whom I meet and start to form a relationship with
5. He might have an interesting background story which could affect my life...
And so, here's a very banal example of something you can do with a seemingly worthless idea. Even the most mundane of topics can start a highly fascinating story or concept for a song, painting, play, etc.;
, Remember your past, look at old photo albums and talk to relatives about any anecdotes they remember. You can always find seeds while digging up the ground.

, Make sure to talk to people and be active - by doing this, ideas will flourish far more easily. Travelling is an extremely important part of getting inspired, and has served to countless writers and artists - think of the Grand Tourists, being inspired as they travelled through the bucolic Tuscany or enigmatic seas of Greece. You'd be surprised how much a change in environment can power your inspiration.

, When you're elated, regretful, excited, bored, worried or even feeling level, note down exactly what's going through your mind and how you view life - even a simple emotion can be the source of any great work of art.

, Countless artists and writers based their works on dreams - think of Stevenson's 'Jekyll & Hyde', Dalí's paintings or The Beatles' classic 'Yesterday', all said to have been fruits of their creators' oneiric imagination. Keep a 'dream diary' where you write what you saw and how you felt in each dream. Both are needed to complete the idea.

, Read novel after novel, listen to piece after piece, go to gallery after gallery. Make yourself a reading list of random books ranging anywhere from Elizabethan classics to how-to manuals, listen to an eclectic mix of music (opera, rock, dubstep, bhangra, anything), be bold and go outside your comfort zone. You'd be surprised how much inspiration this can give you.

, For once in your life, ignore any preconceptions and jump into things you would never do. It could prove life-changing and inspiring.

, If you feel like doing something, do it. Simple enough (as long as it's legal).

, Inspiration isn't something you can plan. The more you overthink, the staler your ideas will be. Don't think this through methodically, just go with the flow of your mind and discard plans.

, Don't stay there waiting for inspiration to come - it probably won't, at least for a long time. Force yourself to begin. Open a dictionary and write the first word you find. Force yourself to use this word to construct a story/song/painting/other work of art. You'd be surprised how often inspiration comes along during your creative process.

Introduce the important elements of storytelling.,
Encourage students to engage the reader.,
Explain the importance of tone and atmosphere.,
Promote the use of active verbs.,
Allow students to pick their topic.,
Have your students write a flexible outline.,
Avoid teaching a story “formula.” One of the most important things to remember when teaching creative writing is to dispense with the idea that stories should follow certain arcs or formulas.,

Organize editing groups.,

Inspire students with an appreciation of literature.,
Provide your students with a large number of resources.,

Publish your students’ work.",How to Teach Creative Writing," Great works of literature share elements across the genres. In order for your students to excel at creative writing, they need to know the fundamentals of storytelling. As a result, you need to spend some time focusing on the core elements of storytelling. Focus instruction time on teaching:


Theme. The theme of a story is its message or the main idea behind it.
Setting. The setting of a story is the location or time it takes place in.
Plot. The plot is the overall story, narrative, or sequence of events.
Characterization. Characterization is how a character or person in a story is explained or presented to the reader.
Conflict and dramatic action. Conflict and dramatic action are the main events of focus in the story. These events are often tense or exciting and are used to lure the reader in.;
, While creative writing is an exercise in expressing individual creativity through writing, the trick to great creative writing is to make it truly compelling and engaging for the reader. The more engaging the story, the more creative the work will be as a whole.


Explain how your students, as writers, can appeal to the humanity of their readers. One great way to do this is to ask them to explore character development. By developing a character in their story, readers will become invested in the story.
Discuss the triggers that engage readers in an effective story. Most great stories start with a problem, which is solved with the resolution, or conclusion of the story. Encourage students to create an engaging problem that will hook the readers in the first few pages of a short story or novel., Let your students know the importance of interesting settings with compelling tone and atmosphere. The tone and atmosphere are essentially the “feel” of the story. This is important in creating a gripping story that is well-rounded.


By setting the tone and atmosphere of a story, the author will establish his or her attitude to the subject and the feel of the story.
Tone can be positive, neutral, or negative.
Atmosphere can be dark, happy, or neither.
Descriptive words like “darkness” or “sunshine” can help set both the tone and atmosphere., While a student might be a great writer, without the use of active verbs, their story may be dry and not really compelling. To cure this, you should ask your students to use active verbs throughout their story. Active verbs are a great way to make stories come alive.


Active verbs are used to show action in the story.
Active verbs are very often a better alternative to passive voice.
For example, instead of writing “The cat was chased by the dog” your student can write “The dog chased the cat.”, The first step in guiding students through the writing process is to allow them to pick their topic. Picking their topic will allow your students to own their writing and to use their own creative energy to craft an engaging story.


Tell your students to brainstorm about ideas they are truly interested in.
If you must restrict the general topic, make sure that your students have a good amount of wiggle room within the broad topic of the assignment.
Never assign specific topics and force students to write. This will undermine the entire process., After your students have chosen a topic, have them create a flexible and general outline for their story. This outline will serve as a guide as they write their story. Because the outline is flexible, it will guide them while not limiting their creativity. Consider:


Letting your students know that the outline is non-binding. They don’t have to follow it in later steps of the writing process.
Telling your students that the parts of their outline should be written very generally.
Recommending that your students create several outlines, or outlines that go in different directions (in terms of plot and other elements of storytelling). The more avenues your students explore, the better., While formulaic writing can aid students who need direction, it can also bind students and limit their imaginations.


Tell students that there is no “right” way to write a story.
Let students know that their imaginations should guide their way.
Show students examples of famous writing that breaks normal patterns, like the works of E.E. Cummings.
Ask students to forget about any expectations they think you have for how a story should be written., As your students move through the writing process, you should read over drafts and provide feedback. Feedback is essential in guiding writers and making sure they are on the right path to storytelling success.


Gather the first drafts and comment on the student's work to encourage excellence in writing.
Remind them that great writers usually wrote several drafts before they were happy with their stories.
Avoid grading drafts for anything other than completion., An important part of the writing process is the formation of editing groups in your class. Editing groups will enable your students to read each others' work and give feedback during the writing process. Students should benefit by listening to the reactions of an audience to their work.


Let students pair off to edit each others' papers.
Have your students join groups of 3 or 4 and ask them to go edit and provide feedback on each member’s story.
Provide guidance so students contribute constructively to the group discussion., Ultimately, when it comes to evaluating your students' work and assigning a grade, you need to evaluate them based on their creativity. While it may be tempting to assign grades based on a certain model or formula, you should look deep into your students' work to see if they've succeeded at writing with creativity.


Reward your students if they are innovative or do something unique and truly creative.
Avoid evaluating your students based on a formula.
Assess and review your own standards as often as you can. Remember that the point is to encourage your students' creativity., Creative writing students will probably arrive with a keen appreciation for great literature and favorite works, but a savvy teacher will review and introduce new literary works of art. Students will learn from the teacher and the masters who preceded them.


Teach your students about a variety of writers and genres.
Have your students read examples of different genres.
Promote a discussion within your class of the importance of studying literature.
Ask students to consider the many ways literature improves the world and asks individuals to think about their own lives., One of the best ways to teach and promote creative writing is to make sure your students have the resources to write. Such resources include both creative resources and material resources to actually write.


Make sure your room is stocked with a wide variety of fiction stories.
Make sure your room is stocked with plenty of paper for your students to write on.
Line up other writing teachers or bring in writers from the community to talk to and encourage your students., A good way to get your students into the habit of creative writing is to have them write a series of practice stories using a bank of pictures and photos you supply.


Cut out pictures and photographs from magazines, comic books, and newspapers.
Have your students cut out photographs and pictures and contribute them to your bank.
Consider having your students randomly draw a given number of photos and pictures and writing a short story based on what they draw.
This technique can help students overcome writer's block and inspire students who think that they're ""not creative."", One way to teach and reinforce best writing practices is to provide your students with audiences for their writing. This way, your students will have the chance to have their writing read by real people who can enjoy their work and provide constructive criticism.


Pair your students with students from another grade in your school.
Allow your students to write stories that younger students in your school would like to read.
Pair your students with another student in the class and have them evaluate each others' work., For many students, it is very important to have a space that is geared toward promoting creative writing. A space specifically designed for creative writing will allow students to focus their creativity into the writing process.


If you just have a typical classroom to work with, make sure to put inspirational posters or other pictures on the walls.
Open any curtains so students can see outside.
If you have the luxury of having an extra classroom or subdividing your own classroom, create a comfortable space with a lot of inspirational visuals.
Writing spaces can help break writer's block and inspire students who think that they're ""not creative."", One way to teach and promote creative writing is to do an informal publication of your students’ stories. This way, your students will not only be able to be proud that their work is printed for others to read, but they’ll be able to read each others' work and get ideas for their own future stories.


Involve students in the printing process.
Publication does not have to be expensive or glossy.
Copies can be made in the school workroom if possible or each student might provide a copy for the others in the group.
A collection of the stories can be bound with a simple stapler or brads.
Seek out other opportunities for your students to publish their stories."

You can read psychological or material issues you would never think people can have. Search on the site using keywords, you will find some stories related to yours. Only focus on the questions; the answers are far less interesting.

, When you read a book, watch a movie alone or view videos on YouTube, take the habit to pause at the most confusing moment. At this moment, try to guess the following. Search as many versions as possible. When you resume the story, your version is sometimes more original than the official ending. It's not plagiarism if the idea is different. You can also adapt your new ending to your story, change the names, the place. Eventually, it will be a completely different story.

, Sometimes, you see a trailer movie and you think ""Wow! This concept is so original!"" You go to see the movie and you discover that the concept is completely another one... Don't be frustrated! It means that you have found an original idea! Don't lose it.

, Find a striking and interesting article that catches your eye, and write about it.

, Snippets of conversation can be incorporated into your story.

, How does the song make you feel? Happy? Sad? Write about a character you can create from these lyrics, or just write about how it makes you feel.

,, Incorporate your favorite band or singer into it and write about their crazy, funny or sad antics. You could write about your interpretation of how a certain song came to be. There are many fan-fiction websites that you can then post your story on, and get reviews.

, Or you could write an auto-biography!

, You can't expect to use your full writing potential by writing on pre-scribbled paper with a really crummy pen, can you?

, Mind maps are great for organizing information about characters and events, especially if you are more of a visual person.

, TV can actually bring inspiring ideas to mind. Study the people on the commercials, and think of their life after the commercial has passed.

, Find something in their that you can incorporate into your story.

, Basically, you write non-stop for 10-20 minutes, writing about whatever comes to mind. Don't make corrections as you write, and just keep writing, even if you have to write, 'I don't know what to write' until you can write something else.

, This is a really good writing activity that can strike up ideas with your friends or family when bored. (- denotes a new line). Grab a piece of paper, and write three lines about something (eg. Once upon a time, their lived a bird - named Andy. Andy loved fishing, because - he loved eating). Then fold the first two lines so only the third line is visible (e.g he loved eating) and then pass it to another person to continue. (e.g he loved eating walnuts- in the summer breeze.

Change around your ideas.,
Have fun!",How to Develop a Story Theme," Take the time to do some self-reflecting. What are your fundamental beliefs, and why? What parts of life greatly interest you and why? Try to find patterns in your thinking. If a similar idea pops up multiple times, you have an interest in it (sometimes the idea is not what we want to hear, but inner conflict is an excellent writing tool).;
, This is absolutely necessary, unless your goal is to avoid any and all readers. Parenthood is an excellent theme to work with, but it's not so great when you're writing for kids too young to care.

, This is less strict, but the more people able to identify with your work means the better of a theme you will have.

, Does the theme match up with your story at all? If so, great! You're on the right track. If not, don't be afraid to edit. The theme should be solid, consistent, and works like the Sun. Everything should orbit around theme; characters, setting, plot, action, I mean EVERYTHING. Don't confuse orbit with gravitation, though. You want to continuously circle around the theme, not explicitly addressing it until around the climax. If you goof up and do so anyway, then your writing will seem amateurish and your opinion will seem heavy-handed. Subtlety is king in the writing world.

, No matter how attached you may be to your completely original, witty, amazing character or your lovely description of Death Valley, If it doesn't match up with the theme, it's out. Your theme is the most important part of your work, and everything else comes second. Don't be afraid to perform giant overhauls and corrections. That's part of the masochistic beauty that is writing.

, Writing is about pure, uncensored expression. Well, except for the part where you completely rewrite everything you said for one reason or another. But there's fun in that, too. Storytelling is fun because it evolves with you. You are witnessing yourself improve with every spelling correction, every rewrite, and even those times where you have to throw away giant chunks of work. The feeling afterwards is oddly refreshing, like shedding off that well-worn and loved skin for one much shinier.

If you commit to writing in the notebook everyday, you can fill it up in no time. Think about a time of the day that would be best for writing. If you have a busy morning and afternoon, write each night before going to sleep.


Once you block a time during your day for writing, it is important to stick with it. You can better utilize your notebook if you stay committed to your goals.It will feel good to complete something you set out to accomplish.;
, An easy thing to write about is your day and what you accomplished or failed to accomplish. Writing about your day will also challenge your memory and improve it over time.


Give yourself a time buffer before reflecting about an event. Say you go to sleep at night, wake up in the morning, and then write about your day.
Date each entry as you go for future reference. You might get into a dispute about when you first kissed your girlfriend. By dating an entry, you can easily pick out the exact date something occurred.

, Your imagination is a great way to utilize your notebook. If you find yourself bored and daydreaming, jot down the scene as best to your abilities. Writing down your fantasies is also a good way to explore your creative side.


You don’t need to write about dragons, unless you like imagining a world with dragons.
If you have a dream about living in South America, explore those thoughts by writing about the details.
You don’t need to write a structured short story. Focus on the specific details in your head. If you want to develop your entry into a story, you have a series of details to use.

, Writing oftentimes can relieve a problem you’re facing in life. Look at the history of poets and writers, who have explored great pain and pleasure in a beautiful arrangement of words. They’re using writing as a form of self therapy by being introspective and in touch with their emotions.You can write about a family member’s passing, a break-up, or even unrequited love.
Expose your feelings and don’t concern yourself with other people reading your thoughts.

, Writing letters can benefit you in several ways. You can actually write a letter to a friend or family member using your blank notebook paper. Alternatively, you could write a letter to someone you are frustrated with and not send it to them. It may seem old fashioned, but you can still utilize the gratification of writing a letter to someone.People enjoy receiving physical mail that isn’t junk mail.

, You and a good friend or group of friends can take turns writing in the notebook. Hold onto the notebook for a week at a time and then pass it on. You can use the friendship journal to tell your friends thoughts and ideas you experience. This can also be a great way to become closer with your friends.


You could even use the friendship notebook to create a story where each of you contributes a chapter at a time.
The same idea could even be used to create a comic book.

, When you wake up each morning, write down the dreams you had right away so you don't forget them! Dreams typically last in your memory during the first ten minutes you wake up.

If your notebook is a pocket sized notebook, you can still draw detailed doodles. It helps if you have good pens to draw with.


If the notebook is filled words, but there is only a line or two, you can still draw on each page.

, Bring your notebook out in public and draw things around you. Find a nice park bench with a good view and look for something to draw. You could also go somewhere like a coffee shop and draw something in your sight.Be cautious if you choose to draw people in public. Some people may find it uncomfortable, so ask permission.

, You can find thousands of images from magazines and other books. Rather than trace over an image you like, try to draw it from studying the image. This will improve your drawing skills more than tracing an image.


Nature magazines will have plenty of scenes that are perfect for practicing.

, Instead of taking your drawings too seriously, try to jot down some doodles to fill a page. Even if you have notes on a page, you can doodle in the blank spaces. Fun things you can doodle are band logos, symbols, geometric shapes, cats/dogs, faces, and swords. You can doodle anything you think of.Experiment with ideas in your head, or just draw for the fun of it.

, If you are an aspiring artist or illustrator, you can practice drawing an image you want to improve. It is good for artists to draw multiple versions of the same object. This will give you variations to choose from. Once you draw an iteration you’re especially pleased with, you can transfer that image to canvas or another medium.


Repetition is a great way to improve your drawing skills. By repeating the same image, the process becomes ingrained into your brain.

, Cut out images from magazines or books and create collages in your notebook. Collages are an easy way to create an artistic image. You need scissors and some glue. Cut out multiple images from a magazine like a golfer, a mountain range, or a bulldog. Then arrange them in your notebook.


Once you find an interesting composition out of your cutouts, glue them into your notebook.
Old National Geographic magazines are great for making collages.

Make your final decision.",How to Create the Perfect Title for Your Book," Each different genre of literature, from children’s to academia and fiction, have different conventions in titling. These help market the books and can direct you towards identifying potential title elements.


Make sure you know the genre in which you hope to market your book. For example, if you want to publish in children’s literature, think about popular titles. They’re usually simple and have something that can catch a child’s eye such as Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs or The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe.
Consider your ability to cross-over genres. Some academic texts could be of interest to the public and can incorporate different elements to hook a person’s attention and give an idea of the subject matter. Many titles have a primary and sub-title, for example, Eugene Weber used The Hollow Years: France in the 1930s. It’s catchy and simple, yet lets the reader know enough to figure out the subject.;
, As you start thinking about potential titles, make sure that a copy of the book is never far. This can help you peruse and identify keywords, images, dialogue or characters that may make great titles that spark potential readers’ attention.


Recognize that keeping the text close for finding a title may also help you refine the text. Refer to it any time you are unsure of something; the lines may inspire you.
Figure out major elements of the book such as the narrator or the overall argument. Ask yourself how these elements can figure into a powerful title. Remember that the title isn’t a simple label, but rather a way for readers to first access your work.Consider incorporating various elements such as perspective and comparison into your title.

, Different genres draw on perspective of a character to tell their story. If your book focuses on the comments or role of one person or narrator, consider using this as a way to draw in your reader. Think of the power of perspective in The Catcher in the Rye: it introduces a mysterious figure that symbolizes the book’s protagonist.


Use a primary character in the title to grab potential readers. For example, in addition to Caulfield’s Catcher, Beverly Cleary’s Ramona Quimby, Age 8 in children’s literature gives us the name of the protagonist with a bit of context; or A Past in Hiding: Memory and Survival in Nazi by Mark Roseman in academia traces the protagonist’s history through the perspective of hiding.

, Anything that draws on a person’s emotions, such as images, metaphors, or even raw feelings can help draw in a potential reader. If your work strikes at particularly emotional chords or has unusual imagery, consider using these as elements in your title.


Think about titles in your genre and even others that use imagery, emotion, or metaphor. There are a world of examples including Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs in children’s literature that uses the image of a rainstorm of meatballs; Bloodlands: Europe Between Hitler and Stalin in academia/ non-fiction evokes the murderous geography in the grips of two dictators; Into Thin Air in non-fiction evokes a feeling of being lost to describe the events of the fateful 1996 Everest climbing season; finally, Twilight in fiction evokes the shadowy work a human inhabits with vampires.

, If your book is a work of fiction that includes a significant amount of dialogue, figure out ways to incorporate to grab a reader with it. You may want to keep the dialogue element short and to the point such as Gone with the Wind or Monsters of Men., Many genres use intrigue, mystery, or curiosities within their text. Planting these types of elements in your title can spark a person to want to investigate farther by reading the book.Intrigue may work best with works of fiction or genres like historical fiction. Think of titles such as The Da Vinci Code or Post-Mortem. They make you ask questions like “ooh, what is The Da Vinci Code” or “what happened post-mortem?” However, even academic titles can create intrigue including such examples as The Last Utopia: Human Rights in History because it makes one ask “why is human rights the last utopia?” Titles that generate questions like this have created a sense of intrigue and piqued your curiosity.
Create your title from context. The circumstances that drive your book can also provide rich material for your title. Asking yourself questions such as “what kind of restrictions exist” or “is there a specific location” to figure out contexts.Recognize that context can include various elements like space and time. For example works like The Year of Magical Thinking chronicles Joan Didion’s life in the year after her husband’s death or Rue Ordenet, Rue Labat uses the streets of Paris to detail the experience of persecution in Vichy France.
Use names or responsibility to create context as well, such as the title Sophie’s Choice. Not only does the example tell us about the protagonist, it sows intrigue and tells us that Sophie was forced to make some type of difficult choice that had significant consequences.

, Take some time to notice if there are contradictory themes or situations in your book. Comparing and juxtaposing these elements in a short and simple title can help you not only get at the fundamental essence of your book, but also grab potential readers’ attention.


Consider other titles in different genres that use comparison. Some examples include: War and Peace, which details personal lives between situations of war and peace; Beyond Totalitarianism: Stalinism and Nazism Compared contrasts two dictatorships that are often paralleled to get at their unique features; and The Drowned and the Saved uses juxtaposition to get at those who survived and those who fell victim to the Holocaust.

, You can use different themes, feelings, or keywords from your book in your title. They can incorporate things like alliteration, rhyme, or an utterance.Keep in mind that some of the greatest works of literature use wordplay. Think, for example, of classics such as Pride and Prejudice and Of Mice and Men, which use alliteration.
Remember that you can incorporate wordplay into other genres such as academia or even children’s literature. Classics like The Cat in the Hat and The End of History and the Last Man employ rhyme and common utterances to capture their readers’ attention.

, No matter if your book is fiction or non-fiction, the title is one of the most important elements of your book. It’s often the first thing people see and can draw them in to pick up the book and possibly buying it.Having an enthralling title versus one that is bland can make a huge difference in interest in your book—for you and your potential readers. A good title will:


Predict content
Catch the potential reader’s interest
Reflect the tone of the book
Contain keywords that search engines can easily access., As you are working on the book, it’s likely that potential titles will pop into your mind. Write these down on a designated piece of paper or in a notebook for when you return to brainstorming your final title.


Avoid thinking that any potential title is stupid. You may find that once you’ve finished composing and editing your piece that exactly what you thought was ridiculous fits perfectly.
Refer to this list as you formulate your final title.
Remember that most titles don’t spring for fully formed and need work, so this list can be an incredibly important resource as you proceed.

, Your title should contain either direct references or allusions to the themes of your book. This doesn’t mean that the title has to be very long; in fact, short and catchy titles are often much more effective at peeking potential readers’ interest than drawn out descriptions.Ask yourself “what does this book cover?” or “what is it about?” to help you figure out themes.Write down these keywords in your notebook. For example, if you are writing about the Red Cross during World War II you could use keywords such as “Holocaust,” “victims,” “refugees,” “humanitarianism,” and “concentration camps.”Use allusion in the title, which works for both fiction and non-fiction. For example, consider the title Shades of Grey. This book goes into so-called grey zones of life and directly addresses one of the books protagonists.
Be aware that your title can help shape your book as you revise it., Check which titles are best sellers in your specific genre to inspire yourself title writing process. In addition, this step can help you avoid using or plagiarizing someone else’s title.


Consider where you plan to market your book. Will this be for the general public or for the academic community? Or both? Look at different titles in your field that market to each of these different groups.
Run searches on Internet search engines and other databases such as JStor for academics or IMDB for fiction. Not only can this help you gain perspective on the title landscape of your field, but also give you further ideas.
Read bestseller lists from sources such as the The New York Review of Books or The London Review of Books.
Remember that you want your title to be as original as possible so that it doesn’t get lost in a crowd of other intriguing books.

, Friends and colleagues can often be great resources for devising titles. Discuss your different title options with them and see if they can offer any great suggestions or advice.


Consider inviting friends and colleagues over for a “title writing” party. Though it may sound corny, it can be a lot of fun and may be much more productive than working alone or with one person.

, As you get closer to the final version of your book and title, decide on several potential titles. Be aware that if your working with an editor, she may change it or you may end up either finding similar titles or decide you don’t like a choice.

, As with any piece of writing, allowing your ideas to sit for a few days without reviewing them can help you see them with new eyes. Return to your list of reserved titles after a week or so to make a final decision on what title you’d like to use. Make sure to have a second title in case you change your mind or your editor has other suggestions.Keep your potential audiences in mind when making your choice., Most authors have an editor for the process of getting their book published. Speaking to your editor can help you come up with the perfect and final version of your title.


Recognize that most editors know what “works” and doesn’t in your specific genre of writing. Respect their opinions while keeping your own choices in mind.
Be aware that your editor may change your title and that you could have little authority in the final title.

, Before you send your book for printing and publication, you’ll need to make final revisions to the text and the title. Use this process to further refine the titles you’ve chosen in order to get the perfect title for your final product.Revisit your title choices with friends, colleagues, and your editor to get additional opinions.Accept the fact that your final title may be very different that everything you’ve devised previously because something new works better. For example, Tolkien's last volume of Lord of the Rings novel was initially ""The War of the Ring."" It was changed later to ""The Return of the King,"" even though Tolkien felt this revealed too much of the story., Based on your revisions, conversations with your editor, and your feelings, decide which title you ultimately want to use if you are able. If you don’t have as much ability to choose your title, find a middle ground that is acceptable to you and your editor.


Realize that both fiction and non-fiction authors run into similar problems with choosing titles.
Consider another publisher if you are truly unhappy with the title the editor is forcing you to “choose.”

Consider whether something can be completed more efficiently, cheaply or with higher quality.
Look for key performance indicators to identify what is functioning well in terms of performance and what needs work toward improvement.Ask yourself why it is a problem. If it is the result of another problem, keep tracing it back to it’s source.;
, Identify the goals you would like to achieve with your business process. Focus on increasing the quality, efficiency or cost of your product or service. These should be more a more general vision of your hopes for the future of your company.Consider the future of your company and where you would like to be in the next 1 year and 5 years.
Your goal should fit with the vision and mission statement of your company.
Goals should be realistically attainable.
Avoid setting too many goals.

, These should be more specific, time sensitive, and measurable than your goals.Set a measurable time frame to achieve the objective.
Make sure the expectations are reasonable.
Be sure you have the employees available to complete your objectives within the time frame you have set.

, When deciding on the activities, it is useful to consider cause and effect of each activity, how they relate to each other and how they move you closer to your desired objective.Identify the starting point of the process and fill in the activities leading to the objective.


These actions should be interdependent and rely upon each other to achieve the objective.
Activities can be sequential or parallel, meaning either one activity can not occur until the other is completed, or two activities can occur at the same time within the process., Review your list of activities to determine which steps are unnecessary. Delete all unnecessary activities from your list if they are not specific to this particular objective.


It is important to streamline the process and avoid having so many steps that it is overwhelming or confusing to the employees.If the omitted activity is important to your overall business, consider which goal best benefits from this activity and save it to be part of a separate business process.

, It is helpful to create a flow chart of the entire process, listing each activity in order and linking it to the next part of the process.Start with the premiere event leading to your goal. Draw a circle around this activity.
Draw a line to a box and fill that box with the first activity required to work from this premiere event to your goal.
When you reach a moment which requires a decision, draw a diamond around the question which must be posed. Two lines should proceed from this diamond leading to the activity driven by this decision.
Link each activity sequentially. Some may run simultaneously through different departments within your business.
Culminate in the activity which reaches your goal, and draw a circle around this conclusion.

, Look at your completed flow chart with a critical eye to see if there are still any remaining activities which could be cut from the process to increase efficiency, quality, or decrease cost. Can the order be rearranged or can the individual processes be improved to accomplish your objective in a better way?Consider whether any part of your process can be automated.
Step back and get an outside eye by sharing the process with your management team.
Look at your process from the point of view of the customer and consider ways you could improve their experience and overall satisfaction.

, This will provide transparent accountability for each step within the process.


Share the flowchart with your employees to clearly communicate the expectations for achieving your objective.
Give management ownership by involving them in the process of creating the business process.
Allow time and support for management to achieve the objectives assigned to them.

Reflect on the depth and breadth of the theme of your heartbreaking story.,
Think through the specifics of the heartbreaking challenges facing your characters.,
Flesh out your characters.,
Write using your heart, not just your mind.,
Seek some balance.",How to Create a Heartbreaking Story," The theme can be broad or narrow, although the breadth will vary depending on whether you're writing a short story through to a novel. Plan out the basic story on paper, then backfill the heartbreaking moments, situations and themes that you want to introduce. This may help you to see how much the story will focus on a particular heartbreaking moment, or whether it will be a series of hardships leading to a pivotal disappointment or loss.


Do you want the story to have high points as well? Plan these in too, as juxtapositions to the less happy times being experienced by your characters. Or perhaps you don't want that––some characters might be on an ever-continuing downward spiral, whether of their own making or due to circumstances beyond their control.;
, There are many heartbreaking moments, situations and outcomes in life. As the author, your own idea of a heartbreaking moment will drive the reader's sense of it being sad, disappointing or shocking. However, here are some ideas of heartbreaking possibilities to focus on:


Loss of a loved one, a family member, a friend. Be it death, moving away, a rupture through an argument or disagreement, etc., this is top of the heartbreaking possibilities.
Broken romantic love is a good heartbreaking theme that never seems to tire the reader's interest (provided it's handled well, of course).
A series of unfortunate events happening to a good, caring character that just doesn't seem to get a break, such as losing a job, then their house, then failure in their start-up business, followed by a divorce, etc. It happens to people in real life and well-written, it can be heartbreaking as a series of events.
Loss of an animal or inability to save a habitat/piece or land/herd of animals, etc. can be a very heartbreaking theme. Many conservation, animal welfare and environmental themes are heartbreaking, including animals kept away from the wild behind cages, animals like elephants losing their own family members, etc.
Repetition of family behaviors that keep a family down on their luck through the decades/generations can make for a heartbreaking novel. Or, focus on a real family member you've researched who had a very hard life and a sad ending––this can have a real ring of truth because it's someone you really identify with.
Coping with a devastating illness, such as cancer, Alzheimer's, etc., can make for a heartbreaking story.
Homelessness, a descent into drug taking, selling/compromising ones dignity to survive, etc. are other possible themes.

, Name them, work out their motivations, character and loves. Get to know them so that they feel like real, living beings to you and you'll feel sorry for them or identify with them when the challenges begin facing them.

, In other words, allow your feelings to inform your writing. Realize some key things that you may experience when writing a heart-breaker:


You won't feel good. You may feel satisfaction with the manner in which you're crafting your work and writing but feelings-wise, provided you've created a good, substantial story with real characters, you'll identify with them and feel their pain and sorrows. On the plus side, this is a benefit because it will feed back into your descriptions and understanding of the character's progress.
Try to tell the story as you'd imagine your character seeing it, feeling it, experiencing it. However, in doing so, this can exhaust you mentally. You may actually cry––that's fine, you're really identifying with your character and their story. It's advised to take refreshing breaks though.
Avoid cynicism or cliched writing. Some writers of sad tales report blocking themselves off from the feelings, blending together the characters and feeling cynical about the whole genre. This can be a sign of writer's burnout or just focusing too much on the specifics without gaining broader perspective. Again, take breaks, even of a few days or weeks and come back to the story when you feel much refreshed.

, Life goes on regardless of the daily tragedies. This is what gives people hope that they too will return to normalcy some day. But it also gives contrast to your writing work, so that the reader can grasp the rhythm of everyday life continuing around the deep tragedy experienced by your character(s). This is like the background of an artist's canvas and needs to be a part of your tale to give it reality and depth.

Remember that magic is distinguished from science by the measure of mystery in its elements.,
Decide who uses magic in your book's world.,
Figure what the source of magic is in your world.,
Decide on how acts of magic are performed.,
Write a personal guide to your magic system, and use it while writing.,
Write your book and remember to follow your own guidelines!",How to Create a Unique Magic System for Your Book," Even if no characters are aware of it, there should be an underlying logical explanation governing how magic behaves, and like an unrealized science, its true potential should vastly exceed its use in-story. Magic is meant to be mysterious!;
, Can anyone do it? Is it limited to holy people or occultists, or might it have intellectual requirements? Consider this carefully, as magic use will likely have been a hugely influential force in shaping the culture and history of your world. Possibilities include:


Everyone- If everyone is capable of using magic, it should be a commonplace part of day to day living. Consider how technology would change in a world where magic can be used to solve problems instead of technology. Would common things like medicine, hygiene, and machinery exist if magic can fix those same problems?
Educated People- If your magic requires schooling, consider how political and social structures would develop where the wealthy and powerful have an additional supernatural advantage.
Holy People- If your magic is drawn from a divine power, consider how much more powerful churches would be in a world where real miracles can be seen on a regular basis. Consider how faiths would grow and evolve around certain types of magic and vice versa. A faith that professes peaceful intentions would likely attract healers, but could still have a fanatic or violent side.
Occultists- Although functionally similar to religious magic, occult powers are classically secretive and dark. That secrecy could lead to many people not believing in magic, or conversely could lead magic to be stigmatized. If magic is performed in secret, it's easy to assume its practitioners have foul intentions.
Chosen People- Unquestionably the most cliched choice is to have a magic user born with mysterious powers. Special birth circumstances or biological factors could be an explanation, or a higher cosmic power could choose who can use magic. There are other ways to leave magical powers in the hands of a select group of people, so consider a unique way for someone to gain their powers.

, Consider if magic is only able to manipulate existing elements, or if it is able to create new things from scratch. Magic could have its source in otherworldly influence, lost ancient technology, or even a mysterious force that slightly alters the laws of physics. The source of magic may be a mystery in your story, but you should decide on a source so as to maintain a set of laws governing its logic in-story.

, Does one contact spirits, use written or auditory actions, or could it be an internal instinctual process? Imagine someone using magic, and the thoughts and training that would go through their head as they performed it. Is it physically straining, or perhaps does it require some unique cost to perform?

, Remember that even though you don't need to explicitly state it in your story, your magic should follow rules of logic as your world will be far more cohesive and believable if designed logically. Remember that introducing magic leave you susceptible to plot holes, so be very careful to not introduce any magical elements that would 'break' the stories internal logic.


Do your research. Looking into ancient magical beliefs can give you unique ideas as can the influence of other writers, but be careful to not copy what someone else has designed. Your magic system should be uniquely designed to fit your world, and poaching someone else's system will only leave you with a boring and unoriginal idea.
A system of magic with no limitations is not particularly compelling. There should still be a vibrant world with interesting characters driving your story that isn't dependent on magic for everything. Remember that while you might think your magic system is brilliant and interesting your reader will be far more interested in the story and character development, and your magic should have natural limitations and conflicts to further the story.
The laws governing your magic should reflect the structure of your story. A comedic story doesn't need to focus as much on a scientific approach; it could have purposely ambiguous rules or overly-convoluted rules which bring about unintended consequences. On the other hand, a more serious dramatic story should have rules that are likewise serious.
Like any other type of design, the best magical systems have very little complexity but a great deal of depth. Consider having your magic being based around a single element; like the mind or temperature or light/shadow or life/death, and devise a way that endeavoring magic users would expand that simple system to fit their needs.

, If at first your system doesn't work as intended feel free to change it, just be sure you keep a consistent vision, and most importantly a unique and interesting vision.

Create characters.The first thing that you’ll want to do is to create your main characters.,
Think about what you want your characters to achieve.,
Make your characters interesting or memorable.,
Brainstorm an original plot.,
Outline or plan the story.,
Write your story.,
Create the text for your storyboard.This is where you begin to lay out your story in spatial terms.,
Begin the visual layout process.,
Read through your storyboard for consistency.,
Share your completed storyboard.",How to Create an Anime Story," These characters should have a definitive set of characteristics and should have some backstory. Write a summary of each character. Things you might ask yourself when designing characters include:


What does the character look like?
What is the character’s name?
What type of personality does the character have?
Where is the character from?
Does the character have any special powers or abilities?
Is the character a hero or a villain?
What is the nature of the character’s relationships with other characters?
For example, you might choose to write a story about a young boy named Charles who has light brown skin, dark brown eyes, and a wiry body. Perhaps Charles is an orphan who is smart, street wise, and funny. Charles, who lives in a foster home in Boston with his gray cat, Charcoal, is the hero of the story.;
, Each character should have a goal.When you know what the goals of your main characters are, your storyline will reflect this and will read smoothly. Without solid goals, characters seem adrift or pointless to the story. Remember that the characters’ goals are what drive the action of the story and what compel them to do the things they do.Our character, Charles and his cat, Charcoal, want to be adopted into a loving family. This is the goal that motivates all of the actions that Charles and Charcoal undertake.

, Create characters who are original and complex. There are several ways to achieve this goal:Put your characters into opposition with the natural progression of the story
Let your characters wander off the path of least resistance
Put your characters into conflicts or dangerous situations
Let your characters struggle, and in turn, let them learn from their struggles
Introduce characters who are emotional or messy
Give your characters plenty of action to undertake
Create characters who are contradictions of themselves.
For example, Charles has a meet and greet with a potential adopter, but he gets anxiety and runs away from his foster home with Charcoal. By running away, Charles doesn’t get to meet the adopter and prolongs his time in foster care, which puts his goals in opposition with the plot. His action also creates tension and conflict between characters because the foster family is worried about Charles and they are out with the police looking for him.

, Write down some ideas for building a storyline. You may want to bounce your ideas off of your friends or family in order to get some suggestions for the storyline if you are feeling stuck. While you’re creating your plot, remember that you can find inspiration in the simplest idea. When you are creating the plot you will want to figure out:What type of story do you want to tell?
How do you want to tell the story?
Where will the story take place?
What is the main conflict?
In this example, we want to tell the story of how Charles and Charcoal find their forever home. We plan to tell the story in a linear fashion and the story will take place in Boston. The main conflict in our story is finding an adopter who works well with Charles.

, You’ll need to map out the entire story with major plot points before you begin writing details.This allows you to see how the character arcs and plot points will play out and it will display any major plot holes that exist before you begin writing. When writing your plot outline remember:Create a sense of urgency at the opening of your story.
Introduce all of your minor characters at the same time to avoid confusion or lengthy introductions.
Once everything has settled, introduce something new, whether it’s a conflict or a new relationship.
Allow your characters to struggle to resolve their conflicts.
When your characters solve the main problem, allow them to celebrate their victory.
Perhaps our story begins with Charles and Charcoal running away from the foster home to abate Charles’s anxiety over meeting the potential adopter. Charles and Charcoal have an adventure along the way, but they are eventually found by a police officer and returned to the foster home. The adopter thinks that Charles is too much trouble and chooses not to adopt him, but the police officer who found Charles shows interest in Charles. The police officer stops by often to talk with Charles and they eventually become friends. The police officer ends up adopting Charles and everyone lives happily ever after.

, Once you have completed the story outline, which is the backbone of your story, you are ready to begin writing the entire story.This is where the details of the story are fully fleshed out and the dialogue is written. You will likely need to write several drafts of your story before you are happy with it.

, Write the captions below each panel, and identify who is speaking and what they are saying. Storyboards usually contain:Action
Important information
Dialogue

, When the text for the storyboards has been completed, start filling in the empty storyboard panels with your illustrations of each scene.Try to show the action you want to depict through these images. Remember that anime images are usually hand drawn.

, After you’ve finished illustrating your panels, read through your storyboard to make sure that the action, dialogue, and illustrations you’ve created align properly to tell your story. If you find any plot holes or missing dialogue, be sure to edit your storyboard to fill in the gaps.

, Your friends and family will make a great audience for your work.Be sure to share your storyboard with them and be proud of your accomplishment.

Choose a name for your world.,
Dedicate a medium to for notes and imaginings about your world.,
Write some things about your world in the book, some ideas are: maps, flags, currencies or even languages!,
Add more pages to your book, using such things as: newspaper articles, presidential elections, new shops, new residents or news.

,
Decide about the commerce of the world.,
Be creative and open your mind and imagination!

",How to Create an Imaginary World in a Book," Some endings include topia, ville, world or land, e.g., Candyville, Snowland or Frogorb.


It could be anything from Zunish to Pofeland. The possibilities are endless. You could even name after something in real life with more, less, or mixed up letters, e.g., Catt, Houze, Blancett.
If you can't think of a name, consider using a fantasy name generator online, or transforming a name from a favorite book/movie. Just change it around a little bit, like terabithia could become terabeast or East Teraland.;
, A physical notebook works best for most people, but you could use a set of Google docs, Windows Office documents, Open Office documents or some specialty programs with the capability to keep everything in one place.


It is best to keep everything together and in one place. For example, keep all your files together in one folder on your home computer or in a single sketch book, DaVinci style.
Consider a hardback notebook or sketchpad to write in. Although they are more expensive, they last longer, and are more durable. A possible alternative, though, is a binder with filler paper and tabs to help organize concepts, characters, and ideas.
Make a second copy of your work periodically. If the medium you have chosen is electronic, simply copy the files to the cloud or to another device, a usb key, for example, and sync the files every now and then. If your medium is a hard copy, you could scan each page individually to a folder or copy the pages on your printer or at the library.

,


To visualize the world, it might help to ask yourself, ""What inhabits this world at the top of the food chain?"" These animals have the power to either change the world or destroy it. It might be a primitive hominid organism, such as an early form of human life, or it could be a highly advanced society of green-skinned creatures. It can be ancient and oft written about creatures and beings from mythology or nether worlds. You decide!
If the beings are smart enough to work things out, make tools, and solve problems, they should have a government. It could be a monarchy or a democracy. It might even have multiple persons in charge, a council of youngers.
Decide on smaller animals in the food chain. Keep fangs, claws, talons, wings, tentacles, slime, fur, skin, scales, feathers, udders, fins, arms, legs, and tails in mind. There can be small mouse-like critters that have large claws, or there can be tiger-striped beasts with huge fangs and a taste for blood. There are layers and layers of niche worlds within each larger world that might be included. Choose to bring these into your book (or not).

,, Work division of labor (jobs), residents, personalities and other things into the mix. Is someone mean and cranky? Or is someone else nice and kind-hearted, the kind who gives little kids candy?

If I were a traveler passing through and saw >insert race here< in their natural habitat what would I see?,
Put it all together.",How to Create a Fictional World from Scratch," A fantasy filled with magical creatures? A sci-fi futuristic covered with aliens? Anything is possible! Just start with your desired theme and build from there.;
, If it's a fantasy filled with goblins you cannot have an alien come out and attack the main character! You need to set laws, like who can and can't do this, where something will always be found, what is taboo and what not. Consistency is needed. You also need laws of Physics; not just government laws.

, What kind of creatures will be found in this world? Where will they usually live? What are their customs and traditions? What do they look like? Think carefully while making each individual race, this is where some of your laws come in.

, How do your races live together? Do they work as one, have a king rule over them? What language do they speak? What calendar do they use? Are they mostly harvesters? Are they religious or are they aggressive (wars and battles could be frequent)? What are their mating habits; what are their family structures? You can go with something traditional from our own world, or create something entirely unique!

, While variety is good you can't have half the world as a desert and the other as icy planes. In certain places that might be used a lot, (the capital city or the main character's home?) try to plan out where most things are and maybe even some of the residence.

, Think about what type of world this is and would these make sense. In a sci-fi world humans may be killed on sight or in a fantasy world only high-borne nobles may be allowed to practice magic. Make sure these have a point in the story.(If all the characters are going to be rich what is the point of that law?)

,
What sort of life would a normal person (average or most commonly found) live in this world?
If I were someone from a different world what impression would I get when seeing it for the first time?
What sort of knowledge would normal people in this world have?

, Your world should be like a puzzle, when brought together correctly it should fit easily to create a perfect picture. From here, look back and decide what to maybe edit or figure out how this world in general will have its toll on the plot.

List your character’s qualities.,
Research those qualities.,
Make creative references.,
Think about your character’s relation to the setting.,
Keep names consistent.,
Research the setting.,
Research the name.,
Make sure the name is pronounceable.,
Say the name aloud.,
Don’t be too obvious.,
Avoid using apostrophes in your characters’ names.,
Don’t make names too similar.",How to Create a Fantasy Character Name," To find an appropriate name, start by listing the character's qualities, from most- to least-dominant.


Ideally, your character’s name should sound at some level fitting to who they are, so keep this list on hand to help you decide between potential names.;
, Once you have your list of qualities, start doing some research into what historical, mythical, or literary figures have been closely associated with some or all of the character’s dominant qualities.


Look into not only the history, myths, and literature of your own culture but of others as well. Try to look into cultures that have some form of connection to the characters, places, or events of your story.

, When you’ve found an element that relates to your character, take inspiration from that element in naming the character.Try not to be overly obvious. If your inspiration is relatively familiar or well-known, avoid naming your character overtly after whatever historical, mythical, or literary element you’ve chosen. So, for example, don’t name a character modeled after Gandolf “Dolf” or “Randolf” or something equally derivative.
Take inspiration from more subtle associations, or create a name that’s more inventively tied to its inspiration. For example, you might name your character after a little-known monster from Norse mythology. Or you might use a word from another language that evokes an important quality in the character. But try to avoid commonly recognizable foreign-language words, like “Belle” or “Loco.”

, Carefully consider the setting of the story and how the character figures into it. Is the character a native? A foreigner? Upper class? Lower class? The name should reflect their position in the world you’ve created.For example, if the character is a lower-class laborer who’s always lived in the same place, choose a name that seems relatively common and unremarkable. Giving the character an extravagant name or a name that would seem “exotic” by comparison will seem incongruous and risk pulling your reader out of the story.

, Decide whether you’ll be using modern-style names or more archaic- or fantastical-sounding ones. Once you’ve made that choice, stick to it and stay consistent.Be mindful that characters who are supposed to share a common ethnic background should have congruent sounding names. Otherwise it may detract from the believability of the characters in the story.For example, if your story is set in Arthurian-era Wales, your characters should have recognizably old Welsh names, unless they’re specifically from a different place or background.
Particularly if you’re using names typical of or popular among a particular group, don’t randomly mix and match culturally specific names unless you have a good explanation for your logic.

, If your story is set in an historically specific time and place, do your due diligence in researching names appropriate to that setting.


For example, if your story is set in antebellum America, choose a name that would fit in with the time. Avoid obviously incongruous names like “Brooklyn” or “Kimberley.”Similarly, be sure the name is age-appropriate. If the character is elderly, look into names that were popular at the time they would have been born, not at the time in which they’re currently living., Put the character’s potential name through a search engine and make sure it doesn’t have any unforeseen, and possibly unfortunate, associations or connotations.If a character’s name may be somewhat common, double-check that it’s not attached to something or someone you didn’t expect.

, Assuming you want people to feel comfortable saying the character’s name in their head and potentially talking about it with others, shoot for a name that readers will be able to pronounce.If there’s anything tricky or unexpected about how the character’s name should be pronounced, include a subtle reference in the text to how it should be pronounced.

, Sometimes the way things seem or sound in your head is different than how it will seem or sound when said out loud.


Before you commit to a name, make sure it doesn’t sound like anything you don’t want it to and that it doesn’t sound grating or comical., Avoid choosing names that transparently communicate goodness or badness, etc. It’s an overused and overly obvious trope.


For example, don’t name a good character something like “Angel Goodman,” and don’t name a bad character “Damon Blacksoul.”, It’s broadly believed within the fantasy fiction community that inserting apostrophes into a name is overused, trite, and generally frowned upon.


Unless you’re taking inspiration from a specific culture that uses apostrophes in given or surnames in a specific way, don’t drop them in just to make a character seem “different” or “exotic.”, Avoid using names that are too similar either in style, quality, or sound. It will make it difficult for the reader to distinguish between the characters.For example, don’t name all of your main characters using the same initial, like Mary, Mike, Mark, and Molly.
Also watch out for names that rhyme or sound quite similar, like Jake, Drake, and Blake or Mary Loo and Anna Marie.

Think about your personality.,
Introspect.,
Look online for wikis.,
Use a search engine for further searches.,
Look around the wiki once you have found it.,
Understand how the materials you publish to the wiki are licensed.,
Learn about the editing process, both the methods (e.g.,
Take a look at the policies of the wiki, and decide whether you can work within them.",How to Decide Whether to Write for a Wiki," What type of things interest you. What do you like to do? There are wikis for many ability levels and topics.;
, Are there things that you like to do? That you need to do? Some people feel the need to help others, to teach others, to share knowledge, etc.

, Wikimediais a good place to start, but there are wikis for many special-interest topics. For example, if you're a big star wars fan, Wookiepedia might be for you. If gardening is your passion, search for a garden wiki. If possible, choose a subject that you can both contribute to and learn from.

, As DIY (do it yourself) becomes more popular, so do wikis., Make sure that it's a good 'fit'. Does it seem like there are things you could contribute? Did the community notice and appreciate your presence, if you tried editing? Does it seem like there is a thriving community and the wiki is active?

, Most wikis publish under some sort of a free license, meaning that the material there is copyrighted but published under a license that permits sharing, usually with certain conditions.


If you want your writing to be truly ""yours"", a wiki may not be the right place to publish it. On the other hand, if you don't mind having others share and improve your writing, you can learn many things by posting your writing to a wiki and watching how it changes and expands.

, the markup language, the simple code that makes formatting work inside a wiki) and the editing conventions.

, All active wikis will have a bit of politics, simply because a diverse group of contributors typically brings a diverse set of opinions.


Policies on a wiki are not static. They may evolve as needs evolve. While you shouldn't join a wiki planning to make sweeping changes to the policies, you may be able to suggest improvements as you become a respected and established member of the community.

Determine the chief complaint by listening to the patient's explanation and then briefly interpret the direct point of the issue.,
Discuss with the patient how long the issue has been going on and put that information into the assessment report.

,
List all relevant personal information about the patient such as age, gender, and even race.,
Reiterate the patient's complaint and what events may have led up to it in sentence form.

,

,, While they often appear trivial, these issues could play a part in the treatment plan as well as determining the severity of the problem.

,, You need to list not only what in the past history has created improvement, but also what has not worked.

, These can hinder proper healing or correction of the problem.

,, It is also a good idea to mention the results that are hoped for along with the next steps if the first directions do not work.

, Effective, yet brief, documentation of a patient's complaint is what you are after. You must be concise.

,"
"
Collect source material and potential project sources.,
Develop a plan.,
Identify the problem and the goals.,
Start writing.,
Evaluate your rough draft.,
Assess your plan for originality.",How to Write a Medical Research Proposal," In this initial stage, you will be looking at how you will implement a project and from where you will get relevant data.;
, In writing a medical research proposal, experts recommend starting with an abstract that is informed by well-thought-out ideas on comprehensive planning for the research project. This includes proposed methods, overall study design, logistics, a schedule or timeline and other aspects of what you will be doing if the project is approved.

, Using the word ""problem"" in the context of a medical research proposal is not quite like the common use of the opposite words ""problem"" and ""solution."" Here, the problem defines the existing situation or general scenario, where goals and objectives seek to use research to illuminate a particular medical phenomenon or general scientific reality.

, Develop all of these ideas and use a good comprehensive approach to blend all of the above into one single proposal.


Take advantage of a good format. The style and format of your medical research proposal is crucial to its success. Take a look at what others have done to guide you in the creation of your own proposal.
Use white space and create concrete elements of your proposal. Experts recommend using labeled elements like an introduction, plan, method module and conclusion in order to make your medical research proposal look good, and to keep all of the appropriate data in the right places.
Approach your document with a concern for style. Many experts who advise individuals on writing these documents recommend keeping the vocabulary reasonably clear and avoiding wordy, vague sentences that may confuse the reader. Also keep an eye out for good transitional elements to make your research proposal flow smoothly.

, With a draft of the medical research proposal in hand, go back over the document and read through it to determine its overall effectiveness.


Look for internal consistency. In order to be fairly successful, your medical research proposal should be coherent, and the ideas that are presented should be presented clearly and consistently throughout each element.

, One thing that helps a research proposal succeed is its originality from prior research and existing projects. Make sure that yours has an angle that will appeal to those who are in authority to approve projects.

Add your Senator’s address.,
Type your salutation.,
Explain why you are writing.,
Support your opinion.,
Add personal details.,
Thank your Senator for their time.,
Include a signature block.,
Revise your letter.,
Edit the letter.,
Send the letter.,
Read your response.",How to Write a Letter to Your United States Senator," There are many reasons why you might contact your Senator. However, most people write because they want to share their opinion on something. For example, many constituents write their representatives for the following reasons:


You want them to vote yes or no on a bill under consideration in the Senate.
You want them to introduce a bill or hold hearings on a topic.
You want them to approve or vote against the President’s appointees to the Supreme Court or cabinet.;
, You will appear credible if you can speak confidently and accurately about an issue. If possible, you should find facts or statistics that you can cite in the letter. Remember to write down your sources, because you will want to list them in the letter.You should also know the name and number of the bill you are writing about.


A good place to start with research is to do a basic Internet search. Spend an hour or so getting a general feel for the issue.
If you need help, you can visit your local library and ask a librarian.
Not all sources are the same. You want to use unbiased sources, such as government reports. University websites are another good source of credible information.

, Visit this website: https://www.senate.gov/general/contact_information/senators_cfm.cfm?OrderBy=state. You can search by state if you don’t know your Senator’s name.


To get your Senator’s email address or fax number, click on their name. You will be taken to their website, which should contain this information.

, You should type the letter instead of writing it in longhand. Open a blank word processing document and set the font to something readable, such as Times New Roman or Arial.Set the font to 12 point size.


Use block-style paragraphing, which looks more professional. With block style, you don’t indent for each paragraph. Instead, you put a blank line between each paragraph.

, You should put the date in the upper left-hand corner. Write out the month, e.g., “January 12, 2017.”

, Move down two lines and insert your Senator’s name and address. You should spell out your Senator’s full name in the address block. For example, “Honorable Susan Collins.”


You have the option of putting a bolded title after the Senator’s address. The title would be centered between the left-and right-hand margins. For example, you could write “Re: Neil Gorsuch Nomination to the Supreme Court.” A title might be helpful if your letter is very lengthy. Otherwise, you won’t need one.

, Move down two more lines and insert your salutation: “Dear Senator” is standard.You could also write “Dear Senator Collins.” Put a colon after the name.

, In the first paragraph, explicitly state why you are writing to your Senator. You can also introduce yourself, especially if your job is related to why you are writing.


For example, you can write: “I am writing to urge you to vote against Judge Neil Gorsuch, who is President Trump’s nominee to the Supreme Court. I do not believe he respects the role our judiciary plays in protecting civil liberties. For that reason, he could imperil freedoms all Americans cherish.”
Alternately, you could write, “I am a lawyer in southern Maine. I am writing to encourage you to support Judge Neil Gorsuch for the Supreme Court. As a practicing attorney, I had the pleasure of meeting Judge Gorsuch at an ABA conference a couple years ago and was immediately impressed with his integrity and intelligence.”

, Usually, you will write a letter to ask your Senator to vote a certain way. In the second paragraph, explain why. Remember to maintain a professional tone and avoid profanity or displays of anger.Mention specifics, if possible.


For example, you could write: “I believe Judge Gorsuch is the wrong choice for the Supreme Court. The more I have read about Judge Gorsuch, the more worried I am that he will overturn long-standing precedents in the Supreme Court, involving such issues as freedom of speech and protections for criminal defendants. These civil liberties are the cornerstone of a functioning democracy.”
Avoid relying on arguments made in a form letter. For example, you might belong to a reproductive rights group, which sends out a form letter telling you what to say and what sources to cite. You should make your own argument.
You can use more than one paragraph to make your argument, if necessary. However, try to keep your letter to one page.

, Another good idea is to explain how the issue will touch you personally.For example, if the Senate is considering a farm bill, you can explain how not passing the bill will affect your family farm.


You don’t need a sob story. Instead, you need a few personal details that let your Senator know how their vote will have real-world consequences.

, In the final paragraph, you want to thank them for reading your letter and considering your viewpoint. Also reiterate that the issue is important to you.


Sample language might read: “Thank you for hearing my point of view on the Gorsuch nomination. The Supreme Court is a critical institution, and I hope you will vote against his nomination to maintain the independence of the judicial branch.”

, You should type “Sincerely,” and then leave four lines of blank space. You will put your name, address, phone number, and email address in a block.Remember to sign in the blank space using a dark ink pen.

, Put your letter aside for a day or so and look at it with fresh eyes. Does your letter make sense? Have you said something in an unclear manner? If so, tinker with your sentences and paragraphs so that you are clearer.


Also revise to make the letter as brief as possible.People are very busy. You might be able to combine sentences or paragraphs. Cut any unnecessary words.

, Typos, missing words, and other errors will reduce your credibility. Read over the letter to find these errors before sending. You can edit your letter by doing the following:Ask another person to read the letter to find mistakes.
Read the letter backwards. Start with the final sentence. Read it and then move to the sentence before. In this way, you’ll focus carefully on each sentence and find any errors.
Read the letter out loud. Our eyes tend to correct errors when we read silently to ourselves. By reading out loud, you might stumble over an error.

, Make a copy of the letter for your records. You can mail the original letter using regular mail. However, you may want to use certified mail, return receipt requested. The receipt will serve as proof that it was delivered.


You might want to email or fax the letter instead. If time is of the essence, fax the letter instead of mailing it or sending an email.Regular snail mail will take too long, and Senator’s in-boxes are usually flooded with emails. Remember to include a cover sheet with your fax.

, Often, Senators won’t respond to letters. However, when they do, they send standardized responses. Don’t be offended.Remember to check if your Senator voted how you wanted. If they did, send a quick email thanking them. Senators usually receive nothing but negative mail from their constituents. They will appreciate a positive response.

Introduce yourself and your purpose.,
Lay out the facts of the harassment.,
Explain how you responded.,
Propose a solution.,
Avoid using offensive language.,
Send the letter to HR.",How to Write a Letter of Complaint to Human Resources2," Sexual harassment is one form of workplace harassment, but it isn’t the only form. You can harassed on the basis of sex, race, color, religion, national origin, disability, age, or genetic information.Consider the following behaviors, which might qualify as harassment:

derogatory remarks or slurs based on the protected characteristic
intimidation
threats and physical assaults
telling offensive jokes

, You’ll want to give Human Resources as much information as possible. Accordingly, you should sit down and write down the following:Who harassed you and their relationship to you. You can be harassed by a supervisor or by a co-worker. Also, the harassment can come from someone as the same sex as you.
When each harassing act occurred—date, time, and location. Also write down what the person said or did, and how you responded.
Who witnessed the harassment. Write down their names and job titles.
What tangible evidence you have of the harassment. For example, you may have harassing emails, voice mails, or notes.

, Set up your letter like a standard business letter. If you know the name of the contact in Human Resources, then include that in the salutation. Call and ask if you don’t know., In the first paragraph, you should give HR some idea why you are writing to them. For example, you should state that you want to lodge a complaint about harassment and identify your harasser.

, Be clear and get to the point.You want to provide enough information that HR can see there is a harassment problem that needs investigation. Explain where and when the harassment occurred, as well as who witnessed it.


Describe the incidents in chronological order, which is the easiest for people to understand.
In some larger organizations, HR might not know everyone, such as a coworker. You should identify who they are, e.g., “Jason Jones, who works in the cubicle next to me, saw our boss make the obscene gesture.”
Stick to the facts. You shouldn’t make any kind of allegation or charge that you can’t back up with proof, such as your written memories or a witness. For example, don’t speculate about your boss or coworker’s motivation for what they said or did. You don’t know that.

, This is legally important. Harassment is only illegal if it is unwelcome.If you welcomed the harassing behavior, then you haven’t been harassed according to the law. You should state what you did or said in response. For example, you might have told someone not to touch you.

Also explain if you tried to resolve the issue. For example, you might have met with your harasser to ask them to stop making sexually-explicit jokes.
Remember to explain how the harassment made you feel. For example, you might have had trouble working in a team with the person who was harassing you, which caused you to skip work or perform below your usual standards.

, At the end of the letter, you should state what you want from HR. For example, you might want to be transferred to a different department. You can also request that HR investigate and punish your harasser. However, you should probably avoid telling HR to “fire” your harasser. That’s their judgment to make.


Remember to end the letter by thanking HR for their time. Insert “Best” or “Sincerely,” and then sign the letter.

, Although you may be angry, you should try not to show it. Using foul language can only undermine your ability to get help. In fact,, the person reading the letter might become angry at you.Instead of writing, “I’m so pissed right now,” write “I am angry.”
Instead of “my boss is a bigot,” write “Mr. Jones intimidates me by repeatedly yelling at me using racial slurs.”

, After you sign your letter, make a copy before sending it. Also hold onto any supporting documentation, such as emails, voicemails, notes, or witness statements. You may need to share them if HR opens an investigation."

Identify why you want to complain.,
Gather facts.,
Set up your letter.,
Begin the letter.,
Provide details.,
Explain how you have handled the issue.,
End the letter with a request for help.",How to Write a Letter of Complaint to Human Resources3," There are many issues you should bring to the attention of Human Resources. For example, you might want to complain about the following:

You haven’t been paid properly: your company might be withholding pay, not calculating it properly, etc.
You have not received what you have been promised under your employment contract.
Your boss or coworkers are bullying you. Some abuse doesn’t qualify as workplace harassment. Legally, harassment must be based on a protected characteristic, such as race, gender, religion, age, etc.Nevertheless, someone might bully you simply because they don’t like you, and you should report them.
For example, a coworker might say something that makes you uncomfortable. A random sexually-charged joke might not qualify as sexual harassment. However, there’s no reason to put up with it. You can report inappropriate behavior that makes you uncomfortable.

, You have to imagine the HR employee who reads your letter. They might not even know who you are, and they have no reason to believe you. For these reasons, you’ll need to fill your complaint letter with facts. Gather the following:

What happened, when and where. If you’ve been bullied, write down the details.
Who is involved (your immediate supervisor, coworker, employee in a different part of the organization, etc.)
How you attempted to resolve the issue. Did you talk to a supervisor? Ask HR for help already? Write down the dates and the names of who you spoke with. Also summarize any responses you received.

, You’ll want to write using a business letter format. Properly format your word processing document by choosing a legible font size and style (Times New Roman 12 point works well). Also use block paragraphing.


Contact HR and ask who to address your letter to. Your salutation should read “Dear Mr. Jones” or something equivalent.

, It’s best to get right to the point. State that you want to make a complaint and identify the substance of the complaint. If you work in a large organization, you should probably identify yourself as well.

For example, you can begin with something like the following: “I am a data processing clerk in our accounting office. I’m writing to complain that my total pay has been inaccurate for two months now.”

, Give the reader enough information so that they can effectively investigate.If you haven’t been paid properly, identify the pay periods. If you’re being bullied, provide a chronological discussion of the major bullying incidents. You can provide more detail later.


You can write something like the following: “There have been three major bullying incidents” and then write “Additionally, there has been low-level bullying, which I am happy to discuss in person with you.”

, Let HR know what attempts you have made to fix the problem and why you are unsatisfied with the results. If you’ve spoken to a supervisor, state so. Remember to provide dates.

For example, you can write, “On January 12, I told my supervisor, Kevin Jones, about my pay being wrong. Although he said he would investigate, my pay hasn’t changed and he doesn’t seem too worried about it. We are now approaching the two-month mark and I am still not being paid properly.”
Also let HR know how you have been feeling. For example, if you are being bullied, briefly explain how it has affected your health. Identify if you had to take time off or had to see a doctor., Ask HR to investigate and to contact you if they have questions. Sign your letter beneath the word “Sincerely” and keep a copy of the letter for your records.

If you don’t think HR has your phone number, you can include that as well.

Meet with an HR investigator.,
Participate in mediation.,
File a harassment charge with the EEOC.,
Hire an attorney.",How to Write a Letter of Complaint to Human Resources4," Depending on the severity of your complaint, HR might appoint an investigator to gather more information. You may need to sit down for an interview. Also provide supporting documentation promptly.

Although you may be told that the interview is confidential, you should expect many other people in the organization to know what you have written.
You may be disappointed with the resolution HR reaches. For example, don’t be surprised if management is let off the hook with only a slap on the wrist., Human Resources might have a mediation program you can use to resolve disputes. In mediation, you and the person you are having problems with will meet with the mediator, who is a neutral third party. The mediator isn’t a judge. However, they can help each side talk and listen to each other.The purpose of mediation is to resolve the dispute voluntarily so that each side can walk away feeling good.
If the harassment has been severe, you shouldn’t feel compelled to mediate a dispute with your employer. Instead, you should find an attorney and discuss next steps.
Your employer might offer “conciliation,” which is like mediation. However, the conciliator is more involved in decision-making than a mediator, who lets the parties decide a proper resolution.

, The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) investigates claims of workplace harassment. You can file a complaint (“charge”) with them. You may also complain to a state agency that investigates harassment.

Avoid delay. You have 180 days from the date of the harassment to file a discrimination charge with the EEOC.Your state agency may give you more time.
Generally, federal EEOC law cover most employers. But some smaller employers might only be covered by state law. If your employer has 15 or fewer employees, you may need to complain to your state agency. Use the Assessment System at the EEOC website to check whether you should direct your complaint to a state agency: https://egov.eeoc.gov/eas/.

, You need expert assistance to protect your rights. A lawyer can help you if your employer retaliates against you, continues to harass you, or refuses to pay owed wages. Contact your local or state bar association and ask for a referral. Visit the American Bar Association to find your nearest bar association: http://shop.americanbar.org/ebus/abagroups/divisionforbarservices/barassociationdirectories/statelocalbarassociations.aspx.

Ask for an employment lawyer. When you call to set up a consultation, ask how much the lawyer charges.

Prepare for your consultation by gathering helpful documents, such as a copy of your complaint letter to HR.
At the consultation, you will discuss whether you have a legal case. Not all harassing conduct rises to the level of legal harassment. For example, one off-color joke probably doesn’t qualify.

Proofread.,Here is an example:",How to Write a Letter Requesting Sponsorship," What are you hoping to achieve with the sponsorship letter – specifically? What do you want the business to do? What are you using the sponsorship for and why does it matter? Before you write a sponsorship letter, you should know the answers to these questions.


Sponsorship letters should be specific and focused. If they are too vague or you don’t know what you’re seeking or why, they won’t be very effective.
Understand why you want to meet the goals. Sponsorship requests are more successful if they are accompanied with a sense of purpose or passion. Convince people why it's worth giving time or money to this cause, perhaps by telling them a story about how the cause has helped someone or the community ;
, Who might have a motivation to support your cause? Maybe there’s a business owner who has a personal reason to support your goals. Or maybe there’s a non-profit that’s supported similar missions. Who has given to similar events? You need to research the field.


Make sure to include businesses or people on the list with whom you or others who work with you have a personal connection. Never underestimate the value of personal connections. Don’t overlook small businesses or those that don’t have storefronts. They might be willing to give, too. Remember that you can play up the ""local"" angle. Hometown businesses often see an advantage in remaining connected to their communities.
If you are working on a team, divvy up the businesses on the list and give each team member the task of contacting some of them, so each gets personal outreach.

, Sponsorship can take many different forms. Before you write a sponsorship letter, you need to determine what you’re asking for.


Cash or in-kind donations are both possibilities. In-kind donations mean the business donates materials or products that can be used at the event instead of just giving money. Sometimes these take the form of services not tangible goods.
Perhaps you are willing to take volunteer work instead of a product. Either way, you need to be very clear in what you're seeking - specifically.

, Often sponsorship letters will allow people to choose from different sponsorship levels. This allows businesses to give when they don’t have as much expendable income as larger firms.


Decide sponsorship levels. You should clearly outline the different benefits achieved by different levels of sponsorship. People who give more should get more.
An advertising banner, a public announcement about the company or sponsorship, and the company’s logo appearing on a website or in promotional materials or programs are all examples of benefits you could offer.

, Don’t ever address the cover letter to the generic “to whom it may concern.” That seems too impersonal.


Often, the proper person will be the person who runs the company’s Human Resources Department or its CEO. You should call the company or look on its website and determine who handles sponsorships. Don’t guess at this. To be effective, the sponsorship letter absolutely must be addressed to the right person. Get the spelling of their name and their title right. You should also figure out if the organization has a charitable giving policy so you don’t waste your time and can align your request with the policy. , You can find many templates for sponsorship request letters on the Internet. Some are paid services, but many are free. You should read these letters to get a sense of the format and content.


Don’t copy a sample letter too closely, though. You need to tailor your letter to the organization you’re writing to so it sounds personal and not too formulaic. For example, if you know a CEO has a personal background that relates to your cause, you can personalize the letter to that person. You should know the background of the people or companies you’re soliciting, and you should tailor the letters so they feel personal.

, Tone will depend on audience. However, you should always be professional and not too colloquial in a sponsorship letter.


Put the letter on formal letterhead that has the logo and name of your organization. This will make your request look more professional. If you're asking for a sponsorship for yourself, you could still create professional letterhead that has your name at the top in a nice font.
If you’re writing to a business or other organization, more formal is best. If you’re writing to a family member or friend, you could be less formal, but you still shouldn’t be so casual you sound disrespectful. Whipping off an informal email is unlikely to get good results in either case. , A typical sponsorship letter uses the format seen in many business letters. You should use the right structure or it won’t look professional.


Start the letter with the date, and then the sponsor's name and address.
Then, after a space, put the salutation: Dear (Name of the person) and a comma.
Keep it short. Keep the sponsorship letter on one page. People are unlikely to have time to read more. Most people being solicited will give about a minute to your sponsorship letter. So in addition to keeping it on one page, make sure the language is concise and clear. Send it snail mail. Email requests make it seem like you didn't take much care when sending it.

, At the end of the sponsorship letter, you should thank them for their consideration. Be sure to add breaks between paragraphs and leave a space for your hand-written signature.


End with a respectful, professional salutation, such as: Respectfully, and then your name and title. Sign it personally.
Include other materials. You might want to provide a printed flyer with your sponsorship letter to provide background on your event or company. This will provide additional credibility and may make the business feel more comfortable in supporting you.
Similarly, if your organization has received news coverage, you could include a sample news article to back up what you’ve done.

, In the opening paragraph of the letter, you should immediately introduce yourself or your company and your cause – specifically. Don’t beat around the bush. People need to be hooked right out of the gate.


Don’t assume people know who you are or what your organization does. Explain those things, clearly. Begin with a description of the company (if it's a corporate letter) or yourself (if it's for personal sponsorship). For example, such-and-such firm is a nonprofit organization committed to rehabilitation... etc.
Highlighting a few accomplishments right away will make it clear why it’s not a risk to give you sponsorship. Make it very clear how the money will be specifically used.
In the second paragraph or first, you need to make the direct request for sponsorship and explain why you are seeking it.

, In order to give you sponsorship, a company or person needs to be convinced they will benefit from doing so. So in the middle paragraphs of the letter, clearly communicate the benefits – not to you, but to them.


If the sponsors will get good publicity out of the sponsorship, for example, explain how. Be very specific: Will the event be televised? How many people will be attending? Will there be VIPS? If other prominent companies or their competitors are sponsoring your event, you might want to mention that.
Give the sponsors options. They will like the fact they have different choices to match their individual needs or budgets.

, This means including a few numbers – audience size, for example, or demographics of those they will reach.


Also don't forget to thread in an element of emotional appeal - a personal story of someone who will be helped, for example, if said briefly (in a sentence or two) can be very moving.
Explain how you will give the sponsors recognition for their sponsorship. Perhaps they can have free booth space at your event in exchange for sponsorship. Provide the essential details of the sponsorship deal that they will need to make their decision. Don’t forget to include contact information. You might want to also include a self-addressed, stamped envelope to make it easier for them to respond. Don’t forget to include the date you need a response by.
Ask the sponsors how they prefer to be recognized. For example, how do they want their name to appear and do they want to be recognized? Offer possibilities but never assume. Ask.

, You should provide some concrete details in the letter to back up your organization or event.


For example, if you’re writing a letter for a charity, you should explain the background of the charity, such as when it was founded, who runs it, who it serves, and any awards or accomplishments it’s received.
Show don’t tell. Don’t just tell us the group or event are good or worthy. Convince us through showing details – evidence that backs up why or how the event or group are good or worthy. Evidence is more persuasive than superlatives, generally. , Just sending off a letter to a company is not the most personal way to develop a connection. Although a sponsorship letter is a good idea, follow up in a more personal manner.


You could call or stop by if you don’t get a response in 10 days. Remember though that many CEOS especially will be very busy and could be annoyed. So you might want to schedule an appointment or call first.
Make sure that you convey excitement about your project. Avoid anything negative. You don’t want to sound like you’re begging or trying to put a guilt trip on them about donating..
If the answer is “maybe,” don’t feel bad about following up. Just don’t do it immediately or too much or you might become annoying.
Never be presumptuous. Don’t assume they will give you a meeting or sponsorship. Simply thank them for their consideration. Don’t forget to send a thank you note if you get a sponsorship.

, You can sabotage your chances for sponsorship if you don’t proofread your letter. Letters riddled with spelling or grammar errors don’t seem professional. And why would someone want their name attached to an unprofessional event?


Check punctuation. Many people don’t know how to use commas or apostrophes properly. The little things matter here.
Print out a copy of your letter, set it down, and read the hard copy in a few hours. Sometimes the eye gets so wedded to online content that it can be easier to miss typos if you’re reading it online.
Make sure you send it with proper postage in a professional business looking envelope. ,"

Keep a copy of the letter.",How to Write a Letter to Your Attorney," There are many reasons why you may wish to contact your attorney. Understanding that reason is key to determining whether a letter is the appropriate course of action and, if so, to writing a letter that clearly communicates your message.If you merely wish to inquire about the status of your case, a formal letter is not necessary. Your lawyer is obligated to keep you reasonably informed about the status of your case and will likely contact you whenever there is news to report. If you have not heard from your lawyer in a while, send him a quick email or leave him a voice mail message asking for an update.If your lawyer has requested that you write him a letter, follow his instructions his exactly. For example, if he sends you a list of questions to answer, simply answer his questions one by one as clearly as possible. Do not worry about formatting the letter in any special way or typing it unless your attorney requests that you do so.
If your lawyer has asked that you write him a letter giving your consent to his requesting documents on your behalf, you should ask your lawyer to write the letter for you. This kind of letter may need to meet certain criteria to be effective and your lawyer is the one who will know what the letter needs to include. Your only role should be to revise and sign the letter once you have received a draft.
If you are concerned your lawyer is not working on your case, write him a polite but firm letter explaining your concerns. If you feel more comfortable emailing or calling him, that would be fine as well. You are under no obligation to express your concerns in a formal letter.If you want to fire your lawyer, send him a letter that clearly states you are terminating the relationship and that the lawyer is to cease working on any pending matters. You should also ask that he return all of the documents regarding your case and pay you refund for any unfinished work.;
, Once you have confirmed that writing a letter will serve your purpose, write an opening paragraph that explains why you are writing and stating any questions or requests.If you wish to fire your attorney, state that clearly in your opening paragraph: ""I'm writing to terminate our attorney-client relationship.""
If you have a legal question for your attorney, ask it up front: ""I'm writing to ask you a question about my immigration case. I'm wondering how my departure from the U.S. will affect my legal residence status.""

, Once you have explained your purpose, the proceeding paragraphs should explain your reasons for making a particular request or asking a particular question.


If you begin your letter with a paragraph stating that you would like to terminate your relationship with your attorney, write one or two paragraphs that explain why you are unhappy with him. Wherever possible, refer to specific examples.
If you are writing your attorney with a question, provide your attorney with the necessary context for understanding why you are asking your question. For example, ""The reason I am asking this question is that I'm planning to leave the United States next month to care for my mother who is sick.""

, If you are making a request, be sure to repeat it in the final paragraph. This will remind your attorney of what you are asking from him.


For example: ""For these reasons, I would like to terminate our attorney-client relationship and I ask that you return my file to me as soon as possible.""

, Your main goal in writing to your attorney should be to communicate your message as clearly as possible. Do not worry about impressing your attorney by using big words or complicated sentences. You want to make sure your attorney understands what you are saying so that he can comply with your request.For example, instead of “enclosed herewith please find,” just say, “I’ve enclosed” or “Here is. . . .”

, Think about your purpose in writing the letter and include only the information necessary to achieving that purpose. Anything beyond the essential information could confuse your attorney and cause him to misunderstand what you are requesting.Avoid unnecessary tangents, like telling your attorney about problems you have been having with your wife, unless they relate to your case.

, Either format is appropriate for a formal business letter.Full block format means that all elements of the letter are left-justified so that the start of each line is at the left-hand margin.
Modified block format means that some elements of the letter are shifted over to the right.

, At the top of the page, on either the left corner (if using full block format) or the right corner (if using modified block format) write out your address.If applicable, also include your e-mail address and cell phone number.

, On the left side of the page, directly beneath your address, write the date of the day you are writing the letter.The date should be placed on the left regardless of whether you are using full block or modified block format.
Write the date in word rather than number form, as in June 8, 2015 instead of 6/8/15.
Allow for two spaces beneath the date.

, On the left side of the page, two spaces beneath the date, write your attorney's full name and address.


Your attorney's name and address should be placed on the left regardless of whether you are using full block or modified block format.
If there is a paralegal that is working on your specific case, you may wish to write to include it in parenthesis next to the attorney's name.

, Beneath your attorney's name and address, on the left hand side, include a subject line referencing your case number.Highlight the subject line in bold so that it appears prominently on the page.
If you don't have a case number, write out your name (or the name of the main client on the case) in the subject line. This will help the attorney and the attorney's staff locate your file.

, By way of introduction, write out a phrase greeting your attorney by his last name.For example: ""Dear Mr. Jones"" or ""Dear Ms. Fisher""
Position the greeting on the left side of the page.
Follow the greeting with a colon, i.e. ""Dear Ms. Fisher:""

, If you have already prepared a draft of the letter, simply insert the text of that draft.


Lead with the main purpose of your letter and then explain the reasons for your question or request.Be specific when referencing relevant information including names, dates and places. The more information you include, the better your attorney will be able to assist you.
Keep to one main topic per paragraph, even if you have several issues to discuss in the letter.
End the letter in two or three sentences as politely as you can, even if your letter to your attorney is a complaint about the service you have received.

, End the letter with an appropriate closing phrase.""Sincerely"" is an example of an appropriate closing phrase.
Place a comma after the closing phrase (i.e. ""Sincerely,"").
The closing should be aligned with your address. If you are using full block format, place it on the left side. If you are using modified block format, place it on the right.

, After your closing phrase, write out your full name.Align your name on the same side as your closing phrase. If you are using full block format, place it on the left side. If you are using modified block format, place it on the right.
Insert several blank lines between your closing phrase and your name.

, Print out the letter, then use a blue or black pen to sign your name between the closing (i.e. ""Sincerely"") and your full name typed name., Print an extra copy of the letter to keep for your personal records. That way, if the letter gets lost in the mail or your attorney denies having received it, you will have proof that you sent it.

Start by gathering the information you need.,
Write a rough draft that you have absolutely no intention of being your final copy.,
Plan it out carefully.,
In the top right corner put the date you're writing the letter.,
Think of the first paragraph as the greeting, like a hand shake.,
Give each complaint its own paragraph.,
End on a positive note.,
Sign it, then under your name add your contact information.,
Leave the letter alone and let it simmer for a day or so.,
When you're satisfied, send the letter.",How to Write a Letter of Complaint to a Mental Health Facility,"  Have your discharge papers handy, your appointment card, as well as whatever else you acquired during your visit or stay.  Use pen and paper or an open document to list as much information as you want to include. 


Most mental health hospital wards will have an obvious sign and suggestion box for the patient advocate.  You'll want to jot that information down; she should get a copy of your letter. 
You should also send a copy of the letter to the doctor you had, even if your complaint is about her. 
Third you should send a letter to someone on the facility staff management team.  Their information may be hard to obtain, so if all else fails you can call the facility and ask who the head of nursing is or who the head of social work is. 
At the end of this step you should have 3 names and 1 or 2 addresses.  Postal mail seems to make more of an impact than email, but if you need to email that is okay as long as you are sure you have the right email addresses, and go for the CC option over the BCC one, that way all recipients are aware of each other and they'll be more inclined to speak about your letter than if they didn't know who else had a copy.;
,  In your rough draft go ahead and express any anger or snarkiness you may have bottled up from your experience with the facility.  You need to get it out, and should really not send it to the facility, so express yourself. 


Remember to include a basis for the situations with who, what, when, where, and how answers for the issues.  For instance:  Matt (who) was a jerk to me (what) during art group (when/where) by only allowing me crayons (how).

, A letter of complaint in it's best form follows this layout:


To: including name, position, department, facility. 
First paragraph of pleasantries, only alluding to the issues to come. 
A paragraph per complaint and suggestion. 
Then ending on another pleasant note. 
The first and last paragraph (and perhaps a middle one depending on the length) being pleasant is very important.  A wall of complaint is more likely to be ignored than a well managed emotional path through out the letter.  So let it out in your rough draft, you need to be nice for the next copy!

,  On the left write who the letter is to, in this case the patient advocate, the doctor, and the head of social work.  Just like how it's better to CC than to BCC, it's best to list the intended recipients right at the top.  Give them a line each with their name, title, department.


Occasionally you might add their phone number on their line as well.  It may encourage communication between your letter's recipients. 
List this information in a postal letter and also emails.  If you don't write who the emails are being sent to it's not certain that the recipients will know each other based on email alone.

,  Use the first paragraph to introduce yourself, and include some positive information on the facility.  Let them know when you were there and allude to an issue.


Admitted to facility: ""From August 14 through August 18 of this year I was on Ward C of ______ (the facility's name).  During that time I received many helpful therapy lessons that have stayed with me thus far.  The schedule was helpful as were most of the staff.  In particular I bonded with Tiffany and found her to be very helpful.  Unfortunately all my experiences at _____ ( facility name) were not as good.""
Outpatient:  ""On the date of ______ I had a 2:15 appointment with Jason.  I've found him to be very helpful, and I was actually looking forward to talking with him.  Unfortunately he was out sick that day and I was put in an interesting situation.""

,  Some issues are linked and can go in the same paragraph, just try to realize each paragraph should represent a new idea.  When you have multiple issues consider writing about them each separately to the letter then pasting them in different positions.  Remember that you're taking your reader on a journey.  It's best to get your biggest issue out first, but for your lesser issues you could either cascade from worst to least, or put some of the lesser issues between large ones to break the intensity up a bit.


Admitted:  ""While I found Tiffany very nice, there were other staff members who I felt were rude.  On the 15th I attended the art therapy hosted by Matt.  Normally I enjoy art projects, and I was eager to try something new.  We lined up for our projects.  When it was my turn Matt handed me a coloring book and crayons.  I told him that I'd prefer working with beads and he told me to go sit down.  Please note that the people both in front and behind me were allowed to choose their project.  Feeling so disrespected, I left the therapy which I usually enjoy the most.  That wasn't the only time Matt was rude in a way that I felt was specific to me.  During one of our courtyard breaks Matt told me where to sit, though everyone else sat where they wanted and walked around.  I felt singled out by Matt then and on other occasions as well.""
Outpatient: ""When I told the secretary that I had arrived for my 2:15 with Jason she threw her hands in the air and loudly expressed, ""He's not even here!""  I wasn't sure if I had the right day, so I asked and was rudely told that he was out that day.  I asked if I could reschedule which was followed by an awkwardly long silence as she typed, I began to think she forgot about me and started to leave when she barked at me, ""Where are you going?""  She said she could get me in with Rodney at 2:25.  I wasn't interested in starting with a new therapist so I began to tell her I'd rather reschedule for Jason.  She angrily insisted that according to my insurance I was required to attend therapy that day.  That didn't sound right to me, but I didn't want to cause a scene.  Around 2:45 I went back to the window and asked her if Rodney was running behind schedule.  She clapped her hand over her mouth and said, ""Oh no.  I forgot to tell him!""  I then insisted I be rescheduled with Jason, which suddenly was no longer an issue.""

,  Note that if you end on a negative note you are less likely to get a response, or anything changed.  If your goal in writing this letter is to express your concerns in a way that leads to discussion and change end positively.  If you don't want a response and don't care about changing anything why are you writing the letter?


Admitted: ""My time at ____ (facility name) helped me when I really needed it.  I am grateful to the helpful staff.  I even liked your cafeteria food!  I just hope positive change can come from my negative experiences.""
Outpatient: ""Your facility is very busy, I realize that.  This was the first time I've experienced such disrespect at ___ (facility name).  I know I will continue my services with Jason.""

,


""Regards, ______ (Your signature), ____ (your contact information)""
""Best Regards ________""
""Looking forward to your response, _______""

,  When you go back to read it after having a bit of time away from it you're more likely to catch any grammar or spelling mistakes you may have made.  You may also think of better ways of saying some things and want to tweak it a little bit.

,  Remember if you can easily print and send by postal mail that is the best way, three envelopes, three stamps.  It's easier and cheaper to send an email, but correspondence of this sort through postal mail remains more professional.

Pay attention to complaints about pets. Many landlords are hesitant to rent to pet owners. Were there complaints about the tenant’s dog or other pet?

, You should also note in your letter whether the tenant left the property in good condition. Was it clean? Did you need to make repairs? Did the tenant cause a pest infestation? Tell the tenant you want to check the property before writing your letter.


So long as the tenant is still living with you, you must give them notice before entering the apartment. Check your state law for how much advance notice you must give.

, Writing a negative reference for a bad tenant invites headaches. For example, the tenant might be angry that the reference isn’t positive. Also, they may dispute the accuracy of your letter and claim the negative letter prevented them from getting a place.


You can refuse to write a character reference altogether, which might be the best choice in this situation.Similarly, you shouldn’t give a bad tenant a positive reference letter. If you lie to a potential landlord, you could be legally responsible., Set up your letter as a standard business letter. If you have letterhead, you can use it when you print your letter. Otherwise, include your address at the top of the letter.


Set your font to something most people can read. Times New Roman or Arial 12-14 point is acceptable.

, You probably don’t know who the tenant will show your letter to. Accordingly, you should write “To Whom It May Concern” as a salutation. Put a colon after the salutation., Your letter doesn’t need to be long. If possible, you can write a single paragraph in which you describe the tenant based on the information you gathered. If you had problems with a tenant, you might need to use a second paragraph.


For example, you can write: “I recommend my tenant, James Smith, who has rented from me since April 2012 in Chicago. James has been a good tenant who has always paid his rent on time and in full. I never had a complaint about him. He keeps his unit tidy and reports necessary repairs in a timely fashion. I would definitely rent to him again and anticipate issuing a full refund of his security deposit.”If there is negative information to share, then revise the above paragraph. For example, you could write, “James has generally been a good tenant, but I did receive a noise complaint about his dog in June 2012. However, after talking with him, I didn’t have any other problems.”

, You should let the future potential landlord know how to reach you. Give your phone number and email address if you have one.


For example, you can write, “Please contact me if you have any questions regarding this tenant. You can reach me at 555-5555 or by email at landlord5555@email.com.”

, Insert “Sincerely,” and then leave about four lines of blank space. Type your name.Remember to sign in the blank space using a blue or black ink pen.

, If you praise a tenant to the skies, then future landlords might suspect you are trying to get rid of a problem tenant by making them sound too good to be true. Instead, remain factual and neutral in the language you choose.Nevertheless, be honest. If you lie, then the future landlord might be able to sue you for misrepresentation., Set the letter aside for a period of time and then look at it with fresh eyes.You’ll want to clean up any mistakes, like missing words, typos, or grammatical errors.


Read the letter out loud. This is a good way to catch mistakes.

, The tenant might have you mail the letter directly to a future landlord. More likely, however, they will ask for the letter. Either way, make a copy of the letter for your records before sending it off.


You can expect your tenant to read the letter one way or another. For example, if your tenant is denied a rent, they will probably ask why. The landlord might say, “Your landlord’s reference letter was negative.”
For this reason, you might want to show them the letter if there is negative information. You can talk about it and give your tenant the option of not using your reference letter.

Develop the first paragraph.,
Develop the second and subsequent paragraphs.,
Develop the final paragraph.",How to Write a Letter of Resignation to Your Coach1," Be direct and immediately state the purpose of the letter. List the name of the team, how long you have been on the team, and your anticipated last day.


Here’s a sample first paragraph: “After over a year on the team, it is with great sadness that I must announce my resignation from the Pleasant ville Lemon Trees Junior Lacrosse Varsity Squad, effective immediately.”
The first paragraph does not have to be long. A couple of sentences is fine unless you have more to communicate.;
, State why you are leaving using non-accusatory language. This means that you do not want to be disrespectful, sarcastic, or mean-spirited, regardless of what has occurred during your time on the team. While it is fine to be truthful, you should always remain positive.


Include your reasons for leaving the team. Here is an example: “I need to go to a team where I’ll be able to get more playing time.”
Mention what you liked about being on the team and indicate how you have developed as a person. Here is an example: “I am not lying when I say I very much enjoyed my time working under you in this program, and that I learned a lot under your tutelage. In particular, your comments on both my stick- and footwork have helped me greatly.”
Be sure to only communicate truthful information based on your personal situation.
Communicate life lessons that you have learned as a member of the team.Many sports teams include the photos of team members on marketing materials, especially on social media. If you do not want your image to be included in these materials in the future, you should include this information in your letter. Sometimes prior agreements are made that allow the team to maintain your image in marketing materials, so each situation may be different.

, End your letter by communicating your appreciation for the coach. Remember to be truthful. You can always find something nice to say about a person. You never know when your paths may cross again in the future, and leaving things on good terms could be beneficial down the road.Here is an example: ""Coach Allen, I want to thank you again for all your time and help in fostering my early junior lacrosse career.""


Include your willingness to help the team, if needed, before you depart. If you are leaving in the middle of the season, you can offer to stay longer or provide any needed assistance to your team members before you depart. However, you should only offer to do this if it is something that you will actually be able to do. Avoid making any commitments that you cannot keep.

Select the platform for writing the letter.,
Select the paper.,
Establish the document layout.,
Add the date.,
Add the recipient’s contact information.,
Add the salutation.,
Add the closing.,
Proofread the letter.,
Print and sign the letter.",How to Write a Letter of Resignation to Your Coach2," You can either write the letter on your computer using the Microsoft Word software application or you can write the letter in an email. If you do not have a computer, you can hand write the letter, but this is not the best option and should only be used if you have absolutely no access to a computer.


If you do not have a computer, you can always go to the library because many libraries have a computer center that is open to the public. Usually all you need is a free library card.
While Microsoft Word is the most commonly used word processing software, some people also use Pages, which is a software application exclusive to Mac computers.
If you hand write the letter, be sure to use good penmanship so that your letter is easy to read.

, Choose the standard paper size, which is 8 1/2 inches by 11 inches. Do not worry about the weight of the paper as long as you use basic printing paper. Usually what you have on hand will work just fine., The top and bottom margins should be between 1 inch and 1 1/4 inches. The right and left margins should be between 1 1/4 inches and 1 1/2 inches.


You can use the default margin settings included in most word processors, which is 1 1/4 inches on all sides (right, left, top, and bottom).
Use an easy to read font, such as Times New Roman, Arial, Verdana, or Cambria, with a font size of 10, 11, or 12. You can select a different easy to read font if you have a preference.
Single space the letter and place an extra line between paragraphs. You should also place an extra line after the address and salutation, however, there are four extra lines after the date.
Your letter should not be more than one page in length.

, Type or write the date you are creating the letter. The month should be spelled out and the day and year should follow: April 2, 2016.

, The address should include the recipients name, organization, street address, city, state, and postal code (Mr. Daniel Allen, Pleasantville Lemon Trees, 55 Fifth Avenue, Pleasantville, NY 10570).


If the address is not available, you can leave it out and move on to the next step.

, Type or write ""Dear Coach (last name)."" Using this standard salutation, also called the greeting, is good because you want to maintain professionalism.


Although “Dear” is appropriate within the context of a letter, it is not necessarily the best salutation if you choose to send your letter in the body of an email. Email messages tend to be less formal and call for a less formal salutation, such as “Hi Coach (last name).”

, There are many options for the letter closing, but for this scenario, you should use ""Sincerely,"" “Warm regards,” or “Best wishes” to demonstrate your sincerity or positive wishes for the coach and team.

, Anytime you write a letter you should proofread it to be sure that it is free of any errors. When you proofread the letter, read it out loud because you are more likely to identify errors when you speak and hear the words.

, Print out your letter and sign it with both your first and last name. If you are planning to send your letter by email, a handwritten signature will not be easy to add, nor is it necessary.

"
"
Deliver the letter yourself.,
Ask someone to deliver the letter for you.,
Send the letter by postal service.,
Send the letter by email.,
Send a greeting card or thank you note card.",How to Write a Letter of Resignation to Your Coach3," Once you have finished writing your letter, there are many methods of delivery from which to choose. However, the best way is to deliver the letter in person. This will give you an opportunity to speak directly with the coach and answer any questions.


You can hand the coach the letter after practice and have a conversation immediately following, or you can discuss the details at a later date.

, If you do not want to personally deliver the letter, you can also have someone deliver the letter for you, as long as it is in a sealed envelope.

, You can always send the letter by mail if you do in fact have an address for the coach. The best address to use is the address of the school or organization that coordinates the team’s activities.

, If you choose to send the letter by email, you can send it as a document attached to the email or by writing the content of the letter in the actual body of the email message.

, Want to do something out of the norm and extra special? Often there is an assistant coach or other administrators who have been particularly helpful to you as a member of the team. You may consider providing a thank you note or greeting card to one or more of those individuals. This is a way of acknowledging a person’s kindness in a way that can be memorable and does not take a lot of extra effort or money.


You can find inexpensive greeting cards and thank you cards at stores like Target and Walmart, as well as other retailers such as various dollar stores and grocery stores.

Examine why you are leaving.,
List the pros and cons.,
Assess the impact on your future.,
Talk to a parent, teacher, or mentor.,
Identify a replacement activity.",How to Write a Letter of Resignation to Your Coach4," When making an important decision, it is best to think about the facts surrounding your decision, such as why and when. This will give you an opportunity to ensure that you are making the right choice. Ask yourself the following questions:


Why do I want to leave the team?
When do I want to leave the team? For instance, will you wait until the end of the season or leave immediately., Grab a sheet of paper and pen or use an electronic notepad to list your answers to the questions below. This will help you to gain confidence in your decision.How will leaving the team positively impact me? (list all of the pros)
How will leaving the team negatively impact me? (list all of the cons)

, Beyond the pros and cons identified, ask yourself whether or not leaving the team could negatively or positively affect your future (such as your college career).


If you are leaving to try another sport or to focus on schoolwork, you should feel confident about leaving because it will be beneficial to your future.
If you are leaving because there is a difficult situation that you have not been able to handle, you may consider staying and getting assistance with resolving the problem.

, If you are having a hard time making a final decision, you can speak with an adult whose opinion you trust in order to hear another perspective. They may have ideas or thoughts that you have not considered.

, Will you have a new coach, team, and replacement activity that will provide similar or more benefits than those gained in the sport that you are leaving? It may not be a good idea to leave the sport and then have nothing else to do in your free time, or to leave the sport and spend your idle time sitting on the couch or playing video games.


Your replacement activity should be of greater benefit to you in the short-term or long-term.

Look for a business letter template.,
Create a mailing list.,
Set up address blocks.,
Provide a greeting.,
Complete your closing.,
Write a brief introduction.,
Provide a date when the change will take place.,
List your new address.,
Include any other relevant information.,
Thank the recipient.,
Provide a means of contact.,
Craft several letters.,
Proofread your letter carefully.,
Make sure the recipients' information is correct.,
Print and sign your letters.,
Provide your recipients with advance notice.",How to Write a Letter for Change of Address," If you're typing your letter on your computer, check for templates in the word processing application you're using. Most word processing apps have a number of different letter templates.Use a basic business letter template that has blocks for the date, your address, and the address of the recipient.
If you have business or personal letterhead that you plan to use to print your letter, make sure the template you use has room to accommodate that.

, The easiest thing to do, especially if you are sending your letter to a long list of recipients, is to create a mailing list on a spreadsheet. You can then use the ""mail merge"" function on your word processing app to populate the fields on your form letter.Your mailing list should include the first and last name of the recipient, as well as a complete mailing address along with any other contact information included in your template.
Proofread your mailing list carefully to make sure you haven't made any typos in entering anyone's name or address.

, The traditional business letter format includes a block for your name (or your business's name) and address, as well as the name and address or the recipient. When you enter your address, use your current address, not the one to which you're moving.If you're using mail merge, follow the formatting guidelines set forth in your word processing app. Typically this means enclosing in brackets the name of the column from which you want the app to pull data from your spreadsheet, such as ""firstname lastname.""

, Your letter template typically includes a double-space after the last line of the last address block, followed by a greeting. It may simply be the person's name followed by a colon, or ""Dear"" followed by the person's name and a comma.Avoid using the ""Dear"" greeting if some of your recipients are organizations, other businesses, or government agencies. Typically this greeting is only used for individuals.

, When formatting your letter, it's typically best to go ahead and get your closing down first and then draft the body of your letter. The word you use in closing will depend on your relationship to the recipients.If you're writing a letter for change of address of your business, you'll want a more formal closing, such as ""sincerely."" However, if you have a mix of personal and business contacts, you may want to go with something less formal, such as ""thanks.""

, Start your letter with a statement to inform the recipient of the letter's purpose. This doesn't have to be long. Typically a single sentence that says something like ""This letter is to advise you that my address will be changing soon"" will suffice.Don't get too wordy with your introduction. You want to keep the letter under a page, so it should be brief and to the point.

, Along with your introduction, you need to let your recipients know exactly when they need to start using your new address rather than your current one.Make sure you're giving your recipients enough time to receive the letter, update their records, and get any letters out to the proper address.

, Provide your recipients with the new address they should use for all correspondence with you in the future. Typically it's best to format it the way it should be formatted on the envelope, so it's easy for them to note and copy.You can include your old address as well, for example by saying your address has changed from the old address to the new address. However, keep in mind that this might be confusing. Particularly if you have a lot of business or government contacts to whom you're sending the letter, the wrong information could be copied inadvertently by a clerk.
It's also a good idea to let your recipients know what, if any, other contact information will be changing and what will stay the same. This is especially important if they need to get in touch with you during the transition.

, Depending on the circumstances of your move, there may be other information that your recipients need to know, such as if others also are moving with you, or whether your business will remain open during the move.For example, if your business will be closing for a brief period to relocate, you need to inform your recipients of this so they can plan in advance, whether they are customers, suppliers, or other clients.
If you're having a moving sale, this might be a good place to let your recipients know about that as well.

, To close your letter, double space after your last paragraph and write a simple sentence thanking the recipient. If they are a business associate, you may want to also add a note about how you appreciate their business.For example, if your business is relocating, you might write ""Thank you for your attention to this matter. I greatly appreciate the value you add to this company and look forward to continued work with you.""

, After you thank the recipient, you may want to provide a phone number or email address the recipient can contact if they have any questions or concerns.This is especially important if your business is relocating. You may want to route all questions or concerns about the relocation to a particular phone number or extension, or to a particular email address.

, Especially if you're relocating your business, you may want to have more than one letter. That way you can tailor one letter specifically to clients or customers, another to business associates, and another to vendors or dealers.Consider several letters if you have any relevant information you want to include that only applies to one audience. This way no one is getting any information other than what they need.

, Before you finalize your letter, check to make sure there are no typos, spelling, or grammatical errors that make your letter look unprofessional or make it difficult to read.Check the address in particular and make sure it's correct. You don't want to send your recipients a change of address letter that points them to the wrong address.

, When you use mail merge for bulk mailings, it can save you a lot of time. But it's also possible that there may be errors in how the data is transferred to your letters.Check all the fields and make sure they all match and belong to the same recipient. For example, you want to make sure that the name and address of the recipient in the address box matches the name in the greeting.

, Once you're satisfied that your letters are formatted correctly and are error free, print them on good stock paper and sign them by hand using blue or black ink. Then they're ready to mail., In most cases, you want to make sure your recipients will get their letters within two to four weeks prior to the date your change of address takes effect.If you have international contacts, you probably want to provide two or three months' advance notice to allow for the time it takes to send mail internationally.

Choose a topic.,
Research your country.,
Take notes on your country.,
Organize your notes by topic.Gather your notes, then use computer software like Microsoft Word to move things around until you have like topics together, such as all the information on topographical features together, all the information on population and political lines together, and so on.,
Write an introduction for your paper.,
Next, outline what you want to say in each paragraph.,
Use the introduction you already wrote.,
Move through your outline.,
Write a conclusion.,
Make sure your report is clear and concise.,
Proofread your report.",How to Write a Geographical Report," Maybe your assignment is to choose a country to report on. You can pick one you want to visit or just one that interests you. If you don’t know what to pick, research a few countries until you find one you like.


Choose a country that you find interesting. Maybe you could choose a country your ancestors came from or that you have some personal connection to. Let’s say you pick Scotland.;
, You can find books on your chosen country at the library, but you can also find solid geographical information online. For instance, the CIA’s World Factbook is a reliable source that has geographical information on every country in the world.Don’t forget to use your library’s online resources. These will give you access to online databases that have high quality articles. The best way to identify good sources is to look at who is producing them, according to Rider University.Is the author an expert in the field? Is the book from a good publisher? Is the journal reviewed by peers? These aspects will help you decide on the best source.

, Make sure to note down where you find important information so you can find it again. You’ll need the author, title, publisher, city of publication, date of publication, and the medium. Also include a URL or the DOI (the digital object identifier) when it is provided.

,


If you don’t want to use software, trying writing information on notecards so that you can move it around and arrange it in the best order possible.

, The introduction should provide a short overview of the paper, introducing the topic to your reader. Basically, you tell the reader what you are going to talk about in the paper—the geography of Scotland.

, As you’ve already organized your notes by topic, use that organization to place the relevant information into paragraphs. Remember to keep one main idea per paragraph.


So, if you’re writing on three main ideas that are each extremely detailed, maybe you need to divide them further into smaller paragraphs. Your main section could be geographical features of Scotland, which you could further divide into paragraphs such as mountains, water features, and habitats.
The American University in Cairo suggests writing a sentence per paragraph so you have an idea of what you want to say.How you organize it is up to you, as long as it goes in a fairly logical order. It might be best to start from the more general and move to the more specific in each paragraph.
Finally, make a few notes on what you want to include in your conclusion.

, Make sure you transition smoothly into your first paragraph. That is, add a sentence at the end of your introduction that leads into your first topic.


For instance, you could write, “Scotland is a fascinating country, and part of its fascination lies in its rich natural resources.”
This concludes the introduction and clues your reader in to the fact that you’re moving on to natural resources (or whatever your first body paragraph is).

, Create paragraphs from your research, adding details as you go. Make sure to transition smoothly from one paragraph to the next.


When writing a paragraph, treat it like a mini report. That is, treat the first sentence as a sort of introduction and the last one as an a conclusion.
Purdue’s Online Writing Lab suggests the best way to write a paragraph is to have only one major idea per paragraph, making each one cohesive.Also, make sure to develop your idea through the paragraph, adding new thoughts and ideas as you go.

, The conclusion brings together everything you’ve talked about in a short summary. You’re basically just reemphasizing for the reader everything you just said and tying up any loose ends.


The American University in Cairo recommends ending on something that’s memorable, so you leave your readers with something that sticks with them., Writing a geographical report isn’t that much different from any type of information report. Your main objective is to provide the information in a clear and concise manner.


Make sure your sentences are not too long, and that you back up what you have to say with research. It is important to keep the report objective.
Remember, a geographic report is not an argumentative essay. You’re not trying to convince your reader of your point of view, you’re trying to educated them on a specific topic, so stick to the facts.

, Read through your paper to check for typos. Look for grammatical mistakes, spelling errors, and awkward sentences. Try reading it out loud. This will slow your reading down, making you more aware of what’s actually there.


Also try to have someone else read it. Another person will catch mistakes you might have missed.

For example, if you are scheduled to appear at a trial, then a default judgment could be entered against you. With a default judgment, the other party wins because you didn’t show up to court. You can sometimes get default judgments set aside, but it usually takes a considerable amount of work.In traffic court, failure to appear could result in you receiving a fine, having your license being revoked, or possibly being arrested.;
, Not all courts will accept a letter. Instead, the court might grant a continuance over the phone, or the court could require that you have a representative appear before the judge in your place.


As soon as you realize that you can’t make a court date, you should immediately call the court clerk to talk about your situation. Some courts have strict deadlines for granting continuances. For example, in California divorce cases, you need to request the continuance no later than five business days before the scheduled court date.In DuPage County traffic court, you must request the continuance at least four business days before the court date., If you can’t attend a court date, then you should try to document the reason why. For example, you might have suffered a debilitating injury or your supervisor wouldn’t let you off from work because of an emergency. If you can document the extenuating circumstances, then you will make yourself more sympathetic to the judge.

, If you need to miss a court date, then you should also inform the other side in the lawsuit. In some courts, you need the other party’s consent to get a continuance. If you cannot secure it, then you will need to file a motion in the court to ask for a continuance., You have the option of hiring an attorney to make an appearance in court for you. The attorney will relay whatever information you were intending to tell the judge at the hearing. Alternately, an attorney can ask the judge for an extension and cite your personal difficulties. If you are in a bind and don’t have time to send a letter, then you should contact a lawyer immediately.


You can find a lawyer by calling your state’s bar association, which should run a referral program. You can find the phone number to your bar association by typing “your state” and “bar association” into a search engine.
An attorney will charge to make an appearance. It could cost you a couple hundred dollars for even a brief appearance. However, if you miss the court appointment and the judge issues a bench warrant for your arrest or imposes some other sanction, then you might end up spending even more than that in legal fees to clean up the mess. An attorney can be a good investment.

, After opening up a blank word processing document, you should insert your name, address, and the date in a block. This block can be left-justified or right-justified.You should try to type the letter, as it looks more professional than a handwritten letter.

, Two lines down from the date, you should insert the judge’s name and his or her address at the court. If you do not know this information, then you should call the court clerk and ask for it.

, Two lines below the judge’s address, insert “Dear Judge ”.You can also type, “The Honorable Judge ” instead.


Instead of addressing the letter to the judge, you may have been instructed to send the letter to a clerk or another member of the court’s staff. You can address the letter to that person by using, “Dear Mr. ” or “Dear Ms. .”
If you weren’t given a staff member’s name, then simply address the letter to “Dear Clerk of Court.”

, Begin the body of the letter two lines down from the salutation. Explain the extenuating circumstances that will force you to miss court. For example, you might have pressing medical needs to attend to, or you may have lost a family member recently. Whatever the reason, try to be brief.


“I am writing to request a continuance for my hearing scheduled on October 12, 2015. Unfortunately, an unforeseen medical emergency has confined me to the hospital for the next several weeks. The diagnosis of extreme pneumonia surprised me, and I would not have missed my court date but for the illness.”

, For example, if you have become hospitalized, then you should mention that fact and state that you are including a copy of your medical record with the letter. Do not send originals of any document, as they will not be returned.


Sample language could be: “I was admitted to the hospital on September 22, 2015, as is shown by the copy of my hospital records attached.”

, You should also request a new court date. Make sure it is a date that you are absolutely certain you can attend. Judges may forgive one missed court date, but two or more could land you in hot water.

, In the final paragraph, thank the judge or court clerk for their understanding. Also add your contact information, including a phone number.


Sample language might be: “Thank you for your understanding. I appreciate how much of an inconvenience this is. If you have any questions, you can reach me at or at the address printed above.”

, Two lines below the conclusion, type “Sincerely,” and space down four or five lines before typing your name.Sign the letter in blue or black ink.

, Unlike letters, motions are formal documents submitted to the court. Copies are sent to the other parties in your lawsuit, who might have an opportunity to respond. If the court does not accept letters, then you might have to file a formal motion to ask for your continuance.

, Some courts have blank motion forms. You simply fill in the blanks and then submit the motion to the court. You should ask the court clerk if a blank motion form is available for you to use.


Maricopa County, Arizona, for example, has a blank motion form available for download at http://www.superiorcourt.maricopa.gov/sscdocs/pdf/gn10f.pdf. You should only use blank motion forms if they have been created by your court. Otherwise, you must create your own motion.

, Open a blank word processing document and set a comfortable font and type size (e.g. Times New Roman 12 point). At the top of the page, insert the header information. The header information consists of the court’s name at the very top, the names of the parties on the left, and the case number on the right. You can find the header information from another motion or pleading filed earlier in your case.

, Underneath the header information, you can insert the motion’s title in all caps, bold. You should title your motion “Motion for a Continuance.” If the court date is fewer than five business days away, then you should title the motion “Emergency Motion for a Continuance.”, In the first paragraph, you should state your name, whether or not you are representing yourself “pro se,” and that you are requesting a continuance. Also identify yourself as the plaintiff or defendant.


Sample language could read, “NOW COMES Plaintiff Joanna Keys, representing herself “pro se,” and asks this Court for a continuance of the hearing scheduled for November 10, 2015 at 1:30 PM. In support of the motion, Plaintiff states:”, In the second paragraph, lay out the facts explaining why you cannot make the court date. As you would in a letter, you should refer to any documentation in support of your motion. Unlike in a letter, however, you need to refer to yourself in the third person.


List all relevant facts in numbered form.For example, the facts can be laid out like this:

“1. The status hearing is scheduled for November 10, 2015 at 1:30 PM.”
“2. Plaintiff Joanna Keys was recently admitted into the hospital on November 1, 2015.”
“3. According to her medical diagnosis (see attached Exhibit A), she has….”



, In the final paragraph, ask the court for the continuance again. You could type, “WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Joanna Keys respectfully requests that the above-entitled action be removed from its present hearing date of November 10, 2015.”, Two lines below the conclusion, you should type “Respectfully submitted” and then type your name underneath. A few lines below that, you should add your signature. Beneath the signature, include your contact information (address, phone number, telephone, and email).Have the motion notarized, if necessary. Depending on your court, you may need to sign the motion in front of a notary. If you needed to notarize the other motions in your case, then you should have this one notarized as well.
Notaries may be found in most courthouses and large banks. To find a notary, you can visit the American Society of Notaries website and use their search engine.

, Make several copies of the motion and take them all with you to the court clerk’s office. Tell the court clerk that you want to file the original. Have the clerk stamp the other copies as well., You probably will need to serve the other party with a copy of your motion. However, some courts do not require that notice be given if the motion is an emergency motion (i.e., filed fewer than five business days before the court date).You should ask the court clerk if service is necessary. Also ask about acceptable methods of service.
If you need to make service, then attached a “Certificate of Service” to the motion. The certificate can be on a separate piece of paper. You can create it before going to the court to file. If you find out that you don’t need to make service, then you can remove that sheet from your packet.
For the certificate of service, you can type something like the following: “I hereby certify that a true and correct copy of the above and foregoing was served on all parties or their counsel of record on in accordance with the Rules of Civil Procedure.”Then type and sign your name above it.

, If you are unable to attend a court hearing in-person, you might consider requesting a phone appearance instead. With a phone appearance, you will call in to court on the day of your hearing and participate as required. In some states (e.g., California), phone appearances are favored in order to promote court access.Therefore, in a state like California, you should have no trouble making a phone appearance unless a personal appearance is required by law.


In California, a personal appearance is required for the following:

Trials, hearings, and proceedings at which witnesses are expected to testify;
Hearings on temporary restraining orders;
Settlement conferences;
Trial management conferences;
Hearings on motions in limine; and
Hearings on petitions to confirm the sale of property under the Probate Code., If you think you qualify to make a telephone appearance, find the required court form online and fill it out. You should be able to access court forms on your local court's website. If you are unable to find the required court form online, go to your courthouse in-person and ask for help.


In California, the court form can be found online.The form will ask you for your personal information and information about the case you are a part of.Most importantly, you will be asked to explain why you are requesting a telephone appearance.Valid reasons include:

Not residing in California;
Being disabled;
Being the victim of domestic violence; or
Being incarcerated., After completing your form, you will take it to the court where your current case is pending. You will take it to the clerk of courts and have it filed. In general, you must file your request a certain number of days before the applicable hearing. In California, you must file your request no later than 12 days before the hearing.In addition, once you file your request, you will be required to pay a filing fee. In California, the fee is $86.00 for each telephone appearance.If you cannot afford the fee, you may be able to request a fee waiver. In general, you will have to be able to convince the court of your inability to pay the required fee. To do this, submit pay stubs, bank statements, and statements of public benefits.



, Every party in your case must be served with your request in a timely manner so they may respond.To serve the other party, you will need to have someone other than yourself personally deliver your request to the other party.You can also serve the other party through the mail.Once the other party has been served, you will file a proof of service with the court, which simply states you have notified everyone of your request."

Study the Request for Proposal (RFP) carefully.,
Investigate the client’s needs.,
Use a formal title page.,
Introduce the problem that you are addressing.,
Put your proposal in context.,
Include definitions for key terms.,
Propose a detailed solution.,
Explain why your solution is the best.,
Present your proposed task schedule.,
Provide a budget.,
Include key contract terms.,
Outline your relevant experience.,
Identify others who will be working on the project.,
Provide references.",How to Write a Formal Proposal1," Many businesses or governmental agencies will send out an RFP when they need goods or services. For example, a company that is being sued might send RFPs to specific law firms, asking them to submit a business proposal. Alternately, a government agency might send out an RFP when it needs to buy some product or materials. The RFP will generally contain details that you must fully understand before drafting your business proposal.Be sure that you can provide the client’s needs as outlined in the RFP. For example, you need to be able to meet the proposed budget, timing requirements, and any other specifications that the client identifies.
You may choose to submit a formal proposal without waiting for an RFP. If you believe some business could use your services, you may reach out to them on your own and submit your own formal proposal.;
, Your proposal should address the client’s actual needs. To write a strong proposal that will be useful to the client and that will help you earn the assignment, you should understand the client’s work and the need that you are addressing. If possible, you should contact someone at the company to get information. If the RFP is competitive, they may be limited in how much information they can provide. Nevertheless, you should make the effort and try to get answers to some of the following questions:Find out if prior attempts were made to address the problem. If so, why did those attempts fail?
Ask what criteria the client will use when evaluating a business proposal.
Find out whether the company has any special concerns that you should address.
Ask about the company’s operating policies. Your proposal should be consistent with these policies.

, Your proposal should contain a title page as a cover. The title page should include the following information:Your name
Your company’s name
The name of the person you are submitting the proposal to
The date you submitted the proposal

, The formal proposal that you are submitting should identify a problem and propose a solution. Begin by identifying the client’s problem in simple and clear language.Explain why the client should see that your understanding of the current situation presents a problem.For example, a proposal to provide legal services might begin with the following introduction: “We are aware of pending litigation that has been threatened regarding your company’s acquisition of XYZ Corp. We offer this proposal to provide the legal services that you need.”, Unless you are responding to an RFP, you might need to provide some background to explain the reason for your proposal. For example, you may need to identify the following:Prior attempts that have failed.
Whether someone asked you to write the business proposal.
How you became involved in the project or aware of the problem.

, Any particular industry terminology or other terms of art that you use in the proposal should be clearly defined. As much as possible, you should write in clear, simple language, but some technical terminology may be necessary.You may be submitting your proposal to, for example, someone in a purchasing department who understands industry jargon, but the final decision may come from someone in administration who is not familiar with industry terms.


You can draft the business proposal first and then go through to identify any terms that might be unclear to the reader.
Also define terms if you are using them in a unique way. For example, the term “fiscal year” can be defined in many ways, depending on the business.

, After you open by identifying the problem, tell the reader how you will solve that problem. Provide as much detail as you can.Typically, the solution that you propose will be for the company to hire you or your company, or purchase your product.


For example, you might offer: “Acme Accounting specializes in Accounting and Payroll Services for growing small and mid-sized businesses. We can provide complete service in the following areas: ledger maintenance, inventory account balancing, year-end tax statements and summaries, and standard pay period check origination.”, You are either suggesting something that the client has not considered yet, if you are presenting a proposal that has not been requested, or you are in competition with other companies, if you are responding to an RFP. In either case, you must explain why the solution that you present in your proposal is the best option for the client. You may wish to use bullet points to highlight key benefits. Common benefits include a cost savings to the business, confidentiality, and professional expertise.


Provide evidence to justify your expected benefits. For example, if you have studies or industry data that support your proposal, you should include them., Include a timeline for completing the tasks that are key to your proposal.At the proposal stage, it is understood that the details may change in the future, but it is important to give the reader some idea of how you will go about executing your proposal.


Highlight certain milestones. For example, if you propose to remodel a store, you should include your beginning date and finishing date, so the client will know when the store can reopen.Include a warning that your timeline is an estimate and may depend on other factors that could be out of your control. For example, a proposal for a construction job could be delayed by having to obtain the necessary permits from the local government or by relying on a subcontractor.

, The client needs to know whether they can afford your services, so the budget could be the most important part of your proposal. You also may be competing against other companies trying to get the same job. You should include information about pricing. Be conservative. For example, you might want to add up the anticipated budget and then multiply by 1.5 to account for any unforeseen circumstances.Include a disclaimer stating that the numbers are only estimates.Some details that you may choose to include are:


start-up costs or initial set-up
labor costs
supply costs
ongoing monthly charges
maintenance costs

, If your proposal is to form the basis of a contractual agreement between you and the client, you should include key contract terms. For example, you could include information such as the following:How much is paid on signing: “50% payment upon signing.”
Penalties or interests assessed for late payment: “A late fee of $50 will be assessed on any account past due.”
Your cancellation policies: “The contract may be cancelled for any reason with 90 days written notice. There are no pre-payment penalties.”

, To be selected to provide the service or product in question, the client should have confidence that you can follow through and implement the business plan.Describe one or more similar projects that you have worked on and explain the success you achieved.


Be careful not to exceed any client confidentiality agreements you may have with other clients. Nevertheless, you can describe your prior experience in general terms. For example, you could write, “Successfully provided Accounting and Payroll Services to 20 mid-sized businesses (25-100 employees) for the past five years.”

, You or your company may not be able to do everything to address the client’s needs. In this situation, you should explain how you will get the necessary support from other sources. Additionally, explain how you will guarantee that any other workers are competent to complete their assigned tasks.


If available, you should include resumes along with the business proposal., If your proposal makes reference to studies, written reports, data compilations or other sources, you should them at the end. Format them using a well-known style, such as APA style.Including a list of sources allows the client to verify your information easily.
Encourage the client to contact you with questions. Provide your website, in case the client would like to see more information about your business.

Begin by selecting the topic for your research.,
Outline the structure of your proposal.,
Begin with an introduction.,
Explain the background and significance of your project.,
Review the main sources of academic literature.,
Describe your research methods.,
Recognize limitations of your proposal.,
Wrap up with a conclusion.,
Provide your citations.",How to Write a Formal Proposal2," Unless you are in a class where a topic is specifically provided to you, you will need to select the topic for your research. This should be based not only on your own interests and expertise, but also on an academic need to answer some particular question. Think about the following questions in selecting your topic:What topics interest you enough to research and write about?
Is the topic important enough, and why?
What problems or open academic questions will your research answer?
How does your proposal build on research that has already been done?
Can you accomplish the research in the time allotted?

, Before you even begin writing, you need to have a plan for your project and the written proposal. By setting out an outline, you will give your research a direction and purpose. In general, most academic proposals should include the following sections:Introduction
Background and significance
Literature review
Research design and methods.
Conclusion
Citations

, This will be the section that provides the basic proposal and explains the topic that you seek to research. You will introduce the topic and the research methods that you plan to use. You should also explain briefly why this topic is important enough to consider.In the introduction, consider the following questions:


What is the main field of your research?
What is the specific topic of study related to that problem?
What methods will you be using to analyze the research problem?
Why is this research worthwhile? What is its significance?
Why would someone reviewing your proposal be interested in the results of your research?

, This is the section of your proposal that will address the reason for your project. Explain the academic context for your proposed research. Provide some basis of work that has already occurred on your particular topic, and where it has left off. Discuss how you will progress from there, and why your proposed topic is worth the work that you will put into it.In this section, you will address:


The primary research problem. Explain the purpose of your study beyond the brief introduction you started with.
The rationale of your proposed study. Explain why this project is worth doing. Anticipate and explain why anyone would care about the outcome of your research.
The major issues or problems to be addressed by your research. Address the ways in which your proposal expands on previous assumptions and beliefs about the topic.
Explain how you plan to conduct your research. Define the primary sources you will use and their contribution to your analysis.
Focus your research. Provide the boundaries for your particular project. If there are related issues that you are specifically not addressing, explain what those are.

, Whether your proposal consists of scientific research in a laboratory, psychological research consisting of observing human subjects, or analysis of particular literature or history, you will be relying on some academic literature as a basis. This section of your proposal is to explain that academic literature and its effect on your project. You need to put your research in a greater context and show how you advance or contradict earlier work., In this section, you need to explain very thoroughly what you intend to do, and why your proposal is worth doing. This is the primary section that will convince your reader that your proposal is not only beneficial but also well-planned and worth pursuing. You need to show that you know what you are doing and that your proposal is the best way to answer the questions you have raised in prior sections. Include the following details:The specific tasks and steps you will undertake. With each step, include a description of the reason for it, and how that step will add to the research project as a whole.
Comparisons to other prior research. If your academic review has found other, similar projects or research, you should discuss how your methods will differ. Explain why the difference is important, and what you intend to show by using your method.

, Part of the responsibility of making a formal proposal includes recognizing limitations or problems you could face. Certainly, you want your proposal to be accepted. However, you do not want to get accepted and then have problems arise that could surprise your supervisors or supporters. In this section, you should mention the following:Materials and budget. If you need financial support for your research, this is the section to include a budget. Provide a list of the materials that you will be using, and explain why they are critical to your work. If other, cheaper supplies are available, explain why you propose to use what you do. Be aware of any limitations that have been placed on any proposals.
Acknowledge potential problems you anticipate. At the outset, you should consider difficulties that may arise. Address them here, and how you believe you will address them.
Provide a timeline.

, Repeat the need, as you see it, for conducting this research. Summarize the key points of your purpose and your project design. Impress upon the reader that your proposal will advance some important academic question, and explain why. You want the reader to come away with the same understand, belief, and passion for the topic that you have., Follow whatever format you have been assigned or that is customary at your institution. You may include a list of references or a complete bibliography of sources. In either case, the purpose is to justify your proposal and allow the reader to review and even check parts of your proposal as necessary."
"
Present your proposal in a professional format.,
Provide a road map for the proposal.,
Proofread and edit your proposal before submitting it.",How to Write a Formal Proposal3," Your proposal should be readable and present a strong appearance. Unless the RFP or your instructions specify something different, you should use a clear, readable font, in a size and style that will be comfortable for the reader. Generally, Times New Roman 12 point font presents a strong, professional appearance.


You might also review sample proposals used in your industry. Search the Internet for “proposal sample” and some details about your particular business field.
You may also find business proposal templates online. Using one of these templates can make your proposal look professional., If your proposal is lengthy or complicated, you should offer an overview of what follows the introduction.You could summarize the parts that follow the introduction.


For example, you could write, “This business proposal has four parts. After this introduction, we offer the proposed solution, timetable, and an explanation of benefits in Part II. In Part III, we provide an itemized budget and a set of standard contract terms. Finally, in Part IV, we summarize our experience and confirm that our proposed solution is the correct course of conduct.”

, Unless time is critical, set your draft aside for a day or two and then review it. Look for typing errors and dropped words. Also pay close attention to your numbers and make sure they are accurate.You also should review the RFP again, along with any relevant correspondence. Make sure your proposal contains everything that the client has requested that you address.
Shorten the proposal, if necessary. Ideally, someone should be able to read your proposal in eight minutes. If it takes longer than that, then try to move as such material into an appendix.

For the current list of countries that are signatories to the Berne Convention, visit the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) at http://www.wipo.int/members/en/

WIPO does not offer a registration service for copyright, but it does acknowledge that many countries have national registration systems in place and that for some countries, this serves as prima facie evidence in a court of law as to copyright ownership.;
, This will protect you should there be a legal ownership dispute in the future. There are several informal ways to solidify your claim without pursuing official registration, though there is no provision in copyright law regarding these methods:


Publish your work to gain common law copyright protection. Whether you publish on a blog, a newspaper, a magazine, or in book form, this is another method to establish you as the original author.
Be sure that when published, the work contains your full name and the date of publication.
Note that if you are a US citizen, you will need to officially register with the US Copyright Office before you are able to make a claim in a US court (even if you already own a right on your work). Registration may also entitle you to statutory damages in a US legal system.

, According to applicable law in most countries, you own the copyright in the work as soon as it is fixed in a readable format. By placing the copyright symbol (©) on your work, you are telling others that you know your rights, and give a legally-relevant date of original publication.


You might also consider adding reference to the legislation that backs up your copyright claim, such as: ""© 2013, . Except as provided by the Copyright Act no part of this publication may be reproduced, stored in a retrieval system or transmitted in any form or by any means without the prior written permission of the publisher.""The appropriate wording is not set in stone and is often defined by your publisher's preference, or by jurisdictional tradition, so ask your publisher or attorney for advice.
If you are considering publishing in various countries, it is a good idea to ask your publisher's legal team or your own attorney about the value of registering in all countries where your works will be published.

,How to Publish a Book1,
"
Know whether you should prepare a manuscript or a proposal.,
Revise your book.,
Get feedback on your book.,
Revise your book further if it's necessary.,
Prepare your manuscript.,
Decide whether you want to enlist the help of a literary agent or to go straight to the publisher.",How to Publish a Book2," Fiction writers should prepare a full-length manuscript, while non-fiction writers will have to write a solid book proposal instead. Knowing what you need to have written will save you time and will make you look more professional when you send your work out into the world.


Many fiction writers try to publish their books before they have completed a manuscript — to no avail. If you are a seasoned writer working with a literary agent, then just a few chapters or even a proposal can get you a contract, but for most people starting out in the fiction business, the book should be 100% done before moving forward to the publication stage.
If you're writing non-fiction, then you need to have a completed book proposal first. If you are writing a fitness book or a cookbook, then you should focus on the proposal. If you're working on more literary non-fiction, then you should work on more sample chapters or even a completed manuscript, in some cases.
If you have determined that you only need a proposal for the type of nonfiction you are writing, then skip to step 6 and decide whether you want to hire a literary agent or go directly to the publishing house.
If you are writing an academic textbook, then skip to the last section and learn how to publish your book by contacting a publisher directly.

, Revising your book can be even trickier than finishing it. Once you've written a solid draft of your book, whether it's a historical novel or a thriller, you'll need to revise it so it's in the best shape possible before you take it to an agent or publishing house. Here are some things to do as you revise your book:


Make sure your book is as engaging as possible. Though not every book is a spy novel or a page turner, make sure your readers are hooked from the beginning, and that they always have a reason to keep turning those pages.
Get rid of any wordiness or excess. Many agents say that they rarely accept a debut novelist's book if it's over 100,000 words.
Make sure you get your point across. Whether you're writing a romance novel or science fiction, you should have reached your objective and communicated your message by the end of the book.
Make sure your thoughts are as clear as possible. Your ideas may be crystal clear to you, but would they confuse your average reader? Of course, your book may be targeted toward a certain audience, but members of that audience (such as college students or nurses) should be able to clearly follow your thoughts.

, Once you think you're really done, it's important to get some feedback on your book to know if it's ready for publication. You may feel that it's absolutely perfect, but there is almost always room for improvement. It's better to get feedback from a fellow writer or trusted professional than to get rejected by an agent or publisher. If you ask for feedback too early in the drafting process, you may feel stifled, so make sure your book feels really ready before you ask for help. Here are some ways to get feedback on your book:


Ask a fellow writer. A friend who knows how to write will have some insight into what works and what does not work in a book.
Ask a voracious reader. Someone who reads a lot will be able to tell you if your book was a page turner, or if they were asleep after the first chapter.
Ask someone who knows your subject. If you're writing non-fiction about something in a field such as business, science, or cooking, ask someone who is an expert in this field to see if you really know your stuff.
Submit your stuff to a writing workshop. Whether you have an informal writer's workshop with friends in your area or you're attending a writing conference, submitting a chapter of your work to a workshop can give you insight into a variety of perspectives at once.
If you're in an M.A. or M.F.A. program in creative writing, you will have lots of resources for feedback, whether it's your classmates or faculty.
Find a reputable editor and ask for a manuscript evaluation. This can be very expensive, but asking the right person can help you see if your book is ready.
Remember to take your feedback with a grain of salt. Not everyone will fall in love with your book, and that's okay. It's important to get constructive feedback from people you trust, but recognize that you won't benefit from every opinion. Getting good feedback means knowing who to ask.

, Revise your book based on the feedback you received. You won't regret it. Take some time to absorb the feedback you received, and then get to work.


Though your revision should take you in the right direction, you should ask for more feedback to make sure you made the draft stronger.
When you've revised your manuscript again, put it away for a few weeks or even a month. Then take it out and read it with fresh eyes to see if it's in the best possible shape.
Last, copy edit your book. Once all of the larger points are taken care of, make sure your manuscript is free of grammatical and punctuation errors. These errors will make your work look unprofessional and will keep your readers from appreciating your hard work.

, Once you feel that your manuscript is completely ready, you'll have to format it so it meets the requirements of the agents or publishers you are seeking. There are a few rules of thumb you can follow, but you should also check the websites of the publishers or the agents' guidelines to ensure that your manuscript meets their standards. Here are a few things you can do:


Always double-space your manuscript.
Have one-inch margins on the left and right-hand sides of the manuscript.
No fancy fonts. Times New Roman is the best font to use. Courier, or the font that looks like a typewriter, used to be more prominent, but TNR will do just fine.
Number your pages. Number the pages of your manuscript on the top right-hand side, along with your last name and title before the page number.

Ex: ""Smith/WHITE SKY/1""


Have a cover page. The cover page should include the following:

Your name, email address, phone number, and address should appear on the left hand side of the page.
The title of your novel should be capitalized and centered on the page, along with your last name. Example: ""WHITE SKY"" on one line and ""a novel by John Smith"" written directly below it.
Your word count should be centered on the bottom of the page. You can round to the nearest 5,000 words. You can write, ""about 75,000"" words.



, Though signing with a literary agent is incredibly challenging, contacting a publishing house directly to try to publish your book is even tougher.


The benefit of working directly with a publisher is that you don't have to use (or pay) an agent as a middleman. The drawback is that the publishing houses trust the agents to screen the submissions, so if you don't have an agent, they will be less likely to consider you.
You can also try literary agents first and go to the publisher if it doesn't work out. However, if your work is rejected by many literary agents, it's even more likely to be rejected by the publishers.

"
Research the market.,
Research literary agents.,
Write a query letter.,
If you get an offer with an agent, sign a contract — if it feels right.,
Revise with the agent.,
Take your book to the market.,
Work with an editor.,
Market your book.",How to Publish a Book3," Once you're ready to take your book to agents, you need to research the market to find your niche. Find books in your field or genre to see where you fit in, and see how well these books are selling and who are big names in your field. If your book doesn't neatly fit in one genre, research multiple types of books that your book may be like.


Once you've researched the market, you should be able to find a way to neatly describe your book. Is it science fiction, literary, or historical? Is it a science fiction and a historical novel? Is it literary, or more of a young adult novel? Knowing what kind of book you have will help you contact the right agent.

, Now that you know what type of agent you're working with, it's time for you to find the perfect agent to represent you. The ideal agent will connect with your material, will be enthusiastic about your work, and will work with you to revise your book and sell it to a publisher. Make sure your agent sells books in your genre, or contacting that agent will be a waste of time. Here is how to find a good agent for you:


Read a reputable guide to Literary Agents.This book will tell you more about thousands of literary agents and will also say which genres they specialize in, how many new clients they take on each year, and how many recent sales they have made.
Check out Publisher's Marketplace. Though you'll have to pay $25 a month for full access to the site, you will gain insight into which agents made recent sales, what type of books they sold, and who is selling the most books.Check out Query Tracker. This site will help you see which agents respond to queries quickly, and which rarely respond or take months to respond. The statistics on this site are reported by other writers, so the data set isn't complete, but it can give you a good indication of how receptive some agents can be. The site can also tell you which agents specialize in what genres.Check out the websites of different agents. When you find an agent who sounds like a good fit, check out his or her website to get more information about submission policies and what genres and clients they represent.
Make sure the agent is accepting unsolicited submissions. Unless you have a connection, you'll have to submit to the agent this way.

Watch out for con-artists posting as agents. No reputable agent will ever ask for a reading fee to see your manuscript. The agent will only make money if he can sell your book. Check out Preditors & Editors to make sure the agent has a good rating., Once you've found your dream agent — or better yet, a handful of dream agents — it's time to prepare your query letter. Your query letter is your chance to introduce yourself to the agent, to get the agent hooked on your book, and to provide a very brief synopsis of the book. It can take a while to hear back from agents, so contact a few at a time (as long as they allow simultaneous submissions) and sit back and wait. The query letter should follow the following format: Paragraph one: an introduction of your book and your interest in the agent. Here is what should go in the first paragraph:

Start off with one or two sentences that gives the agent a ""blurb"" of what your book is about. It should be specific, original, and gripping.
Then, tell the agent what genre your book falls under, whether it's multi-cultural, young adult, or historical. It can fall into a number of categories. You should mention the word count in the first paragraph as well.
Tell the agent why you've chosen her. Does she represent a lot of books in your genre, or does she represent a few authors whose work is similar to yours? Do you have a personal connection to the agent? If so, mention it right away.



Paragraph two: a synopsis of your book. Here is what should go in the synopsis:

Describe what happens in your book and what themes are highlighted. Make the description as accurate and gripping as possible.
Show who the main characters are, what the stakes are, and why the book is important.
You can do this in one or two paragraphs at most.



Paragraph three: some brief information about yourself. Tell the agent if you've won any awards and how the book personally connects to your life.

Paragraph four: tell the agent that the full manuscript or sample chapters (if you're writing non-fiction) are available upon request and give your contact information. Thank the agent for taking the time to consider your work.
Follow directions carefully. If the agent also asks for an outline or sample chapters, send those along too.

, If the agent liked your query letter, he or she will ask you to send along some sample chapters or even the whole manuscript. If the agent falls in love with your work after that, you will receive what you've been dreaming about: an offer of representation! But before you sign with the agent, you have to make sure he really is the dream agent you've been seeking.


Talk to the agent over the phone. If you can, meet with the agent in person. If you live near Manhattan, this will be easier, since many literary agents are based in New York City. Get a sense of this person's character and how enthusiastic he is about your book.
Trust your gut. If something is telling you the agent sounds too busy, too eager to get off the phone, or not very excited about your work, don't sign with him. It's better to continue your agent search than to put your book in the hands of the wrong person.
Ask if you can talk to some of the agent's clients. A good agent will be glad to give you the names of a few of his clients, so you can chat with them and get a better sense of whether or not the agent is a good fit.
Double-check your research. Make sure the agent has made sales and has a solid client list before you get on board.
Read over your contract carefully. Once you see that the contract is pretty standard, and that the agent gets around a 15% of your domestic sales and 20% of your foreign sales, and you feel good about signing with the agent, then sign your contract, put it in the mail, and celebrate a job well done.

, Even if your agent is bowled over by your book, you will almost always have to revise the book once, twice, or even three times before it's ready to go to the market. You'll have to do things like trim down the word count, make your narrator more likable, and address any questions your agent may have.


Remember that the book is still yours and that you don't have to change it completely to suit the needs of the agent. Only make changes that you're comfortable with.

, Once your agent is happy with your manuscript, and you have prepared a package for the book, she will take it to the publishers. This is the most nerve-wracking part because your book's fate will be out of your hands. Your agent will pitch your book to a list of trusted editors at various publishers, and if you're lucky, you'll end up with a deal with an editor at a publishing house!


Sign the contract that includes you, your agent, and the publishing house.

, Now that your book has been sold, you'll sign with a publishing house and will continue to work to revise the book with an editor there. You'll work until the writing is exactly where it should be, and then other aspects of publishing will be decided, such as when and how the book will be released, and what the cover will look like.


But you can't just sit tight and wait for the publication date. There is more work to be done!

, Once the fact that your book will be published has sunk in, you'll need to work your butt off to market your book, whether it's through your publicist, your website, Facebook, informal readings, and word of mouth. Do what you have to do to get the word out there so your sales are high when the book does come out.


Don't ever stop advertising for your book — especially not after it is published. You can bask in your glory for a little while, but remember that promoting your book is just as important as writing it!

If your book is accepted, sign with a reputable publishing house.,

Market your book.",How to Publish a Book4," Check out the websites of different publishing houses to see if they accept query letters or if they only accept solicitations from agents. Many publishing houses only accept work that has been brought to them through an agent.


Find publishers that not only accept unagented submissions, but which specialize in the type of book you are writing.

, The method for writing a query letter for a publishing house is the same as it is for contacting an agent. You'll have to introduce your book as well as yourself and to provide a brief synopsis of the work.


If the publishing house is impressed by your letter, you will be asked to send along part of or all of the manuscript.

, If the publishing house is impressed by your work, you will be given an offer. Look at your contract carefully and sign it if it meets your demands.

, Work with an editor to revise your book until it is ready for publication.

, While you're waiting for the book to be released, market the book to everyone you know — and people you don't know. Once your book is published, you will have to continue to advertise for your book. You can enjoy your publication, but remember that marketing should never stop.

, Make it beautiful and attractive. If you want the original Burn Book look (from Mean Girls) cut out funky magazine letters and glue them into your title. Make lipstick kiss marks on the front - you could either buy stickers of lip marks or if you don't mind you could always put on red lipstick and actually kiss the book to make a mark. Finally, doodle random words in the corners like 'backstabber' and write quotes like 'only the strong survive'.

, If someone really gets on your last nerve, add them to the book. To do this, get a photo of them and get a marker pen. Glue them in and let out your feelings.

, If anyone finds it - like snooping parents, siblings, etc - you're going to be in big trouble. Don't use easy hiding places like under the bed. You need to be secretive and creative. You could always take the dust cover off (the paper cover set over the cloth one underneath) of a hardback book, wrap it on the Burn Book and put it on your bookshelf or in a cupboard.

, Say that you found it and were going to hand it in to the school or something plausible like that. A good way to make this even more believable is putting an entry for yourself in the book. Just don't make the handwriting recognizable and remember you did it yourself.

",How to Create a Diary," You'll need a pencil too, for the basic structure of your diary. Read the ""Tips"" section before you begin working on the diary.

, If you have someone to help you, better. If not though, that's okay. You have to apply a lot of compression to the sheets—consider holding them down with a textbook or dictionary.

, Spread a thick layer of glue on the side of the compressed sheets you think the spine of the diary will be. Don't worry if some glue spreads beneath some sheets. The important thing is that there is a lot of glue in the spine so the sheets won't be loose. The worst part is: you have to compress the sheets until the glue is dried, so the sheets won't be hanging out.

, You have to remember that you need at least a 3 centimeter (1.2 in) border to each side. These 3 centimeter (1.2 in) of normal paper will be glued on the first and last normal sheets of the inside of the book.

",How to Write a Finance Paper," Because the topic choice is so difficult, be sure to choose something narrow enough that your research is limited, but general enough that it can be proven in a practical manner. Most financial topics for papers and dissertations undergo multiple expansions and contractions before settling on the specific subject width.;
, This will lead you to compose a topic statement for the most favored subject choice.

,, This will include your desired topic as well as an elucidation of the research you will be doing in order to prove the veracity of your chosen focus. In your dissertation proposal, you must also demonstrate that you are qualified enough to carry out the research on the dissertation you are proposing.

Include where you are and how you are feeling: e.g. ""8/12/2016: on the bus, feeling nervous."" If you're going somewhere, include where you're going. You will probably read back over this diary at some point in the future – so give your future self a few points of reference to jog your memory.;
, Don't think too much about what to say. Start by writing about your morning, or about whatever first comes to mind. Write about the most exciting thing that happened today.

Don't worry too much about what you write. The important thing is that you start writing., In the first entry, when you mention people, write what relationship you have with them. Are they your best friend, worst enemy, or crush? This way, when you read back over your diary in years to come, you'll know what all of these people meant to you at this point in your life., Just write down whatever comes to mind, no matter how silly it sounds. Filling your diary isn't about making everything sound perfect.

Write about why you can't think of anything. Write about why you want to keep a diary.Try setting a time limit for yourself. Set an alarm for ten minutes, and then start writing.

, When you are done writing, include a few lines to end the entry. If you are writing ""to"" your diary, then you might end the entry as you would a letter: by signing your name or initials.

, If you are worried that someone might read your diary, you can make the first page into a message for anyone who opens up the front cover. Make it clear that the person shouldn't read any further – or else!

Do not go overboard.",How to Write a Diary," The type of diary you choose depends on your writing style, personal preferences, and other factors. Take some time to consider diary type before purchasing a diary.


Take your handwriting into consideration. How big do you usually write? If you have small, neat handwriting a diary with smaller margins and line spaces might be ideal. If your handwriting tends to be bigger and messier, opt for a diary with larger margins. You could even choose a diary with white pages and no lines--this is especially good if you like to sketch alongside your writings.
How durable do you want your diary to be? Something like a moleskin notebook is somewhat expensive, around $15 to $20, but it's very durable. You may be able to find cheaper diaries at supermarkets, craft stores, and thrift/charity shops.
Do you plan on carrying your diary with you? Many people like to have a diary or notebook on their person at all times to write down day-to-day observations. If that's your plan, consider purchasing a pocket-sized or small diary that can easily fit in a purse or tote bag.
If you live with other people and want privacy, consider a diary with a lock. However, keep in mind diary locks are sometimes flimsy and easily broken.
There are websites that allow you to keep a diary online. One benefit to this is that it takes up less space and many people feel more comfortable typing than writing by hand. However, privacy is an issue. Even if your site is password protected, your privacy is never 100% secure online. Someone might stumble on your diary online and gain access to your personal information.

, If you want to keep your diary private, find a discreet place to store it in your home. Consider hiding it under your mattress, under your clothes in a dresser drawer, or any other place where people are unlikely to poke around. If you're not worried about privacy, keep your diary in an easy-to-reach place close to your desk, bed, or wherever you plan on writing.

, There are various manners you can mark entries in a diary. Some people enjoy dating their entries so they'll remember the rough timeframe when rereading their works. Other people prefer short titles to each entry. Be creative and have fun. Use whatever method feels right for you.Some people use signatures to mark entries. If you enjoy leaving a signature, feel free to do so. However, privacy may be an issue. If your diary is accidentally lost, the words will be linked to you. If you're recording particularly private thoughts, you may not want this. Consider initials instead.

, Diaries can be cognitively beneficial. A study at University of California showed that writing about feelings honestly helps the brain regulate emotion.As you write your diary, try to be as honest as possible in your entries. This is good for your emotional well-being.


Many people find diary writing cathartic because they can let go of inhibitions on the page and truly be themselves. Feel free to record your emotions, both positive and negative, in their entirety in your diary.Let go of worries about the quality of your writing. Your diary is a safe space for you to vent and share without the pressures of external judgment. Try to take a few minutes at the beginning of each entry to simply free write. That is, write quickly and without inhibition. Jot down the first things that come to mind when considering your day, current mood, and any feelings you're struggling with.Many people have epiphanies about themselves and their relationships through honest diary writing. Be open to learning about yourself as you write., There are many different types of diaries. Some people use diaries to record daily events. Others use them to chronicle dreams. If you're working towards a goal, like losing weight or completing a creative project, a diary can be a great means to discuss your feelings and progress. Some people record a mix of different things in their diary. It's up to you what you feel is important to record.

, Diaries are also important as they preserve moments in their immediate aftermath. Memory is fickle and precise details of an event tend to blur with time. Use details in your diary entries to try to preserve the moment.Think about your past before you begin writing in your diary. What do you wish you remembered? Do you wish you had better memories of your grandmother's laugh? Do you wish you took greater time to commit to memory the smell of your childhood bedroom on Thanksgiving morning as your mother fixed breakfast? Use these longings as a guide in your diary. Record, in detail, those moments that feel precious to you and that you'll long to recall later on.You should be as honest in your descriptions as you are in your venting. You want your diary to preserve your memories and perspective of an event. Do not talk about how your girlfriend's hair ""shone brighter than the Northern Lights"" if you've never witnessed the northern lights. Talk about things in terms that make sense to you. For example, you could say your girlfriend's hair ""glistened like sun reflecting off the headlights of a car mid-afternoon."" While perhaps a less romantic comparison, it's authentically yours., Many people struggle to find the time to write a diary entry each day. If you're interested in maintaining a diary, try to stick to something of a schedule.


Write in your diary around the same time each day. This way, writing in your diary will become as much a part of your schedule as brushing your teeth at night or showering in the morning.Do not set a schedule you do not think you can keep. If you don't reasonably think you'll be able to write in your diary every night, don't commit yourself to doing so. Instead, choose a more lax schedule. Plan on writing an entry 3 times a week instead.
Pick a time to write where you do not have other obligations or external time constraints.

, Everyone gets busy from time-to-time. If you're in a rush, just write a shorter entry. Jot down the bare minimum of your feelings and thoughts. Get out whatever feels most pressing and immediate. You can always record more about an event later in the week when you have time. Simply try to get out the basic details before you forget., If you want make your diary more personal, consider adding illustrations. This can be a fun way to make your diary more personal.


Some people having a particular illustration or type of illustration on each page. For example, if you have a cat you're attached to you could draw a small sketch of your cat at the bottom of each page. If you want to get more detailed, consider drawing the cat different based on seasons. In the summer, he could be wearing sunglasses. He could be sledding in the winter.You could also include illustrations of some the material you're writing about. You could add a small sketch at the end of the entry or sketch in the margins. Draw pictures of the people you saw that day, the food you ate, the movies you watched, really anything memorable., Some diaries come with decorative covers, but some are plain. If your cover is simply dull, you might want to add decoration. You can write your name in colorful, fun lettering. You can add stickers or glue on cut outs from magazines or newspapers. You can draw on the cover with colored pencils or markers. Have fun and be creative.

, You can purchase personalized journals online if you don't feel comfortable crafting yourself. You can usually choose from a handful of illustrations or templates and can add things like your name and address to the inside cover. Some journals, usually marketed towards a younger audience, may include writing prompts and fill in the blank pages inside.

, Remember, it's a diary and not a scrapbook. It can be fun to add mementos like concert tickets, photographs, and brochures from places you've visited. However, adding too much can make your diary look like a scrapbook. A diary should be primarily used for writing rather than collaging.

,, It can be useful to write down your feelings whenever you feel confused, upset, worried or distressed. It can be just as useful to write down your thoughts whenever you're feeling happy, excited or inspired. Recording thoughts can help you to learn that you're a balance of both negative and positive thoughts and that you might be tilting a little too far either way and need to readjust to see life more realistically or less pessimistically. It's also great to have some positive entries to read on days when you feel everything but happy or settled., It can be a great place to make lists, do pro and con columns and to work through consequences. You can also read back to other times you've made decisions, to remind yourself of the outcome and what worked best for you each time (or what didn't work)., Use mind maps, lists, diagrams and other visual aids to work through the goals you want to set yourself and the hopes and desires for things to turn out the way you'd like them to. Be sure to include possible roadblocks and speed bumps––thinking ahead about possible negatives is a way of planning for the worst and having alternative scenarios to help you move on., Of course, you could also use photographs if you have any.

Put it in pile of folded clothing that only you ever access.

Do not cut the exact measurements, because then the bottom will not be able to fit into the box. Also, don’t cut too much smaller than the original measurements because then the bottom will not snug into place.
Make sure to cut two half circles on either side of the bottom, this is how you will lift the false bottom out of place with your fingers. , Referring to the measurements of the cardboard you will be using for your box, cut out four thin strips of cardboard to act as the foundation to the false bottom and also the walls to the secret compartment. How much room you have in your compartment will be dependent on how tall or short you make these four pieces. , Take the four cardboard strips you have cut out and glue them to the walls and bottom of your cardboard box. After they dry, place the false bottom piece of cardboard on top of the strips. Check to see if the false bottom passes off as the real bottom of your box.
If all looks good, lift up the false bottom and put your secrets in the hidden compartment, then cover it again with the false bottom.

, Since you used cardboard for this secret box, you can decorate it however you want!

Choose a book.,
Leave a few pages towards the front untouched.,
Protect the front and back covers.,
Brush glue on the outside of the pages.,
Place a weight on the book.,
Draw an outline of your secret compartment.,
Cut out the compartment.,
Keep your secrets safe!",How to Create a Secret Box2," Look through your collection of books, you can use one that you wouldn’t mind cutting into for this project. Or go to your nearest bargain bookstore, where you can find an assortment of books sold for $1.


When choosing a book, make sure to keep in mind what you are going to place in this secret box. The size and thickness of the book used affects what can be placed inside.

, Leaving these pages untouched from glue will give the illusion your secret box is just another book. Put a rubber band around the first few pages and the front cover to keep them in place. , Make sure the front and back covers are not glued down. You can use plastic bags to protect the front and back. When wrapping the front cover with a plastic bag, make sure to include the first few pages as well.

, Now that your covers and first few pages are protected, close the book firmly and glue the outside pages. Using a paint brush, spread the glue evenly on the outside pages around the book. Try to spread out any globs that may arise, since these will dry white if left.


To make a glue mixture, mix together regular glue and water. Try to make the mixture 80% glue and 20% water. Too much water in the mixture will warp the pages. , To keep the pages from warping, place a large weight on top of the book. Use free weights, or a pile of other books. Let the book dry for an hour with the weight on top.

, Check to make sure the glued pages have completely dried. Remove the plastic bags protecting the covers and the rubber band from the first few pages. Decide how big you want your compartment.


Using a ruler and a pencil, draw an outline for where you are going to cut a hole in the book. It can be any shape and any size you want, but try to make sure to leave at least a half an inch border all around the outline. , Using a box cutter, carefully start cutting your outline. You should take your time for safety reasons and to make sure your edges do not come out too rough. Depending on how thick of a book you chose, this may take some time. Try cutting away layer by layer, going back now and again to clean up the corners.

, Place your secrets in the book compartment, then store your book on a shelf or desk. Either way, its inconspicuous design will keep everyone at bay.


To add some color to your book compartment, glue some colored felt or fabric inside.

Find any kind of scrap wood.,
Cut the wood into strips.,
Cut out two more square pieces.,
Drill holes into the thicker square.,
Get two rare earth magnets.,
Use epoxy to glue the magnets to the thinner square.,
Attach the two squares.,
Position the secret compartment.,
Glue the box together.,
Fill your secret compartment.,
Decorate!",How to Create a Secret Box3," Look around your house, backyard, or garage to find any kind of scrap wood for this project. Go to your nearest hardware store and ask if you can have some of their scraps.


You can use particleboard, medium-density fibreboard (MDF), or plywood.
Just make sure you have enough wood to make a decent size box. You will be making an open wooden container for small objects, with a hidden compartment toward the bottom of the box., You can use a hand saw, jigsaw, bandsaw, or a table saw to cut these strips. Make sure to cut four strips.


All four strips should be the same length.
Use a ruler to measure out two strips of one width and two strips of another width. This will guarantee that when you put the four strips together, you will have a square opening.

Measure two strips 2 ¾” wide and two separate strips 2 ¼” wide.
Measure the inside square opening. It should read 2 ¼” for width and length. Hold these four pieces together with a rubber band for now, to keep them in place.

, One square piece is going to be the false bottom everyone else sees, and the other will be the top of the secret compartment. Measure these pieces to match the square opening you have created from the four strips of wood.


One square should be thick enough to hold some screws, ex. ½” thick. This will be the top of the secret compartment.
One square could be thin, ex. ⅛” thick. This will be the false bottom. , First, drill a hole all the way through the center of the thicker square. This hole will be used to open the secret compartment. Next, drill 4 holes, one in each corner, for screws.


To find the center point on the thicker square, connect the corners using a ruler and a pencil. Drill an ⅛” hole all the way through the center.
Before drilling the corner ⅛” holes, check to make sure the hole is inset enough from the corners so that the head of each screw will not hang over the edge of the square.

Do not drill the corner holes all the way through to the other side of the square. You want the screws to be sticking out of this thicker piece to create space for the secret compartment. Screw in 1” wood screws into the four corner holes, but only enough for them to be sturdily in place.

, These magnets are circular in shape and are very strong. You can find these magnets at most hardware stores.

, Epoxy is the best way to glue metal to wood. It is a two part formula that only hardens when each are mixed together.


Mix the two parts together with a thinner piece of scrap wood on wax paper or any other hard surface that is disposable. Do not mix epoxy with your fingers!
With the piece of scrap wood that you used to mix the epoxy, put the mixture on each rare earth magnet and glue one magnet on opposite corners. , The magnets will allow you to attach the thinner square to the screws sticking out from the thicker square. Line up the heights of each screw so that the two square pieces are level with each other. Here, you have your secret compartment.

, Using the strips you made earlier as reference, take the compartment and decide where you want them to be inset from the bottom of the four walls of the box. The thicker piece with the screws will be hidden inside from view.

, Using yellow wood glue, glue the four strips you cut out earlier to the outside of the thicker square making sure the screws are facing downwards. Make sure to apply glue to the edges of each wall as well. Hold everything together to dry by wrapping up the box with rubber bands. Do not glue the thinner square with magnets to anything.


Once the box dries, you can sand the sides with sandpaper for a smoother finish.

, Place your secrets in the compartment at the bottom, then connect the false bottom. Attach the thinner square with the magnet to the screws. This false bottom will stop people from thinking there is a secret compartment.


Place pens, markers, pencils, rulers, flowers, etc. into the top space of the box. It will look like a holder to everyone else.
To open the secret compartment, you need a long, thin object that is able to fit through the center hole you drilled in the thicker square.
Unscrew a pen, and take out the thin ink tube. Dump everything from the top space of your box. Stick the ink tube through the hole in the thicker square and push the square with the magnets away from the screws of the thicker square. It will pop off., Feel free to decorate your secret box/holder however way you’d like. To help the illusion of the false bottom, paint the inside and bottom of the box black.

Choose a diary that is obviously a diary.,
Consider what it is you'd like to add to the diary to make the seeker realize that they've been rumbled.,
Spend a lot of time writing in your diary in obvious view.,
Casually drop comments about needing to write in your diary when around those you'd like to want to read it.,
If someone asks you about what your writing or they try to look, press it against your chest so no one can see and quickly say ""Nothing!"",
Never leave your diary unattended.,
Keep your diary in a great hiding spot.",How to Make Everyone Want to Read Your Diary," One that has the word ""Diary"" written in big letters across the front is a good start. As is choosing a diary with bright colors, fancy designs or lots of ""Do Not Read"" messages on the cover. Some diaries come with a lock and key; this can add to the sense of impenetrability (although you'll need to leave the key with the diary when hiding it so that it can be opened easily), or if you want people to notice it more often, keep the key in a chain around your neck and wear it like a necklace. And if you really want to get attention, then choose a neon or glitter cover.;
, How you deal with this aspect of the diary finding is up to your purpose:


If you want the person to know that you set them up to find the diary, find some way of making this clear in the diary. You might write something that they'll find in the text of the diary, perhaps in a passage about themselves, such as ""And Jake thought that when he found this diary he was such a smarty pants but little did he know that I had decided early on he needed to read these home truths about himself and I orchestrated his desire to find you dear diary.""
Or, you could make a more upfront statement at the beginning of the diary, like ""Jake, you moron, I WANTED you to find this diary. Have fun reading about yourself and what I really think of you.""
Or, perhaps you want to keep this all totally subtle and only find out through things the person says or does that they have read your diary. For example, perhaps you want someone to love you or you want someone to give you gifts you really like. By orchestrating their finding of the diary and expressing your feelings or your wish list, this could result in them declaring undying love to you... or finally buying you that gadget that you actually wanted for your birthday.

, Always write around family members. Especially around parents, spouses and nosy siblings! If they're in a room or you know they're about to go in a certain room, go sit down and start writing. Feel free to think out loud and make obtuse comments as you're writing in it.


Laugh or smile while you're writing, or write furiously (quickly) with a determined look on your face.

, For example, if you've just seen something you think is of interest, you could say ""Wow, now that just has to go in my diary."" To whet the appetite of the person or persons whom you'd like to get all nosy about your diary, make remarks that cause them to wonder what is being written about them in the diary. Something along the lines of ""Oh I write about every person in my diary, especially when I feel annoyed or upset with them.""


If the person asks you if you're writing about them in the diary, be evasive. Say something like ""Maybe… maybe not. Maybe you're not worth writing in my diary…"".

, The more alluring and tempting you make the diary's contents seem, the more likely your interrogator will become curious and want to know what's in it.


Be very urgent and defensive about wanting no one reading it!

, Even take it with you to go to the bathroom. This will only encourage suspicion, causing your target diary seeker to think that you're hiding something.

, Every diary needs to be found in a suitable place after a little rummaging. For that feeling of finder's satisfaction, the diary needs to be somewhere reasonably obvious but not too obvious. If someone can't find your diary, it will make them search and search more. Never hide it in your mattress! Some spots are:


Behind your dresser drawer.
In an old backpack everyone knows you don't use.
Under some old blankets or clothes on the top shelf of the closet.
Taped under large furniture with strong tape.
In a zip-lock bag in the toilet tank.
Behind a bookshelf.
Under your bedspread.
If someone walks into the room where you're writing, keep a blanket nearby to quickly but obviously hide it under there.

Number important steps in plot development or argument.",How to Annotate," If you annotate everything you read, your annotations won’t really help you find what you need when the time comes. Before you start reading, decide what you are looking for. If you are in secondary school, you may want to ask your teacher for a list of suggested annotations.


Clearly annotate the thesis and key parts of the argument in an essay. Underline evidence that you find questionable. This will be useful if you want to argue that the author’s thesis is wrong.
Annotations on works of literature usually identify plot, character, and theme. However, they can also include setting, vocabulary and figurative language.
If you are reading for pleasure, highlight points that you found very interesting and that you might want to go back to. Consider, for example, annotating quotes that you really like and might want to use later. In addition, if you run across a big idea that changes the way you think, highlight it so that you can return to it.;
, Successful annotation is only possible if you are always reading actively. Consider reading shorter works multiple times, circling things you had trouble understanding the first time., No matter what your assignment is, you will need to understand the big idea of the text. Any part of the book that seems to speak to a major idea, should be clearly marked. Consider drawing a big asterisk in the margins so that you can easily find these elements later.

, If you miss something important it can be very difficult to go back and find it. Yellow highlighter is the best way to mark text without making it hard to read. Pencil is easy to erase if you want to correct something or return the book to a pristine condition after you finish. </ref>


Pen generally isn’t recommended because a lot of pen annotations can make the text messy, but if you are going to be taking notes sparingly and want permanent reminders, pen can work.

, If you don’t want to dirty up your copy of the book with a lot of writing, place Post-it notes in the book and write comments on them. This will also make it easier to find your notes when you are done.

, Taking a yellow highlighter to important parts of the reading is the best way to mark relevant sections without making it harder to read. However, you can also circle and underline words. Consider using different annotations to identify different topics.


Most e-book readers will allow you to highlight passages. Marvin will even allow you to use multiple colors when highlighting the text., Use circles, boxes, multiple colors, and so on. The more techniques you use to annotate the text, the easier it will be to find specific types of information. You can, for example, circle vocabulary you have trouble with so you can easily skim through and find vocabulary later. How you use each type of annotation will depend upon what you need to look for in the text.


For example, you may want to circle new vocabulary, box figurative language, underline thematic statements, and place parenthesis around descriptions of setting. Most e-readers don’t allow so many different types of annotations, but some, like Clearview, offer at least a few types of annotation.You can use different color highlighters to identify text relevant to character, theme, or setting. You can also use different color highlighters to identify important statements about different characters.
You can create different symbols to make it easier to identify relevant pages. For example, an asterisk in the margins or top of the page could identify pages with major parts of the argument. You can use arrows to point to quotes that you know you will use during the essay.

, Make a list that explains what each type of annotation you use means. If you are using a print out, write the key on a blank piece of paper attached to the printout. For an e-reader, write a note at the beginning of the text. The front page of a book can also be a great place to write out your index., Try to develop a method that you can use for future assignments. After several assignments, you may no longer need to use a legend to keep your annotations straight.

, Overly underlined or marked text can be hard to decode. Be sure to identify what you are looking for in advance and limit annotations to text that is relevant to your assignment. If you annotate everything, your annotations won’t help you find what you need when you review the book.Try to have a preliminary thesis as you read so that you know what quotes will be useful for your argument. Your thesis can, and probably should, change as you read. But having something at the beginning will help you identify important material.

, When you find a passage that may apply to your assignment, create brackets around the text. Then, record significant observations or ideas in the margins. If you do not want to mark up the text so much, you can write your observations on Post-it Notes or a separate piece of paper with page numbers listed.A common mistake with annotations is to underline too much and take too few notes. Your notes will help you to make important connections that you can refer to later. Otherwise, you might forget what it was that you found to be important about the underlined section.
E-readers also allow you to place notes in the text of the book and sometimes to export them to your computer. Most allow you to instantly search through your notes for keywords. “Skim” allows you to include different types of notes in the text and automatically creates bibliographies with your notes., Write down predictions so that you can return to the text later and remember where you think the text was going. This can be a good way to think about how the story or argument evolves and to pick out any curve balls the author might have thrown.

, Write down page numbers and a short description for the most important parts of the book. Try to group these comments by relevant subject, like theme, character change and repetitive figurative language on your additional note pages. For a book, consider putting the index on the front page. Otherwise, write them on a separate page, or in a word file.


Keep a list of themes and important figurative elements. This is especially important if you are going to be asked to do a literary analysis or write an essay. You can write these on a separate piece of paper, or on blank page in the front of the book.List comments and page numbers under each theme. The more detailed you are, the easier it will be to write a paper and provide evidence.

, Summarize the important points of each chapter. This will make it easier to go back and find relevant material. In addition, it will force you to digest what you read. Consider writing your own title for the chapter. This will help you think about the theme and major events of each chapter.In a book, you can write this in the space between chapters. For e-books, write notes at the end of the text in the chapter. You can also write comments on a separate piece of paper or in a word file.

, When you hit parts of the book that you have trouble understanding or that you think require deeper analysis, write questions in the margins. Return to these after you finish the book to see if you can answer them. Questioning the text is a good way to produce original opinions about it., When you encounter a word that you’re having trouble with, circle it. Look it up when you can and write the definition next to it., Create a list of words that you circled. Go back and study it before you re-read the chapter. This will make it easier to understand the passage the second time.

, When you are trying to understand a process or a plot line, write down numbers on the margins. Number each step in the process as you encounter it. Then, when you go back, you can quickly identify how something happened.If, for example, you are reading a book on chemistry, you could number each step necessary to produce a chemical reaction.

Nouns are words representing people, places, things, or ideas.


Dog, computer, Haiti, teacher, and dream



Pronouns are words like he, she, they, it, or who, which represent nouns.
Verbs are action words.


To run, to swim, and to fly



Adjectives are description words that apply to nouns.


Blue in blue water, big in big baby, and smelly in smelly garbage



Adverbs, like adjectives, are description words; however, adverbs apply to verbs, adjectives, and other adverbs.


Quickly in quickly run, quite in quite slowly, and very in very beautiful



Participles are words formed from verbs that act like adjectives or nouns.


Working in working farmers, flying in flying birds, and flooded in flooded basement



Conjunctions join clauses or words within the same clause.


And, but, and or

Joining independent clauses: ""Jalissa took the car keys, and she drove to work.""
Joining words in the same clause: ""Arturo likes apples and oranges equally.""




Prepositions tell you how nouns in a sentence relate to one another. There are many prepositions.


Above, on, in, between, through, and to



Articles modify nouns differently than adjectives. They help make nouns more specific.


a, an, and the


;
, It is much easier to diagram a sentence if you already have an idea of the grammatical contents of that sentence. You can write out and label the different words in the sentence, or you can simply note mentally which words serve what purpose. Some words are difficult to parse, so save those for last.


Determine your subject and verb. These are the foundations of a sentence, and thus the foundations of a sentence diagram. The subject is a noun or pronoun that is performing the verb. The verb is the action of the sentence. The subjects of the following sentences are bold, and the main verbs are italic.


Children will listen.
Though John doesn't like broccoli, he will eat other vegetables.

Vegetables disgust Felipe.

Felipe was disgusted by vegetables.

Ira gave Cho her necklace.



Find the direct object if there is one. Direct objects are nouns or pronouns that are the recipients of the verb. From the above examples, Children will listen does not have a direct object; but, Vegetables disgust Felipe does. Felipe is the direct object of the verb disgust.

, To the left of the vertical line, write your subject. To the right of the vertical line, write your verb. This is the most basic complete sentence.





, To the right of this line, write the direct object.





In the above sentence, Vegetables disgust Felipe, vegetables is the subject, disgust is the verb, and Felipe is the direct object.

, In general, indirect objects could take a preposition and so are drawn with a diagonal line coming off of the word they modify. See step 6 for prepositions.






In the above sentence, The farmers gave their kids fresh vegetables, farmers is the subject, gave is the verb, vegetables is the direct object, kids is the indirect object, the is an article, their is a possessive pronoun, and fresh is an adjective modifying vegetables.

, A predicate nominative is a noun, pronoun, or adjective that refers to the subject. The verb preceding the predicate nominative or adjective is usually a linking verb, such as the forms of to be (is, are, was, etc.) or sense words (looks, smells, tastes, etc.). To the right of the slash, write the predicate nominative or adjective.





In the above sentence, Vegetables are disgusting, vegetables is the subject, are is a linking verb, and disgusting is the predicate adjective.
Note that pronouns following linking verbs should be in the nominative case: This is she or It is I and not This is her or It is me.

,





In the above sentence, The green vegetables are always disgusting, vegetables is the subject, are is the linking verb, disgusting is the predicate adjective, green is an adjective modifying vegetables, the is an article, and always is an adverb modifying disgusting.





Participles are diagrammed similarly to adjectives. Draw the participle as a curved word on a bent, slanted line beneath the word it modifies. In the above sentence, Working farmers enjoy vegetables, working is a participle modifying farmers, which is the subject; enjoy is the verb; and vegetables is the object.

, The object of the preposition goes on a horizontal line coming off the preposition line.






In the above sentence, The kids threw the vegetables in the trash, kids is the subject, threw is the verb, vegetables is the direct object, in is a preposition, trash is the object of the preposition, and all three thes are articles.

,

If the sentence is a compound sentence made up of two independent clauses, the coordinating conjunction will connect via a bent, broken line.





In the above sentence, The green vegetables are always disgusting, and I hate them, there are two independent clauses. Vegetables is the subject of the first clause, are is a linking verb, disgusting is the predicate adjective, the is an article, green is an adjective, and always is an adverb. I is the subject of the second clause, hate is the verb, and them is the direct object (it is a pronoun whose antecedent is vegetables). The two clauses are linked by the coordinating conjunction and.


If the sentence is a simple sentence and the conjunction is joining words within it, you will split the line and join it by a broken line, or you will join two existing lines with a broken line.











In the first of the above sentences, I like fruits and vegetables, I is the subject, like is the verb, fruits and vegetables are the two direct objects, and and is the conjuction joining the direct objects.
In the second of the above sentences, Green and yellow vegetables are disgusting, vegetables is the subject, are is the linking verb, disgusting is the predicate adjective, always is an adverb modifying disgusting, green and yellow are adjectives modifying vegetables, and and is the conjunction joining the adjectives.



, Appositives are words that redefine or rename other words. Adjectives and articles that apply to the appositive are drawn beneath the appositive word.

In the above sentence, An unabashed herbivore, I like fruits and vegetables, I is the subject, like is the verb, fruits and vegetables are direct objects, and joins the direct objects, herbivore is in apposition to I, an is an article, and unabashed is an adjective modifying herbivore.

, Infinitives are the basic forms of verbs, often beginning with the word to, as in to see or to walk or to eat.

In the above sentence, I like to eat vegetables, I is the subject, like is the verb, to eat vegetables is an infinitive phrase made up of the verb to eat and the object vegetables.

, Gerunds are verbs ending in -ing that act as nouns, but often take direct objects. They are usually drawn on a pedestal.


In the above sentence, Eating vegetables is good for you, eating vegetables is a gerund phrase made up of the gerund eating and the object vegetables, is is a linking verb, good is the predicate adjective, for is a preposition, and you is the object of the preposition.
Gerunds can also function as objects of prepositions. When functioning as the object of a preposition, gerunds do not need a pedestal.






In the above sentence, You can achieve a healthier lifestyle by eating vegetables, You is the subject, can achieve is a verb phrase, lifestyle is the direct object, by is a preposition, eating vegetables is a gerund phrase made up of the gerund eating and the object vegetables, healthier is an adjective modifying lifestyle, and a is an article. See Tips below for more information on verb phrases.



, That, and other expletives like which, can introduce a noun phrase.


In the above sentence, I wish that she ate more vegetables, I is the subject; wish is the verb; that she ate more vegetables is a noun clause introduced by the expletive that and made up of the subject she, the verb ate, the direct object vegetables, and the adjective more.
Noun phrases do not always need an expletive. Sometimes it is simply understood, as in the sentence I wish she ate more vegetables. When the expletive is understood, draw an X in parentheses where the word would go.

This could be a how to book on urban beekeeping, or a memoir about your complicated family background. The best way to get a good start on writing a book is to choose a story idea that you feel committed to and willing to spend a significant amount of time on.Take out a piece of paper and make a list of things you are knowledgeable about or an idea you feel strongly about and are interested in delving into deeper in long form.
You may already have a story idea in mind. If that’s the case, consider if the story idea is engaging enough to sustain 80,000 words.;
, There are many types of writing, from fiction to non-fiction to self help to memoir. Some writers begin with a story idea or a character first, rather than a genre. But it can help to pick your genre before outlining your story idea.In fact, there are over 70 genres of writing.Your book on urban bee keeping, for example, might fall in the genre of craft and hobby books, while an autobiographical book on your family history could fit in the memoir genre.

, Head to your local library and look for titles that relate to your story idea. Try to pick newer titles so you can see what the market is like for your story idea. This will also factor in later to your book proposal, as your book should be competing against current titles in order to be relevant to the current market. This will show potential publishers that your story idea is in demand and similar current titles are being read and bought.


For a book on urban bee keeping, look for titles in the craft and hobby section that discuss bee keeping for the average person living in a city or urban area. For books that relate to your memoir, look in the historical fiction section as well as the memoir section for titles that seem similar to your family background.

, Read through three to five books that relate to your story idea and look closely at several details:


What genre does the book fall into, and why? Consider why the publisher decided to place the book in a certain genre or category. You may be surprised, for example, to find a book on urban bee keeping in the Economics section of the library. You may then think about how you can integrate the economical benefits of urban bee keeping into your book.
Who is the book’s intended audience? Think of the ideal reader for the book, and who the ideal reader might be for your book. For your book on urban bee keeping, this could be young professionals seeking a unique hobby, or older retired folks looking to make some extra money and improve the environment.
Is there a positive message, theme, or moral in the book? Morals and themes are more common in fiction books, but non-fiction and self help books can also carry a positive message. Consider how the message, theme, or moral of your book comes through in the example books. Does the author state the theme upfront or is it woven into the chapters and sections of the book? Is the moral or theme clear in the book, or hard to figure out?
How does the writer make the main character interesting and engaging for readers? This is a big concern in fiction books, as the main character or protagonist acts as the driving force in the story. Do you feel the main character is relatable or enjoyable? Did you find yourself getting bored by character cliches or flowery descriptions of character in the book? How does the author balance the main character with supporting characters in the book?
Is there an unexpected twist or payoff at the end of the book? This is a key element in fiction books, especially thrillers and mysteries, as well as some self-help books. An unexpected twist or payoff is what keeps readers engaged in the story and motivated to finish the book. Consider how the author builds up tension in each chapter to create suspense. Did the twist seem obvious from the beginning or were you surprised and entertained by the twist as a reader?

, Often, when writing fiction or non-fiction, the setting of your story will inform the details of your main character and the genre you are writing for. Think about an area you know well, such as your town or city, or a geographical area you would like to learn more about. You will then need to research certain elements of the setting to ensure it seems believable and clear to your reader.If you are writing historical fiction set in a certain time period, you will need to do some research about that time period. If you are writing dystopian fiction or a folktale, you can use your imagination to create a unique and slightly futuristic or supernatural setting.
In fiction, there is no limit to setting. From a spaceship on Mars to a pirate ship in the Caribbean, all these settings can be used for your story.

, This sentence will act as your ten-second selling tool for publishers. It should be a statement of the big picture of your book. When you later write a book proposal, this sentence should appear very early in the proposal. Writing a one sentence summary can be difficult, and is almost an artform of its own, so take your time and revise the sentence until it feels right.Go short, no more than 15 words.
Avoid character names. Instead, use a short vivid description of your character.
Link the big picture and the personal picture in the book. Which character has the most to lose in your story?
For example, a one sentence summary of your book on urban bee keeping could be: “An exploration of the economical benefits and the environmental benefits of urban bee keeping for the under 30 hobbyist.”
A one sentence summary of your memoir could be: “A young, mixed race woman searches for the mother she never knew and battles her own addictions in British Columbia, Canada.”

, Creating a working title will help you answer the reader’s questions about the book and provide a good sense of the book’s overall goal or theme. Try to match the title to the tone of the book.For example, a working title for your book on urban bee keeping could be: “Sweetness in the City: A Simple Guide to Urban Bee Keeping”, and a working title for your memoir could be: “Autobiography of a Mixed Child” or simply, “Searching for My Mother.”

, If you are writing non-fiction, your table of contents will help you organize your thoughts and act as a guide to writing the book.


Make a bulleted list, with the main topic and then sub topics or headings underneath the main topic. For example, for a book on urban bee keeping, the main topic might be Urban Bee Keeping and the sub topics could be: Origins of Bee Keeping, Development of Bee Keeping, Supplies for Bee Keeping, Hazards of Bee Keeping.
You can also use this tactic with fiction books, where the main topic might be My Life Story, and the sub topics could be: My Birth, My Childhood, My Adolescence, My Adulthood.

, For fiction books, you should create an outline of your chapters or sections. You may start with three distinct sections, broken down by time periods, or twelve chapters, based on each year of a character’s life. Though you may want to simply begin with Chapter 1 and see where your writing takes you, having a rough outline of the chapter breaks or section breaks can help to focus your writing.Start a folder on your Desktop for each part of your book, one for your introduction, another for your index or resource section. For a fiction book, you could start a folder for each chapter of the book, or each section.

, If you are writing a fiction book, your protagonist, or main character, is going to act as a guide for your reader as they read your story. Your main character should be interesting and endearing enough that your reader cares what happens to her.To develop your main character, write a summary sheet that covers:


The character’s name.
A one-sentence summary of the character’s storyline.
The character’s motivation, or what the character wants in the story in an abstract or big picture way. For example, your character may be looking for redemption and reconciliation with her heritage.
The character’s goal, or what the character wants in the story in a concrete way. For example, your character may be searching for her missing mother, or a missing family member.
The character’s conflict, or what prevents the character for reaching her goal. For example, maybe the character is battling addiction and other demons that get in the way of her search.
The character’s epiphany, or what the character learns or how she changes. For example, a reconciliation with her missing mother and an attempt to get sober.
A one-paragraph summary of the character’s storyline. This should cover all of the above points in further detail.

, Make those first several sentences count. Begin with action, dialogue, or a description that sets the mood of the story. Start as close as possible to the story’s catalyst, or the aha moment for the main character. This is the moment where your main character’s life shifts from ordinary to extraordinary and the plot of the story takes off.Avoid creating false beginnings, like the character wakes up from a dream or the main character dies in the first chapter. You want to make your reader feel surprised and engaged, rather than cheated or disappointed.
Skip the prologue and start right in the action of the first chapter. Most prologues are unnecessary to the main story or act as a way to stall getting into the nitty gritty of the story.

, In non-fiction books, it helps to draw your reader in if start with an attention grabbing first paragraph. Some ideas for generating a hook paragraph include:


An interesting or surprising example: This could be a personal experience, such as your childhood memories of urban bee keeping with a family member, or your failed first attempts at bee keeping.
A provocative quotation: Look through your research materials for a quotation that sums up your book. For example, a quotation on the environmental benefits of honey bees or on the relationship between a bee keeper and her bees.
A vivid anecdote: An anecdote is a very short story that carries moral or symbolic weight. Think of an anecdote that might be a poetic or powerful way to start your book. You can also look through your research for your essay for any note worthy anecdotes.
A thought provoking question: This could be a question that will get your reader thinking and engaged in your topic. For example: “Did you ever wonder how honey is made?”

, Focus on getting through the first three chapters, using your rough outline and your one sentence book summary as guides. Avoid stopping to revise or edit your writing, especially in the early stages of drafting. Only move forward in your writing, as this will allow you to work through your ideas. Save editing for further down the road.Note how long it takes you to finish the first three chapters of the book, and use this number (3 months, 2 weeks, 1 year) to gauge how long it will take for you to finish the rest of the book.

Don’t be afraid to take entry level positions.",How to Be a Professional Content Writer," Before you plunge into a content writing career, it’s important to be aware of the facts. Most writers graduate with a degree or certificate in content writing and are quick to learn the realities of the industry, including:


Low pay. Most content writing positions do not pay well, especially entry level writing positions. Small newspapers or publications are often good places to start in terms of gaining experience and contacts. But often, the compensation will be $10-$12 an hour.The average salary for content writers in the United States is $40,000 a year. Higher paying positions in the content writing field include project managers, online researchers, and proposal writers. However, you will need higher levels of experience to qualify for these positions.Lack of creative license. Though you may think content writing will give you a chance to showcase your creativity and rousing ability with words, in fact, most content writing is seen as a way to sell a product or simply inform a reader of the facts. In a content writer role, you will likely be writing about dry or dull topics, though you may get a chance to also write copy for more engaging projects on occasion. Your employer will dictate the topics you write about, and you will need to learn to be flexible and engaged on even the most obscure or boring subjects, regardless of your personal preference.Quick turnarounds. When you write for an employer, on their timeline, you will need to be able to write fast and write well. This is especially true for writers just breaking into content writing. Often, your project will come with an expected words per hour, or article per hour, as well as strict deadlines. You will not have time to labor over every word or turn of phrase. Instead, you will need to produce content fast and at a constant rate.;
, Technical writing is a type of content writing that focuses on communicating technical material through manuals, reports, and online documents. This could be a how to guide, a safety manual for a worksite, or a document on a process or procedure. There is a growing demand for technical writers who can explain complex procedures to the average reader.


Most technical writing programs are accelerated and take one to two years to complete. These programs will focus on improving your organizational skills, your project management skills, your ability to create user guides and documents, and your ability to write content for online formats.
Check your local college or university for a technical writing certificate program. Look at the faculty of the program to confirm you are being taught by professionals in the field or working content writers who are familiar with the demands of the writing industry. Certificate programs can be beneficial for writers who are new to content writing or technical writing., Some professional content writers argue that academic programs may be too basic or general for individuals who already have some writing experience or an existing English degree. If you feel you are already a skillful writer, you will likely need technical writing skills that you can gain through a content writing class online.To get technical writing tools, get a subscription to a site like Lynda.com for $25 and go through the courses on Illustrator, Captivate, Photoshop, and other Adobe products.
To gain knowledge on tech-comm based programs like Flare, Robohelp, or Framemaker, you may need to look at other institutions online for classes on these programs.

, An English degree, or other writing and reading focused degree, can be used to get into content writing, especially if you feel you have strong writing skills. Consider how well you did in your English classes, writing essays, book reports, and other assignments. Would you be willing to spend hours a day writing on a variety of topics for an employer? Could your existing writing skills translate into more professional writing for an employer?You may want to supplement your existing degree with a content writing course, or a technical writing tutorial online.

, While you are doing your degree, start looking for internship opportunities at local publications in your area. Some publications may offer summer positions to gain experience in the field and a taste of the professional writing world.


You may also want to consider doing an internship at a publication you hope to work for full time in the future to make connections with editors and other writers at the publication. Many of these internships will likely not be paid, at least not at first. Be prepared to receive compensation in the form of connections and contacts. But be wary of being taken advantage of as free labor. If you feel uncomfortable working for free, try to find internships that pay.A database of writing internships can be found here: http://www.writersweekly.com/markets_and_jobs.php.

, The PWA is a member based organization that acts as a “virtual learning hall” for professional writers. They offer writing and career resources, tools, tutorials, and connections to other professional writers.There is a fee to join the PWA, but it is significantly lower than other writing associations and many successful copywriters and content writers are members of the PWA.

, Talk to the professors in your program, the editors at publications you are interning at or are trying to write for, or other writers in a content writing organization or alliance. A mentor is someone who has extensive experience in the content writing industry and can impart valuable professional knowledge and career advice.There are also professional content writers who offer mentorship, for a fee. Often the best mentors are ones you can get the know personally and work with closely on a one on one basis. Before you sign up for a mentorship online, look for possible mentors in your workplace or your academic program.

, Learn how to write a newspaper article and how to write a wikiHow article. As a professional content writer, you may find a position that focuses on journalistic article style writing, or more educational how to writing. Study the form, structure, voice, and tone of each type of article so you are familiar with both types.


Choose an existing wikiHow article that seems well written and well researched. Create your own version of the article, for example, How to Write a Screenplay, and then compare your version to the existing, professional version online. Note the organization of the article, the tone and voice of the article, and the examples used in the article.
Use a newspaper article from a local publication or an online publication and break it down based on the upside triangle structure of a typical newspaper article. Does the article conform to the traditional structure or does it use a different structure or form? Does the writer seem credible and believable? Does the article use reputable sources and quotes to support any arguments in the article?

, Many content writers starting out in their careers are not sure how much they should be paid per word. Most publications pay by word, or by hour, with a certain word count expectation. On average, content writers should be paid no less than $0.02 per a word, but may not reach more than $1 a word. Salaried positions are different, as you will be paid a yearly rate for a certain amount of work. It can be difficult to get a salaried position fresh out of graduation or when you’re just starting out. Most content writers will start out working per word, or per hour.You may start out in a position that pays $17-$20 an hour, and if you write fast, this may translate to $0.03 per a word. This is fine as a starting wage, and often, the expected rate in the content writing industry.
As you gain more experience and become a faster writer, your writing opportunities may average $0.03 - $0.10 per a word. This can translate into a healthy hourly rate. However, you will make more money by pitching to clients directly, rather than relying on job boards or databases for clients.

, If you decide to go a more traditional route and apply for a permanent content writing position at a writing based agency or organization, you will need to customize your resume and cover letter to fit the position. This will show your employer that you noted the skills outlined in the job posting and that you can fulfill the expectations of the position.


Read articles on how to create a resume and how to create a cover letter. Focus on including the requirements of the position in your cover letter and how you can fulfill these requirements.

, As you start out, you may need to take on low paying writing positions to gain experience and build your portfolio. These may be small freelance gigs, at a low rate for a set amount of words, or this may be a permanent content writing position at a company for a low salary.As you complete each content writing gig, or as you gain more experience in a permanent position, add each article or piece of writing to an online portfolio. This will then help you network for other writing projects and positions in the future. With enough clips and contacts, you may then be able to freelance and work for yourself as a content writer."

Notice other format changes.,
Use a search engine.,
Plug the paper into a plagiarism checker.,
Confront the student if you suspect plagiarism.,
Determine the consequence if the student plagiarized.",How to Check an Essay for Plagiarism," If the style is noticeably different, it may be that the student plagiarized the most recent essay. For example, is the work considerably longer or does it employ more in-depth analysis than you'd expect from this person? This doesn't mean plagiarism per se, but definitely keep your eyes open for other signs of plagiarism.For instance, does this person usually make typos, but all of a sudden provides a perfectly clean essay? Does this person usually have incoherent or poorly formed concepts, then suddenly presents well-formulated statements?;
, If one sentence is simple and clunky and the next is verbose with complicated connections, it's likely those sentences came from two different sources. Watch for these changes throughout the paper, as many times students will interweave other sources into their own writing.You may also note that points of view shift or that the student abruptly ends thoughts by switching to another topic.
Also, look for a weak start and end with an amazing middle, or some other mix of weak and strong areas. While this mixture can be a sign of a student struggling to shape an essay logically, it can also be a sign of plagiarism if a student has cut and paste from various sources.

, When a paper is plagiarized, certain words may have different spellings. For instance, the essay may shift from British to American spellings or vice versa. Sometimes, a character's name in a novel varies slightly according to the version of the text. If words shift throughout, that could be a sign of plagiarism.

However, inconsistent spelling can also be the work of a poor writer.

, Of course, students may veer off topic in a essay just because they are not great writers yet. However, if the essay veers off so much that it's not even covering the main points, it may be that the student chose poorly when picking a source to plagiarize from., It's not always easy to find a good plagiarized paper. If the student doesn't read it well, they may not notice it is written poorly. Often, the odd phrasing is due to bad translations, as some papers may come from other languages., If you notice some concepts are way above the class level you're teaching, you may want to follow up on it. Of course, some students will be way above the current level, but it could also mean the student copied from another source.For example, if you are teaching intro composition and the student is doing graduate-level work, you might want to check their essay more closely.

, One way to catch plagiarism is to look for similar phrases across different papers. Often, students who plagiarize will do so from the same websites, so the same words and phrases will show up in their essays.For instance, you may find that when discussing a book like Frankenstein, a particular phrase such as ""represents the monster within each of us,"" shows up across many papers.

, If the student uses more than one type of citation style, it may be that the student plagiarized part of it. Similarly, if you requested the paper be in one style (such as MLA), and the paper is another style (APA), it may be that the student plagiarized the paper.Also, check if the citation even exists. In some cases, students make up the citations altogether, or claim that a chapter essay in a book exists when it doesn't. Perhaps you have access to the book in question and can check. Check Google Books, or look online for article citations.

, Sometimes, a plagiarized paper will have details that are not current. For instance, if the paper references a ""recent"" event that happened years ago, that could mean it was plagiarized. Similarly, if the essay references someone in a particular position that they have since left, that could be a sign, as well.Also check for old resources, which may indicate the paper is older.

, If the student is copying and pasting into a document, they may not go back and make sure the font is the same throughout. If the font changes size or style, that may be an indicator of plagiarism., The font style isn't the only thing that may change throughout the paper. You may notice that curly quotation marks turn to straight ones and vice versa, for instance. Similarly, the heading style may not be the same throughout., If you suspect a sentence or phrase has been plagiarized, you can simply stick that phrase in a search engine, such as Google or Bing. Try putting quotation marks around it to search for that exact phrase, though sometimes that will turn up no results (if the student changed part of the phrase).If the text has been copied either verbatim or fairly closely, it's likely that the search engine will return some exact matches. Any online source that has the same text should appear on the first page of results.

, Many schools offer plagiarism software to their teachers. However, many checkers are also available for free online. You simply copy and paste the text in, and the program searches for plagiarized parts by checking it against other text on the internet. While these methods aren't foolproof, they can help you determine where the student got the paper.Turnitin is one widely used site for plagiarism checking. You can also try Plagiarisma or Copyleaks.

, Once you're fairly certain the student has plagiarized, save the evidence. Then, follow up with the student. Discuss with them the evidence you've found, and use the time to see if the student will confess to plagiarism.If you're not 100 percent sure the student plagiarized, you can also use the meeting to determine if the student actually knows the material or not.However, some introverted students may freeze up under these circumstances, whether they wrote the material or not.

, As far as consequences go, how you proceed is determined by your school's policy, but it's helpful to have the incident in writing. Discuss the consequences with the student. After you've met with the student, write an email to the student noting what happened and the action you took."

Read widely.,
Pay attention to current events.,
Watch movies or TV.,
Listen to music.Musicians draw from everyday experience or classic themes.,
Do research.",How to Come up With Ideas for Creative Writing1," Good writers are good readers. Not only can you keep abreast of trends in your writing specialty and see examples of other writers' styles, but you can also find story ideas from what you read, whether in newspapers, magazines, books, or online.


Other works of fiction can serve as inspiration for your stories, as well. Scholars have cited the influence of the Scandinavian legend of Amleth and the Roman tale of Brutus on Hamlet.You can also base a creative writing idea on a quote. The classic ""Star Trek"" episode ""The Conscience of the King,"" featuring the exposure of a former dictator, who had tried to atone for his past by leading an acting troupe, takes its title from a line in ""Hamlet"": ""The play's the thing wherein I'll catch the conscience of the king."";
, If readers recognize the connection between your story and something from everyday life, they will be more likely to empathize with your characters and appreciate your story more.


Reading a newspaper, news magazine, or news website on a regular basis can provide you with a steady stream of story ideas in the form of news events. Many episodes in the ""Law and Order"" franchise were based on contemporary news headlines.Some English scholars and historians argue that Shakespeare's ""Hamlet"" was inspired by the life of King James I.You'll have to change some of the elements in the real story for your fictionalized versions in order to avoid scandalizing real people.

, If you are writing for a popular audience, see what is popular on the big screen or on your television screen. Think about topics in the same genre as other popular movies or shows.

, Build off your favorite song. Maybe listen to a Tupac song and write about gang violence. Maybe listen to a Joni Mitchell song and write about environmental issues. Listen to all kinds of music even if you don't consider a genre to be for you.

, If you think you are interested in writing about a subject, learn more about it. You might just learn an interesting detail that will form the kernel of your entire creative writing piece.Look through dictionaries, encyclopedias, and even thesauruses. You may come across a word, idea, or event that will spark your imagination."
"
Ask ""what if"".Take elements of something that happened to you or someone you know and consider how things would have played out if circumstances had been different.,
Watch people.,
Log your experiences.,
Get together with other writers.Spending time with other writers, either by participating in a writing group or by taking a creative writing class, gives you the chance to bounce ideas off other people and draw support from them.",How to Come up With Ideas for Creative Writing2,"


For example, if you talked your mother out of going to the grocery store after noticing ominous clouds on your way home from school, imagine how your life would have been different if your mother had gone to the store and it was demolished by the tornado.

, Go somewhere public where you can observe people coming and going, such as a shopping mall, nightclub, or auditorium. As you watch them, ask journalist questions to yourself about them. Where are they going? What are they doing? Where did they come from? Do they have a family? What do they enjoy doing? What do they hate?, Whether you call it a log, journal, or diary, recording your daily experiences with other people, places, and events gives you a written resource to draw from whenever you need story ideas.The more detail you put in your journal when writing down your experiences, the more detail you can take from them and put into your story, enhancing its believability.

, Another person's perspective may be enough to encourage you to accept the idea that's been kicking around in your head and run with it, or you can trade story ideas you can't develop for ideas your fellow writers can't develop but that you can."
"
Use a story starter.,
Use word association.,
Build on a randomly chosen element.,
Pretend you're telling the story to someone else.,
Think about your audience.,
Identify your purpose for writing.",How to Come up With Ideas for Creative Writing3," In some cases, you don't need to reinvent the wheel. Others have created lists of great story ideas for you to build off. Story starters or story prompts are pre-written scenarios or phrases you can use as jumping-off points for stories. You can find story starters as exercises in writing classes, in writing group newsletters, or online.

, Pick a word (e.g. farm, president, chalk, hungry, daughter...etc.). It doesn't matter what that word is. Then write down as many words that relate to it. For a fixed period of time. Set a timer for 5 to 15 minutes, then write down as many story ideas as you can think of before the timer sounds.
Challenge yourself to write down a large number of ideas, such as 50 to 100. Keep writing ideas down until you've met your goal. You can also challenge yourself to write this many ideas for a fixed period of time, provided you allot yourself a reasonable amount of time to do so. # Be sure to allow yourself enough time and put in enough effort to come up with a reasonable amount of possible ideas. In most brainstorming sessions, the majority of your ideas won't be worth pursuing. Keep at it.
Whichever brainstorming method you use, don't stop along the way to evaluate the ideas you've generated until your time is up or your goal is met. At that point, you can then review the lists you've made and pick out what works best to you. You can also then identify any related ideas and see if they generate any additional ideas.
For instance, you could begin with the word ""storm"". Then you list words that relate to ""storm"" like: wind, water, damage, clouds, danger...etc. Then pair one of those words with your original and try to tell a story about it.

, Take the name of a person or place from the newspaper, the phone book, or somewhere else and then imagine what he, she, or it would look like.


Build a backstory. For a person, this would include information about their line of work, friends, family, aspirations, and fears. For a place, you could discuss the area's geography, local history, population, and wildlife. Then, add an element of conflict, a problem that plagues the person or happens in the place you've created. Build a story about what happens as a result.Write backwards. Alternatively, you may know the outcome of a story. Now make a list of possible reasons why the character is so angry. Choose the most interesting possibilities and flesh them out, defining the event that triggered the rage and the prior events that led to it. Add more specifics to each step until you finally have the elements of a story.

, Instead of trying to write the story right away, act as though you're talking to somebody else, either by carrying on a conversation in your head or by talking into a recording device. Try to think of what questions another person might have about your idea or story. Transcribe the results of that conversation onto the page.

, For whom are you writing this piece? You will choose topics differently if you are writing for adults vs children, Americans vs Canadians, highbrow vs lowbrow people, or men vs women. Try to think about your audience's preferences and then go from there., Are you trying to entertain? Are you trying to inform? If you can identify why you are writing something, you can build off that initial inspiration."
"
Try writing a different piece of work.,
Allow yourself time away from writing.,
Exercise.,
Nap.",How to Come up With Ideas for Creative Writing4," If you're having trouble coming up with an idea for a particular story, try working on a different story, a different part of the story, or a different kind of writing altogether. Changing what you're working on might free you up to come up with ideas for your original story.


If you are working on a short story idea, stop and write a poem, a review of a television show, or even just a list of words. It is important to get your mental juices flowing and writing anything is better than becoming frustrated with yourself.

, You know when inspiration will strike. Get away from your paper or keyboard. Your brain will continue to churn out ideas or will draw inspiration from something. Even though Isaac Asimov wrote 10 hours a day, 7 days a week, he found the time to attend science fiction conventions, carry on correspondence with friends, and flirt with women.

, If you're feeling sluggish while struggling to come up with ideas, take a few minutes to get some physical exercise, either by exercising for its own sake or by doing a household chore that requires some effort for a short period of time. At the end of that time, you'll feel more alert and the ideas will come easier.

, If exercising only wears you down, perhaps you should instead take a nap. A short nap of 30 minutes or less will be enough to give you a rest and may be enough to let an idea come to you. Longer naps of up to 90 minutes may allow you to enter REM sleep and give you the opportunity to dream up a story idea.


Use a dream. If you've recently had a dream and remember it, write some ideas of it down on a piece of paper and jumble them all up to whatever you want it to be or whatever feels right to you, this should give you some ideas to write a story in the future.
Edgar Allen Poe drew inspiration from nightmares for much of his poetry.According to his claims on the 25th anniversary of publishing his 1865 paper on the ring-like structure of benzene, chemist Friedrich August Kekule claimed to have daydreamed seeing a snake grab its tail, which inspired him to interpret his research as he did."
"
Think of things you like.,

Think about how you want to start the story.,
Make up a storyboard to help you see how things flow.,
Don't be afraid to be creative with it.",How to Come Up with Writing Ideas," The best thing you can do for inspiration is... think of things you like. It might be a movie you love, your favourite animal, one of your typical hobbies, or anything that can possibly relate to you.;
, Listen to songs or watch music videos. Do anything to give you a good idea of maybe what you want your character's personality to be like, events you want to see happen, etc.

, If you want to write about ghosts, search them up. You don't want to go into a story with no information to back up the things you're putting down on paper.

, You don't want the story to be boring, and you want to catch the reader's attention. Start with a bold, interesting first statement, something to really catch the attention.

, You want a good flow throughout your story so that it looks and sounds good, and will make sense to readers.

, Remember, writing is fun if you make it so. Do you want this story to be interesting and hold a reader's attention? Then have fun with it! Add your own spice and flavour to it.

Understand the essay assignment.Understanding the assigned essay is the first step to coming up with a topic.,
Evaluate the purpose of the assignment.,
Select a topic from a provided list.,
Ask if you can write about an alternate topic.,
Brainstorm a list of ideas.,
Freewrite for a predetermined amount of time.,
Create a visual representation of your ideas.,
Remember what the teacher focused on in class.,
Think about what interests you.,
Consider the list you have generated.,
Limit the scope of your topic appropriately.",How to Come Up with a Topic to Write About1," Knowing the type of essay that is expected, the length of the essay, and to what degree research is expected will all determine the scope of the topic you will choose.;
, The purpose of the assignment will also determine the type of topic.A persuasive essay, for example, will have a much different type of topic than a personal experience essay.


Look for key action words like compare, analyze, describe, synthesize, and contrast. These words will help you determine what your teacher wants you to do in the essay.

, If your instructor has provided a list of topics for you, choose a topic from the given list. It is likely that the topics have been gathered together because they are an appropriate scope and breadth and the instructor has found that the topics have led to successful essays in the past.


Try to write a thesis, or central argument, for each of the topics.
Choose the topic for which the thesis comes most naturally and for which you feel you can develop the paper easily.

, If you really feel limited by the list of topics your instructor provided, ask her if you can write about another topic. It’s best to have a specific topic in mind when you go to her to ask about an alternative., Write down a list of ideas that come to mind. They don’t have to be good ideas, but it’s good to just start writing a list to get your ideas flowing. Just write down everything you can think of; you can evaluate the ideas later., Decide ahead of time how long you want to freewrite, then just write without stopping.Most people write for 10-20 minutes.
Do not stop writing, even if you need to just write “blah blah blah” in the middle of a sentence.
Hopefully, you will write yourself towards a useful thought or idea through freewriting. Even if it does not give you content you can use in your essay, it can be a valuable writing warm-up.

, Especially if you are a visual learner, creating a visual representation of your ideas may help you stumble onto or narrow down ideas to a good topic.Use a mind map. The center of the mind map contains your main argument, or thesis, and other ideas branch off in all directions. Draw an idea web. This a visual that uses words in circles connected to other words or ideas. Focusing on the connections between ideas as well as the ideas themselves may help you generate a topic., If you are writing an essay for a class, think about what the teacher spent a lot of time talking about in class. This may make a good choice for an essay, as the teacher clearly thinks it’s something important.Review your class notes and see if there is anything that stands out as interesting or important.
Review any handouts or focus sections of a text that were assigned.

, Writing something you care about or that you are interested in is much easier than making yourself write about things that seem boring. Make a list of your interests and see if there is a way to connect one or more of them to your essay., Write a few additional notes next to each potential topic and evaluate whether each item would be an appropriate topic. At this point, you should be able to narrow your list down to a few good choices.


You may want to ask your teacher if you have narrowed down your ideas to two or three items. She may have some insight as to which topic would be the most successful.
Go back and look at the original assignment again and determine which of your narrowed topics will best fit with the intent of the essay assignment.

, Once you have decided on a general topic, you will need to be sure that your specific topic or argument has an appropriate scope.A focus that is too broad will either make your paper too long or lead to an unsuccessful argument because you haven’t provided enough detail. For example, a topic of “dogs” is too broad for a paper.
A focus that is too narrow or specific will lead to a short paper that misses a “big picture” argument. For example, a topic of “the adoption rate of one-eyed teacup poodles in ” is likely too narrow for a paper.
An appropriate focus will give you enough space to write about the topic thoroughly. For example, “the effects of puppy mills on stray dog adoption in ” may be a better focus.

Identify your audience.,
Know what interests you.,
Freewrite about something.,
Consult a list of writing prompts.,
Keep an idea list.,
Look around you.",How to Come Up with a Topic to Write About2," The first step to virtually any kind of writing is to know your audience. The audience of your creative writing can determine the topic that you choose to write about.


Ask yourself what your audience would be interested in reading.
Think about what may surprise or shock your audience.
If you are unsure about your actual audience, create a fictional reader in your mind. You could even give your fictional reader a name.

, Writing about what is interesting to you will help your writing flow more easily, help you generate fresh content, and lead to a better final product.

, It matters less what you freewrite about than that you do it. Pick a situation that seems interesting to you: perhaps a person is lost in the desert, or perhaps they are waiting to find out if they have an illness, or perhaps they are trying to decide whether to tell someone they are in love. Then, freewrite based on that situation, thinking about what might happen, what they might be thinking, conversations they might have, etc.


Write nonstop for a predetermined amount of time (most people do 10-15 minutes.)
Do not stop writing, even if you need to just write “blah blah blah” in the middle of a sentence.
Hopefully, you will write yourself towards a useful thought or idea through freewriting. Even if it does not give you content you can use in your creative writing, it can be a valuable warm-up.

, There are whole books of writing prompt ideas for creative writing, and several websites that contain lists of prompts.Treat the prompt as a beginning point but don’t be afraid to leave the topic of the prompt.
Check your library for a book of prompts so that you don’t have to buy one.

, Keep a list of ideas of things to write about on you all the time.If you think of an idea, write it down. Go to your working list any time you feel like you need help coming up with a topic.

, Your environment contains a rich array of items that can serve as writing prompts, so just look around and write about something that you see.


Close your eyes, then open them and write about the first thing you see, regardless of what it is.
Look at the color of something nearby, and write a list of other things that are the same color until you feel inspired.
Look at an item near you and try to remember the last time you saw a similar item. Who were you with? What were you doing? Then write a story, real or fictional, about that memory.
Find a unique item in your line of sight, then imagine that you are seeing it for the first time. Write about someone from a different culture seeing the item for the first time out of context and speculating about what it is used for.

Read any available prompt very carefully.,
Rewrite the essay prompt in your own words.,
Think carefully about the list of topics.,
Select a topic that you feel the strongest connection with.,
Use a backwards approach.,
Say something meaningful and unique.,
Show, rather than tell.,
Read through the college website.",How to Come Up with a Topic to Write About3," Find out if the school you’re applying to uses the common application. If so, be sure to select one of the current year’s common application essay questions. Most college application prompts can be identified as one of several “types” of question:


Tell us about an event in your life that changed you. Be sure to answer this type of question with a specific, detailed narrative and follow it with analysis. Tie it in to who you are now, and be sure to add details about how you think it will shape your future.
Tell us how you would contribute to the diversity of the student body. Remember that there are different kinds of diversity: racial, gender identity, sexual orientation, and family history. If you are a first-generation college student in your family, that may contribute to the school’s diversity. Find the student body statistics on the college’s website to see if there is a way you would stand out.
Tell us why you want to attend this school. Be specific and complimentary, but try not to use too much flattery. Use the schools website to find specific programs that are unique to the college that you are interested in participating in. Be sure to tie your goals at college in to your personal strengths.

, Rewriting a prompt in your own words ensures that you really understand it and know what it is asking you to do. If any questions come up while doing this, consult a teacher, guidance counselor, or parent for a second opinion.

, Do not just select the topic that jumps out at you on the first read; give the topics some time in your mind.


Narrow the list down to a couple of options that you think would make good essays.
Pre-write a list of ideas or draw a mind map for each of the selected topics.

, While there may be many topics that you could write a successful essay about, if you choose the one that just “feels” right, you’re more likely to put an intuitive personal spin on your essay.

, Instead of selecting the essay prompt first, try writing down a list of personal accomplishments, attributes, and stories that you want to include in your essay and then selecting the topic that will help you shine as an applicant., The key to being successful at a college essay is standing out and providing the student body of the college with value of some sort.


Avoid generic topics or stories and try to really find something to say that highlights who you are as an individual.
Integrate your strengths and goals into the answer for the question, but be sure to answer the question as well.
Find out if there are any overused or cliché experiences that may not be successful as a college essay. An example of an overused topic is a charitable mission trip. Your guidance counselor may help you determine what has been overdone.

, This is a common mistake in college admissions essays. You can be in such a hurry to tell the admissions committee all of your accomplishments that your essay reads more like a list. Use concrete examples with personal relevance to back up all of your claims.For example, don't just say ""I have strong leadership skills."" This is telling. Instead, use a formula such as this: ""My experiences in ____ have developed strong leadership skills."" Then write about how you organized cookie sales for your Girl Scouts troop or served as a camp counselor in the summer (or whatever is germane to your claim).

, Determining what seems to be important to the college (such as diversity, community service, or personal integrity) and emphasizing that quality in yourself can make you seem like a good fit for the school.Search the college president’s page for a “strategic plan” for the coming years.
Look at the college mission and vision and try to weave these into your personal values.
Check the website for special programs or initiatives such as service learning, global leadership, or environmental conservation and integrate these ideas into your own.

Evaluate your passions and interests.,
Select a theme.,
Keep an idea list.,
Ask your audience.,
Stay current with other blogs.",How to Come Up with a Topic to Write About4," A blog may be a long-term writing project, so you want to be sure that you will still be interested in the topic of your blog in several months or even years.

, Think of your blog as a theme. A theme is a broad set of ideas that revolve around one central, controlling ideas.Thinking of your blog as a theme will help you determine an appropriate scope.
Having a consistent theme with your blog will likely make it more successful because your followers will continue to be interested in what you write about.

, Like with creative writing, keeping a list of potential topics will give you a “bank” to choose from when you’re ready to write. You may even want to write a few sentences next to some topics that you can flesh out into a whole entry., If you have regular subscribers who read and comment on your blog, ask them what they would like you to write about. They may give you a great idea that you would not have thought of yourself.Give your readers a list of topics and ask them to comment with one they would like to see.
Read comments on entries to see if any ideas have been indirectly suggested there.
If your blog is tied to a social media outlet, try asking on the social media platform what you should blog about. This may seem less awkward than making a blog post asking what to write about.

, If you regularly read other people’s blogs, chances are you will have ideas about what to write about while you are reading. Jot them down in your idea log.


Be sure to link to blogs that inspire you to write an entry to credit the ideas appropriately.
Ask another blogger to write a guest post on your page. It may trigger some new ideas in you or your readers.

To begin improving others' lives, you must first look at yourself from another person's point of view.,
Now that you see yourself clearly, it is time to help others.,
Is someone sitting by themselves at lunch?,
If you have a locker, or even just a desk, write a note to someone that seems sad lately.,
Join a club or group that helps the community.,
Just be ready.",How to Change Peoples' Lives for the Better," What do you see? Do you like how you're seen by others? If not, look around you. If you have friends, it means you may be looking at yourself negatively, while others are not. Improve the way you see yourself, and you've already helped one person, you!;
, By this, I do not mean to totally change then and try to make them more like you. I mean to support friends in need. Maybe your friend got in a fight with her parents yesterday, and now she/he is upset. Listen to them and talk to them. Let them know you are there for them. If you are good at giving advice (and read a lot of wikiHow articles like me), you can try to help your friend solve the problem. If you're no good with advice, just listening really helps.

, Make their day by getting a couple friends (and you) to come eat lunch with them.

, Say something like ""Just saying hey! If you ever want to talk about anything, you can come to me!"" You can also write a letter to someone who was out sick. Make a little card and put it in their locker or desk.

, Some groups help the environment, while others help the less fortunate people that maybe can't afford food. Walk or run for cancer! Make a donation! Every bit counts.

, If a bunch of people start coming to you for advice, take it as a compliment that they want your help! Notice that you will feel better and better each time you improve someone's life. Have fun! :)

Decide who you want to collaborate with.,
Start coming up with ideas.,
Try making a graphic organizer.,

Try not to be a control freak.,
Communicate with your fellow authors.,
Eventually, you will have a finished novel or story.,
Begin the revising process.,
Edit the story.,
Share the story.",How to Collaborate on a Story with Friends," You may choose to work with a close friend who you might agree with well or another writer who you know has good skills. Also, choose the amount of people you want in your group - you may just want two people to write, or you may want five, ten, twenty, whatever you feel would be the most fun. Keep in mind that too many friends may become overwhelming, but other than that, there's no limit.;
, Because you are in a group, you can bounce ideas, characters, themes, and plots, rather than having to come up with all of it yourself. Write down good ideas that you all seem to agree on to save them for later. Once you have all the ideas, begin compiling them into one storyline.

, This is a great idea to organize everything in a manner that all of your writers will understand and be able to save for later. Once you have all of your ideas together into one story, keep your main characters and their personalities, the setting or settings, the theme, the conflict, and other story elements on the graphic organizer for later reference.

, You can write your story on paper or online. If you choose to write online, you can pick a private network, such as Google Drive, or publish it publicly on a website like FictionPress or Wattpad. If you want to write it on paper, try making a schedule with the others on when to meet and write your story.

, After all, this is a group effort. While you're writing the story, be sure you don't only use the ideas you came up with or like. If you're writing on paper, try passing the paper around for each paragraph, chapter, page, e.t.c. to make sure everybody gets a chance to add something.

, While writing, talk with your partner/partners and make sure your story is consistent and that you agree on a situation in the story. You won't get anything done if you can't agree on how to complete the chapter.

, Have the others read over it and celebrate the finishing of this stage if you'd like!

, You can either do this yourselves or ask someone else to help out, maybe even both. Be sure there are no major grammatical errors, confusing sentences, or otherwise hard-to-understand parts of the story.

, After you have fixed the grammar in your story, look over scenes, characters, and other features of the story and see if you all like them. Feel free to take out irrelevant scenes, add ones that are needed, shorten or lengthen the story, and do anything else that would help the flow.

, After you've finished revising and editing, you're ready to publish your story! Print it out, share it on a website (if you haven't already), or leave it be. Be sure all of the writers have a finished copy at least.

Look for inspiration in nature.,
Look for historical sources of inspiration.,
Look for fictional and artistic sources of inspiration.,
Look for inspirational details in old, familiar things.,
Read motivational and self help literature.",How to Be Inspired1," Musicians, poets,painters, artists, and other highbrow intellectuals have long drawn upon nature's beauty as a source of inspiration, but, in truth, you don't have to be an egghead to be inspired by nature. For instance, simply taking a short walk in a nearby park or a nature preserve can be a reinvigorating experience. In addition to being a potentially inspiring experience, it feels great to get out into the wilderness and experience nature firsthand, so don't delay!


As you walk through nature, try to take in the beautiful, minute details around you. For instance, notice the simple, yet perfectly-crafted beauty of a flower or see the scenic quality of a creek flowing beside you. The beauty of nature can be effortless, but it's never unremarkable.;
, If you ever feel like there's no way that you, an ordinary person, can achieve great things, know that history offers hundreds of real-life examples which prove this idea wrong. Some of history's most inspirational stories are well-known, like those of Jesse Owens, Andrew Carnegie, Nicola Tesla, Mother Theresa, and so on, but countless more people who are less well-known had similarly huge impacts on history. Below are just a few:


Frank Willis: Security guard at the Watergate office building in Washington D. C. in the 1970s whose discoveries sparked the famous Watergate political scandal.
Ziryab: Persian slave in the 8th and 9th centuries who, upon becoming free, went on to become a master artist, scientist, and inventor. Among his inventions: the three-course meal.
Nicola Tesla: A great inventor, who sleep nearly 2 hours a day and work for his inventions for years and years. He had registered nearly 278 patents of his own inventions.
Audie Murphy: After being turned down by the Navy and Marine Corps, joined the Army during WWII and became one of the most decorated soldiers in history for his astounding courage in battle.
Candice Lightner: Formed Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD) after the hit-and-run death of her daughter at the hands of a drunk driver, which led to sweeping drunk driving reform in the United States.

, While real life has more sources of inspiration than can ever be accessed, fictional stories created by humans can be just as inspiring. Movies, books, songs, and other forms of art can tell inspirational stories and offer transformative new perspectives on age-old problems. As an added bonus, these things are all fairly accessible today, especially compared to certain real-life sources of inspiration. For instance, it's easy to download a new movie or song, but not so easy to start pursuing your secret mountain climber. Below are just a few examples of the countless fictional and artistic sources of inspiration that exist today:


The Shawshank Redemption: The classic uplifting tail of the relationship that develops between two prisoners over the decades.
The Brothers Karamazov: Fyodor Dostoyevsky's 19th century masterpiece tells a tale of love, death, family, evil, and redemption in czarist Russia. A must-read.
Somewhere Over the Rainbow: A simple yet beautiful song about the age-old hope that something better is waiting for you somewhere out there in the world. This song has been covered by dozens of musicians, so many different versions exist.
Space Jam: Michael Jordan and the Looney Tunes team up to defeat basketball-playing space aliens. It doesn't get much more inspirational than this.

, Sometimes, inspiration is all around us, just waiting to be noticed. If you're feeling particularly uninspired, try doing something you've done many times before or going somewhere you've been countless times while keeping a keen eye out for details you may not have noticed before. Noticing a tiny new detail in something that you're intimately familiar with can lead you on a trail of discoveries that can give you a completely new understanding of the place or process you're revisiting.


As an example, let's say you visit a nature preserve near your home that you've been to dozens of times before. This time, however, on your walk, you make an effort to venture off of the path you've taken so many times before and actively seek out new details. By doing this, you may find something new, like, for instance, a massive ant colony located just off of the trail that you were previously unaware of.

, It's definitely worth noting that many, many books, publications, and articles specifically detail the process of becoming motivated and inspired to achieve a goal or reach for the stars. These sources can vary greatly in terms of length, credibility, and quality. Some are written by Ph.Ds, while others are written by self-appointed experts. Some have great, life-changing advice, while others are written primarily to make money for the author. Some are comprehensive guides for how to live your whole life, while others detail only very specific aspects of life.


Only you will know which self-help resources are useful for you. However, whenever possible, try only to research your choices. You don't want to waste money on snake oil treatments or common sense advice packaged as profound insight, so only pay for self-help resources that are well-reviewed and verified by independent sources.

Seek new sources of stimulation.,
Travel.,
Laugh.,
Get in touch with an old contact.,
Spend time with someone new.,
Reach for a dream, even if it's unlikely.",How to Be Inspired2," When people feel uninspired, often, the root cause is simple boredom. Inspiration gives ambition and In these cases, getting yourself excited to go out and try something genuinely new can be enough to shake you out of a deep funk. Don't be afraid to break out of your comfort zone! You may discover that you had interests or talents you weren't even aware of. Below are just a few ideas to get you started:


See a movie. For bonus points, see a challenging art house picture or one from a director whose work you're not familiar with.
Listen to music. As above, you may want to try listening to styles and genres you're not familiar with.
Read a book. You guessed it — read the work of an author you haven't read before or read about a subject you have little knowledge of.

Exercise. Besides just plain feeling great, physical exercise has scientifically-proven depression-fighting benefits that can help you kick the blues and get back to your life.Go on a date. The excitement from a first date can be quite intense! Use this to your advantage by channeling this excitement into productive pathways.

, Sometimes, when you're feeling uninspired, a change of scenery can do the trick! There's a reason why so many friends, relatives, and self-help books will tell you to ""get out of the house"": removing yourself from the same old boring, uninspiring surroundings can refresh your mind, leading you to think and feel in ways that you may not have for a long time. One of the most draining parts of our daily routines is to see the same old places again and again, day in and day out. Make a change and leave these problems behind from time to time. You'll be amazed how much more inspired you feel.


If you've got the funds to take extravagant vacations or long sabbaticals, do so, but count yourself lucky! If you're short on cash, cheer up — you don't need to go to the French Riviera to recharge your batteries. Short trips to neighboring towns or cities can be just as inspiring as trips to faraway places and are much, much cheaper. Try spending a day or two at a local nature preserve, for instance. You may be surprised just how little you were familiar with the area you live in.

, There's almost no situation in life that isn't better with the addition of a little laughter. The times when you're seeking inspiration are no exception. While laughing isn't necessarily going to give you genius ideas on how to achieve your goals immediately, it will help you relax, improve your mood, and, most importantly, allow you to exist in the moment (if only for a few minutes). In short, it will put you in a state in which you'll be open to new ideas and experiences which can inspire you.

, Ringing up an old friend, colleague or mentor can be a remarkably refreshing experience, especially if you've been feeling down because of a lack of good company in your life. Reconnecting with someone you haven't seen for a while isn't just a mood-booster, though — it can also bring you inspiration in the form of new ideas, new perspectives on old ideas, and more. Because the type of people you're likely to want to reconnect with are the types of people whose opinion you respect, the thoughts and advice of these people are also likely to influence your own. Below are just a few ideas for people you may want to get in touch with:


Friends that you've lost contact with due to moving, changing schools, etc.
Old teachers or professors (especially ones with whom you had a close relationship). Great for inspiration in the form of vocational guidance.
Distant relatives you haven't seen in a long time.
Bosses from past jobs you had a good relationship with. Great for inspiration in the form of career path guidance.

, While seeking out someone you're already familiar with can lead to inspiration, so too can striking a chord with a complete stranger. What better way to gain a new, inspirational perspective on life than from someone who's entirely new to you? To be fair, not every single person you meet will have something inspirational or groundbreaking to say. Some will undoubtedly be pessimistic, dreary, and uninspiring, but don't let the occasional bad apples let you down, as getting out and meeting new people is generally a great idea if you're looking to reinvigorate your life.


For more information on meeting new people, see How to Meet New People.
You have nearly countless options when it comes to locations for meeting new people. Anywhere people gather is a potential opportunity to make a new contact. This being said, some of the best places to look are places where people are likely to share interests with you. For instance, if you're a bookworm, you might try striking up conversations at your local used book store.

, The process of striving toward a dream can be just as rewarding as achieving the actual dream itself — in the words of the old cliché, ""it's the journey, not the destination"". The knowledge that you've made a genuine effort to achieve a long-shot goal that's dear to you can be immensely fulfilling and, more to the point of this article, can be tremendously inspiring for future endeavors. Life forces us to make a choice between idealistic visions and realistic, attainable goals. By choosing the former just once, you open your life up to the possibility, however remote, that there's something amazing waiting just around the corner. It's an incredible feeling. Below are just a few ideas to get you started:



Record an album or EP. While studio time can be expensive, many colleges and art institutes offer free recording resources.

Write a book, article, or short story. While it can be very challenging to get a piece of literature published for wide release, small literary magazines and newspapers can be much more forgiving.

Make a movie. While the possibility that you'll be able to make a breakout hit on a shoestring budget is a small one indeed, the possibility of getting into a local film festival is much more achievable.
Find a showcase for a hidden talent. If you're great at something, share it! While you may not be able to support yourself with, for instance, your ability to do amazing yo-yo tricks, you may be able to book shows at local schools and street fairs for recognition and a little spending money.

Love.",How to Be Inspired3," By making something new, it's possible to learn about yourself. When you make something new from scratch, tiny pieces of you are visible in the final project. Whether painting a beautiful landscape or building a sturdy table, every creator leaves a mark on his or her creation. The process of creation is great way to observe these inner qualities as they come to the surface. These qualities can inspire you by changing the way you think about yourself. You may be surprised by what you find! Below are a few ideas of creative endeavors you may want to pursue:


Art: Drawing, painting, designing, producing music, and more.
Writing: Literature, criticism, articles, blog posts, poetry, and more.
Building: Furniture, hobby models etc., vehicles, practical art pieces, and, if you have the resources and know-how, buildings and houses.
Miscellaneous: Cooking, arranging, decorating, gardening, and more!

, One of the greatest ways to get a new viewpoint on life when you're feeling down is to do something nice for someone else, especially if this person is in a worse place than you. In addition to putting the problems keeping you from achieving your goals in perspective, performing a selfless deed usually creates a feeling of inner warmth that's genuinely difficult to recreate any other way. Most importantly, however, it makes life better for someone who may not enjoy the comfort, safety, or sense of purpose that you take for granted.


The recipient of your act of kindness can be a stranger (like, for instance, if you volunteer at a local homeless shelter or juvenile home), but s/he can also be someone who is close to you. Helping out a friend who's struggling with life's commitments can be an inspiring, perspective-changing experience and also a way to deepen your relationship and cement the bond that made you friends in the first place.

, The creative and inspirational benefits of meditation have long been touted by the practice's supporters, though the exact truth of these claims is still not a matter of scientific fact. Whether or not meditation provides a tangible, measurable benefit, it certainly provides intangible ones. Meditation can have a calming effect, which, can make it easier to focus and think clearly for some. Meditation can also be immensely refreshing, especially if you spend most of your day stressed out. Even just 15 or 20 minutes spent in quiet contemplation can be a luxury that few people are accustomed to!


If you're interested in the potential benefits of meditation, try sitting calmly on the floor or your bed with your back straight and your legs folded or stretched out in front of you. Set a timer for 15 minutes to half an hour. Close your eyes, take deep breaths, and try to think about nothing at all. Alternatively, focus on a simple word, phrase, or image until it loses its meaning. Though there are many fancier, flashier ways to meditate, this simple method works perfectly well.
See How to Meditate for more information.

, If you belong to a faith, praying for guidance in times of difficulty can be an inspiring experience. Many devout religious people pray for inspiration when they are having difficulty overcoming an obstacle or making a difficult decision. The effectiveness of prayer, like belief in a religion itself, is a matter of faith. If you believe in your faith, you may find prayer to be an inspiring experience, whereas non-believers who cynically attempt prayer are unlikely to gain inspiration because they don't truly believe it's even possible to gain inspiration from prayer on a fundamental level.


Note that different religions will have different guidelines for which types of prayers to say when you're looking for inspiration. Some may have prayers specifically written for the purpose, while others may not. For instance, Roman Catholics artists seeking inspiration may want to say a prayer to a patron saint of artists like Catherine of Bologna.In many religions, it may also be appropriate to say a prayer of your own making when seeking inspiration.

, As corny and cliché as it sounds, the love of another person can be extremely inspiring. Genuine human love is something that can change your entire life by completely changing your priorities. If you're an adult you probably know people who have made important changes in the course of their life because of their love for someone else — moving, pursuing a new job, sharing a new hobby with their partner, and so on. You may have even done this yourself!


Best of all, in addition to inspiring you, love can give you a reason to be inspired. For example, an artist who loves someone may push herself to complete her latest endeavor because she wants her lover to be proud of her, while an ordinary, everyday IT employee might be inspired to pursue the novel he's been meaning to write out of a similar sense of obligation to his lover.

Identify the emotions in your story.,
Think about a time when you experienced the emotion your character is experiencing.,
Decide how the character would react.,
Be specific.,
Use the setting.",How to Add Emotion to a Story," What do you want your readers to feel at different points during the story? How should they feel when they finish reading? How do the characters in the story feel about what is happening?

, While you may have never been through exactly what your character deals with, chances are you've felt happy, sad, angry, surprised, scared, and a whole host of other emotions before. Think back to the last time you felt the particular emotion you're trying to get across. What do you remember thinking and doing?

, Your own emotions are a good starting point, but in most cases, your characters aren't the same as you. Think about the type of person your character is and what he or she would do when faced with the situation you're writing about.


If you're having trouble imagining your character's reaction, try writing down how you think you would react in the exact same situation, what you would think, say, and do. Then, go over each part of your reaction and ask yourself ""Would my character do this?"" Even if the answer is ""no,"" this exercise may give you a better idea of how your character would react by making it clear what he or she wouldn't do and why. If you're still stuck, go through the same process but use different characters - yours or someone else's - in place of you.

, If you just write ""Sam was happy,"" your readers aren't going to be moved. It will help if they know why Sam was happy, but that's still not enough detail to make readers feel Sam's happiness too. If you were standing next to Sam, how would you know that he was happy? What does his face look like? What is he doing? Is he talking? If so, what is he saying and how does his voice sound? Specific details will make your readers feel like they are seeing how a particular person expresses happiness in this particular situation, not just being told that someone is happy.

, What you describe about the area where the action is taking place, the objects in that setting, and even the other characters can help to enhance the emotion of a scene. Remember that you and your readers are seeing everything through the eyes of your main character and the main character's emotional state will influence what he or she notices and thinks about. You don't have to have it rain during a sad scene or set a happy moment in a beautiful, comfortable room. A truly happy character may fail to notice the dull grey walls around her or even find them beautiful, while a miserable person could be unswayed by the most pleasant weather.


Another writing exercise you can try is to describe or find a picture of an environment, that write scenes where your character enters the room while feeling happy, sad, frightened, angry, tired, or whatever emotion you would like to explore. See how you can use the same set of details in the environment to convey how your character feels in each scenario.

Identify public and private goals.,
Share the public items on your list with others.,
Find others who are working through their bucket lists.",How to Make Your Bucket List," Developing your bucket list should be exciting, so find a place to brainstorm that inspires you! You might pick your favorite park, a cozy corner in your house, or a coffee shop., Your bucket list should contain items that are deeply meaningful to you. Don’t include items simply because you feel you should, or because others would find them impressive. What are your dreams? What brings you fulfillment?Consider childhood passions that have fallen to the wayside. These can be a good indicator of things you value, but haven’t had the time or resources to pursue.
Think about achievements that have given you the greatest confidence, and activities or moments that have brought you the most passion or joy.

, As you brainstorm within these categories, look for a common theme and use it to guide the creation of your list. For example, if your happiest moments have been helping others, then choose bucket list items, like starting an after-school program for underprivileged kids, that align with that theme., Don’t worry about others judging you, or not achieving certain items. Listen to what you truly want. Are there any goals that you’ve secretly wanted to pursue, but never have because you were embarrassed? Consider including those.If you don’t achieve all of the goals on your list, that’s fine! A bucket list is a guide, not a binding document.

, If you are feeling stuck, reach out to friends and family. Ask them about the items on their bucket lists and their favorite life experiences.Ask, “What is the coolest thing you have ever done?” or “If you could do one thing before you die that you’ve never done before, what would it be?”

, You can document your goals on a piece of paper or on your computer--the important thing is that you write them down. Writing down a goal increases your likelihood of achieving it., Take at least 15 minutes, and jot down every idea that comes to you. Don’t be embarrassed or self-conscious--just write! This is your chance to get everything out. You can edit later. Keep the ideas from your brainstorming session in mind.Try starting with the question, ""If you only had a year left, what would you want to do?"" Think about places you want to visit, skills you want to learn, activities you want to try, and people you want to meet.Just like with brainstorming, the best writing is done in an inspiring place! You can stay in the same location you used for brainstorming, or pick a new one.

, Of course, your bucket list should have big, challenging goals, but it’s good to include smaller goals, too. Not only can smaller goals be rewarding, by they’ll make your list more manageable, inspiring you to get out there and check some items off!You can think of small goals as those that can be accomplished without leaving your town on a budget of less than $100. For example, a small goal might be making pasta from scratch.

, It’s best to wait a bit before you begin to edit your list. Allow yourself to think about each of your items. Make sure each item is meaningful., You might want to host your own television show one day. Put that down. Then, include an easier variation of that goal, like hosting a Youtube show that gets 5K views. The easier variations can act as stepping stones to the harder goals.Do you want to write a novel? Start with publishing a short story in a local literary magazine.
If one of your goals is to open a bakery, you could start by running a successful baked goods stand at your local farmer’s market.

, Looking at all of the items on your lifetime bucket list may be overwhelming. This can lead to inaction. Short term goals are less daunting, so try breaking up your list by time periods. You can break it up by decades, years, or seasons.For example, you might have mini bucket lists for your 20s, 30s, and 40s. Or, you might make a bucket list just for the summer. It’s completely up to you. Choose a time scale that seems most manageable.

, You bucket list may--and should--include items that seem difficult to achieve. The challenge of the bucket list is part of its beauty. That being said, you should remove any items that are completely unrealistic. Your list should contain items that are hard, but not impossible, to achieve.For example, if you are a 50-year-old man with limited athletic experience, you will probably never be a professional basketball player. However, you might be able to win the championship in a local club league with practice.
You shouldn’t remove an item just because it is expensive. Expensive goals can be achieved in creative ways.

, Go through your list, and place a star next to the 3 items you want to work on first. It’s a good idea to start with the items that excite you the most. If any items have a time limit, prioritize those., People are always growing and changing. Likewise, some of the things that are important to you may change over time. Your list should be flexible. Allow it to evolve as you do. A relevant list will help you stay motivated.Set aside some time each week to go over your list. Add or remove items if necessary, and begin to plan how to make one or two items a reality., You may want to share many of your goals with the people you care about, but others may be more private. That’s ok--you don’t have to share all of them. Determine in advance which goals you feel comfortable sharing, and those you don’t., Share your public list with loved ones. By sharing your list with others, you are expressing a new level of commitment. Your loved ones can hold you accountable and offer support, prompting you to take action.Share your list with people who are optimistic and supportive. Pessimists can drag you down.
Consider working through some of your bucket list goals with a loved one. Checking off an item with a loved one can be even more rewarding.

, Motivation and inspiration are contagious. In other words, you can gain motivation by surrounding yourself with motivated people. Find people who are passionate about their bucket lists and get to know them. They’ll be able to give you new ideas while inspiring you to achieve the goals on your bucket list."

Go to writing or art critique groups.,
Create in another discipline.,
Always have a new project in the works.,
Continue growing and learning all of your life.,
If the muse isn’t visiting, get out of the house and visit her.,
Remember that art requires a period of gestation.,
Reach out.,
Be ingenious; be inventive.,
Adopt a Zen-like philosophy.,
Listen to others’ success stories.,
Remember why you started creating your art.,
And the most important words to inspire you are: Just do it.",How to Stay Inspired (for Writers and Artists)," Creative people need supportive peers to inspire, console, and bolster them. It is so important to get out of the office, study or studio to be around other people. Surrounding yourself with those who have similar goals and issues creates a positive synergy, infusing you with fresh energy. Someone in the group will always inspire you, give you a great idea, offer a solution, or provide a creative spark that keeps you going.;
, Artistic people have many outlets for self expression. For example, you can balance mental projects (writing) with hands-on (crafting). It awakens different parts of the brain and forms new neural connections. Switching it up keeps the creative juices flowing.

, If you get discouraged with one, work on another. Experiment by changing genres, trying on different styles, writing for a different age group.

, Fill your mind with fresh ideas. Go to conferences; take classes; read books about the craft of writing and art. Educate yourself about the industry. Learn a new art form. Connect with other artists who inspire you. Develop new techniques, styles, and hone your craft. Take a successful artist out to lunch and pick her brain.


Carry a notebook and a pen around wherever you go so you can note down any good ideas you could use in your writing.
Read lots of genres of book they will help you to decide what kind of book you will write and give you ideas which other authors have used.

, Make weekly art dates with yourself. Peruse book shops, galleries, concerts. Read in and out of your genre. Take a nature hike. Sketch in a coffee shop – and eavesdrop. Inspiration is all around you. Art is ordinary life charged with meaning! Look for the beauty, the grit, the unusual, the humor, the symbolism in everyday life.

, Accept moments of non-productivity as the yin that goes with the yang. Something wonderful may be brewing inside. Dream. Imagine. Allow it time to take form. When you revisit your studio, you’ll have a fresh infusion of energy. Always remember: the fire will return.

, Your art does not have to be between the covers of a book - or on a canvas - to find an audience. Teach painting classes, tutor children, visit schools. Reach out and connect with other audiences. Read stories and bring puppet play to preschoolers. Their smiles will make your day! You’ll find deep satisfaction in sharing a part of yourself and your talent.

, Organize a small schmooze, a wine and cheese event for other artist and writers. Join a book club or a crafting group.

, While you wait for agents’ or galleries’ responses, do not obsess. Focus on your art in the here and now. Artists are emotionally invested in their creations. Separate your creation from the business end. In the meantime, learn from critiques, others’ wisdom, and incorporate what is useful. Keep at it, grow, improve, and... relax.

, Clap for friends and critique group partners who are published and those friends who have illustrated picture books! And be sure to celebrate each of your little successes along the way.

, When you were 5 years old, art and storytelling was fun! Joyous! No pressure! Sometimes you have to step back and remind yourself to write because you enjoy it, not (necessarily) to gain recognition or make money. Allow yourself to play, dabble, experiment and to do “junk” art. Keep a scribble notebook handy. Write “stream of consciousness-style.” The arts are about transcribing emotion. If you keep loose, feel spontaneous and free, so will your art.

, Now! Writing requires butt-in-seat time. Art requires easel time. Roger Ebert said, “The muse visits during the act of creation, not before. Don’t wait for her. Start alone.”

You can create your own prompts by focusing on a theme like love, loss, or power. You can also choose a particular location as the prompt, such as the doctor’s office, your parent’s home, or a rocket ship on Mars.Emotions can also work as prompts. Focus on strong emotions like anger, rage, sadness, excitement, or fear.;
, Another option is to use a real life person as a prompt for the freewrite, such as your teacher, best friend, or pet. You can make up a person and use them as a prompt as well. Sometimes using a generic term for a person, like “father,” “lover,” or “enemy” can work well as prompts.


Using a person as a prompt may be especially useful if you are struggling with creating a character in a story. Do a freewrite in the voice of the character to help you generate ideas for the story.

, You can also make up your own prompts using lines from your own writing or the writing of others. Flip through your favorite book and pick a sentence or phrase at random. Then, use this as the prompt for the freewrite. You can also choose a line you like from your own writing or a line that you are stuck on in a story.


For example, you may choose a sentence like “She went into the bedroom” as the prompt. This can then be the start of the freewrite.

Others prefer a pen or pencil and paper so they are not tempted to click around on their computer during the freewrite. Choose whatever works best for you.

, Have the prompt written down in front of you. This will help you think of ideas as you write and act as a guide for the freewrite.

, Get a stopwatch or use a timer on your cellphone or computer. Freewrites are timed to ensure you stay focused and write. Usually, freewrites are done for 10-15 minutes.


You can make the freewrite longer, 15-30 minutes, if you really want to go for it and write for awhile.

Try not to read over what you write or edit it in any way. Simply write, moving forward on the page.Once the timer goes off, you can stop writing and read what you have written. Avoid doing this during the freewrite, as this will only distract you and force you to stop writing.
You can then decide to keep the freewrite and use it to create a new piece or add lines from it to an existing piece. You can also discard it or share it with someone else.

, Read Rowling's works, watch the films. Get an idea of how this genius weaves enchanting spells into her words and haunts them into our dreams. Get some headphones, plug them in, and block out the world, listening only to songs that ignite a passion in your heart. Some good songs would be by Regina Spektor, they will help evolve your imagination.

, What do you like writing? Romance? Fantasy? Crime thriller? Whatever it is, brainstorm the main aspects. You need to understand your characters and every thing that goes on. You, as a writer, must know the characters more than they know themselves, so that nothing they do may be mis-interpreted.

, Rowling is famous for her bends in the plot. Everything changes, and the twists leave your mouth gaping wide open. Take Snape, for example. The greasy-haired, miserable man, so easy to hate, turns out to be the brave hero, acting only out of love. It is this that make a story endearing. Whatever happens in your novel, please deliver at least one shock factor, it is pleasing to both reader and writer. Trust me.

, Even if it is just a small one-liner, weave some amusement in there. All readers require a small dose of light relief from the harsh, intense plot. Exactly like when Fred & George cancel the fifth year's OWL exams with a terrific firework display. Readers are so caught up in the drama of Harry's life, they need to be snapped back to sanity, something to help up with the fast-paced plot. Light relief humour is always essential. Even if it just happens once per chapter, less is fine, but not infrequent. And making the comical narratives or speech appear in bad-timing is even better, it shows how clever a writer you are. Plus, always use irony. People can't get enough of the stuff- it's like a drug.

, One of the key reasons to why Harry Potter is so widely known is the fully 3 dimensional characters. Girls relate to the struggle Hermione faces with trying to win Ron over and also cope with the prejudice against muggle-borns, which could refer to things in real-life such as 'racism', 'fascism' and other things. People who have lost someone they love relate and mourn with Harry, feeling his pain. Under-achieving tag alongs may recognise how Ron feels after constantly living under his siblings, and friends shadows. Always give characters flaws, otherwise they'd be Mary-Sue's.

, Everybody resents those really cringey scenes that consist of 'love at first sight': '""I love you so much it hurts."" The drop-dead, gorgeous boy said and I was so lost in his eyes it almost killed me. I loved him so much I had to pinch myself. I love him. I love him. I love him. It's just the best feeling ever. I want to spend the rest of my amazing life with him and have twenty children.' That is just sickly. Avoid over-emotional scenes at all cost. Let's re-construct that scene altogether, and instantly, we've evoked more emotions. 'The boy stared at me for some while before saying; ""You are Miss Brown?"" I smirked, was he stupid? ""Of course, Mr James."" I tried to tear my gaze away from his, yet there was something so startling about his vivid blue eyes that made me want to out-stare him, even if it was just to prove something I didn't even know. The silence wasn't awkward, but peaceful. How odd? Maybe I would see this boy again, maybe I wouldn't... whether I'd like to, was a different matter entirely. Either way, I didn't really want this moment to end.' The second construction is so much more intriguing, and realistic. It shows that the female character isn't a weakling who falls madly at first look, but a dominating woman who keeps her head high even in the face of lust. Don't do the corny 'I love you xxxxxxxxxxxx' bits. Remember, less is more. Make your characters grow, don't just throw them in at the deep-end, they must swim their way toward that. Remember, Ron and Hermione meet in the 'Philosopher's Stone' and don't kiss until 'The Deathly Hallows', giving them enough time to establish strong feelings.

, Since the Queen of Hogwarts reigned in the best-sellers, nobody has yet stole her limelight. Now is your chance. Make the novel different. Give it something that WILL be slated by some, but loved by others. Don't just cater for everyone. There has to be something so daring in there, people HAVE to buy it. Don't make it so 'indie' only a small gaggle of people desire it. If you want to be the next JK, please hit the popular market. Otherwise, you'll never get your name in lights.

, Why else would people pick up another book? Make it well-known. Facebook pages? Twitter? Tumblr? Wattpad? Youtube? Just get the title of your book out there... let people know the brilliance of it.

, Write as if it would be a fantastic movie. Create trailers for your novel and send it out to 'Warner Bros', 'Lionsgate' and 'Paramount. Any picture company. Someone has to reply. You have no idea how much help that will be to becoming a legend.

, Get radio interviews, newspaper, public speaking, anything you can find. Honestly, it will be the best thing you'll have ever done.

, It may sound odd, but these are the gifts Rowling gave to her army of followers:


Bertie Botts, Chocolate Frogs, Butterbeer, Diagon Alley, Quidditch, The Tales of Beedle the Bard, mythical references and the unforgettable 'Daily Prophet', and much more.

, They adore things they can take away from the experience. Like eating the real sweets Harry does, drinking the same beverages, having the merchandise and going on spin-off adventures in carry on books like 'Quidditch through the ages' and 'Beedle the Bard' and 'Fantastic Beasts'. Build up a world, and culture in which the readers will thrive off.

, Here you still are. Hunched over a computer, wanting to write a story. Get off now, get a notebook, and a pen. And imagination, get writing. Grow a pair and finally start this amazing story that you think is worthy of overtaking Rowling's work. You can do this- just believe.

, These are surprisingly helpful when rising to fame.

, Give the geeks out there something to feast on.

, Don't do this all alone. It is a long, lonely ride.

For those of you under 13, you can sign up for their Young Writer's Program. (NaNoWriMo also has ""Camp NaNoWriMo"" which is during April and July.)

, They help get you excited to write and are full of information to make your novel more realistic, ideas to pad your word count, links to online thesauri and dictionaries, and even a forum for other writers in your region. Lurking and posting at the forum will give you more determination to keep going, because you will be surrounded by people doing the same thing.

, Dares are silly (or not-so-silly) plot twists, characters, or objects that you try to work into your novel. NaNoWriMo is all about quantity, not quality, so many writers work in as many dares as possible. One of the most popular dares is the Traveling Shovel of Death™, a shovel that is used to kill or bludgeon characters. Another popular amusement is to incorporate characters whose names are anagrams of ""NaNoWriMo"": Mr. Ian Woon, Norman Iwo, and so on.

, No Problem"" by Chris Baty. This person started it all. The book is, of course, optional. However, it is great preparation for November and keeps some brain cells occupied in October while waiting for November. There are some great tips and you will get a preview of what to expect during those four glorious, fantastic, fabulous, and grueling weeks. In addition, help you customize the supplies you should lay in before November 1 hits.

, Do not be afraid to drop by the adopt-a-plot thread in the forums; those are up for grabs. You do not need to make it detailed; you do not even need to follow it completely. Chapter summaries will do, and the plan is just for if you go into a corner and cannot continue. Do not be afraid to veer off the plan or change completely. Many NaNoWriMo writers title their novel and name their characters before they have even thought of a plot. It is perfectly acceptable under the rules of NaNoWriMo to outline your plot before November 1. You may bring in as many notes and supporting documents as you wish, but the work of fiction itself must be written during November.

, In order to validate your word count, your final submission must be in .txt format or an electronic document you can copy and paste as text, but you can hand write or use a typewriter, and enter it into a computer after it is finished. Have a lamp and a comfortable chair—you will be spending a lot of time there.

, Writers stock up on energy drinks, soda, and one-handed snacks so they do not have to leave their writing spot while they are writing. Many also prepare specific ""writing playlists"" of CDs or MP3s to listen to. Buy a supply of notebooks and your favorite pens to carry around for whenever inspiration strikes.


Start writing immediately when November begins. Midnight (in your time zone) on November 1 is the official start of NaNoWriMo. You should have your notes handy, and just start writing based on what you have plotted out. Refer to them often, because you may forget a key component later, which means you have to think some more.
Keep a list of your characters as you name them. You may be surprised at how quickly you will forget who was who. A simple page or text document will help you keep them in order.
Don't go back and reread your previous day's writing each day; you will be tempted to fiddle with it. Read back only enough to get your place in the story and continue. Notes will help you keep your place without too much back reading.
Do not delete words. The backspace key will only reduce your word count; do not let it! If your novel is utter junk, well, you are not alone. Someday you will look back at the hilarious typos and the Freudian slips and laugh. (Also, there is a thread in which to post such amusing disasters.)
Try to overdo it the first week. Try to get 20,000 words by the seventh day. No doubt, it will be nearly impossible to do it, but even if you do not make 20,000, you will be a good bit ahead in case you miss a day of writing. Try to hit 35,000 by the next week, 45k the following week, and 50k in the next few days. See the pattern? You have a smaller and smaller goal every week. This is to accommodate for writer's block, which you may get from time to time. However, don't overwhelm yourself so much that you experience burnout. This is optional, but it does help you stay positive and encourages you to keep going.
Keep track of your word count. You can update your word count at any time through your user profile. The website keeps a graph of these updates.

, You may have only a vague idea of where you are going. That is all right. The objective here is quantity, not quality. Still, your story will be easiest to write if it is interesting. Do not be afraid to throw in a complication. Kill a character, have somebody get pregnant, bring in a new villain, or reveal the extent of a character's flaws. Then, see how your characters react. Take the plot somewhere, even if it is not where you intended. Sometimes the surprises are the most fun.

, Now for the hard, painful part: when midnight, local time, the night of November 30 hits, stop. Even if you have not hit 50,000, you must stop now and turn in your word count. You can finish writing it if you think you have anything to salvage, but your word count as of the end of November 30 is your final NaNo word count. Remember that even if you only hit 10 or 20k, that's more than most people ever write.


To verify your word count, you will upload your entire manuscript or paste it into the website once at the end of the month. The NaNoWriMo website does not save or publish your manuscript, but if you are concerned about anybody reading your story, there is a tool available that will jumble the manuscript so it will become unreadable without altering the word count.
Verify your word count early if you can. The website gets a great deal of traffic during the first and last couple of days of November. Verification is available starting on the 25th of the month. If you have reached the 50,000-word goal, you will receive a downloadable certificate, your name will appear on the list of winners, and in December, you'll be able to collect your prizes.

, In the spirit of NaNoWriMo, you should have done no editing during November, which means your novel will need cleanup to be the best it can be. If you decide to work with it, expect to put in a year or so of editing to get it ready for others to see.

, If so, give copies to friends, family, and other NaNoWriMo authors.


A few NaNo authors do publish their books in print with book publishers, but most manuscripts require extensive revision to achieve that quality.
It is easy to publish a manuscript online. Be sure to mark it with your copyright or a free license of your choice. The other option is to self publish, which many people do, or you may also go through a traditional publishing house.

Decide whether to write a basic announcement.,
Announce the death.,
State whether you will have a service.,
Identify where people can send donations.",How to Write a Death Announcement1," A basic announcement is always appropriate if you feel too overwhelmed to write anything else. You can keep your announcement to a few sentences. However, there may be other situations where you want to write a short announcement.


You’re publishing an announcement in a newspaper. There may be a word limit, so you may want to keep the announcement as short as possible.
You want to invite people to the funeral but don’t know them too well. You can limit the amount of information you share with people you don’t know. You can send a more intimate announcement to friends and family.;
, You can begin your announcement with a simple sentence stating who has died and the date of their passing. You may also choose to include their age. Often, you will make this announcement as a family.


For example, you can write, “The Smith family announces with great sadness the loss of their beloved mother, Eileen, age 81, on September 1, 2016.”Here is alternate wording: “The Smith family announces the passing of their mother, Eileen, who died peacefully on September 1, 2016.”
Another wording: “Eileen Smith. 81. Our beloved mother passed away on September 1, 2016.”, You might hold a mass or a funeral—or both. You should state when the event will be held and where.


For example, you can write: “A Holy Mass will be held on September 8, 2016, at 8:00 pm at the Catholic Church of St. Ann.”If you’re having a funeral, then write: “A funeral service will be held on September 8, 2016 at 2:30 pm at United Methodist Church, Any City.”

, Those in grief might want to contribute money in the memory of your loved one. Make sure to mention any foundation or scholarship fund they can contribute to.For example, you can write, “Memorial donations in Eileen’s name may be made to the NAACP College Fund.”

Play “go find” surrounding the topic at hand.,
Host a crazy movie night where everyone is a critic.,
Write a “fill-in-blank” story to generate ideas.,
Describe random items using out-of-the-box words and phrases in order to get the creative juices flowing.,
Hold art class instead of a meeting.",How to Have a Brainstorming Session Without Talking," For example, if your team is brainstorming about how to sell a certain product, provide each team member with a copy of the product and then ask them to “go find” other items that convey or describe the product.

Break your team into pairs of two or play the game with individual players.
Provide either the actual product, prototype/model or a photo/description of the product. For example, if you're trying to sell cars, you probably won’t be able to give each team member a vehicle during the exercise.
Allow team members a certain amount of time to find items and parameters of where to look. You may want to limit the search to the office or within office property. Also, since this game could go on for hours on end, keep track of time and allot each team up to an hour, for example to search.
Suggest that for each descriptive item found, the teammate must write a short statement or draw a visual depiction as to why that item best describes or promotes the product. For instance, if you're brainstorming about how to make dog food seem healthier, you could gather some of the wholesome ingredients and write about or visually depict how real food, not byproducts are in this dog food.
Ask each teammate or team to create a display making use of his or her items. Give teams creative freedom as to how they’d like to display items, such as using display boards, tables and any other fun tools. Another approach is a visual demonstration using mime, imagery, improvisation or skits (a little ""talking"" could be permitted but only if it is like a play, not like a meeting discussion––improvisation can force participants to use rhyme, singing and gestures rather than the usual talk).
Request that everyone walks through the room to see what other team members have found. Suggest that individuals take notes surrounding each display which they can use later to come together as a unit to discuss. Doing so could take the brainstorming session to a new creative level. For the visual demonstration, simply have observers make notes as and when they like while watching, for later discussion.;
, Sometimes the best ideas can be derived from a film. Consider having an inspirational movie night or week (depending on your team size and amount of time) to pull brainstorming ideas from beloved films.


Ask each person to suggest one or two films that they feel best describes the topic at hand. Films should be easily accessible on DVD and can be viewed at work or at a team member’s home. Make a few rules before viewing movies, such as film ratings and length so that no one brings in a lengthy, inappropriate film.
Over the course of an evening, few days/afternoons or a week, host movie watching event. Request that the person who suggested the film(s) write a quick synopsis of why this film was chosen for the brainstorming project.
Provide each participant with a sheet of paper and a pen to write about why they believe the film inspired or did not inspire them as they're watching the movie.
Request that each participant provide two to three ideas derived by watching the film on how to sell or promote the topic.
Collect and maintain a file of the ideas and participant’s thoughts. When the team has watched all of the films, have the group review the entire file and begin a collaborative idea writing session based on the thoughts produced by watching the films.

, The idea is to write a collaborative story based on a particular topic with the goal of reaching a new creative height. Each participant is given directional goals and writing parameters prior to the writing session.

The team leader begins the story by writing the initial sentence. This sentence will set the tone for the story, however as the story travels from participant to participant, it is expected to morph and develop. The initial sentence could begin something like: “Once upon a time there was a lonely bottle of mustard who was lost on a shelf in the grocery store” (in the event selling mustard was your charge).
Without speaking, the team leader will slide the story to the next participant who must write a specific number of sentences that build upon the initial statement. Be sure you designate how many sentences each participant should write.
The last person to contribute to the story arrives at a conclusion and passes the story to the team leader.
Without showing anyone, the team leader makes enough copies of the story for each participant and distributes the completed story to each participant.
The participants should read the story in its entirely and then arrive at a statement that describes the story.
The team leader collects all of the statements and then the group reviews the statements in order to arrive at a creative slant or way to promote or sell the item.

, This brainstorming session may not specifically lead to answers on how to sell a particular item, but may serve as an icebreaker for a hard core brainstorming session to follow.

Gather several household/random items such as a hat, spoon, mixing bowl, dust buster etc. Provide several envelopes, pieces of paper and pens for each participant.
Set the items up on individual tables within a room. Allow for enough space between items and possibly try to match the same number of items you have as participants (for example, if you have 10 people in the brainstorming session, find 10 household/random items).
Ask each participant to stand in front of one item with a piece of paper and a pen. Request that the participant study the item for a few minutes, taking in its features.
Ask each participant or team to write down five adjectives that describe the item. Suggest that instead of thinking deeply about which adjectives would work best, to just write down words that quickly come to mind.
Give participants a certain amount of time to write down their words and then ask everyone to move to a new item until everyone has describe each item in the room.
Request that each participant or team place their piece(s) of paper in the envelope and place the envelope either in a hat or on the table. Mix up the envelopes.
Invite a participant to randomly select one envelope. The group should study the word list and then have to find the item in the room that is being described.

, Hand out art smocks and easels with paper and paints/markers to each participant. Tell them to paint several images that come to mind when particular objects, words or anything else is shown to them.


Tell each participant that artistic ability is not being judged. They are free to paint, draw, squiggle, doodle, etc., however they like, whatever comes to mind. In fact, they're not to delay, as it's their initial ideas that count most.
At the end, pass the images around the group to gauge other people's thoughts and to see what new inspiration arises as a result of the images team members have drawn or painted.

Explain the cause of death.,
Provide other details.",How to Write a Death Announcement3," You might want to share more details about the death, such as the cause of death. Often, people want to share this information with close friends or family in an email or letter.


An intimate death announcement allows you to adopt a more informal tone. You can address the reader as “you.”

, You can identify when your loved one died. Because the announcement is informal, you might only want to state the day of the week instead of the date.


For example, you can write: “Our family is devastated to announce the untimely death of our beloved uncle, Jack, who passed away last Friday.”, By including the cause of death in an intimate death announcement, you can prevent people from responding to your letter or email to ask how your loved one died. Instead, just put that information in the announcement.

Reduce your risk of identity theft.",How to Write a Credit Card Cancellation Letter," Before you can cancel a credit card account, for any reason, you must make sure that you do not owe anything. If you try to cancel an account that has an outstanding balance, you are likely to affect your credit rating or set off some collection effort on behalf of the company. The best way to reach a $0 balance is to stop using your card.If you cannot afford to pay off the balance in the first month, you may need to pay it over two months. Do not use the card at all while you are paying down the balance.;
, After you have made what you believe to be your final payment, check your next monthly credit card statement. If the balance is not $0, then you will need to continue to pay down the balance.Even after the balance reaches $0, you need to check the monthly statement carefully. You need to check the purchases that are recorded, to make sure that everything you have used the card for is reported.

, When you believe that your account is fully resolved, call the credit card company’s customer service number. Ask to verify the amount due on your card. If the representative verifies that there is no balance, you can then proceed to cancel the account.You should be able to find the customer service number for your account either on the back of your credit card or on the monthly statement.

, When you have verified that you owe nothing on the account, tell the customer service representative that you wish to cancel the account.Credit cards are a sales business, so be prepared for the representative to try to change your mind. You may be offered a lower interest rate or even some sort of incentive gift to keep the account open. If you wish to accept one of these offers, be sure that you understand the terms of your new account. Otherwise, proceed with the cancellation.
For example, when the sales representative offers you a lower interest rate or a trip to Las Vegas, you might reply with, ""Thank you very much for the kind offer. However, I have really decided that I don't need this card, and I wish to cancel it."" You need to sound decided, or the sales representative is likely to keep pushing. Eventually, you may just have to say, ""I am trying not to be rude, but I really do not want to keep this account. Please cancel it for me.""

, The customer service representative will probably tell you that you can cancel your account over the telephone. Even so, you should ask for the name and address of someone to whom you can send a letter, so that you can confirm the cancellation in writing.After the customer service representative has verified that the account will be canceled, you should still send a letter of your own to confirm the conversation. Ask the representative, ""What is the name and address I should use to send a confirmation letter for this cancellation? Do you have any particular format or information that I should include?""

, The letter should have your name, home telephone number, cell number, mailing address, email address and account number. Reference all of this information at the top of the letter, before the body of the letter., In your letter, make reference to the recent telephone conversation that you had regarding your account. This will help put your letter into context and explain why you are writing.For example, your letter may begin, “Dear Sir or Madam, I am writing to confirm a telephone conversation that I had with Agent #34567 on July 15, 2016.”

, You do not need to apologize or give any explanation for choosing to cancel your credit card account. You are entirely within your right to do so, as long as you no longer owe any money.A simple sentence should suffice: “I understand that my account has been closed as of our telephone conversation on July 15, 2016.”

, In your letter, you should verify that your credit report is to show that you voluntarily canceled your credit card account. This is important for your credit rating. Your rating will be affected quite differently if you voluntarily cancel an account than if the company closes it without your involvement.You may ask, “Please ensure that my credit report correctly reflects that this account has been ‘closed at the consumer’s request.’ Please provide me with written confirmation that the account has been closed.”

, Finish the letter with a signature. You should use your formal, full name signature, as you would if you were signing a legal document or contract., When your letter is ready to go, take it to the post office and send it by certified mail, return receipt requested. This will require someone at the company to sign for the letter, and you will receive a card with the signature. You may want this in the future to prove that the letter was received., You should maintain a file consisting of your closing credit card statement, any notes from your telephone conversations, and a copy of the letter you sent and the post office signature card. In case any problem arises from this account after you believe it has been closed, you will want to refer to these documents., The company may need 30 days or more to finalize the cancellation and for notice to reach the credit reporting agencies. After waiting for about a month, you should check to make sure the cancellation is on the report, with the note that the account was closed at your request.

, Credit cards are convenient. But having too many cards available may provide just too much convenience, which can result in overspending. If you find that you have difficulty controlling your spending habits because the credit is just too easy, then cancelling one or more cards may help., Your credit score is optimized when you carry a few open credit cards and manage them well. If you are carrying excess cards and not using them, this could be reflected in a lower credit score. You may find that cancelling some of the excess cards may have a positive effect on your credit score.A review of your credit report will list ""risk factors"" that account for a low score. One of these risk factors may be ""too many credit cards.""

, Some credit cards require the payment of an annual fee in order to use -- or even just to have -- the card. If you have cards that require an annual fee, you may be better off by cancelling those accounts and focusing on the cards that are cheaper to use.On the other hand, some cards that charge a fee may also give you incentives for using the card. These incentives could be cash-back awards, free airline miles, gasoline discounts, or some other valuable awards. If the incentives outweigh the fee, you might be ahead by keeping the card and paying the fee.

, In today's world, identity theft is a growing concern, and credit cards are a key focal point. The more cards you have open, and use, the higher your risk will be that one of those cards could get ""hacked"" and open you to identity theft. Limiting your number of credit card accounts should help keep this in a manageable state."

Address your letter to the customer service department.,
Quickly get to the point of your letter.,
State specifically what outcome or remedy will satisfy you.,
Attach copies of supporting documents.,
Give them a time limit to resolve the matter.,
Finish the letter respectfully.",How to Write a Complaint Letter to a Company2," When writing a letter of complaint, your best chance of success will come from directing the letter to the customer service department of the company. The customer service department is accustomed to dealing with complaints and your letter is likely to be processed efficiently and effectively.Try to find out the name of the customer service manager or director and address your letter to them personally. Begin your letter with Dear Mr, Mrs, Miss or Ms followed by their surname. If you cannot find the name of the customer service manager, simply write Dear Sir or Madam.You should be able to find the address of the customer service department on the company's website, on any of the company's promotional or advertising materials or product packaging or labels., The very first line of your letter should clearly address why you are writing the letter and what your exact complaint is. Give as many pertinent facts as possible, including the date, time and location where you made the purchase or received the service, along with any relevant serial or model numbers.


The recipient of the letter should be able to identify the point of the letter in under five seconds, so avoid any long, rambling intros.
You may provide further detail or explanation of the situation in the paragraph following your opening sentence, but the first line should draw attention to your complaint as succinctly as possible.
For example, your opening sentence might read: ""I am writing to complain about a faulty hair dryer that I purchased from your company on the 15th of July at your location on First Street, Exampletown.""

, If you want a replacement, a refund, a repair, or some other form of compensation, state this clearly in your second paragraph. This will help to avoid receiving a form letter or other stock response, and give the recipient something to work with on their end.


Try to be as constructive as possible in your comments, suggesting a way that you can move forward and continue your relationship with the company. If you demand a refund or some other form of compensation, while simultaneously informing them that you plan on taking your business elsewhere, they will have little incentive to try to resolve the problem.If you would like the company to correct a broader problem, state that in your letter as well, but recognize that such a thing may take time.
Do not threaten legal action in your first communication. It may be the solution you ultimately require, but send your complaint letter first and await a response.

, These may include receipts, guarantees, warranties, copies of checks you sent and, if appropriate, photos or videos. All documentation should be included with your letter.


Make sure that you send copies of any documentation you wish to include, not the originals. That way, there's no chance of this key information being lost or mislaid, should you need to provide evidence to someone else.
Also make sure to state in the body of the letter the exact materials you are including. For example: ""Please find attached a copy of my original receipt, along with a copy of the hair dryer's guarantee and information regarding the serial number.""

, It is helpful to provide an exact time period within which you would like the issue to be resolved. This will give you peace of mind and will help bring the issue to a speedy conclusion.


Providing a time limit will also help to prevent the possibility of your letter becoming lost or forgotten about, which may lead to further awkwardness and resentment between you and the company.Just make sure that the time period you provide is reasonable. A week or two is usually sufficient, though this will vary depending on what your requests are.

, Thank the recipient for their assistance, and let them know how and when they can reach you to resolve the matter. This will make their job a lot easier, resulting in a more efficient outcome for you.



Sign off the letter with Yours sincerely, if you know the name of the person you are writing to, or Yours faithfully if you referred to them as ""Sir"" or ""Madam"". Avoid informal closings such as ""Best,"" or ""Yours truly."""
"
Be polite.,
Be concise.,
Be authoritative.,
Format your letter in a clean, correct way.,
Check spelling and grammar.",How to Write a Complaint Letter to a Company3," You may be angry, and may have every right to be, but being rude will only put the recipient on the defensive. Write in a respectful tone and avoid making threatening, angry or sarcastic comments at all costs. Remember that the person reading your letter was not directly responsible for whatever happened, and they will be much more responsive and willing to please a gracious, polite customer than an angry, accusatory one.


Remember, the company to which you are writing probably isn't out to get you, intentionally. Most companies have an interest in their customer's satisfaction.
You will have much better success treating the recipient as somebody who wants to help you, rather than assuming they're filled with malicious intent.
Don't write when you're furious. Wait to write your letter until you have calmed down. Or if you wish, write the letter while you are fully steamed, and then let it sit for a day or two before you send it. In all likelihood, you will want to rephrase things in a less-incendiary way.

, Customer service representatives may receive as many as hundreds of letters a day, so it's vital that you get to the point quickly, so they know exactly what they're dealing with as soon as they begin reading. If your letter is too long or detailed, the reader will be inclined to skim its contents and end up with an unclear idea of the exact problem or your desired resolution.Avoid superfluous detail or going off on long rants or tangents.
Try to keep your letter on a single page, or under about 200 words.

, Being authoritative in your letter creates the right tone and lets the company know that your complaint is to be taken seriously. This is especially true of more serious complaints, which may have considerable financial implications.Being authoritative encompasses a range of things, such as the quality of the language used, your knowledge of your rights and the company's responsibilities, as well as the professional presentation of the letter.All of these things give you credibility, which should positively effect the response to your letter.

, As mentioned above, formatting your letter in a professional way can favorably influence how your complaint is received. Include your name, address and the date in the top right-hand corner, followed by the name or title of the person you are writing to, along with the company's address, on the left-hand side, just above the body of the letter.


Always type up your letter on a computer, this makes it easier to read and is much cleaner looking. If you must hand write your letter, make sure your writing is clear and legible, with no crossed out words or ink smudges.
To write your signature, leave a blank space under the Yours faithfully or Yours sincerely where you can write in your signature by hand. Underneath this space you should also type your name so it is easily read.
Keep the letter tidy and well-spaced, with paragraphs of approximately equal-size.

, Incorrect spelling and grammar can negatively influence how your complaint is received. Make sure to do a spell check on your computer before printing the letter, or have someone else read it over before you send it.

Wait until the time limit you provided is up.,
Proceed along the chain of command.,
If you wish to pursue legal action, see an attorney.",How to Write a Complaint Letter to a Company4," Be patient and do not pursue any further action until the time limit you provided in your initial letter is up. If this date passes and you still haven't heard anything, you may follow up with a phone call or email to check if the letter was received. It is always best to give the company the benefit of the doubt.


If you still do not receive any information regarding your letter or if you do but the situation was not handled to your satisfaction, you can proceed by addressing your complaint to someone higher on the chain of command.

, If you are unsuccessful in your dealings with the customer service director, try to find out who the next person in the chain of command is and reach out to them instead. Each time you move up the ladder, whether it's from Customer Rep to Supervisor to Director to Vice President to CEO, attach the correspondence you have had at the previous level. This will update your new company representative and very possibly get the matter resolved in a non-litigious way.


It is better to start with the customer service department before working your way up instead of going to straight to the top. This is because the customer service department are more used to dealing with these types of complaints and any letters addressed to the CEO will probably be referred back to this department anyway.If this is the case, the employees of the customer service department might automatically regard you unfavorably, as you tried to go over their heads.Be aware that if you are writing a letter to a CEO or Managing Director, it will need to be extra clear, concise and well-written, as they will have no prior knowledge of the incident.

, He or she will know how to proceed. Keep in mind that legal action should be your last resort and leading with it in your letter sets a negative tone and will derail any requests for compensation you may ask for at the same time. It also may come back to bite you if your bluff is called.

Provide a space for both signatures.",How to Write a Credit Card Settlement Letter," Before trying to settle your credit card debt, you need to decide what you can afford. Review all of your outstanding debts, and compare these to your regular income and any other funds you have available.


Using your credit report can help you make this decision. Many people focus on their credit score, but your credit report is much more than just a score. It will provide a list of all outstanding debts that you owe, open accounts that you have, and ongoing collection efforts against you. These all factor into your ability to settle a particular account.
See Get Your Credit Report for Free for more information.
If necessary, you may wish to get a copy of your credit reports from the three major U.S. reporting bureaus, TransUnion, Equifax and Experian. Their websites contain information about obtaining copies of your reports. ;
, If your offer is too small, the company is not likely to accept it, but if you offer too much, you run the risk of not being able to make the payments. Find a number in the middle that you believe you can justify. Offer less for older debts. The company is likely to believe that older debts are generally less collectible. Therefore, they are more inclined to accept a lower offer. A reasonable offer might be something around 15-to-25 percent of the debt. , Anything other than full, on-time payment will hurt your score to some extent. A settlement, however, is better than waiting until the account goes to collection, because it will show that you took some responsibility and addressed the issue directly.

, Find out which office of the credit card company handles settlement offers. You can usually discover this by looking up the company online or calling the customer-service number on the back of the card itself. When you reach someone at the company, say that you would like to make an offer to settle your debt, and ask what address you should use for sending a letter.


Ask if you should address your letter to a particular individual. In most cases you will just write to the collections office (or something similar), but some companies may refer you to a particular individual.

, At the top of your letter, below the address, you should state the account number. Especially if you have more than one account with the institution, it is important to state clearly which account you are trying to settle. , Avoid getting emotional about the problems in your life, but you should explain your reason for needing to settle your debt. It will help your case if you can refer to a particular cause, such as an accident, divorce, or something else that is not likely to repeat. If you've simply overspent, the company will be less inclined to settle, because they have no assurance that your spending habits will change in the future. As an example, your letter might begin by saying, “Due to a recent automobile accident and the medical costs I have incurred, I find that I am unable to make all my outstanding credit card payments. I am writing in the hope of reaching a settlement with you for an amount that I can realistically pay.”
An explanatory letter for a settlement like this may help you with future lenders as well. Keep a copy of the letter, and be prepared to share it. Potential lenders will be concerned when they see a settlement on your credit history, but your explanation will lend context.

, Provide a precise statement of the amount you're offering to pay. You should also make it clear whether you're suggesting a one-time payment or a payment plan for a number of months. Either could be acceptable, but you should clearly outline your offer. An offer of this type could say something like, “I am able to make an immediate payment of $4,000 in full settlement of my outstanding credit card debt.” Be sure to use the phrase “in full settlement,” so it is clear that you mean this as a full and final payment and not as part of a payment plan.
If you intend to begin a payment plan, you could offer something like this: “I would like to start a payment plan, whereby I would pay you $1,000 by the first of each month for the next six months. This $6,000 would constitute full settlement of my outstanding credit card debt.”

, At the end of your letter, ask the company to respond to you by a particular date. You should allow at least two weeks for the response. However, even if you do not receive a reply by that date, do not assume that your offer has been rejected. You should call the company, refer to your letter, and try to continue the negotiations. , Whether you initiated the negotiation by phone or in writing, you should find out the name of the individual handling your account. Address any follow-up correspondence directly to this person by name. , In any letters you should make reference to earlier letters or conversations. Provide a brief history of the negotiations so far. This will help maintain context for your current correspondence. For example, your opening paragraph may say, “I am writing to follow up on our telephone conversation of July 16, 2016. I made an offer to resolve my credit card account with a single payment of $2,000, but you countered by saying that your company would accept $8,000.”

, Any negotiation involves give-and-take between the two parties. If you can reasonably increase your offer, you should include the newest offer in your letter. If, however, you have reached a point you honestly cannot move beyond, you should say so. The company will then be forced either to accept your offer or proceed with legal action. This latest letter could state, “I appreciate your request for a payment of $8,000. However, I cannot meet your request. I am able to offer a final payment of $3,500 in full settlement of my outstanding debt.”

, If you pay anything less than the full amount due, your credit score is likely to drop. However, you can try to minimize the damage by modifying the way the company reports the settlement. Ask them to report your account as ""paid."" This is best for you. If they won't do that, suggest that your account be classified as ""settled."" The poorest result for you would be a report of ""charged off"" or ""transferred,"" which indicates you have not paid the full amount. In that case you might expect to be contacted by a collection agency. Realize that you really have very little leverage for controlling the way the company reports your account to a credit-reporting agency. Even so, it is worth discussing. Ask for the most favorable treatment you can get.

, Retain a file of all letters you send and receive. You may need to refer to these in the future as you consider further offers. , Eventually you and the credit card company are likely to reach a settlement. When that occurs you must confirm the agreement by putting it in writing. , In your final settlement letter you must make sure to state the terms of the agreement accurately and completely. Be careful not to leave out any details. Include all of the following:


the amount of your agreement
the payment deadline. Even if the agreement is for “immediate” payment and you are including a check with the letter, you must say so.
periodic payment dates if you are setting up a payment plan
the phrase “full and final settlement.” This binds the company legally to this amount and prevents future collection efforts for any additional amounts.
a description of how the company will report this debt to the credit-reporting agencies. It makes a difference whether a debt is reported as “paid,” “settled,” or “paid late.” Try to negotiate for a reporting of ""paid.""

, You should sign the letter and provide a space at the bottom for a representative of the company to sign, indicating the company’s agreement.


Send the company two copies of the letter with your original signature. In the body of your letter, request that the account representative sign one of the letters and return it to you.
Above the signature space, include the words, “Agreement accepted.” Then provide a line for the company representative to sign and insert the date.

While some states limit your ability to file a complaint against an attorney you have not hired, most states will allow you to file a complaint against any lawyer you believe has acted criminally or unethically.


For example, in New York, you can make a complaint against a lawyer even if you have not hired them.Also, in Washington, you can make a complaint against your present attorney, your past attorney, or even opposing counsel.;
, In general, you can make a complaint about any action your attorney takes that you believe is unethical or improper.Attorneys have to abide by a certain set of state mandated rules that govern the ethics of the practice of law. If an attorney breaches any one of these rules while representing you, you may want to consider making a complaint. While it can be difficult to know if an attorney is following the rules or not, the following are common examples of legitimate complaints:


Your lawyer is holding money for you and will not return it to you or provide you with an accurate accounting of how it was spent;
Your lawyer consistently does not respond to inquiries about your case, inform you of court dates, or appear in court;
Your lawyer does not tell the truth or asks you to lie;
Your lawyer fails to do what they say they will do or does not perform their duties in a timely manner., While there are endless amounts of complaints you can legitimately make against your attorney, there are some topics that will typically not be entertained by your lawyer, a disciplinary board, or a court. If your lawyer's conduct does not rise to the level of an ethical violation, your complaint will be thrown out.You may not like what your lawyer does, but that does not necessarily mean you have a legitimate complaint against them.Generally, the following types of topics are not cognizable:


Your lawyer's personal life (e.g., disagreements with neighbors, creditors, or spouses).Your belief that your lawyer generally did a bad job.Your belief that your lawyer was rude.Your lawyer made a single, honest mistake., If you have a legitimate complaint against your lawyer, start by sending them a personal letter. Oftentimes, an attorney will be happy to work with you to resolve your issue so it does not reach the state bar.Also, your attorney may not know about your dissatisfaction, and if you write them a letter before filing a complaint, they may be able to fix it quickly and amicably.


While this is your first option, if the informal complaint letter does not lead to the outcome you desire, you may have to file a formal complaint against your attorney.

, When you sit down to write your complaint letter, use a computer and write in a professional tone. Furthermore, Your letter should include the following information:


Your contact information, so your attorney can get in touch with you. Also, you should request a response from the attorney within a specified period of time.A clear statement of your complaint. This should be towards the top of your letter and should lay out exactly why you are dissatisfied. For example, if you believe the lawyer has lied to you, clearly state that you believe they have been dishonest.
An easily understood statement of facts that back up your complaint. For example, if you believe your attorney has been dishonest with you, walk them through the facts that lead you to believe this. Include as much information as possible, including times, dates, and places.
A request for relief. At the end of your letter, you should request some sort of relief that will satisfy you. Make sure the relief you ask for is reasonable, as an attorney will be much more likely to oblige if you do so. For example, if you believe your attorney has been dishonest with you, you may want a written apology and then you may want to find a new attorney to handle your case. Note here that you never need your attorney's permission to fire them; you can do this whenever you want.

If your complaint is about money (e.g., excessive fees or the return of unused funds), you might ask for the funds back.



, Once you have written your complaint letter, send it to your attorney, return receipt requested.In addition, you may want to deliver a copy, in person, to their office as well.


Always keep a copy for your own personal records.

, An attorney will usually respond to a complaint quickly, as they know the possible repercussions of having a formal complaint filed against them. If your attorney responds and agrees with you, hopefully this will satisfy you. However, if your attorney responds and disagrees with your claims, you may have to file a formal complaint in order to have a third party look at the issue.


If your attorney fails to respond at all, your letter can be used as evidence during the formal complaint process., Once you have exhausted all informal options, including writing a complaint letter to your attorney, you may have to resort to filing a formal complaint in order to resolve your issue. While it is not necessary to hire an attorney to help you with the formal complaint process, it may be advantageous to do so. For one thing, you might have other legal options apart from a formal complaint.An attorney will help you assess your options and can help you make important decisions about how to proceed against your other attorney.

, In general, the formal complaint process against attorneys is handled by each state's bar association. For example, in California, the State Bar is an arm of the California Supreme Court and they have the ability to investigate and prosecute complaints against lawyers.However, while any complaint alleging an ethical violation should be brought to your state bar's attention, if you are claiming that your attorney is doing something criminal, you need to contact the district attorney's office.For example, if you believe your attorney is engaged in the unauthorized practice of law, you need to contact the district attorney's office because, if found to be true, the unauthorized practice of law is a crime.

, If you are making a complaint to the state bar, which will handle any complaint alleging unethical behavior from your attorney, you will need to access their complaint form so you can fill it out. In general, each state's formal complaint form will be available for you on the state bar's website so you can download and print it.If you believe your attorney has engaged in any criminal activity, you can contact the district attorney's office directly and inform them of your complaint.This can usually be achieved with a phone call or an in-person discussion, and there is usually no form to fill out.

, Once you have printed the form, you will need to fill it out completely and accurately. In most states, the bar association will want the following information:


Your contact information;
The lawyer's contact information who you are complaining about;
A description of the relationship between you and the lawyer (e.g., client, past client, opposing lawyer);
Whether there is a court case associated with your grievance, and if so, what the case name and file number is;
An explanation of your grievance, which includes a description of what happened;
Attachments of any relevant documents, which might include written fee arrangements and any other correspondence between you and your attorney., After preparing your complaint, you will have to file it with your state bar association within a certain time period. These time limitations will vary by state, but in general it is a period of years. For example, in Florida, you have six years from the time the matter giving rise to the complaint is discovered., Before you file your complaint make sure you are sending it to the correct entity. Not only do you have to worry about whether to make a complaint to the bar association or to the district attorney, you also need to make sure you make the complaint to the correct office.


For example, in California, you need to send your complaints to the state bar's Office of the Chief Trial Counsel/Intake.In New York, the address you send your complaint will vary depending on where you live., Once you know where to send your completed formal complaint, you will do so. In general, there is no filing fee for making a complaint against an attorney., After you send in your formal complaint, you should hear back in a matter of weeks.The initial response you receive will be based on a review of the information you submitted. In general, the response will let you know whether the state bar is:


Opening an investigation;
Asking you for more information; or
Notifying you that there will be no action taken., If the bar opens an investigation into your complaint, you may have to take part in an official hearing. In some instances, you may even be required to appear as a witness.If you are required to do this, show up to the hearing on time, dress professionally, and answer the questions asked of you completely and honestly.

, Once the disciplinary process is complete, you will be notified of its' outcome."

This will drive the choices you make throughout the document. Before you start, think about the following questions, and if you don't know the answers, try to find out:Who will read this paper? Government officials? Business executives? Journalists? Some combination of these?
How much does the audience already know about this issue? Do they know anything at all? What does the audience need to know?
What authority does the audience have over the issue? What changes are he/she/they capable of making?;
, Before you get started writing your briefing paper, you should map out, either mentally or in an outline, the key points you want to make.


Because a briefing paper is typically only a page or two long, it needs to be condensed. Policy makers are very busy, and yours is not the only issue on their plates. There's no room for unnecessary information or long-winded explanations. Decide on your key points in advance to craft a concise briefing paper., While the formatting of a briefing paper isn't overly complex, you can save yourself some time by downloading one of the many free online templates for creating briefing papers in MS Word.A template can help you organize your thoughts and more quickly craft a briefing paper.

, If you aren't using a template, you 'll need to start setting up your paper by creating name, date, and subject lines.The name corresponds to the person to whom the briefing paper is addressed.
The date corresponds to the date on which the paper was submitted.
The subject line should describe in a few words the main topic of the briefing paper, such as ""The Prevalence of Bullying in the North County School District."" This lets the reader know, without even skimming the document, the issue that will be addressed.

, Some briefing papers include a summary section at the start of the paper, summarizing the entire paper in a few bullet points. Decide whether you'd like to do this, and if so, set aside space for this section.For a very busy reader, the summary offers the key points in advance, thus allowing skimming over of the rest of the document.
A well-crafted briefing paper is often concise enough that this section is unnecessary. However, for issues that require immediate action, this can be a way to highlight the urgency of the paper by clearly indicating the deadline within the summary.
The summary should be no more than three to four bullet points.

, The next part of the paper must describe the issue or problem in some detail. Start with a brief opening, usually labeled ""issue"" or ""purpose"" that describes in a sentence or two the main issue the paper focuses on and/or why you are submitting this paper.For example, you might write something like: ""Violent incidents related to bullying are on the rise in schools within the North County School District. Current disciplinary policies may not be adequate for addressing this issue.""

, The next section, labeled ""considerations"" or ""background"" should provide some detailed information about the state of the problem or issue, focusing on the recent development and/or current state of the situation.This section should include the information necessary for the reader to make a decision about this issue. Information not necessary for this purpose, however interesting it may be, should be excluded.
If you haven't already, do some research before writing this section. You want the information in section to be as accurate, specific, and up to date as possible.When necessary, translate the information for your audience to make this section clear and simple. Avoid jargon, technical language, or information that isn't of central concern to the audience.Use statistics and data as appropriate, but explain things in terms that your audience will be able to quickly and easily understand.

, Your views on this situation and/or what should be done about it should not appear in this section. Keep it strictly factual.


You may, however, choose to discuss the pros and cons of various proposed or current actions, highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of each., Your briefing paper should wrap up with sections labeled ""conclusion"" and/or ""recommendations"" or ""next steps."" This closing should make it clear why this issue should be considered important by your reader.Try to link the issue directly to the reader's self-interest to make your paper more persuasive.
For example, you might say something like: ""Bullying related incidents are leading parents to consider private school options. They are linked to lower test scores and graduation rates, making our schools appear less effective in the eyes of the community. They reduce our district's opportunities to supplement funding with federal and private grants.""

, Many briefing papers will provide a proposed solution to the issue that has been described, linking the issue to a policy change aimed at improving the situation.


Some briefing papers will outline the proposed solution(s) in a section labeled ""recommendations,"" but some writers prefer ""next steps,"" believing this has a softer feel that is less presumptuous or aggressive.Remember that the reader will be the one who makes the final decision on this issue, not you.
This section need not be ""balanced"" as the background/considerations section was. This can be a place for you to express your view as to what should be done.
It should be noted, however, that you do not have to endorse a particular solution. You can also just lay out some options with their pros and cons, and simply urge the reader to consider these choices and take action of some kind to address the issue. You don't necessarily specify which action would be most appropriate.

, Your proposals in this final section should flow logically from the information presented in previous sections. Use the facts you have laid out to show why the solution you are proposing is a good one.Make sure any solution you propose is clear and directly related to the issue as you have outlined it.For example imagine you have highlighted the lack of bullying prevention programs in your previous section. Here, it will make sense to suggest such a program, and perhaps point to their effectiveness at other schools. If prevention programs haven't already come up, a solution like this may feel like it came out of nowhere.

, A briefing paper should only be about two pages. If, after you are done, the paper is longer than this, your first pass through for editing purposes should look for places to cut it down.Look for information that is off topic or less important and remove that material, especially if it doesn't relate to the solution(s) you offer.
By the same token, make sure there aren't key pieces of information missing that are necessary to make your argument clear and convincing. You may need to swap out one piece of information for another.
Try to put yourself in the shoes of a politician or bureaucrat as you edit. Think about how many pieces of information these individuals receive every day. Don't contribute to the problem. Be part of the solution by providing the information necessary to make a decision--no more, no less.

, As you edit, keep an eye out for technical language or jargon that could make your paper less accessible. Even if you sought to avoid this in writing the paper, it's possible that some challenging language made its way into the document.


Especially if you are an expert on a topic you are writing about, it's easy to forget, at least momentarily, that language that is everyday for you may be difficult for others to understand.Keep in mind that it is likewise not always immediately obvious why something is important to people who aren't already familiar with a topic. Policy makers usually can't be experts on every topic they have to make decisions about.

, Ensure that the key facts you have included flow logically from the issue, as you have summarized it. Be doubly certain that any solutions you propose address those key considerations as well., After dealing with the length and flow of the paper, give it one more careful look to ensure that it is free of all errors.A paper with spelling, style, or grammatical errors may be taken less seriously by your reader. You may be doing more harm than good by submitting such a paper, as it may discredit your perspective.

Keep copies of all correspondence for your records.",How to Write a Complaint Letter About a Job Interview," Many countries and municipalities regulate the kinds of questions that can legally be asked of job applicants. Your age, race, religion, ethnicity, health status, family status, sexual identity, and arrest record might all be protected categories that cannot be used against you in a job interview.However, as many as 20% of interviewers have asked an illegal question of a job applicant.Be sure that you are aware of your municipality's regulations, ideally in advance of a job interview. Illegal questions might include:


Do you have any children? Do you plan to have any soon?
You have an interesting last name--where is it from?
Do you have any illnesses you want to tell me about?
Have you ever been arrested? (Your conviction record can be asked about but your arrest record cannot.);
, Sexual harassment is when someone uses physical, verbal, or or psychological means to intimidate, threaten, or offend another person. Sexual harassment can be caused by or directed at any gender.In an interview context, common kinds of sexual harassment include:


Implying that you can only get a job by providing sexual favors.
Asking you on a date during the interview.
Inappropriate touching.

, Many states and countries provide agencies whose job is to protect employees and job applicants from discrimination and harassment.You might be able to resolve the matter using their templates and paperwork.Many of these offices also provide free hotlines to answer important questions about whether or not you have experienced discrimination and whether you should pursue legal action.They might be able to help you sort out what is illegal activity in a job interview (such as refusing to give you a second interview because you have children) or whether your interviewer was merely rude and unprofessional (such as if your interviewer was late and rolled his eyes at you).
In some countries, there are questionnaires that job interviewees can give to a potentially discriminatory interviewer.These questionnaires might not give you redress, though they might help alert a company to internal discrimination.

, Some companies have an internal grievance procedure for job interview complaints.This might save you the trouble of composing a letter yourself, or it might provide guidance about what you should include in the complaint letter.


See if the company has a copy of the Employee Handbook posted on its website. The grievance procedure would likely be laid out in the handbook. The Human Resources section of the company website might also have this information posted.

, If you feel like a job interview was discriminatory or unprofessional, write down your memories as soon as you can. Write it all down while it is still fresh in your mind, before the details begin to fade. Even if you are not sure whether you will file a complaint, having written documentation will keep your options open. Details to write down include:


Date of the interview(s).
A timeline of events.
Names of the person(s) you wish to complain about.
Names of potential witnesses.
Specific examples of the discriminatory or unprofessional behavior.

, Would you like to be interviewed again, by a different search committee member? Would you like an apology? Would you like monetary compensation? Would you like the offensive interviewer to be sanctioned by his or her supervisor? Do you want to involve the courts? Ask yourself what you hope to accomplish by complaining about the incident. This might help you determine whether a letter of complaint is sufficient or whether you require legal representation in order to achieve what you require.


For example, legal grievances often need to be filed within 6 months of the incident. Rather than getting bogged down in letter-writing, you might want to go straight to a lawyer.If, however, you simply want the company to be aware of a problem with their interview practices, a letter of complaint might be sufficient.

, Retaliation against employees and job applicants who complain of discriminatory practices is illegal.However, retaliatory incidents have been known to happen even if they are prohibited by law. Steps you can take to protect yourself from retaliation include:


Document every encounter you have with the company. Include specific dates, times, and persons involved.
Make copies of all textual communication. Letters, emails, and text messages should all be backed up in hard copies and digitally.
Consult an employment attorney. An employment attorney may be able to help you navigate difficult situations without compromising your current job. This might be especially important if you wish to complain about a job interview within your current place of employment, such as an interview for a promotion. Because you are more vulnerable in this position, you might need extra legal assistance to protect your job.

, Human Resources Departments are present at most large companies, and it is their job to make sure that hiring practices are in line with federal and state law. If something illegal has taken place, they are required to take action.If something illegal has not taken place, they might still wish to be made aware of it to make sure the company does not get itself into hot water.


If the company is too small to have a separate HR Department, or if you are making a complaint against the HR Department, find the name of the interviewer's direct supervisor instead.

, Your complaint will be taken more seriously if it is composed according to the business letter format. There are numerous guidelines online and in style manuals that will allow you to format the letter correctly.However, the most important aspects of the business letter format are the following:


Type the letter using a standard, 12-point, black font. Do not handwrite your letter if at all possible. Instead use a typewriter or computer. Use a standard, legible font in the color black. You want your letter to appear as professional as possible.
Have 1-inch margins.
Put today's date at the top of the letter.
Type your name and address at the upper left of the paper.
Type the name and address of the letter's recipient immediately below your address. Make sure you skip a line in between your contact information and the recipient's contact information.
Use last names and proper titles. Do not refer to anybody using only their first names. Instead, use their full names along with their titles. For example, do not refer to ""John"" in your letter. Instead, refer to ""Mr. John Doe"" or ""Mr. Doe.""
Make sure all paragraphs are flush left, without indentations.
Skip a line in between each paragraph.
Use professional salutations and closings. ""To Whom It May Concern:"" is an appropriate salutation. ""Sincerely"" is an appropriate closing. Keep your language formal, and do not be too friendly or effusive.
Make sure the letter is signed, unless you wish to remain anonymous.

, It can be effective to begin the letter with a brief thank-you for the opportunity of interviewing in the first place. Even though you are writing with a complaint, remember that the HR representative is likely not the cause of the problem but rather the source of a possible solution. A small conciliatory gesture at the beginning of the letter might help them listen to your complaint more closely.For example, you might write, ""Firstly, I would like to thank your company for the chance to interview for a position. It was an exciting opportunity, and I was grateful for it.""

, The HR representative will likely not be aware of who you are or when you were interviewed. Be sure that you provide all the relevant details in the letter, including:


The position you interviewed for.
The date and time of the interview.
The person(s) who interviewed you.
A timeline of events.
Other parties you met who might corroborate the events of your letter.

, Explain in clear but professional language that the interview was deeply concerning to you. State exactly what happened and do not spare any details. If you wish to file a formal complaint, state this is no uncertain terms. Use as many specific details and direct quotations as you can to emphasize your case and to supply HR with information for their investigation. However, you should avoid blaming language if at all possible. Instead, stick to the facts. For example, you might write things like:


""I wish to call your attention to some concerning events during the interview. My interviewer, Ms. Jane Doe, Assistant Sales Manager, asked me several inappropriate and discriminatory questions. She asked me whether I was a Muslim and whether I would have to take time off for prayers. She then asked me the origins of my last name and told me that my last name 'sounded weird.' These questions took place about 10 minutes into the interview, and I was excused immediately after these questions, at 2:45p.m.""
""I write to file a formal complaint about my treatment during the interview for Retail Manager. The interview was conducted by Mr. John Doe, Head of Personnel. Over the course of the interview, Mr. Doe made several comments about my outfit. He said that my shirt 'was flattering' but that I should wear more makeup in order to 'show off my pretty eyes.' During this time, he repeatedly touched my elbow and shoulder. The interview concluded at 1:30, at which point Mr. Doe asked if he could walk me to my car. In the elevator, he asked me whether I was single and whether I enjoyed martinis, implying that accepting a date with him would guarantee me a job.""

, After stating the facts of the case, cite the particular laws and policies that might have been violated during your interview. For example, were you asked questions that violated federal anti-discrimination law? Or were you asked questions that go against the company's honor code or internal regulations? Be specific about what violations you believe might have occurred.

, Depending on whether you are filing a formal complaint or whether the matter is less formal, you might wish to conclude the letter by indicating how you believe the grievance procedure should continue from here. You might wish to consult an employment attorney or your local equal opportunity office about what solutions are possible (and legal). Consider carefully whether you are pursuing a legal case: if so, you might be limited in what you can write here. For example, you might write:


""I hope to have the chance to re-interview for this position in a non-discriminatory fashion, as outlined in your Company Handbook. I also hope that Mr. Doe is properly sanctioned according to your company policies. I look forward to hearing from you about possible solutions to this matter.""
""I no longer wish to work for this company. However, I wanted to alert you to these serious problems in your interview practices. An apology from Ms. Doe would also be appreciated, as would the guarantee that her conduct in future interviews will be more professional.""

, It is acceptable for you to send the letter as a hard copy through the mail. You may also email the letter as an attachment to Human Resources. In either case, be sure that you have clearly labeled the name and address of the Human Resources director to whom you wish to send the letter.


If you are sending an email, use a clear subject heading such as ""Formal Complaint about Job Interview, October 13, 2015.""

, Be sure to print off extra copies of your letter and keep them in a safe place. If you do not hear from Human Resources about your letter, you will have proof that you contacted them in a timely way. That will help your case if you decide to pursue legal options at a later point."

Write down concrete means to achieve your goals.,
Identify any barriers to your goals.,
Figure out means to defeat these barriers.,
Figure out how to measure career progress.,
Order your career development on a timeline.,
Make note of milestones.,
Keep the plan dynamic.",How to Write a Career Development Plan," To write a career development plan, you'll want to start somewhat vague and narrow things down from there. To start, consider what your primary field of interest is. If you had to define your career by a few terms, how would you define it?For example, say you want to work in an academic field. You could write something like, ""My primary career interest is teaching at a college-level."";
, From here, think about how you define yourself professionally. What skills do you bring to the table in a given place of work? Also think about what drives you and what kind of worker you are..


Try to write down some of your personal skills. Even if you're just starting out, you may have general qualities that can be an asset to an employer. For example, maybe you're hardworking. Maybe you're easy to get along with and tend to be helpful to others.
Discuss your hobbies and education. These can help establish the skills you have already learned that you can bring to the work force.
What drives you as a worker? Are you driven by passion, the aspiration for success, or something else? Write down your main motivational factor before continuing with your plan.

, You need to know where you're starting to flesh out a career development plan. Take a moment to honestly assess where you are at the present moment so you can figure out where to go from here.What is your current position in your field? Have you just finished your education? Are you beginning your educational path towards your goal career? Are you working an entry level position?
Write down exactly where you fall on the career ladder right now. For example, ""Graduate student and teaching assistant in literature.""

, From here, figure out the career you ultimately want. In order to hash out how to get from Point A to Point B, you need a firm idea of what Point B is.


Leave aside any barriers here when you considered your dream career. If there was nothing holding you back, where would you ideally be in 5 years? 10 years? Do not worry about dreaming too big.
Write down your ultimate career goal. For example, you could write something like, ""I would like to be a tenured literature professor at a four year university.""

, SMART is an acronym that can help you create a series of realistic goals that help you achieve success. SMART stands for smart, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time bound.Write down a series of short and long term goals that will help you achieve your dreams. These goals should be relevant to your career at hand and obtainable. They should also be tangible goals so you can measure your progress along the way. Have a sense of when you want to achieve certain goals. For example, ""Be a better teacher"" is somewhat vague. To make it a SMART goal, think about what areas you want to improve in and write goals that cater to those areas.
You could narrow down the following goal more. For example, you could say something like, ""I would like to improve the sense of support in my classroom by fostering more one-on-one time with the students."" This is a measurable, specific goal that's relevant to your career. You can also set a time table for this goal. You can plan to foster more one-on-one time by spring semester.

, Once you've established your SMART goals, you'll need to write some action steps. Think of how you mean to achieve these goals. In addition to focusing on how you'll achieve a goal, think about when and where you'll achieve it and the results you'll see after completing it.


Returning to fostering more one-on-one time in the classroom, think about how this could be done. It's okay to consult other teachers and mentors here for advice. Maybe you could require three conference days where you talk to students one-on-one about their progress each year. You could also try to be more available electronically. Be more vigilant about returning student emails so students feel they can come to you with concerns.
From here, figure when you want to get this done by. These could be your goals for the coming semester. You could strive to improve the level of one-on-one support by the end of spring semester. The results, which should be measurable, could be your student evaluations. Write down something like, ""I hope to see improved ratings in my student evaluations due to the increased classroom support.""

, All goals come with barriers. You want to go into your career path with a realistic sense of what could potentially hold you back. Make a list of potentially barriers that keep you from achieving the short and long term goals in your career path.These can be personal issues. For example, you may be a disorganized person by nature. Therefore, it may be hard to keep up with things like student email and grading. You could write down something like, ""My tendency towards procrastination may hold me back.""
There may also be larger factors at play holding you back from your dreams. For example, academia is a competitive field with a limited number of jobs. You could write something like, ""The job market for academic careers in the humanities is very competitive.""

, Once you've identified barriers, figure out how you want to overcome them. What can you do to make sure you'll reach your career goals despite setbacks?If you're a procrastinator by nature, what steps can you take to combat this? You can say something like, ""I will start using a calendar to track deadlines"" or ""I will limit my time on Facebook and Twitter.""
As for larger barriers, like a competitive job market, what can you do to set yourself apart? In academia, connections and active participation in the community can help set you apart. You could write something like, ""I will maintain positive references with my contacts from graduate school"" and ""I will join a variety of academic organizations relevant to my field.""

, Once you've established a series of goals, figure out ways to evaluate your progress. Your career development plan is a tool to keep you on track. You want to make sure you have concrete ways to assure you're where you want to be at any given time.Know means of evaluating your success. For example, you could strive for improved ratings in student evaluations each semester.
You should also focus on participation in the community, maintaining contacts, and achieving certain awards, honors, and publications. How many publications you have, and any academic honors you receive, can be concrete measures of success. The time you've committed to an organization can also speak to success. For example, you could pledge at least a year to working on the student affairs committee in your graduate program.

, Once you've established a series of goals, order your timeline in a logical trajectory. Start with your short term goals and move up to your longterm goals, until you've achieved your dream. You essentially want to carve out a road map you'll follow to success.You can start at the beginning. Look at the goals you want to achieve by the end of this month or year. Write them down in order at the beginning of your timeline, including how you'll achieve these goals, any possible setback, and how you'll evaluate your success.
Then, move forward. What do you want to achieve in the next two years? The next five years? The next ten years? Keep adding on your goals in order, including setbacks, means to measure them, and means to achieve them.
For the example, your career path may start with activities in graduate school. These could include solid student teaching experience, obtaining awards and honors, and participating in graduate school organizations. As you move forward, you may want to gain an adjunct position, then move on to more permanent work. Eventually, your path should lead you to obtaining the role of a tenured professor of literature.

, You should mark milestones on your career path. These are important skills, certifications, awards, and so on that you receive that will help you on your career. Know what kind of milestones you're striving towards, and when you hope to achieve these milestones.For an academic path, a milestone may be something like obtaining your master's degree, and then your doctorate. You also want to include things like accruing a particular honor or award, like gaining membership into an honors society.

, Your career plan is not set in stone. Keep in mind your goals may change over time. You may need to tweak your career plan due to unforeseen circumstances. You also may change what you want with time, or realize the means to achieving a particular goal are different than you anticipated. Save a copy of your career plan to your computer, and keep in mind you can always alter it in the future."

Instead, you can use one of the following methods for requesting the free annual report:Call 1-877-322-8228. Your credit report will be delivered by U.S. mail.
Visit annualcreditreport.com and request a report.
Request a copy of your report by mailing a written request to Annual Credit Report Request Service, P.O. Box 105281, Atlanta, GA 30348-5281. You can complete and mail in the Federal Trade Commission’s form available at http://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/pdf-0093-annual-report-request-form.pdf.;
, Once you receive your report, you should review it closely to find any errors. Common errors that can negatively impact your credit score include:late or missed payments erroneously reported
loan modifications reported as “foreclosures”
closed cards reported as “closed by grantor”
bad debts more than seven years old still showing on your credit report

, Each creditor’s address should be listed on the credit report. However, if one is not listed, then you should contact the credit reporting agency and ask for the address.

, Try to find whatever documents you can that support your position that the item is erroneous. For example, if the creditor claims that you missed a payment, then find cancelled checks or statements that show payment. If you requested that a credit card be closed, look for any letters from the credit card company to that effect.


You may also have loan modification documents, which show that you were not foreclosed on.

, Open a blank word processing document to begin your letter. You should insert your address first, aligning it on the left-hand margin. After typing the address, move down two lines and enter the date.Two lines underneath the date, you should enter the creditor’s address.

, If you know the name of a contact person, then you can use it. Otherwise, you should simply type “Dear Sir or Madam” and add a colon afterwards., In the first paragraph, make sure to explicitly state why you are writing. For example, you can type “I am writing to dispute the following information in my file. I have highlighted the items I wish to dispute on the attached copy of my credit report.”, In the second paragraph, you can identify what items you want the creditor to investigate. Also request that the creditor remove the item from your report.


You can write, “The item listing ‘60 days past due’ is inaccurate because I paid my account within the 30-day period. I am requesting that you remove the item to correct the information.”, In the third paragraph, tell the creditor what documents you have enclosed that support your position. Be sure to send photocopies as the creditor probably will not return originals. If you do not have any supporting documentation, then you can skip this step.


Sample language: “Enclosed are copies of three cancelled checks that cover the period in question. Please reinvestigate this matter and delete the disputed item as soon as possible.”, End the letter with “Sincerely,” and then space down three lines before typing your name.You can sign the letter in blue or black ink.


At the very bottom of the page, you can type “Enclosure:” and then list any enclosures., You want to keep copies of all communications with the creditor. For this reason, it is better to dispute with a letter than to submit disputes over the phone or online.Even when a creditor insists that you use an online reporting system, you should still follow up with a letter.

, You should send the letter first class, return receipt requested.The receipt will serve as proof that the creditor received the letter.


Be sure to attach any supporting documentation, such as a copy of your credit report., It is not enough to send a dispute letter only to the creditor. You should also send the letter to the three credit reporting agencies. By sending to the credit reporting agencies, you trigger potential liability for the creditor and the credit reporting agency if they do not properly investigate and get back to you.For instructions on how to contact the CRAs, you can see Dispute Credit Report Errors.

, The credit reporting agencies have between 30-45 days to investigate and then report back to you. Even though you sent a letter to the creditor, the CRA will also forward the dispute to the creditor to investigate. If the creditor cannot verify the information or simply fails to respond to the CRA, then you will win and the disputed item will be removed from your credit report.If you do not hear back within 45 days, then you should send a follow up with another letter. Be sure to send a copy of the original letter as well.In the follow-up letter, ask that the creditor or CRA update you on the status of the investigation.
As always, keep copies of your communications and mail all letters first class, return receipt requested.

"
Explain why you are writing.,
Support your argument.,
Direct the reader to additional supporting information.,
Address counter-arguments.,
Use an appropriate tone.,
Write in the active voice.",How to Send a Letter to Someone Important1," You should identify why you are writing in the first paragraph of your letter. If you don’t do this right off, the recipient might be confused and set your letter aside. Remember to get right to the point.


For example, you can write, “I am writing to ask you to vote ‘No’ on the upcoming Senate bill authorizing drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. I believe drilling will cause serious harm to the environment.”;
, Generally, you will probably send a letter to an important person because you want to change their mind about something. Accordingly, you need to give them a reason to see the issue the way you see it. This might mean you need to do some research.


Refer to books or articles by name. Cite facts, statistics, or anecdotes to support your argument.If you are relying on personal observation, then include key details—who, what, where, when, etc.
If you have more than one reason for your position, then develop each in separate paragraphs. This type of organization makes it easier for the reader to follow along.
If you aren’t writing a letter to argue, then simply include the bulk of the information you want to convey in the body of the letter.

, Remember that you are writing a letter, not a master’s thesis. Accordingly, you might want to point the reader in the direction of where they can find more fully-developed arguments.


For example, you can include the address to a website where the recipient can find additional information.
You can also mention the names of books or articles on the subject.

, It is particularly effective to mention common counter-arguments and then rebut them. Only mention the strongest counter-arguments but provide a reason why the reader should not give these arguments too much weight.


For example, you can argue that a counter-argument is based on faulty data. You might write something like, “Supporters of Arctic drilling argue that abundant oil exists beneath the surface. However, newer data has cast doubt on those claims.”
Alternately, you could argue that the counter-argument is mistaken. For example, you could write, “Preserving the Arctic will not result in higher oil costs. In fact, newer wells in Texas and Oklahoma can make up the difference.”

, You convey important information through tone. Tone is hard to define, but you hear tone when people are speaking. Someone can say, “That’s crazy” in a humorous tone or in a fearful one. Tone also exists when we write. You want to maintain a professional tone when addressing someone important.


Avoid using contractions, which are too casual. Write “I am” instead of “I’m.”Don’t use slang or jargon. Write “I was disturbed” instead of “I was freaking out.”
Be polite and respectful. Don’t insult someone or call them names. This can be difficult, especially if you are writing a letter because you want to argue.

, Your sentences should be as forceful as possible. Accordingly, write in the active voice. Active sentences are clearer and usually simpler than passive voice sentences.Compare the following:


Passive voice: “This issue was already decided ten years ago.” In this sentence, someone decided the issue—but you don’t know who.
Active voice: “Congress decided this issue ten years ago.” With an active voice sentence, you know exactly who the subject is.

"
Revise the letter.,
Proofread your letter.,
Ask someone else to read the letter.",How to Send a Letter to Someone Important2," After you type a draft, you should try to condense the letter as much as possible. Strip out any unnecessary words and sentences. Simplify complicated sentences or ideas, and reorganize your paragraphs if necessary.

, Typos, dropped words, and grammatical errors reduce the quality of your letter. Accordingly, you want to go over your letter to make sure you have written it accurately.Read it backwards. Start with the last sentence, then read the one before it. By reading backwards, you won’t anticipate what you intended to say. Instead, you will focus on the words on the page.
Read it out loud. You might hear a mistake that your eyes would gloss over.
Don’t rely only on spellcheck or grammar check. A lot of errors slip by.

, Tone is so key you need another person to read the letter to make sure you aren’t being too rude, angry, or informal. However, you should also have them read it and share their impressions about the content:


Were they convinced by your argument? Did they remain unconvinced?
What other information would help convince them?
Did you come across as professional and credible?

"
Set up your word processing document.,
Include your address.,
Add the date.,
Include the recipient’s information.,
Insert your salutation.,
Tell the recipient how to contact you.,
Insert your closing.,
Note any enclosures.,
Add the names of additional recipients.,
Mail the letter.",How to Send a Letter to Someone Important3," You should type your letter, and you should choose a font style and size that reads comfortably for most people. Generally, Arial or Times New Roman 12 point will work.


If you are creating a letter for email, you should still use a standard font. Avoid colors or anything that is hard to read.
Also set up one-inch margins on all sides.

, You should include your address, but not your name, in the upper-left hand corner. Use block formatting, so don’t indent.All information should line up with the left-hand margin.


If you use letterhead, then you don’t need to include your address., Skip down a line and then include the date you wrote the letter. If you wrote the letter over multiple days, then include only the date you finished the letter.Type out the date using the format of the country where the recipient lives.


In the U.S., the date is listed as follows: “February 12, 2017.”
In other countries, the date will be listed like this: “12 February 2017.”

, Skip down another line and include the address for the recipient. You should include their name and the address.Remember to keep the information lined up with the left-hand margin.

Look at your credit card statements regularly.,
Compare your purchases to your receipts.,

Check your billing rights summary.,
Notify the credit card issuer on time.,
Draft your written notice.,
Mail the notice to the correct address.,
Look for the credit card company's initial response.,
Await a final determination.,
Write your credit card company if you disagree with their decision.,
Understand the credit card company's rights.,
Attempt to resolve the dispute first.,
Know when you can withhold payment.,
Inform the credit card company of your withholding.,
Ensure the credit card company responds correctly.",How to Provide Written Notice of a Billing Error," Each month your credit card company will make a statement available for each account you have. Your statements may come in the mail, they might be emailed to you, or you might have to go online and download them. However they are delivered, make sure you get a copy of every one. These statements contain information about every purchase you made on your credit card, including how much was spent and where it was spent at.


While credit card companies are usually pretty good about avoiding billing errors, they do happen from time to time. If one does occur, you will not catch it unless you check your statement.;
, When you look at your credit card statement, your goal is to match up every purchase, interest charge, and credit to transactions that actually took place. The best way to do this is to compare your credit card statement to your purchase receipts, interest notifications, and credit notifications. Therefore, in addition to keeping all of your past credit card statements, it is also important to keep evidence of the transactions that occur on your credit card.


Start the process by looking at the first transaction on your credit card statement. Any given transaction will include the name of the entity where the purchase was made, the amount associated with the transaction, and whether it was completed or is pending. Match that transaction with your receipts or notifications. Make sure the amount on your receipt matches the amount on your statement.
Follow these steps for each transaction on your statement. If everything matches, no billing error has occurred. However, if there are discrepancies, you will have to look a little bit closer to understand what happened.

, You will likely find it advantageous to understand common billing errors so you can spot them easier. Billing errors can take many forms on your statement. The most common billing errors include:Purchases found on your statement that you did not make
A lack of credit that was supposed to have been put on your account
Purchases found on your statement that you made but that you returned
Purchases that do not identify a recipient (i.e., you cannot tell where the purchase was made)
Statement accounting errors (i.e., the numbers just don't add up)

, Whenever you get a credit card, the company will send you a billing rights summary along with your new card. If you cannot find the billing rights summary, contact your credit card company and request another copy. The billing rights summary will tell you where you have to send your written notice as well as any other additional rules the credit card company may have.In general, the billing rights summary will simply mirror your rights under federal and state law. Credit card companies are required to send you this information in order to notify you of your rights., Federal law requires that, if you think a billing error has occurred, you notify the credit card company within 60 days after you receive the statement that contains the disputed charge.Your notification must be in writing in order to be valid. If you call or contact the credit card company in some way other than writing, your credit card company may require you to send the complaint in writing within a certain period of time after the complaint was voiced (e.g., within 10 days of orally notifying the credit card company)., Within your 60 day timetable, you will need to draft a written notice that meets federal standards as well as the standards of your credit card company. Your written notice should be typed, printed, and mailed. Avoid using email or fax whenever possible. A sample notice form can be found at https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0385-sample-letter-disputing-billing-errors. In general, your written notice will need to contain the following information:Your name as it appears on your credit card.
Your credit card number.
The name of the seller as it appears on your statement.
The date of the purchase.
The amount of the transaction.
A description of the billing error. For example, if you recognize a purchase you made at the grocery store but the amount on the statement is more than what your receipt shows you should have been charged, explain this.
The address where you are sending the notice.
The date of the notice (i.e., the date you send the letter in the mail).

, When you complete your written notice, make sure you send it to the correct address. The correct address will be found in the credit card company's billing rights summary. If you do not send it to the correct address, your written notice may not be valid and your claim may be delayed. If you fail to respond correctly and on time, you may not be able to dispute the billing error at all., Once the credit card company receives your notice, federal law requires them to respond within a certain period of time and in a certain manner. In general, credit card companies are required to respond by taking two actions:First, within 30 days of receiving your notice, the credit card company must correct the error or give you a written acknowledgement that they have received your notice.
Second, within two billing cycles, the credit card company must decide whether an error has occurred and how it will be remedied.

, If your credit card company believes a billing error occurred, the credit card company must correct the error, credit your account in the correct amount, and mail you a correction notice. If your credit card company conducts their investigation and determines no billing error occurred, they must mail you a determination letter explaining why they are denying the existence of an error., If your credit card company denies the billing error and requests payment of the disputed amount, you can write your credit card company and voice your disagreement with the decision. Within your written dispute you can request copies of any relevant documents the credit card company used to make their determination. Your letter can also state that you are refusing to pay the disputed amount.


This letter must be sent within 10 days of receiving the credit card company's determination letter., If you refuse to pay the disputed amount after the credit card company denies your billing error claim, the company can start collection proceedings and might report your account as delinquent. However, the credit card company must state that you are disputing the charge whenever it takes these actions.On the other hand, the credit card company may work with you and not start collection proceedings until your dispute has been investigated further. Your relationship with the company will dictate how this matter is handled.
In a lot of situations, especially where the disputed charge is minimal, it may be best to pay the charge and dispute it with the seller or credit card company later. This will help you avoid collection proceedings and will help you maintain a quality credit score.

, If you have accepted the item or service that has led to a possible billing error, your main tool will be the withholding of payment. For example, you might be able to withhold payment when you order a new dishwasher but it is delivered with dents and scratches. When you try to return the item the seller will not accept your return. In another example, you may be able to withhold payment if you bought something online but you do not receive it within a reasonable amount of time. When you call the company to ask for a refund, nobody answers or returns your calls.


However, before you can withhold payment, you must first make a good faith effort to resolve the dispute with the seller (not the credit card company). Try calling the seller and sending a letter voicing your displeasure. If, after making these efforts, you still do not get a satisfactory resolution, you may be able to withhold payment in accordance with federal law.

, You can only withhold payment if you have used your credit card in a consumer transaction. Therefore, the law only applies when you buy goods or services for personal purposes. If you use the card for business purposes, you will not be able to utilize this law. Furthermore, you can only withhold payment if you truly believe you have a valid claim or defense to payment. Also, when you withhold payment, you can only withhold the amount that is in dispute. The rest of your payments must be made in full and on time. Finally, you can only withhold payments that have not already been paid. As soon as you pay the credit card bill, you will lose your right to withhold payment.

, Write your credit card company promptly if you want to withhold payment. Inform them that you desire to withhold a particular payment in accordance with federal law. It is important to make this request in writing so you have evidence of the correspondence. In addition to sending this notice to the credit card company, you should also send a copy to the seller you are in a dispute with. Your letter should contain the following information:


Your name.
Your credit card number.
The name of the seller.
The date of your purchase.
The amount that you paid.
A brief explanation of why you are withholding payment.
The address where you are mailing the letter.
The date of the mailing.

, Your credit card company will respond by either withholding payment until the dispute between you and the seller is resolved, or the credit card company will tell you that you do not have the right to withhold payment. If you withhold payment properly, the credit card company cannot report payment as delinquent until the dispute is settled.


If the credit card company tells you that you are not allowed to withhold payment, ask for an explanation as to why. If they can provide a quality explanation, you may have to pay the bill. However, if you believe that you are in the right, you can continue to withhold payment despite the credit card company's questions. The credit card company will start an investigation and, after the investigation, can request payment and/or start collection proceedings.

Identify your reason for describing the smell.,
Observe the smell.,
Notice any words, images, feelings, or memories that the smell brings to mind.,
Notice descriptions of smells when you see or hear them.,
Use adjectives.,
Use nouns.,
Use verbs.,
Borrow words associated with other senses.,
Consider what feelings and emotions a smell evokes, especially if you are using it as a literary device.,
Use metaphor.",How to Describe a Smell," Why do you want to communicate it? Your description may be different depending on whether you are writing a technical manual or writing a poem. If you're describing the smell aloud, your tone of voice and body language may lend an additional level of meaning.

Do you want to capture the nature of the smell or the overall quality?
Do you want your reader or listener to recognize an unfamiliar smell based on your description?
Do you want to evoke a certain meaning or feeling in your reader?;
, If it is possible and safe to do so, smell what you wish to describe. Pay full attention to it.

Remove distractions. Don't smoke or wear fragrances or drink strongly scented beverages.
Take breaks. The sense of smell acclimates or becomes accustomed to a smell. Remove the smell or remove yourself from the smell for a while if you stop being able to smell it or smell it distinctly.


, If you have any sort of gut reaction, pay attention to it. Make notes if you can, even if they're disjointed., This could be advertising (""lemony fresh"", ""fresh pine scent""), poems, or technical descriptions. Look especially hard at other sources that are similar to what you're trying to convey., Adjectives can describe the general, overall quality of the smell. Wispy, rancid, airy, musty, stale, fresh, putrid, faint, light, floral, and acrid are all adjectives that could pertain to smell.
Smell origins may take the form of a noun (the smell of leather) or an adjective (a leathery smell). The adjective may describe the effect where the noun describes a specific source.
Use imaginative adjectives. Saying that a vile smell was ""like sucking puss out of a festered wound"" does not actually describe the smell as such, but pulls on so many different thoughts and memories that the mind races to label it odious.

, Often a smell will conjure thoughts of its source. Does your smell remind you of strawberries? Like fresh rain?Be specific. Smoke smells different depending on it source. Can you tell the difference between smoke from a campfire and a wildfire? Between cigarette, cigar, and pipe smoke? Could you recognize, by smell, burning rubber or a vehicle that was burning oil?






Be creative. What does spring smell like?


, Verbs are strong, direct, active words.

Use verbs for the smells themselves. Smells can waft, distract, hint, permeate, suggest, confuse, conjure images, command attention, or intrude upon the consciousness.
Use verbs to describe the source of the smell. Here are some actions that you might associate with smells: baking, frying, digging, sweating, burning, rotting.

Visualize what the smell does. Does it creep into your nose? Wrap around you? Follow you? Bombard your nostrils?


, Smell doesn't have a lot of vocabulary of its own, but many other senses do, and they can suggest the quality or nature of a smell.
Sight. Can a smell be bright or dark? Can a smell be pink or green? Can it be clear or hazy? Can it be fast? Slow? Sluggish? Smooth?
Sound. Can a smell be dissonant? Harmonious? Loud or quiet?
Touch. Can a smell be sharp or dull? Even or jagged? Smooth or rough? Heavy or light? Cool or hot? How would you physically react to the smell? Would you relax or stiffen, pucker, or make a face?






Taste. Smell is closely associated with taste, so tastes are a good choice if they fit. Is a smell sweet or sour, salty or bitter? Is it chocolaty, fruity, or yeasty?

, Smell can conjure associations with particular events or general thoughts or emotions.

Is the smell startling or jarring? Soothing or comforting? Earthy or natural? Chemical or antiseptic?
Smell is often strongly associated with memories, but this is only useful if you're describing the smell to yourself (such as in a journal) since you can't know what somebody smelled in their memories.


, If you're writing poetry or trying to evoke an emotion, metaphor might be a good device. A smell can't really grab someone by the nose or stab someone, but this might be a powerful description."

, It is usually much easier than you think to get the total of their check. Pay it. Include a good tip. Request to remain anonymous. You will find the cashier is happy to help you.

Determine what you’re measuring.,
Figure out your survey size.,
Set your area.,
Choose your method.",How to Execute a Successful Survey1," The more specific, the better. Think about your main objective and how you can narrow your survey to achieve that objective. For example -- are you trying to find out which political party’s message has more resonance? You could ask respondents which party they will vote for and why. It could be that it’s not even about ideology, but about the candidates themselves, and your survey takers will let you know that. Typical surveys include those that measure:Political choices or leanings
Health data
Income and labor information
Child development statistics
Eating and food habits
Exercise and wellness patterns;
, The sampling size is important. Too large and it could be extremely time consuming and expensive to analyze, too small, and you may not achieve an accurate portrayal of the information you are seeking. For each survey, your sample size might be different. You need to consider the following factors when determining how many people you’re going to survey:How much money do I have to complete the survey?
What kinds of analysis am I going to do with this data, and will it include subgroups?
What kind of margin of error am I willing to tolerate?
What is the population size for the group I am surveying?

, Local or national, the type of information you desire will dictate the areas you need to cover. Do you want to focus on a particular neighborhood or town, or are you looking for national trends? Once you have set your area, you should consider how your methods can help narrow the survey to only the people in the zone you have chosen.

, Most surveys are carried out over the phone, on the computer, or in person. Figure out which method or methods are the most effective for the population you have chosen to survey. If you’re going to do a phone survey, how will you get people’s numbers? For a computer survey, where will their email addresses come from? Consider the positives and negatives to each method."
"
Determine the format of the survey.,
Choose an appropriate length.,
Write your questions.,
Pay attention to your wording.,
Try out the survey.",How to Execute a Successful Survey2," For some kinds of surveys, you might want short true or false questions, while for others you might want a long written questionnaire with space for extensive written answers. Are you looking for a large volume of quantitative answers, or a smaller number with qualitative answers? This will tell you how to format your survey. Some possible formats include:True or false answers
Spectrum answers -- strongly agree to strongly disagree
Multiple choice answers
Open-ended questions with either short or long answers

, The shorter the survey, the more likely people are to complete it. Try for a survey that can be completed in less than five minutes. Make sure all of the questions are short and to the point. If you are providing multiple choice answers, do not list more than ten options -- survey takers are likely to get overwhelmed and stop reading., Pay attention to the order in which you ask the questions -- try and put them in some kind of order so your survey taker can easily follow along. Start with broad questions and move to more specific questions. Be very careful and clear in the wording of your questions. Avoid leading words like might, should, or could.


An example of a bad survey question would be the very open-ended: “How could we make the bridge situation better?”
A better question getting at the same data might read: “What steps could the mayor and city council take to help the neighborhood deal with the increased traffic from bridge repairs?” and provide 6-8 choices that survey respondents could rank., Avoid questions that are vague or use jargon that your respondents might know. Asking questions like “What do you think about President Obama?” end up being pretty useless because respondents could go in so many different directions that the answers would not be measurable. In terms of jargon, if your survey is about computer usage, for example, you can’t assume that your survey takers know about IP addresses, so you would need to explain that piece of jargon. You cannot assume knowledge on the part of your respondents., Give your survey to friends or family and get their feedback. Ask them if they found any of the questions confusing, or if they have any suggestions. Were there any questions they thought you should not include? Feedback is important, because typically you’ve been working on the survey for a while and it’s hard for you to see its possible problems. Fix any problems your friends and family have identified."
"
Find your subjects.,
Define your purpose.,
Give the survey.,
Take stock.",How to Execute a Successful Survey3," Make a list of the people you are going to survey with their phone numbers or email addresses. If you’re doing an on-the-street survey, figure out where you are going to stand, and how many people you are going to ask., Decide exactly what you want to learn from the survey. Is it quantitative or qualitative? (Are you looking for numbers or explanations, or both?) Your objective in giving the survey should guide you to a good explanation to your survey-takers about why it’s important to hear from them. Let people know why they should take the survey and how it will help something: their customer service, medical research, how local tax revenues are allocated, etc. If it’s an academic survey, explain how it will help your research, and what you ultimately hope to do with it -- a book, article, etc.

, For phone and email surveys, how long are you going to try for people’s responses? You need to have a clear deadline. For an in-person survey, how many hours or days are you going to conduct the survey? If you are doing a phone or in-person survey, how are you going to keep track of the results. Make sure you have a good and consistent way of marking responses. Online surveys are often the easiest, because the data is collected and tabulated for you, and for most respondents is the quickest way to complete a survey., At the end of your survey taking, figure out if you can quit when you wanted to, or if you need to keep going. It might turn out that you need a larger sample size because not enough people responded, or the answers were so spread out it was difficult to see what the trends might be. If it seems like your survey is not returning clear results or enough responses, continue to give the survey to more people.

"
"
Tabulate your responses.,
Analyze the results.,
Share the results.",How to Execute a Successful Survey4," Depending on the kind of survey you created, you will be collating it in different ways. For a survey with a spectrum (from strongly disagree to strongly agree), you can assign numerical values to each response (highest numbers are best) and tabulate quantitatively. For a longer survey with written responses, you typically group the answers together by question and then deal with each question at a time., What did you learn from the survey? Was it what you believed you would find, or not? Take the results and use them for whatever role they were intended -- from the kinds of changes people want to see in a town or city to a public health journal to changes in the way customer service is delivered. Surveys are a great way to hear from a lot of different people, so now it’s up to the survey taker to make sure the people’s voices are heard. If it was an academic survey, you can analyze your results, put them in context, and hopefully publish., Put your hard work out there. If it was a customer service survey, tell customers the changes you have made as a result. If it was a medical research survey, tell respondents about how their answers have helped change the course of your research. People like to know that their opinions and thoughts matter, and surveys can help facilitate this. You might even want to share the survey data and conclusions with your survey takers -- possibly through an email or mailing."

Consult with your web developer about the type of cookies used by your site and what they are for, as they will be most familiar with and specific about the site’s functions.
Communicate with or read the cookie policies of other third party services which may collect cookies on your site. This could include any service you use for search engine optimization, conversion optimization, other web analytics, or advertisers.

, Make your cookie policy as brief as possible while still providing a comprehensive explanation. Try to keep your policy down to one page, sticking to the basic facts regarding your use of cookies.


Unlike other documents that may exist on your site strictly for legal purposes, and may consist of several pages of jargon, a cookie policy most importantly informs and assures the public. Because of this, you want to keep the policy as readable and approachable as possible.
Avoid using complicated web developer terms or vague reasoning when describing how you use cookies. Stick to the concrete benefits or processes in layman’s terms when you write your policy.

, Model your cookie policy off of one from another website, or a template or generator designed for this purpose. Just make sure you include accurate information specific to your website.


Note that many websites that provide templates or generators are not provided by lawyers and you should not assume that the generated policy assures your compliance with any laws in your country. Consult with a lawyer regarding your policy and any applicable browser cookie laws.Use a template by simply filling in the specific details of your website and cookie usage in a document that has the rest of the text already generated. Make sure you provide proper attribution to the template’s author if they require you to do so., If you're operating out of the UK, there are laws regarding cookies. In the United States, restrictions are more lax, but you may still have to follow UK policy in the United States under certain conditions.EU law states that you have to ask users permission before using cookies. Essentially, you should provide a popup that says something like, ""This websites wants to use cookies."" Users can select ""no,"" and opt out of having their data tracked.
For the most part, this only applies to EU countries. However, all mobile apps must abide by this law as well. If you're in the United States and your company has a presence in the EU, you must follow this rule.

, Explain in your cookie policy that cookies are small, basic data files of encrypted text. State simply and clearly how basic information is gathered from a user’s computer or mobile device through the following types of cookies.


First Party Cookies: Set and collected by the website itself, and only used by the site when a user is visiting it.
Third Party Cookies: Set and collected by other entities besides the website, such as advertisers or services used by the website for things like web analytics or social media sharing.
Session Cookies: Only stored in a browser’s memory until it is closed down. Used for many essential site functions, such as quickly loading a page.
Persistent Cookies: Set up with a specific expiration date, so they will survive in your browser’s memory for a certain period of time before deletion. Used to keep you logged in, track web analytics, etc.
Secure or HTTP only Cookies: Secure cookies are only transmitted over “https” pages to keep data encrypted and secure. Only cookies prevent any client scripts on the page from accessing the cookie, preventing malicious cross-site-scripting (XSS) attacks., Address the concerns of many internet users about the ability of cookies to track or gain personal information from them. State the facts and then provide a contact email or phone number that concerned individuals can use to reach you for more information.


It’s often useful to explain what cookies are not. You can assure readers that cookies are not viruses, they are plain-text files that cannot be self-executed or self-replicated, so they cannot be harmful on their own.Go into greater detail, if you wish, by explaining that a cookie includes only the name of the server the cookie was sent from, the lifetime of the cookie, and a random number value. The website uses this number to recognize a user when they return to a site or browse from page to page. The cookie alone cannot be used to identify the user., Describe specifically the types of cookies your website uses and why you use them. Be honest about your reasoning why cookies benefit both the user and yourself.


Many of the ways that cookies are used are for essential site functions, such as loading pages properly, adding products to a cart and checking out, and inputting secure information (on a bank’s website, for example). You can inform the public of these things in your policy, but they are considered so essential that they can be exempt from consent under EU cookie law.For example: “Our website uses cookies to help provide personalized ads, analyze our traffic, and provide you with a variety of social media features. This information may be shared with our advertisers and analytics department, where it may be combined with other information you've given to our website. This helps us make the site more personal for you, and allows our team to track website traffic.”, Provide instructions to the best of your ability for users who wish to disable or block cookies that your website requests from them. Be sure to explain that doing so may prevent regular use or access to certain features on the site.


Explain that any user can go to the “Settings” in his or her browser to find control features to accept or reject some or all cookies requested from websites. This is also where a user can delete cookies already stored in the browser’s memory. In your policy, link to a page with further instructions specific to each type of browser.You can also encourage cautious users to update their internet browser, install anti-spyware software, and access websites from a secure internet network in order to be more protected from security threats and those that attempt to use cookies for malicious intent., Keep the link to your cookie policy page in a place where it can be easily found on your website. Make sure a user can view the policy from any page of the site.


Placing a link to the policy in the footer of your website is a common way to make sure it can be found and viewed easily. You can also consider placing a short statement about cookies in a banner that appears at the top of your page for new visitors, especially if you want or need to ask for user consent to use them.
Don’t bury your cookie policy by making it part of your privacy policy, terms and conditions, or other longer, fine-print documents. Make the policy easy to find and read, which will make users more trusting of your site and will allow you to comply with EU cookie law, if applicable., Make user consent of cookie usage necessary before they browse the site, if you wish or if required by law. Provide a clear explanation of the way you use cookies, as well as a way for the user to consent and opt in to allowing that usage.


The ePrivacy Directive, or “cookie law” used by the UK and countries in the EU is a law that requires user consent of cookies. It also requires a clear explanation of how and why your website uses cookies.
Note that consent can be implied rather than an explicit “opt-in” on your website, but to make sure you comply, it's advised to require users to take some positive action in order to consent, such as pressing a button, ticking a box, or clicking a link., Make consent for cookie usage be an easy and obvious action step when new users visit your website. Include a short amount of text about why you use cookies, a link to a longer cookie policy, and something for users to click to acknowledge their consent.


Try a banner that appears at the top of the website for new users, which is the most common way to allow users to be informed and give consent for cookie usage. Ironically, you will want to use persistent cookies on your website to ensure that once a user has given consent, the banner won’t continue to show up every time they view the site.
Some website's design templates, like WordPress, may offer a widget or provided code to add to your website to make cookie consent and compliance with the law easier."

If a web search doesn't turn up the answer, then visit the website for the relevant department of the local, state, or national government.If you live in the United States, visit https://www.usa.gov/ to access a comprehensive list of contact information for national, state, and local administrators.If you don't have a specific official in mind, then look for the address of the relevant department. Perhaps you need to contact your local DMV office, or the Department of Homeland Security.

, Include the official's title and full name (e.g. President Barack Obama) along with his or her official mailing address. Write the words clearly and legibly in the center of an envelope, and then seal the letter inside the envelope. Stick a stamp in the top-right corner of the envelope. If you are hoping for a response from this government official, make sure to write your full name and return address in the top-left corner of the envelope!"
"
Show due respect.,
Use the proper title.,
Read sample letters, or send a form letter.Do your research to find out how other people have addressed letters to this particular government official.",How to Address a Letter to a Government Official3," Open your letter with a formal salutation, and end it with an appropriate closing statement. Depending on the level of government, this official may employ a team of secretaries to read through his or her mailbox for important letters. A polite, thoughtful, and well-written letter will almost always be more likely to make it through this filtration system., If there is only ever one person in a given post at a time (e,g, the President, the Mayor, or the Speaker of the House,) then you can address the person by his or her title alone: Mr. President or Ms. Mayor. If multiple people hold a given office at one time (e.g. Senator, Justice, Representative,) then you need to use the last name to clarify whom, exactly, you're addressing.It never hurts to include the official's name, even if he or she is the only person holding the position. A personally-addressed letter lends a certain degree of humanity to your message.

, Some activism groups and petition websites will actually provide specific information about contacting the officials relevant to a certain cause. You may also be able to simply email the official.If you are very unsure about how to address and relate to the official in question, remember that you don't need to use your own words. Some elected officials receive hundreds of letter each day, and they certainly don't have time to read them all closely.

Petitions and form letters are usually well-written and actionable. Make sure, however, that the demanded actions fall within the scope of this official's duties.

, Depending on rank, government officials may receive dozens to hundreds of letters each day. He or she may even employ professional letter-sorters to determine which select few messages actually wind up in the hands of the official. Make your letter polite, concise, and topical. In the first sentence or subject line, reference an issue that is at the top of the official's agenda.


Make sure that your letter is insightful and well-written. The letters that wind up at the top of the stack will be readable, relevant, and easy for the official to understand.
Identify your credentials. Briefly explain your qualifications, and tell the official why he or she should take note of your opinion. Perhaps you have a Ph.D, or you live in the town that's been in the news lately, or you have personally met the official at some point in the past.

, Is it necessary, or are you just venting? Send a request that is polite, concise, and realistic. Do not swear or drop insults. Respect begets respect.


Do not threaten a government official. The letter can be traced back to you. Beyond any risk, your threats will not necessarily inspire productive action.

Consider what you want from your ""real life"" Pinterest board.,
Decide where the Pinterest board will hang or be displayed in your home.,
Purchase or recycle supplies.",How to Create a Real Life Pinterest Board1," It's likely that you have quite a few Pinterest boards online and to replicate them all is probably asking too much of your wall or living space. Select the one that you feel is the most inspiring or creative and that you'd really enjoy seeing ""live"" in your own home. When considering which board to choose, or which series of pinned pictures to display, keep in mind your current home décor/theme and any special interests you have, such as pets, crafts or cooking.


Develop specific idea categories such as food (recipes), fashion, organization, work life, kids, fitness, holiday and more. If you already have Pinterest boards, these might be all you need to inspire the category creation.
Consider how you’d like each category to flow into one another. For example, you could post the recipe board next to fitness so your low calorie recipes could be inspiring to the next workout you plan to try.
Obviously, you're not limited to Pinterest. Feel free to pin on photos from magazines, anywhere off the Internet, old books, newspapers, advertising materials, and any other resources. What you might find though, is that this is a reciprocal exercise, in that you discover things to add to Pinterest while making your offline real Pinterest board! That's fine––enjoy the journey.;
, This will determine both the size of the board chosen and the room or space where you'll keep it. For example, if you're creating a Pinterest board featuring cupcakes, you might like this to be displayed in the kitchen where it inspires your baking. Or, you might have a series of animals in amusing poses and think that it'd make a great conversation piece in the lounge room when you're entertaining guests. If the board is of the organizational variety, you'll need to place it somewhere that the family can see it daily.


Assess the available wall space or leaning options open to you. This will help you to decide the optimal board size and the suitability of placement.
Plate or book holders can be used effectively to lean the board against, on a buffet, countertop, side table, etc. This might open up more options to use your space than only hanging it.
In some cases, you might think that creating a series of boards of smaller size would prove better than a single board of a large size. Think laterally!
There is no limit to the boards other than space––if you want one in the sewing room, one in the kitchen and one in the bedroom, go for it! The more you have, the more themes you can indulge in.

, Old or new cork boards, pin boards, clipboards (make use of the clip), heavy cardboard backing, picture frames, etc. are all likely to make suitable real life boards. Whatever the board backing, just be sure it is strong and will be compatible with having items pinned or stuck to it and that it can be safely hung or displayed as needed.

Complain right away.,
Find someone who can help.,
State your problem and your desired outcome.,
Smile.,
Don't get emotional.,
Thank the individual for his or her time and attention.",How to Complain and Get Results1," If you feel like you've gotten ripped off or treated poorly, it's worth speaking up to get the situation resolved. Get ready to be a little pushy and stand your ground. If you don't make yourself heard, chances are the company to which you're complaining will simply ignore you., Do it while the incident is still clear in your mind, and the people responsible are still on shift. If you wait and do it later, it will be harder to make your case. Try to complain the same day the incident occurred. If that's not possible, do it the same week or month - the sooner, the better., Don't be that person screaming at a fight attendant about how angry you are that you're going to miss your connecting flight - she can't do anything about it, and all you're doing is making the situation worse. Instead of flying off the handle at the first person who crosses your path, take the time you need to think the situation through and figure out who will actually be able to do something about your issue, or at least connect you with the person who can.


Many stores have an information or help desk staffed with people who can assist you with problems. Before you turn to a store clerk, find out if there's a more appropriate person to talk to.
You can start with the person who is manning the register or waiting your table, but such people will generally only be able to help you with minor issues. If your problem with the place goes beyond finding a fly in your soup or wanting to return a defective kitchen appliance, you'll likely need to ask for the manager.
If you're calling a customer service line, make it clear that you have a complaint to issue, and ask to speak to the appropriate person.

, When you find the right person to talk to, be clear about what happened and how you want the situation to be resolved. If you need your money back, be specific about the amount. If it's a service issue and you want some kind of explanation, state that. It will be easier for the person to correct the situation if you're up front about what you want.Address the employee by name. Introduce yourself. A formal introduction is a great way to make them stop and take notice. ""Hello Jane, I'm Mrs. Smith. How are you? Listen, Jane, I realize this isn't your fault, but....""
Speak to them as if they were a confidant and you are revealing a secret. Start off by pointing out you are not blaming him or her, personally, for the problem or error, but you'd greatly appreciate their help in resolving it.

, This cannot be overstated; you can NEVER smile too much. People will respond more favorably to someone who is smiling. You are guaranteed to get a kinder, gentler response when you use this strategy.

, Don't go on and on about how angry this incident has made you. Don't raise your voice or make angry gestures. The key to actually getting what you want out of the situation is to get the person who can help you on your side. If you're acting threatening, the person will be far less likely to want to give you what you want.Control your body language and facial expression so that you appear calm and alert. Don't resort to eye rolling, crossed arms, and other gestures that imply you might lose your temper at any moment.
Wait patiently. In order to get your refund, apology, and so on, you might have to wait until the customer service rep gets approval from someone higher up. Creating extra tension by acting impatient is a hostile way to behave. Wait calmly and patiently while the situation is resolved.

, If you got what you want, a genuine thanks is in order. If you didn't receive your desired outcome, you'll have to decide whether it's worth it to you to take it to the next level.


Make sure to take down the names of company representatives you've already complained to, if for no other reason than it makes them realize you mean business and they might be held accountable.

All you need to do is find a nice one and hang it from the clip end (or lean it against something) and start slipping images in under the clip. Or, slip a piece of paper the same size as the board under the clip and tape or tack images to the paper. If the clipboard is a bit shabby, use one of the following methods to improve its overall look (paint, fabric cover or paper cover). Many brightly colored clipboards can be bought from stationery stores or search through the stationery section of a favorite thrift store near student areas.

, A painted board can match room décor or complement it, depending on the colors chosen. It's a fairly easy background, provided you select paints that are right for the type of board. In general, acrylic paints are probably a good bet but check with the retailer if you're in doubt. A painted board is probably best for sticking images to with poster tack or tape but if you have used a soft surface, such as cork, you could also pin the images to it.


Prepare the workspace. Cover with newspaper or other material to prevent stains. Arrange the paint and paintbrushes so that they're ready to use.
Paint each board. Either paint one color or paint the first layer, allow to dry, then paint stripes, dots, squiggly lines, a border, flowers, or whatever else takes your fancy. Let the paint dry between each layer. Borders can be a particularly effective addition that makes the end result look more professional.
Allow to dry completely before using.
If needed, attach hanging mounts after drying. Done!

, Paper boards are very easy to make and can use up that sweet piece of gift wrap you loved so much you just couldn't bring yourself to throw away! As with the painted board, the method for pinning items to it depends on the material used for the board but this method is probably best for pins or poster tack. Do note that if you plan on taping items to this board, that the tape may rip the paper backing if the images are removed. It depends how permanent you'd like the board to be (another alternative is to simply keep sticking images over the top but eventually this will look sloppy).


Find a suitable piece of paper. Measure to check that it will fit the entire board with at least an inch (2.5cm) overlap all around to allow to gluing to the back.
Bend the overlap edge around the board's four sides. At each corner, cut out a triangle piece to allow for easy turning over of the paper edges.
Use craft or hot glue to glue the edges to the back of the board. Before gluing, check that the paper sits evenly across the front of the board, with no creases, bubbles or ripples.
Allow the glue to dry.
Add embellishments, such as a ribbon or lace border, small fabric flowers in the corners, a bow in the top or bottom center, etc.
Add hanging mounts if required. Done!

, This board requires a little more effort but it's by far the easiest to use and probably will last the longest. As well as a picture frame as the board, you'll need good quality untextured fabric to cover the board with, magnetic sheeting that has adhesive backing and scissors. And any sort of magnets will work to keep the chosen images in place, but it's a good idea to choose funky ones that match the fabric style.


Measure the fabric to fit the inside of the picture frame. Cut to size and lay down on a flat surface, wrong side facing out.
Measure the magnetic sheet to the same size as the picture frame. Cut to size.
Peel the backing off the magnetic sheet. Lay the sticky side over the wrong side of the fabric, taking care to meet the edges of the fabric precisely. If you don't have an adhesive-backed magnetic sheet, simply glue into place.
Turn it over and smooth out any bubbles using a ruler. Trim off any fabric overlap to neaten.
Remove the glass from the frame if it has any.
Insert the fabric covered magnetic board into the frame. Replace the frame's backing board. Done!

Hang or display the board in the place you've chosen.,
Theme your Pinterest images.,
Finished.

",How to Create a Real Life Pinterest Board3," Depending on the type of board you've made, use poster tack, pins, magnets or tape to place images onto the board.

, As touched on above, it's a good idea to have a theme for your Pinterest-inspired real life board. You may want to make a plan digitally first by searching Pinterest or using your own Pinterest board, followed by printing off the final choices. Some things to bear in mind when creating your real life Pinterest board include:


Consider how often you'll change/rotate the images. This may impact what is placed where and what theme you'll have––you could go with ""theme of the month"" if space is tight but you'd like to vary the board's contents often.
Consider printing quality––these are for display, so the best printing possible should be aimed for.
Consider grouping images based on colors. This is often done on Pinterest and it may be ideal for complementing your décor or inspiring a cooking or crafting project.

Write down the details.,
Write a formal complaint letter.,
Email the CEO.,
Post it on Facebook or Twitter.,
Work with a consumer advocate.",How to Complain and Get Results2," If you've decided it's time to involve the higher-ups at the company, start by writing down all the details of the incident in question. Write down dates, dollar amounts, and any other pertinent information. Write down the names of any employees or customer service reps to whom you've already spoken, and describe the exchanges you've had with them.

, Track down the email or address of the person at the company who handles complaints. Compose a cordial but firm letter stating what happened and what outcome you desire. Be clear that you expect a reply within a certain time period - a week is usually best. Include your contact information and times during which you are available to speak.


Email is usually the quickest way to get in touch via written correspondence, but you could also print out your letter and send it through regular mail.
Keep records of all correspondence on the matter from here on out.
If you're satisfied with the reply you get from the company, write a thank-you note and consider the issue resolved. If you don't get a reply, or if the reply you do get seems dismissive or rote, you'll have to keep escalating.

, Don't be afraid to take your complaint to the top if you aren't getting through to employees and managers. If the company's error was egregious and harmful to you, the CEO is going to want to know about it. Be persistent - email the CEO every week until you get a reply.

, This is an increasingly effective way to get the attention of companies that are otherwise unreachable. Write a post or tweet explaining what happened and asking for help. Be sure to share it with the company's Facebook page or Twitter account. Since your complaint has now moved to a public forum, you'll probably get a response very quickly.


Don't use this method until you've already tried to contact the company privately to no avail.
You'll get better results if you don't publicly slam the company. Your posts and tweets should be calm and straightforward. Resist the urge to rant.

, Contact the Better Business Bureau, online resources like Consumerist.com, or your local TV station's consumer reporter to serve as an advocate. These institutions are set up to keep consumers from getting ripped off by companies.If complaining on your own isn't causing the company to budge, it might be time to get some outside help.

Have friendly conversations with all of your neighbors.,
Explain your problems with the smoke.,
Offer reasonable solutions.,
Consider sending a written letter to the smokers.",How to Complain About Secondhand Smoke in Apartments1," Not only can talking to your neighbors help you figure out where the smoke is coming from, but you also may find out that you're not the only person having trouble with secondhand smoke in your apartment.Begin by asking the person if they smoke. If they say they don't, you might say ""Have you noticed any secondhand smoke coming into your apartment lately? I've been having a problem with that.""
If they do smoke, ask if they smoke in their apartment. If they do, you might say ""I believe your secondhand smoke is drifting into my apartment through the vents. Can we talk about some ways to stop that from happening?""
Focus your efforts on the tenants in apartments that share a wall with yours. It's most likely that you share ventilation systems or have common air conditioning and heating ducts, which means these tenants are most likely the source of the secondhand smoke coming into your apartment.
Branch out to talk to your neighbor's neighbors in the same way. If one of your neighbors is smoking in their apartment, their other neighbors may have noticed the secondhand smoke coming into their apartments as well.
Others may have similar complaints, but be afraid to say anything. Banding together can bring more power to your message.;
, Rather than assume that everyone understands the dangers of secondhand smoke, before you talk with your neighbors you may want to gather some basic information about the health risks associated with secondhand smoke.Search online for brochures and information. You may find materials you can use on the websites of health organizations such as the American Heart Association or the American Lung Association.
Particularly if any of the neighboring tenants have children, they should be aware of and concerned about secondhand smoke coming in to their apartments.
If you have any particular health issues, you might bring those up as well. People might feel more sympathetic to someone with specific health issues than they would someone who just seems like a militant anti-smoker.
Avoid being accusatory or insulting. Keep in mind that most smokers want to quit but feel powerless to do so.
For example, you might say ""I don't mean to step on your toes, but my daughter has asthma and the secondhand smoke is causing her serious problems. Can we work on a compromise so you can stop smoking inside your apartment?""
If you're talking to someone who suddenly gets defensive or antagonistic, don't take the bait and get into an argument – it won't solve the problem and will only leave you and your neighbor locked in a tense situation.
For example, you might say ""I understand your concerns. I'm only trying to protect my health and the health of my family. I would really appreciate it if you would at least meet me halfway on this.""

, Complaining about secondhand smoke in your apartment won't accomplish anything unless you help the smokers come up with an option that respects their rights while ridding your apartment of secondhand smoke.For example, if each apartment has a private balcony or patio, you might suggest that your neighbors smoke there instead of inside their apartment.
If you live in a high-rise building, you might point out designated smoking areas located outside the building or on the floor.
Another option may be to request that any smokers who must smoke inside their apartment do so through an open window, which would limit the amount of secondhand smoke traveling through the ducts into your apartment.

, Your neighbors who smoke may take your complaints more seriously if you send them a written letter. Even if they don't, the written letter provides evidence that you attempted an amicable solution before involving your landlord or other authorities.A written letter also can work if you're shy or don't feel comfortable addressing your concerns to your neighbor.
Keep the tone of your letter friendly and neighborly, and stress that you would like to work out an amicable solution without involving anyone else or causing any problems.
Avoid threatening your neighbor. Instead, provide reasonable solutions to the problem.
Give your neighbors a deadline to respond to your letter, and let them know what you'll do next if they don't agree with you to work on the problem.
For example, if you intend to go to your landlord, let them know that. This isn't a threat provided you actually follow through with it.
Make a copy of your letter before you give it to your neighbor. You can place your letter on their front door – there's no real need to mail it, just watch and see that your neighbors have seen the letter or taken it inside.

Review your lease.,
Draft a formal business letter.,
Get a note from your doctor, if applicable.,
Mail your letter to your landlord.,
Talk to your landlord in person.,
Find out if you can move to another unit.",How to Complain About Secondhand Smoke in Apartments2," Your lease includes provisions regarding your rights as a tenant that you can cite in a letter to your landlord. These provisions will support your position and make your arguments more persuasive.It's possible that your lease, or other community rules incorporated into your lease, prohibit smoking in apartments. If this is the case, you definitely have the upper hand in complaining about your neighbors' smoking because they are violating their lease.
Even if there's nothing explicitly stated in your lease, you can rely on the covenant of quiet enjoyment, which is implied in all leases by law.
Through this covenant, all tenants agree not to do anything that disturbs or causes a nuisance to their neighbors and disrupts other tenants' rights to quietly enjoy their rental unit.
Secondhand smoke is a nuisance that can cause significant health problems and impact your ability to breathe – not to mention that it damages the apartment and makes all your things smell like an ashtray.

, Initiate your effort to involve your landlord with a formal, written letter that explains your problems with the secondhand smoke in your apartment and demands something be done about it.The word processing app on your computer typically will have a business letter template that will help you format your letter correctly.
You want to keep your letter brief – no more than a page – and stick to the facts. Let your landlord know the efforts you've made to resolve the situation amicably before turning to them for help.
State clearly that you understand your rights as a tenant and are asking for your landlord's help in eliminating this nuisance. Let them know that you are open to discussing all available options.
Provide your landlord with a deadline to respond to your letter. A week to 10 days from receipt of the letter should be plenty of time. If you plan to do something else specifically if you don't get the result you want, let them know.
Otherwise, you don't want to make threats that you don't intend to follow through with. Simply say something like ""If this matter is not resolved within 10 days of receipt of this letter, I will be forced to take further action.""

, If you have a health condition that is affected or exacerbated by the secondhand smoke, talk to your doctor about it and see if he or she will write a letter to your landlord explaining the health risk the secondhand smoke presents to you.If you have special sensitivities to secondhand smoke, you may qualify under federal laws that require landlords to provide people with disabilities reasonable accommodation.
The federal Fair Housing Act prohibits landlords from discriminating against people who have a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits a major life activity.
Breathing is considered a major life activity, which means any health condition that affects your breathing – including severe allergies to secondhand smoke – constitutes a disability under federal law.
Reasonable accommodations include smoking restrictions in your building, moving you to another building with smoking restrictions, or sealing off your apartment and providing it with separate ventilation.

, When you've finished drafting your letter, you should proofread it carefully, then print it and sign it. Make at least one copy of your letter for your own records before sending it to your landlord.Mail your letter using certified mail with returned receipt requested. This way you have proof of the date when your landlord receives your letter.
Certified mail may seem like overkill when you could just take your letter to the rental office yourself, but keep in mind that you need to establish objective proof of your efforts should your landlord refuse to work with you.
If you simply take the letter to your landlord, they can later claim they never received the letter and they don't know what you're talking about – and it would be your word against theirs.
When you get the green card showing that your landlord signed for and received your letter, keep it with your copy of the letter and mark the date for your deadline on your calendar.

, If your landlord contacts you regarding your letter, you may want to consider sitting down with your landlord in person and talking about the problems you have with secondhand smoke.While you want to assert your rights to a smoke-free home, you also should try to understand things from your landlord's point of view.
Your landlord is trying to walk a thin line because they don't want to lose any tenants. However, you can point out the damage smoke does to apartments, which impacts their value.
Your landlord will have to put more work into cleaning an apartment after tenants move out who have smoked there. Even if the landlord is able to charge the tenants for those damages, it still means the landlord has a longer turnaround time before they can rent the apartment again.
You might want to ask your landlord if they would consider imposing smoking restrictions in your building or complex.
However, keep in mind that even if your landlord agrees to do this, it may be nearly a year before the problem is fully resolved. Landlords can't change active leases, which means you'd have to wait until the smokers' lease was up before you noticed any difference in the quality of the air in your unit.

, If you live in a large building or complex, and there are open units available, your landlord may be willing to allow you to move to another unit that isn't near smoking tenants.By moving to a different unit, you can transfer your lease without causing much additional expense either to you or your landlord.
If your landlord has another, smoke-free unit that you can use, offer to clean your current unit after move out and try to leave it in the condition it was in when you first moved there.
Even though moving is a hassle, if you're just moving to a neighboring building it's nowhere near as disruptive as moving to the other side of town.

Contact your local tenants' rights agency.,
File a complaint with the local housing board.,
Raise awareness in your community about the dangers of secondhand smoke.,
Consult an attorney.,
Consider moving to a smoke-free building or complex.",How to Complain About Secondhand Smoke in Apartments3," Particularly if you live in a larger city, there may be a tenants' rights agency near you that can help you with the problem of secondhand smoke in your apartment.Tenants' rights agencies exist to help you assert your housing rights as provided by federal and state law and local ordinances. Any help they provide typically is free of charge.
Tenants' rights agencies also often have attorneys on staff who can assess your situation and provide you advice on the next steps you should take.
If secondhand smoke is a problem for many other tenants, someone at the tenants' rights agency also may be able to help you hold a tenants' meeting or organize a tenant union in your building or complex to give you more power to assert your rights to smoke-free housing against a reluctant landlord.

, If your community has a housing safety or sanitation board, they may accept complaints about secondhand smoke – particularly if you have a health condition that is exacerbated by the smoke.Some cities and counties also have passed smoke-free ordinances that may restrict smoking in rental units. If your landlord is violating a local ordinance by allowing tenants to smoke in their apartments, you can get help from the city or county to end the problem.
Even without a local ordinance, the local housing board may take action against your landlord for failing to provide reasonable accommodation to you if you have a health condition or special sensitivity to second-hand smoke.
When you file your complaint, bring along all the copies you have of your letters to your neighbors and your landlord, as well as any other documentation you have that supports your claims.

, You can find fliers and posters online that you can print out and post in common areas to help educate and inform your neighbors about various health risks associated with secondhand smoke.Check the websites of health organizations such as the American Heart Association or the American Lung Association. There also are anti-smoking organizations that have materials.
Be careful that you're not creating a nuisance yourself by distributing these materials. Post them in common areas where tenants are free to post bulletins or other items, but don't litter.
For example, leaving fliers on people's cars or in their doors may be seen as a nuisance or as harassment, particularly if you're continually leafleting neighboring smokers that you've already engaged about the issue.

, As a last resort, you may want to consider filing a lawsuit against your neighbor, or against your landlord to force them to remedy the problem of secondhand smoke in your apartment. Most attorneys offer a free initial consultation to evaluate your case.Look for attorneys who specialize in landlord-tenant law or in local nuisance law. You may be able to sue your neighbor for creating a nuisance, or your landlord for failing to abate that nuisance.
If you're a renter, you typically will want to focus on suing your landlord as opposed to suing your neighbor. Even if you win your lawsuit against your neighbor, you may have difficulty enforcing the judgement against them.
Typically you can file these lawsuits in small claims court, which are designed for people to use on their own without the assistance of an attorney.
However, take advantage of free consultations to get more information and advice on your potential lawsuit.
You can search for attorneys on the website of your state or local bar association, which typically will have a searchable directory of member-attorneys who are licensed to practice law in your area.

, If you have the means to do so – and particularly if you're nearing the end of your lease – you may want to move to a different apartment community in your area that has a 100 percent smoke-free policy.Simply moving away may not satisfy your desire to assert your rights, but in some cases it may be the easiest solution.
Even if your landlord was unwilling to help you before, if you state that you're ready to move to a smoke-free complex, they may become more interested in helping you to avoid losing you as a tenant – particularly if you've been a good tenant who paid your rent on time and never caused any problems.
You can ask your landlord if you can break your lease if you've still got several months left. It may actually be cheaper (from your landlord's point of view), to just let you cut your lease and go than to make any accommodations that would be necessary for you to stay.
If you find yourself having to move because of the secondhand smoke issue, bring it up to your landlord and ask for a break on any damages you would be charged, or for a full refund of your security deposit regardless of any damages. Make sure you get any such agreement in writing.
If your landlord agrees to give you a full refund of your damage deposit, this doesn't mean you should leave your apartment in disarray.
Clean up after you've moved all of your stuff out and make an effort to repair any minor damages you might have caused that go beyond normal wear and tear.

Don’t delay.,
Use the appropriate letter format.,
Enter the salutation.,
State the reason for your letter.,
Go into a bit of detail about why you’re grateful and how their contribution will be put to use.,
Conclude the letter.,
Sign off.,
Proofread your letter.",How to Write a Letter of Appreciation1," Saying thank you to someone should happen soon after the event, gift, favor, or other action for which you're thankful.



Etiquette demands that you observe a three-day rule for sending a thank-you note or letter.If you have missed that window, though, it's better to say thank you late than never at all.;
, When writing a formal letter, you should use a professional, typed format and print the letter on quality paper.When writing a more casual or personal letter to someone you know well, (clear and legibly) handwritten letters on quality stationery may be appreciated.You can either set up the format yourself or use one of the letter templates built into your word processing application.
If you’re setting up your own format for a formal letter, begin by entering the date in the top left-hand corner. Skip a line, then enter the full name and address of the person to whom you’re writing. Skip a line and enter your salutation.
If you’re using your own format for a personal letter, it’s customary to include the date and, below it, a personalized yet polite greeting.

, Letters to business associates or people you don't know well should include a title in the salutation. Letters to someone you already know well can be more personal, such as “Dear Jeff,” or “Dear Bridget.”


Doctors, professors, government officials, and military service members should all be addressed with their appropriate title spelled out in full, i.e. ""Dear Doctor Johnson"" or ""Dear Sergeant Jones.""
If the person doesn’t have a more formal title, use the abbreviated ""Mr."" for men, and ""Miss/Mrs./Ms"" for women (be sure to know which title she prefers; if you don't know, you can opt for the more neutral “Ms.” or you can use her full name, like ""Dear Jane Smith.”).

, When writing a formal letter, it’s polite to begin by informing the addressee of the reason you’re writing.If you’re writing a letter of appreciation, the purpose will likely be something like, “I’m writing to thank you for your kind donation to X Scholarship Fund (or sponsorship or recommendation, etc.). I was very excited to learn of your donation and would like to express my gratitude.”

, This portion helps you communicate both your gratitude and gives the recipient a sense of how their contribution will be used. For many people, knowing that their contribution will be put to good use is very reassuring and affirming.


Give a bit of information about yourself--who you are, your position, etc. Eg, “I’m the Director of the University Scholarship Fund and spearheaded our most current fundraising drive, with the goal of raising $50,000. I was delighted to receive your contribution”
Describe how their contribution will be put to use and specify who or what it will benefit. Eg, “Your kind and generous donation will be used to establish a scholarship fund in your name, to benefit outstanding scholars in literary studies. The scholarship will award $1,000 annually to 3 students in need, selected for the quality of their work and dedication to the field. The scholarship money will help these students conduct a focused research project of their choosing, helping both further their academic careers and make valuable contributions to their field.”

, Close by reiterating your gratitude and belief that their contribution is valuable and important.


Reiterate your gratitude with something like, “Your donation will make a crucial difference in the career of the students who receive the scholarship, and I couldn’t be more grateful for your generosity.”
Reiterate how valuable their contribution is by saying something like, “Your donation has allowed us to reach our fundraising goal and to continue our mission of supporting future scholars.”

, Finally, you’ll need to formally sign off with a valediction (a parting salutation) and your signature.


In general, it’s standard etiquette to use “Sincerely” as your valediction if you’re writing a formal letter.
If you’re writing a very personal letter, you might use “Love,” but slightly less intimate options are “Yours Truly,” “Warm Regards,” “Fond Regards,” “Best Regards,” or “Respectfully.”Hand-sign your name below the valediction.
If you’re writing a formal or professional letter, it’s common to include your name, typed in full, below your signature, in case your signature is difficult to read.

, Before sending the letter, be sure you’ve carefully proofread it for typos and grammatical errors. A flawed letter will make a much less positive impression than a well-done one.


You may find it useful to read the letter aloud; sometimes reading aloud helps you catch errors you may miss by reading silently.
Have a trusted friend or colleague review the letter.

See a counsellor.",How to File a Complaint," Focus on the actual events that took place. It’s important to separate facts from feelings, particularly in emotionally charged situations.


If the situation is particularly complex, you may find it helpful to write your thoughts and feelings down in a journal. Getting a better sense of your feelings may help you separate them from the facts of your complaint.
If you are having trouble figuring out whether you should complain, consider consulting an unbiased third party. If you do this, make sure that it’s someone you trust, who won’t share any details of your situation without your approval.;
, Filing a complaint can be a lengthy and stressful process. It’s important to ask yourself if filing a complaint is worth your time — particularly if you have a lot of other things to do.


Example: you buy a $5 box of hair dye that fails to dye your hair the promised color. You send an email to the company asking for a refund or a coupon for another box of dye, and they say no. If you escalate the situation by asking to speak to a superior, you may still be able to get what you want, but it will take time, and the end result will be using more of the company’s products. You might find that it’s not worth the trouble.

,


The contact person may be your supervisor, your landlord, your school’s principal or another relevant person in charge.
If the person you wish to complain about happens to be the primary contact for complaints, you should contact someone higher up than them — for example, if you want to file a complaint about your boss, you will likely need to contact human resources.
You may be advised to speak to a specific individual, appear in person, write a letter or fill out a form.

, Solutions will differ depending on the context of your complaint:


If you’re calling or emailing a company to complain about a faulty product, you’ll need to first familiarize yourself with their return policies. If they only replace faulty products and do not refund them, but you do not want the same product, you might ask if they can grant you a store credit instead.
If you’re complaining about a boss’s or a teacher’s misconduct, possible resolutions might be that you can transfer to another work branch or department, or change classes or schools; in more extreme cases, you may even believe that the person deserves to lose their job.

, The more evidence that you have, the more effective your complaint will be.


Examples of supporting documents for a retail transaction could include sales receipts, product listings and email exchanges.
For a complaint against a boss or teacher, supporting documents may include inappropriate emails and Facebook messages, journal entries detailing instances in which you were mistreated, or letters of support from witnesses.

, The types of records you keep will depend on the context of the complaint.


If you’re lodging a complaint against a business, you’ll want to have records of your communications with them as well as any receipts for products purchased.
If you purchased a faulty product, keep records of the specific times and ways in which it was faulty; in addition, note what you’ve done, if anything, to try to fix the problem.
Unless you have witnesses, it will be more difficult to file a complaint against a boss or teacher who is verbally abusing or harassing you. Administrators will commonly ask for a detailed account of your interactions with the person in question, so it’s best to keep a journal.

, Often in cases of misconduct in the workplace or school, mediators will give more weight to your complaint if you have kept a journal. If you think that you may have a problem with a boss, teacher, or other superior, it’s hugely helpful to keep a journal of your interactions.


Date your pages and be as detailed as possible about what was said and done. Try to focus as much as possible on facts as opposed to feelings, as handing over a journal full of emotional outbursts against the person may undermine your complaint.
If you want to lend more weight to your journal, you might consider doing it in the form of emails to yourself, just so that the dates are recorded in something other than your own handwriting. You can keep these emails in a separate folder of your email account. Just be sure that you don't accidentally send them to anyone other than yourself!
Keeping a journal may seem stupid since you could make the whole thing up, but administrators do place a lot of weight on it. Besides satisfying administrators, maintaining a journal can actually help you keep your facts straight during what can end up being a long and confusing complaints process.

, Regardless of whether you’re complaining about a product or a person’s behaviour, your complaint will be more effective if you are specific about what has happened.


In the case of a complaint about a company’s service, you might write about how the product specifically broke down; provide the details of your communications with the company thus far (including any documents/evidence possible); and then state how you are unhappy with the service you’ve received thus far.
In the case of a complaint against a boss or teacher for harassing you, you would describe when the problem started, exactly what the boss/teacher said or did, and how long it went on for (i.e. give a timeline of the harassment). You would also include descriptions of anything you did to try to avoid that person’s unwanted attention, and if applicable, give evidence for the ways in which their behaviour affected your work.

, Doing this may also help the complaint process move along much more quickly.


In the case of a faulty product: “I purchased XYZ app 20 days ago and since then, whenever I use it, my device freezes and the only way I can get it to unfreeze is to restart it. I complained to customer service 10 days ago and was sent a brief response 9 days ago that told me to remove and re-download the app. I did that 9 days ago and it is still not working. I sent an email 7 days ago and have not received any responses. At this point I would like a refund, if possible.”
In the case of misconduct: “On September 10 last year, I attended an office hour with Dr. Smith. During the office hour, and in several instances after that initial time, Dr. Smith made sexually aggressive comments and movements towards me which made me feel uncomfortable. I am struggling because I am depending on him to pass my class, but I do not feel comfortable working with him alone. At this time I would like to report his behaviour in order to prevent him from doing this to other people; I would also like to be moved to another class.”

, Complaints can get emotional, particularly if you’re not achieving your desired resolution. It’s important to remain respectful at all times — from the time that you submit your complaint to the time that you receive the decision.


Anything you do or say to suggest that you cannot control your emotions may reflect badly upon you, making it less likely that your complaint will achieve its desired results. This is particularly true for complaints about other people’s misconduct.
No matter what you're complaining about, being respectful and polite is more likely to make people want to help you than the shouting and swearing. Some people might even just straight refuse to help you if you shout and swear at them, and rightfully so.

, Instead of saying “can I get a refund?” or “will he be disciplined?” you might ask, “What can be done to help this situation?”, Whether you’re filing a verbal complaint or a written one, write it down and give it an edit before submitting it. If it’s a verbal complaint, you can write out a script and read it out loud before deciding on a final version.


This isn’t only about ensuring that you’re spelling thing correctly; it’s also about ensuring that you've said all that you want to say, and that you’ve done it in the most effective way possible.

, Extreme frustration or emotions can cloud your thinking; that’s why it’s important to really know what you want to say before calling in a verbal complaint.


You may find it helpful to write out a script, or at least write down your main points so that you can check them off as you go.

, When making points/writing a script for your verbal complaint, focus on the facts. When you’re feeling emotional, take a deep breath and look down at your script/notes, then return to the facts.


Being overly emotional will only make you look weak and unreliable to the people you’re complaining to. Some people might even think they’ve go the upper hand when they see that you are emotional.

, It may be tempting to gloss over details when you speak things out loud as opposed to writing them down. It’s important to be just as clear and detailed when making a verbal complaint.


Identify the actual events, relevant conversations and/or important transactions that have led to your complaint.

, If the person to whom you’re speaking says anything that you don’t understand, stop them politely and ask them to clarify.

, Before you have finished speaking to the person, make sure that you know what the next steps are. Possible next steps:


When you can expect a response.
Who might be contacting you next.
Who you can contact in the meantime if you have any questions or remember any more details while you’re waiting for a response.

, A standard complaint form may be required when submitting complaints in academic, corporate and government settings.


Sometimes the form will differ depending on the nature of your complaint. If you have any questions about which form you need, double-check with an administrator.
If you need to ask about which form you need, you needn’t be too specific about the nature of your complaint — for example, “I would like to file a complaint against a teacher who is sexually harassing me.”

, Complaint forms will request your name, the date of the incident, the name of the offender, and the acts and events that you find damaging or offensive. Be sure to respond to all of these requests as clearly and specifically as possible.

, Complaint forms generally require a signature and may not be processed without one.

, Keep the copy in a safe place so that you can review the facts at a later date, if necessary. If you don't have access to a photocopier, you can make a copy of the form by taking a high-resolution photograph of it with your camera or phone.


If you end up taking a photograph of the form, make sure that the photograph is clear before you submit the form, otherwise it won’t be a useful copy to you.
If it’s an online form, you can make a copy of it by saving it as a PDF or by taking a screenshot of it. Often you’ll be prompted to print a form after you’ve filled it out; if this happens, choose “print to PDF” in the printing prompt.

, In certain environments, a formal complaint filing procedure may not exist. In that case, writing a complaint letter is important for documenting the events.


You may even want to do this in combination with a verbal complaint, just so that there’s a written record that your complaint has been submitted.

, This includes the date that you’re writing the letter, as well as the name, professional position (if applicable), and address of the person to whom you’re writing.

, If the recipient of the complaint letter does not know you, provide enough relevant and personally identifiable information that they get a sense of who you are. Such information includes your name, position, address, phone number, and your relationship to the offender(s).

, Recount the relevant conversations, dates, transactions and any actions you have already taken. Provide all necessary information, such as how much money you lost, or who and how many people were involved.

, Explain your expectations, whether you are expecting a refund, an apology or some other remedy.

, Ask the recipient to indicate that your letter has been received and to clarify the time frame for resolving the issue. Let them know how they contact you — for example, by phone, email, post, or all three.

, Try to keep your letter as short as possible. Stick to the facts and avoid getting overly emotional. If you’re describing a situation in which you were harassed or abused, it’s important to note that you felt uncomfortable or at risk/unsafe, but try to state this in more objective as opposed to emotional language.


More objective: “When I was in his office he closed the door and pulled his chair very close to me, within about 1 foot of my knees. I moved my chair back but hit the wall, and he moved in closer and leaned his face toward me and told me how great I looked standing in front of class during my presentation today. At that moment I felt uncomfortable and trapped as I was against the wall and couldn’t move away from him. I didn’t want to upset him so I found an excuse to leave as soon as I could.”
Emotional: “When I was in his office he shut the door, trapping me inside with him as he moved closely toward me and told me how hot I was before obviously trying to kiss me. I felt terrified and was worried he might attack me, but I couldn’t move because he had me trapped against the wall at that point. I ran out as soon as I could.”

, If you have not heard back within the expected time frame, contact the complaint recipient to inquire about the delay.


Unless the company/person has told you otherwise, an appropriate time to wait might be two weeks.
If you have not heard anything within two weeks, it’s within reason to contact them and politely ask whether they received your complaint. If you’re communicating by email, you can attach another copy of your complaint to your message in case they didn't receive it the first time.

, Familiarize yourself with the levels that your complaint will go through. If you are struggling to resolve your issue, you may need to seek legal help.


If you have a complaint against a business, your first point of contact should be the manager or owner of the business. If that doesn’t work, and if the business is a chain, you can contact their head office. If that fails, you might consider filing a complaint with the Better Business Bureau.
If you have a complaint against your boss or a teacher, be prepared for your complaint to travel through several channels. Its path will depend on your company’s/school’s process for complaints.
An example of complaining about a professor at a university would be to first submit a written complaint to your head of department (as long as the head isn't the offending prof); you might then need to speak to the faculty dean and, depending on the nature of your complaint, a specific member of the department that relates to your complaint — e.g. plagiarism or sexual harassment will be dealt with by different departments.

, Some companies and schools will try to defend the person who has been the cause of your complaint. They will do this because it could be quite expensive for them to fire that person, even if that person has clearly been the one who misbehaved.


They may try to make you feel as though you’ve made a mistake or that you're blowing things out of proportion. It’s possible that you are, but if you know you aren’t, don’t let them tell you you’re wrong.
If your complaint is something serious, it deserves serious treatment. Unfortunately, particularly in misconduct cases, the company/school will often protect the offender if they are in a position above you, as to admit wrongdoing could cost them a lot of money.

, Your complaint may not go the way you want it to, but it’s important to remain respectful to everyone involved.


Don’t let your emotions get the better of you. the more emotional you appear, the less likely people are to take you seriously or want to help.

, As you work through the complaint, ensure that you keep records of all emails, phone calls and/or any other communications.


You may need to refer back to these to protect yourself or remind the company/school/etc. of things that they have promised.

, Chances are, the offending party will not be pleased with your complaint. They might even fight back, and this could be stressful for you. You have to be prepared for the fact that your complaint might make things harder for you.


If you make a complaint against someone in the workplace or at school, you may be asked to sit down with the offending person and work things out so that you can continue to work together in the future. If it escalates to this level, depending on the offending person’s maturity, they might hold resentment toward you and things could just get worse.
If things become too difficult, you might consider moving to a different school or job or asking to be transferred to a different department or class so that you do not need to see that person any more.

, Ideally your complaint will lead to a satisfying resolution. Unfortunately, many complaints do not. If yours does not, you’ll need to know when it’s time to let go.


Remember that you made the complaint because you were unhappy with the way things were going. The most important thing is that you are no longer unhappy; you must make this the focus of your efforts no matter what the outcome of the complaint process is.

, If there’s nothing else that can be done, try to learn a lesson from your experience and then work on moving forward. If you are unsure of what you can learn from the experience, consider asking.


This can be particularly useful in a misconduct situation, where you are meeting with people who are trained in conflict management. When they give you the bad news, you might say “I have to admit that I’m disappointed with this outcome. I don’t want it to continue affecting my life. Do you have any suggestions for how I might move on from this?”
If your complaint was with a company’s faulty products and poor customer service, some lessons you might take from your experience could involve anger management, clear communication skills, and a finer-tuned ability to seek out reputable companies with good products.

, Seeing a counsellor could help you work through any feelings that may have been brought up during the complaint process, particularly if it’s one of a more personal nature.

Have a friendly but formal opening.,

Give proper notice.,
State your reasons for leaving (optional).,
State that you're willing to help out during the transition.,
Thank your employer for the experience.,
Wrap up your letter on a kind note.,
Have a nice closing.,
Stay professional.,
If you're turning in your resignation letter through email, stick to similar conventions.,
Read it over before you turn it in.",How to Write a Resignation Letter," This can be a tricky balance to maintain, but your goal should be to keep things amicable while maintaining your professionalism. Unless you really don't have a good or familiar relationship with your boss, you should begin your letter by saying ""Dear"" followed by your boss's first name. You can say something like, ""Dear Lisa,"" before you announce your resignation. If you say, ""Dear Ms. Smith,"" then your resignation may come off as too formal, especially if you do have a friendly or at least cordial relationship with your boss.Of course, if things happen to be more formal at your company and you normally call your boss ""Mr. Jones,"" then you should stick to that in the letter — in that case, suddenly getting familiar would be strange.
If your letter is typed on paper instead of email, just write the date at the top lefthand side, with your boss's name and address written below it.

, It's important to state your intention to resign in clear terms so that your boss doesn't think you are open to an offer for a higher salary or other perks, or that you are open to a counteroffer though you've accepted a new position. You want to be crystal clear so you sound confident in your decision, or so you're not faced with the discomfort of your boss coming to you thinking there's a chance that you'll stay on, after all. Here are some ways you can clearly state your intention to resign:


""I hereby submit my resignation as ""
""Please accept this letter as notice of my resignation from my position as .""
""It is with regret that I submit my letter of resignation as .""

, It is simple courtesy to give your employer a reasonable amount of time to fill your position. If your job is complicated, your employer may need time for you to train your replacement. Give notice of no less than two weeks. It may be common courtesy to give more notice if your position in the company is more elevated. Many people recommend using your given vacation time as an accurate measurement of how many weeks' notice you should give; if you have three weeks vacation, for example, you should give three weeks' notice, if you want to be polite. You should state your last work day immediately after you've stated your intentions to resign — you can even do so in the same sentence. Here's how you can go about it:""I hereby submit my resignation as effective on July 12, 2014.""
""Please accept this letter as notice of my resignation from my position as . My last day of employment will be July 12, 2014.""
""It is with regret that I submit my letter of resignation as . I intend to work until the end of the month, with my last day being July 31, 2014.""

, You don't have to be too thorough in this part, but it could be a nice gesture to state your reasons for resigning. If you're resigning because you're just really unhappy at the company, you don't have to go into detail about this. However, if you're resigning because of retirement, maternity leave, personal reasons, or, most commonly, because you've accepted an offer at a different company, then you can state this to give your boss a better sense of the situation. Here are some ways that you can state your reasons for leaving:""I was recently offered a new opportunity at a different company, and have decided to accept the offer.""
""I received an offer to serve as of a company that suits my needs, and after careful consideration, I've realized that this opportunity is the right path for me.""
""I would like to inform you that I will be retiring on April 3.""
""After much thought and consideration, I have decided not to return after maternity leave.""
""I have decided to resign for personal reasons.""

, If you're in a position that would be difficult to fill, and if you really feel you owe it to the company, then you can make it clear that you're happy to help train someone else to do your job or to smoothly pass on your duties. Ideally, if you were planning to resign, you might have been doing some of this already, little by little, but in any case, if you care about the company and know that you have big shoes to fill, you can mention that you're willing to help during in the interim. Here's how you can state it:""I would be happy to help with the transition of my duties so that the company continues to function smoothly after my departure. I am available to help recruit as well as train my replacement.""

, Resist the temptation to leave a piece of your mind unless you want to be remembered as an ungrateful whiner. In fact, do the opposite: document positive memories of your job. Mention how this job has positively influenced your career and how it has or can help you secure an even better position. This will leave your boss feeling like you've had a positive experience at the company and it will minimize any potential animosity you may encounter. Unless you really feel like your boss does not deserve any kind words, do this as a common courtesy. Here's what you can say:""I can't thank you enough for all of the experience and confidence my position has given me.""
""I want to give you my sincere thanks for all of the opportunities you have given me and for all of the knowledge I have gained at your company over the years.""
""I'll always be grateful to you for going above and beyond to ensure my success at my position.""

, The way you end your letter depends on what you stated earlier. If you said you'd be happy to help recruit and train a new person for your position, you can say something like, ""You can reach me any time at or ."" This will show your boss that you really are committed to the success of your company. Remember that you don't want to end on anything but a positive tone that leaves your boss feeling warm, or at least not furious.If you really do have a close relationship with your boss, you can go the extra mile to make this clear by ending by saying something like, ""I'll never forget how much you've helped me over the years, and will always be grateful to you"" or, ""I never would have been able to secure this new position without all of your help and encouragement over the years.""

, End your letter by saying ""Warmly,"" ""Kind Regards,"" ""Wishing you the best,"" or something similar just before you write your name. You can also just use ""Sincerely"" if you want to be more formal about it, but you can also use this opportunity to use a closing that really shows how grateful you are for your experience at the company.

, Be respectful and courteous. Do not use emotional or controversial language in your letter. You are a professional, so quit like a professional. If you have quit because of the working conditions at your company, you can kindly say so, but there's absolutely no reason to go into all of the details of why you have left the company. You can write them down on a different piece of paper for yourself, if it will make you feel better.Just remember that this letter will go in your personnel file and will be available any time a future employer calls the company asking about you; you don't want a negative letter to have an adverse effect on your future.

, These rules can be followed whether you're turning in a traditional resignation letter or if you're resigning over email. The only difference is that your email won't require you to write the date or your boss's address on the top lefthand side, and that you can title the subject of the email ""Resignation"" along with your name, to give your boss an idea of what to expect.


Resignation over email is becoming more common than ever in today's tech savvy society, though you should have a sense of workplace etiquette when you decide the best path to take.
With the mass transition to email for a lot of work correspondence, it's become common for resignation letters to have become a bit shorter then they used to be. Now, just 5-6 sentences can do the tricks instead of several detailed paragraphs.

, Though this piece of advice is true for any piece of professional correspondence, it's particularly important to give your resignation one last look before you turn it in. While checking for typos and grammatical mistakes is important, what's more important is that you're pleased with the overall impression given by the letter, and that it comes off as positive instead of hostile. You may just quickly get everything off your chest and want to turn it in immediately, but if you let it cool for an hour and read it over again, you may see that it could have been a bit more kind.


Once you turn in the letter, there's no taking back anything you said. Make sure that it's something you're proud of, not a way to get back at your boss.

Proofread your letter.",How to Write a Letter of Appreciation2," Sending a thank-you letter after a job interview can make an excellent impression on a potential employer, provided you send it promptly after the interview--no later than three days is ideal.


Even if you don’t get the job or suspect you won’t get the job, sending a thank-you letter will leave a positive impression that can benefit you if you apply there or with an associate in the future., Because a letter of appreciation to a potential employer implies a professional relationship, choose and appropriately professional letter format.When writing a formal letter, you should use a professional, typed format and print the letter on quality paper.You can either set up the format yourself or use one of the letter templates built into your word processing application.
If you’re setting up your own format for a formal letter, begin by entering the date in the top left-hand corner. Skip a line, then enter the full name and address of the person to whom you’re writing. Then skip a line before you enter your salutation.

, A professional thank-you should include a title in the salutation.


Doctors, professors, government officials, and military service members should all be addressed with their appropriate title spelled out in full, i.e. ""Dear Doctor Johnson"" or ""Dear Sergeant Jones.""
If the person doesn’t have a more formal title, use the abbreviated ""Mr."" for men, and ""Miss/Mrs./Ms"" for women (be sure to know which title she prefers; if you don't know, you can opt for the more neutral “Ms.” or you can use her full name, like ""Dear Jane Smith.”).

, To begin writing the body of your letter, start with a simple and concise expression of gratitude.


Something like, “Thank you for taking the time to meet with me on Monday. I greatly enjoyed our discussion.”

, To show sincerity and that you aren’t simply using a general thank-you letter for every interviewer, include a specific detail about what you enjoyed during your conversation.


You might say something like, “I particularly enjoyed our discussion about the impact of social media outreach within non-profit organizations. Your insight about using technology to forge closer relations with clients made a strong impression on me.”

, As you close your letter, you can express a desire to talk or work with the recipient again in the near future.


For example, you could write, “I hope we’ll have more opportunities to work together in the near future.”

, It’s polite to conclude a post-interview thank-you letter with a sentence making yourself available for further contact.


For example, “I will gladly provide any additional information you may need and welcome additional questions.”

, Finally, choose an appropriate valediction (parting salutation) and sign your name to the bottom of the letter.


”Sincerely” is the most common valediction for professional letters, but you may consider additional options like, “Warm Regards,” “Best Regards,” “Sincere Regards,” or “Respectfully.”Hand-sign your name below the valediction.
It’s customary to type out your full name below your signature in case your signature is difficult to read.

, Before sending the letter, be sure you’ve carefully proofread it for typos and grammatical errors. A flawed letter will make a much less positive impression than a well-done one.

You may find it useful to read the letter aloud; sometimes reading aloud helps you catch errors you may miss by reading silently.
Have a trusted friend or colleague review the letter.

Keep the grantor informed.,
Be patient.",How to Write a Grant Proposal," Highlight all questions you must answer and materials you have to include. Underline key words or phrases you might want to use.Assess the purpose the grant is intended to fulfill. Throughout the process, you'll want to make sure to highlight your organization's contribution to this purpose, both in the past and in the present.For example, if the grant is intended to promote education, you'll want to make sure to highlight your organization's educational activities, donations, etc.
Before you start writing—brainstorm. What are the strong points of your organization? Your program? What are your best arguments and examples? These ideas give you a place to start writing., Start by writing a one-paragraph description of your request. This will help you start with the big picture—the rest is filling in the details. You may be able to use this summary in the proposal, or as the first paragraph of your narrative. It should include:


Who you are, explained as if the grantor has never heard of your organization before.What your project is, and specifically what you plan to do.How much you’re asking for, and exactly what you'll use the money for.If the grant requires an abstract, this summary statement will serve as your first draft.

, It should describe each step of your plan and organize your thinking. The outline is the plan you'll follow as you draft your proposal.Expand each point as needed to fully explain each section.
Use the grantor's request for proposals (RFP) or criteria as the basis. The outline should follow, painstakingly, the sequence and terms prescribed by the grantor.

, Don't assume that just because there is a significant amount of money available, that they will fund just anything.The truth is that grantors are usually very specific in what they are looking for (and sometimes a bit odd, but that's their choice), and will rarely deviate from their category.
You may have the very best purple widget in the world, but if the grant is only for the producers of red widgets, you won't get the grant.

, It doesn't have to look good, just get your ideas down on paper—you can polish them later.Look at your brainstorm ideas and your outline, and start with the questions that you have the most answers for. If you get stuck on one question, work on another one for a while.Focus on the parts of your project that they’ll like best—use their guidelines for clues. For example, if they're partial to environmental responsibility, and part of your project is using renewable resources for energy, make that stand out.
Where appropriate, highlight your organization's partnerships with other groups. This builds credibility and legitimacy.

, Your grant proposal should describe what the money will be used for, and the clearer you are in describing your goals, the more likely the outcome of your proposal will be positive.If you say, for example, ""I want this grant so that I can help the community,"" you won't get nearly the credibility as you would by saying ""This grant will allow us to buy two new computers, and create two part-time paid staff positions in an area where jobs for high school students are very difficult to find.""

, When you’re done with your draft, go through it carefully and polish it up. Make sure the ideas are clear and the delivery concise. Read it out loud to see how it flows. You will probably need to rewrite a lot, and possibly will need to do so several times.You can use the key words and phrases you underlined in the application. But don’t worry about getting fancy—just say what you have to say, briefly and clearly.
Review your original summary. Make sure it exactly reflects the proposal you've actually written—your ideas might have changed!

, Before you proofread, read and re-read the requirements instructions carefully. Every grant has rules and procedures that must be followed exactly as written. Make sure your proposal has followed all the rules.If it says that the grant must be submitted via the online form, don't even bother to ask if you can send it via fax.
Unlike employment applications, in which it sometimes pays to be original, grant committees have rules in place for a specific reason, and they expect them to be followed to the letter. To do otherwise may mean that your application will be disqualified before it ever gets read.

, Show the funding committee that you take the proposal seriously by carefully proofing your proposal for spelling, typing, and grammatical errors.Take time to have at least two people proofread your proposal before you submit it—and then read it out loud to yourself to make sure.Some say reading something from back to front is a good way to catch errors you might otherwise miss, but do whatever you must to make certain you are submitting a flawless document.

, Have at least two other people outside of your organization or discipline read the proposal, and then ask them questions about your concept.If they cannot explain what you are trying to do, chances are the grants committee won't either, and they won't fund what they can't comprehend.

, Don't guess about the numbers. Instead, take the time to research and evaluate the actual expenses you've got to manage. Don't estimate. Use real numbers, not amounts that end in 000.00.In a grant proposal, guessing won’t make it. If a grant reviewer suspects that your financial sheet is not accurate, they don't have either the time or the inclination to do the research—you just lost the grant.
Find out exactly what kind of equipment, labor, and anything else you are going to need, and exactly what the cost will be so you can spell it out in the proposal.

, A budget summary is a document that summarizes personnel expenses by category such as salary and fringes, purchased services, supplies, occupancy related expenses, communications, travel, equipment, printing, capital, indirect costs, etc.Typically, you will allocate the summary across several columns of information: total project cost, amount sought from the funder, and the matching funds you are contributing.
Grantors are more likely to consider proposals that show the applicant is also has a stake in the outcome.
Do not use a line called ""other expenses"" unless you fully explain it.

, A budget justification provides numerical detail explaining how you arrived at the amounts in the summary.In all circumstances, make sure your amounts balance out, meaning that everything adds up to the same numbers throughout the proposal.

, Letters of support and newspaper articles document your success and your partnerships with other organizations, and go a long way toward establishing your validity.

, For example, a 501(c)(3) letter of tax-exemption; an audit or financial report, and a list of the board of directors. Make a file with several copies of each, so you have them ready whenever you write a proposal.

, This should include a summary of your request, including the purpose of your project and the amount of money you are requesting. It should also list the contents of your proposal (i.e. which documents you have included).Your cover letter will, in many cases, provide your grantor with their first impression of you. You should invest as much time and care in the cover letter as the other parts of the document., You may think the document has been thoroughly proofread, but do it again anyway. It's not unusual for a word to be misspelled and have nobody catch it.


Keep a look out for small details, such as a ""there"" that should be ""their,"" an ""it's"" that should be ""its,"" or a word that is commonly misspelled.

, Make sure you answered all the questions and are sending all the required materials.

, The information you've compiled could be very valuable for future grant applications.

, A late application will look sloppy, and may not even be considered., About a week after mailing, call to make sure it arrived and is complete (this is also an opportunity to talk a bit with the grant maker)., During the review period, if you have a major success, send a letter and let them know. If you get an article in the paper or online, send them a copy or the URL., The review process can take a long time. The fact that you haven't heard anything is not necessarily a sign of anything."

, One good way to go about this is to consider how you would explain this word to a small child or a person who is just beginning to speak the language. Avoid using descriptive words that are more complicated than the word in question, unless you also explain their meaning.

, What other words seem similar? What words are close? What is the difference between this word and other related words? What distinguishes ""fragile"" from ""weak"" from ""flimsy""?

, Some of these can go into the definition, if they are appropriate.

, While it's perfectly all right to include synonyms in the definition, a definition composed entirely of synonyms may not be as helpful as it could be. Thus, try to be as descriptive as possible.


If the word has a range of meanings, you'll need to address each one separately.

, Compare:


moxie - Gumption; pluck; chutzpah.
moxie - Bold determination; strength or fortitude.

, Phrases such as ""This word is used to..."" or ""Describes a situation in which..."" may help to get you started, but edit them out of your final definition.

, Verb definitions will contain many verbs; noun definitions, many nouns.


Most verb definitions will begin with the word ""to"". For instance, a definition for the verb ""pause"" might read, ""To stop briefly or temporarily; to interrupt a process or activity and later resume it.""
Noun definitions may begin with the words ""a"", ""an"" or ""the"".

Research the name of the person you wish to address.,
Write the inside address.,
Write the salutation.,
Verify that your question or concern is best addressed to the district attorney.,
Organize your thoughts prior to writing your letter.,
Review the letter before sending it.",How to Address a District Attorney in a Letter," If you do not already know the name of the district attorney in your jurisdiction, you can find it online by searching for the website of the ""office of the district attorney"" or ""district attorney's office"" in your area.


""District attorney"" is the title of the chief prosecutor of a jurisdiction within only 21 of the 50 states. Other jurisdictions may use ""attorney general,"" ""county attorney,"" ""prosecuting attorney,"" ""state's attorney,"" ""state attorney,"" ""commonwealth's attorney,"" ""circuit attorney,"" ""solicitor,"" or ""district attorney general."", The inside address includes the recipient's full name, title, and address.For example, ""The Honorable Jane Doe, District Attorney for San Diego County, 330 W Broadway #1300, San Diego, CA 92101.""


""The Honorable"" is used to refer to elected officials.47 of the 50 states elect their chief prosecutors by popular election in each jurisdiction.If your jurisdiction's chief prosecutor is appointed rather than elected (Alaska, Connecticut, New Jersey, and District of Columbia), use Mr. or Ms. instead of ""The Honorable.""

, The salutation, or greeting, normally begins with ""Dear."" It is acceptable to begin your salutation with ""Dear Mr./Madame District Attorney"" or ""Dear Mr./Ms. (surname).""The term ""Dear"" is always appropriate in a business situation and does not mean that the person is dear to you. It is simply a proper opening salutation.

, The district attorney may not have the authority to address your concern, and may simply refer you to another office. If you are not sure to whom you should address your concern, consider telephoning the district attorney's office or contacting an attorney.


If you are making unsolicited contact with the district attorney or his or her office, you may not be entitled to attorney-client privilege, and your communication may not be confidential.If you are a defendant in a criminal case and are represented by an attorney, the district attorney may be prohibited from communicating with you without your attorney's consent., Write down the most important points that you wish to make. Think about what the district attorney needs to hear, not just what you want to say. Imagine yourself talking to the district attorney in person in a rational manner and write it down.


Be brief. Explain your situation in as few words as possible, addressing the issue and the solution you would like to see. Remember that the district attorney is likely to be very busy, and he or she will be more receptive if a letter's author is considerate of his or her time.
Be professional in your language and positive in your approach. Try to keep your personal feelings out of your letter.
Keep your tone formal and respectful. Do not allow casual language or slang to creep in.

, If possible, have someone else proofread it for clarity and typographical errors.

Be passionate, but have a solution.",How to Write a Column," Figure out what you (or your editor) want the column to be about. Do you want to entertain or inform? Asking yourself why you are writing a column will help you figure out what you want to write about. If you want to entertain, you might want to write about humorous topics or make a serious topic comical. Wanting to inform your audience might mean your column is more factual, educational, and serious., Unlike more traditional forms of journalism (such as news reports or articles), a column is by nature biased and opinionated. Think of a topic that you are passionate about and that you have a strong opinion on when figuring out your content. It will be a lot easier to write a column if you care about the subject.Although a column is biased, you should still have journalistic integrity and not maliciously slander anyone.

, News stories come and go very quickly. When writing a column on recent events, move fast. You will want to write a column about a recent event within 24-48 hours after the event happened. Choose relevant topics that you have good perspective or advice about.


For example: if a political debate happens on a Sunday, you will want a column on your viewpoint of the debate written by Monday or Tuesday.

, Choose topics for your column where you can write about people. Using real people in your column gives it a stronger impact and helps you prove your point.Writing about concepts and policies without using names does not have as much of an effect as using real names.For example: if you are writing a column on your opinions on immigration, use the story of a local immigrant in your column.

, If you are writing a column for a local publication, then make sure to give issues a local point of view as much as you can. You can also use your own experiences to show you understand something from a first hand experience.


For example: if you are talking about problems in the education system, don’t be too general. Focus on the schools in your town and the problems kids in your town have faced or still face at school., Keep your column about the same general topic (politics, beauty, local issues, etc.). However, you should have variation within your theme. Your readers might get bored of your column if they feel like they are reading the same thing repeatedly.For example: if your theme is beauty you can talk about curly hair in one piece, eyeliner in another, and lipstick in another.

, Don’t be afraid to write articles on personal topics. Your views are out in the open in columns. Write about topics that allow you to reveal and expose yourself. This personalization and vulnerability is what will make readers keep reading your column.For example: if you are passionate about helping the homeless population, write about your feelings on homelessness in your column.
If you have five dogs, then write a piece about dogs and include information about your own experiences with dogs.

, Writing a column for teenage girls is going to be lot different than writing a column for business owners. Think about your audience when writing a column and how they pertain to your topic. , There are different structures for columns. You can have a personal column about a specific subject or about a variety of subjects. You might want a column that is in the form of “question and answer,” to give advice or to educate. Informative columns can also be written in a “how to” format.Claiborne Ray writes a Q&A structured column for The New York Times on simple science topics.Maureen Dowd writes a traditionally structured column on politics for The New York Times., Don’t complicate your column with confusing and technical language. Keep your writing simple. Use short sentences and paragraphs.Start a new paragraph whenever you have a new thought, even if that means a paragraph is only a sentence or two.


Your column should be between 600 and 800 words., Journalistic writing is usually written in Associated Press (AP) Style. This style includes specific requirements for abbreviations, grammar, titles, and names. Refer to an AP Style guidebook or search online to learn the rules of AP Style when writing your column., In a column, don’t be afraid to talk about yourself as yourself. When writing your opinions, say it is your opinion. Don’t refer to yourself or quote yourself in third person (either by your name or as “the author” or “the reporter”).For example, you could write: “I find it horrific that our taxes are not being used to help more homeless people find jobs.”
Don’t write: “Sara Finn, the author, was horrified to discover her taxes were not being used to help more homeless people find work.”

, A column is more personal than other types of journalism. Your language in a column does not have to be as formal. While maintaining good grammer, keep your tone casual and personal. Don’t write too formal: “Hell’s Kitchen, a neighborhood in New York City, is known for its variety of delicious restaurants.”
Instead write: “As a self-proclaimed 'pasta expert,' I thought I knew good pasta. However, when I went to Hell’s Kitchen during my trip to New York, I ate fettuccine that changed my life.”

, The “lead” (or lede) is the opening section of your column. Unlike traditional new reporting, your column should have a descriptive and attention grabbing lead.For example: “It was 11 p.m. and I still had not eaten dinner. I was starving, angry, and lost in New York City. I finally found an Italian restaurant that was still open and ran inside, completely unaware that I was about to have fettuccine that would change my opinion on pasta forever.”

, Your column should not be a huge list of facts, but you should back up your statements with facts to make your opinions more concrete. Even though a column is not a news report, you still might want to conduct interviews and do online research to back up your points. You will be taken more seriously if you know what you are talking about., If you are explaining something complicated or technical, use analogies to simplify and make your point. This will help your readers understand what you are saying in your column.For example: “When trying to understand how the business was hiding their money to get out paying taxes, think of the files on your laptop. When you put files in the “trash can” they seem gone, but really they are still there and accessible if you drag them out. The CEO put his money into a “trash can,” so the government would not see it.”

, A column is the perfect time to be passionate about your point of view. Share your opinions and viewpoints loud and clear. However, you can’t just write a column of you complaining about an issue. You need to finish off your column with solutions. The audience of your column wants your opinion and they want answers. For example: “I am disappointed and disgusted by the number of homeless veterans living on our streets. Let's raise the taxes of the wealthy and use that money to help the homeless.”

Don't delay!,
Choose an appropriate format.,
Choose an appropriate greeting.,
In the opening sentence, express your gratitude and clearly identify what you are thanking the recipient for.,
Discuss the direct impact or significance of what you are thankful for.,
Compliment the addressee, but without flattery.,
Allude to the future.,
Reiterate your thanks.,
Wrap it up with a regards, and sign your name.,
Proofread and review your note.,
When you're confident with your note, send it immediately.",How to Write a Business Thank You Note," In almost all business-related contexts, the foremost advantage of sending a thank-you note is that it leaves a positive and lasting impression with the business partner, potential employer, client, or donor. The more time that elapses between the interview, deal, or services rendered and the receipt of a thank-you, the less effective this reinforcement will be.

, In most instances, it's preferable to opt for real paper, as opposed to an email. If you are representing a company, typing the note on company letterhead is the most professional choice. However, a handwritten card adds a more personalized touch, and may be more appropriate for some circumstances-- for instance, if you are a small business owner, or when expressing gratitude for substantial donations. Hand-written notes are also a good choice for thanking a prospective employer after you've been interviewed for a position. If you choose to hand-write your thank you note:


Choose a card that is simple and sophisticated. A cream or white-colored card with an embossed ""Thank You"" on the front is generally a fail-safe bet. Avoid cards with messages printed on the interior, and designs that are overly ornate, ""cutesy,"" or cluttered.
Consider your handwriting abilities. If you are unsure of the quality or clarity of your handwriting, show a sample to a trustworthy friend or coworker. If you aren't quite a master of legible and neat cursive writing, be sure and try a few practice runs before writing on the card you intend to send. In a pinch, you can employ someone else to transcribe your note (just be sure to sign it yourself).
If for whatever reason the recipient's mailing address is not available, email may be your only option. It is also sometimes a more appropriate format-- for instance, when email has been the primary mode of correspondence between you and the person(s) you wish to thank. The main disadvantage associated with emailed thank-you notes is that they are more liable to be lost or ignored, and less likely to stand out. Remember that some people (and especially business executives) may receive hundreds of emails a day. With these cautions in mind, it may be tempting to compensate by making your email more flashy, or sending an E-card through a third-party site. In short, don't-- this will more likely make your email appear as an advertisement, and hence increase the odds that it will be ignored or trashed. Instead, keep it short, simple, sophisticated, and again, timely. You may wish to tailor the subject line to include information specific to your business relationship or what the thanks is for-- e.g., ""Thank you for your consideration of my application."", If there is one person in particular to whom thanks is due, address him or her by title and last name-- e.g., ""Dear Mr. Kinkaid."" When addressing more than one person, include them all by name and title in the greeting line. Avoid impersonal greetings like ""To Whom It May Concern."" Otherwise, the formality of your tone should depend on your level of familiarity and the nature of the business conducted with the recipient(s).

, There is no need to qualify your introduction-- avoid openers like ""I'm just writing to say thanks for…"" or ""I would like to express my gratitude…,"" and opt instead for the simple and direct present-perfect tense: e.g., ""Thank you for supporting our corporate community service project.""


While it is important to state what you are thankful for, avoid the direct mention of money if it is for a donation. Replace specific cash denominations with euphemisms like ""your generosity,"" ""your kindness,"" or ""your generous donation.""

,


When addressing a donor, specify what the donation will enable your company to achieve.
When addressing a potential employer after an interview, you may wish to take this opportunity to reiterate your interest in the position you're applying for. Do not, however, use the thank-you note as an excuse to emphasize why you think you'd be ""perfect for the job."" Instead, choose a tactful approach like ""I appreciated meeting you, and am very excited about the position.""
When addressing a business partner or advisor, saying something like ""It was a pleasure to work with you,"" or ""your advice proved invaluable in pursuing my department's annual goals,"" helps to strengthen a positive relationship and implies an interest in continuing that relationship.

, This can be the most difficult part of a thank-you note, and is not always warranted or necessary. Consider a general statement of praise regarding the recipient or the company he or she represents-- e.g., ""Your work is beautiful,"" or ""your expertise in account management is unparalleled.""

, Here, you may wish to explicitly state your desire to continue business or establish a longstanding relationship with the recipient. When addressing a potential employer, this is a good opportunity to express confidence in your anticipation of his or her decision. This can be achieved by simply saying ""I look forward to hearing from you."", This needn't require more than a simple sentence, restating your opening thanks (but in different words). ""Thanks again for…"" should do it.

, In most instances, it will be most appropriate to close your note with some variation of ""Best regards,"" ""Yours truly,"" or ""Sincerely."" Even if your letter is typed, always sign your name in pen. When appropriate, include your title or position and the company you represent beneath your name.

, Depending on circumstances, the finished product should be short and relatively simple (about half of a type-written page at most). If it seems lengthy, check for any unnecessary redundancies-- with the exception of the thank-you itself, each point should only be stated once. Check also that your tone remains consistent throughout. It may be a good idea to enlist one or two other people to proofread for spelling or grammatical errors, as even minor errors can send a negative impression to the addressee.

, Again, time is of the essence-- the more prompt you are, the more memorable your overall impression will be.

Was the product defective? If so, the merchant should give you a refund.
Was the product not as advertised? If so, you should get a refund.
Did you simply change your mind? If so, then whether you get a refund will depend on the store’s policies.However, in the U.K., you have up to 14 days to change your mind if you purchased something online or over the phone., Call up the business or visit and tell them that you are unhappy with the product or service. If necessary, you can send an email instead of calling on the phone.Don’t delay, since some retailers have time limits on returns (e.g., 14 days).Be clear with your complaint. State why you are unhappy. For example, you can say, “This coffee pot doesn’t work.”
Also state you want a refund. The company might try to give you something else, such as store credit, if you aren’t clear.
Realize that the first person you speak to might not be able to help you. Chances are they are reading from a script and have limited authority to give refunds.

, Ask to speak with a supervisor if a clerk can’t help you.Politely tell the clerk, “Is there someone else can I speak with?” Wait patiently for the clerk to get the supervisor or manager.


Explain again that you want a refund and why. Be consistent with your story. Don’t tell one person one thing and then tell another person something else.
When you complain, be as brief as possible. Longer stories sound suspicious.
Write down the name of every person you speak to and provide a short summary of what they tell you.

, Nevertheless, you should remain firm in your convictions. Remind yourself: “I have the right to quality service” and don’t let a “No” scare you away.


Avoid personal insults or any complaint that you spend a lot of money at the store. Staff is unlikely to take you seriously, and you may be escorted from the premises.

Calm yourself, if necessary. It helps to remember that the clerk you talk with probably would like to help you but doesn’t have the power.
If possible, try to show empathy to the person on the other end of the phone. You can say something like, “I bet you’ve had plenty of people complain today.” The clerk may see you as a friend and go the extra mile for you.You might strike out and not get a refund. If so, thank the person you have spoken with and plan your next move.

, Your rights will depend on the law where you purchased the item. Before going any further, you should analyze whether you have a right to the refund. Consider the following:Did the store have a return policy? It should have been clearly stated, either on a sign in the store or on your receipt. Check to make sure. Some retailers won’t allow returns unless the item is defective.
Does your law allow the seller to provide the service again instead of giving a refund? This is the law in the U.K. unless it’s impossible to provide the service again, or it would take too long or otherwise be inconvenient.Is there a warranty? If so, take it out and read whether the defect is covered by the warranty.
Does your state have automatic warranties? In the U.S., every product you buy is guaranteed to work as you would expect it to. Also, it must work as promised if you bought it for a particular purpose.
Did the seller disclaim warranties? For example, they may have sold the goods “as is.” If so, you might not have the right to a refund, depending on your state.
Did the seller lie to you? This is very different than purchasing defective goods or inadequate services. When someone lies, they have committed fraud and you can sue for any financial injury you have suffered.

, If you can’t get help over the phone or in person, you should write a letter to the business. Remember to get to the point. If you have the legal right to a refund, mention it in the letter.


In the U.S., the Federal Trade Commission has a sample letter you can use. It is available here: https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/blog/how-write-effective-complaint-letter.
In the U.K., you should use a sample letter provided by Citizens Advice, which is available here: https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/consumer/template-letters/letters/problems-with-services/letter-to-complain-about-the-poor-standard-of-a-service/. This letter is for services or goods you purchased after October 1, 2015.
If you live in a different country, remember to include the following information in your complaint letter: details about the purchase (date, amount, etc.), why you are unhappy, and what you want (a full refund).
When you mail your letter, request a signed receipt. Always keep a copy of the letter for your records.

, You might need to notify the person who manufactured the product. You can find the phone number on the product’s packaging or on the receipt. You might also need to go online to check the number.Tell the manufacturer what is wrong with the item and when you purchased it. Also ask for a full refund.

, If you paid with a credit or charge card, you should contact the company and tell them what happened. You may be able to get a “chargeback.” In effect, a chargeback undoes a credit card transaction. Generally, you must meet the following requirements:The charge must be for more than $50.
You must have bought the item in the state where you live or within 100 miles of your mailing address.Larger credit card issuers will waive both of the above requirements.
Call up your credit card company (or visit online) immediately. You can’t get a chargeback once you pay your bill.

, The business might be willing to attend mediation. In mediation, you meet with a mediator, who is a neutral third party who listens to both sides. The mediator doesn’t act as a judge. Instead, they guide the discussion and try to get each side to compromise.If you would like to mediate the dispute, then mention this fact in your complaint letter to the company.
Your Attorney General’s Office might have a mediation program you can use.Check their website.

, Arbitration is like a trial. Each side presents information to an arbitrator instead of a judge, who decides the case. The TV show “Judge Judy” is arbitration, though she dresses up like a judge (and used to be a judge in real life). The business might be willing to arbitrate the dispute.


Typically, you sign an agreement to arbitrate. As part of the agreement, you waive any right to bring a lawsuit or appeal the arbitrator’s decision.
You might have already agreed to arbitrate a dispute when you purchased the product or service. Check your receipt and other paperwork that you received. Look for any arbitration or dispute provision.

, Each state has a small claims court which hears cases for a low dollar amount. The dollar limit varies, depending on the state. For example, Alaska has a $10,000 limit, whereas Arkansas has a $5,000 limit.Small claims courts are ideal for people who don’t have a lawyer. Typically, the process is streamlined and you can use pre-printed forms for court filings.
If you have a big claim against a business, you should consider suing in regular civil court. Contact a lawyer to discuss your options. Civil court cases can be drawn out, but you can win more money.

, Complain to the BBB in the city where the merchant does business. You can find the address by visiting the BBB website here: https://www.bbb.org/. Search for the business by name.


Provide details about the dispute. BBB will send a copy of your complaint to the business. Your complaint will also be posted on the BBB website.
You can’t complain anonymously. Instead, you must provide your name, address, phone number, and other contact information. For this reason, always use appropriate language in your complaint.

, Your state or city may have a consumer protection agency. These agencies investigate consumer complaints and can enforce an violation of consumer protection laws.You can find your nearest agency by visiting this website: https://www.usa.gov/state-consumer. Select your state from the drop-down box.
The agency can sue or bring another enforcement action against the retailer.

, If someone committed fraud, then you should complain to your state’s Attorney General’s office. You can find the phone number online. There may also be an online complaint form.The Attorney General won’t represent you in a lawsuit. However, they can investigate the business and bring an enforcement action if necessary.
The Attorney General also shares information with other enforcement agencies so that they can find and catch scammers.

, Many agencies gather information on fraud. You should file complaints with as many as necessary. For example, consider contacting the following:Federal Trade Commission. You can report scams using the FTC’s Complaint Assistant.econsumer.gov. You can report international Internet fraud to this website: https://www.econsumer.gov/en/Home/FileAComplaint/1#crnt.
IC3. The Internet Crime Complaint Center accepts complaints about Internet fraud. Either the victim or a third party can file a complaint."

, If you do write your address or phone number, write alongside it something like, ""Please do not sell or distribute my information, nor add to mailing lists."" It's generally not necessary to send in warranty cards or ""register"" a warranty for the warranty to be valid, regardless of what the card may imply.

, Some items are sent in such bulk that they go to every resident on a postal route. These are addressed to ""Resident,"" ""Our Friends At,"" or some variant. Your postal carrier cannot, by law, determine what you consider ""junk mail"". All ""resident"" mail must be delivered as addressed. You must contact individual mailers to have your address removed from their database. Look around on mailers for return addresses and phone numbers. Here are quick links to some common ones.


ADVO is responsible for the blobs of sales circulars and the little card with the missing children.
Call sweepstakes mailers like Publisher's Clearinghouse (phone 1-800-645-9242 or email mailto:service@pchmail.com) with your full address and instructions to remove from mailing list. American Family Sweepstakes is another common solicitor of this type (phone 1-800-237-2400).
Pennysaver, Potpourri, and Redplum.The online form does require a valid email address, but the confirmation requires no reply, so if you are concerned about your privacy, you can use a service such as Mailinator. You can also mail the entire back label with a request to be removed to 2830 Orbiter Street, Brea CA 92821-6224. Their circulation message listing these details can be reached at 1-800-422-4116, but it is a recorded message. Mail suppression of this publication is good for one year and they do not honor mail removal requests from third parties.

, Many companies target specific areas based on neighborhood subdivisions or home values. By making your information confidential in the county and state databases you may eliminate quite a bit of junk mail.

, If you do business with a company via mail services, it will put you on its contact list. So the first time you make a transaction (such as placing an order) with that company, ask to be put on its ""in-house suppress"" or ""do not promote"" lists. Tell the company not to ""rent"" or share your name with other companies.

, Free papers and handbills are another form of unsolicited advertising that often plagues our front lawns, but most are not delivered through the mail. Many of the people who deliver free papers will simply stop once the resident has placed a sign near their mailbox that reads ""No Free Papers."" In the USA, it is illegal for anyone other than the letter carrier to put things in your mailbox.

, They're not junk mail, but it does require paper and resources to mail them. Many businesses and banks now offer electronic notifications, which will significantly reduce unnecessary mail clutter.

, If you've moved recently, the mail can take a while to catch up with you. Make sure you call the USPS or fill out the online form to keep your address current.


Often, changing your address will reenlist you in various solicitation mailers you've previously opted out of. You may have to re-do them if you start getting mailers you've canceled.
You should not receive mail if the mail or the accompanying card is not addressed to you, but some bulk sales circulars may continue arriving on ""auto-pilot"" after you have canceled them. Remind your letter carrier politely that this matter is not addressed to you.

, If you are getting first class mail for a former resident, you can write Return to Sender/Not at this address on the envelope and drop that envelope back in the mailbox.

, Mail a copy of the death certificate to each of them:Equifax P.O. Box 105069 Atlanta, GA 30348
Experian P.O. Box 9530 Allen, TX 75013
TransUnion P.O. Box 6790 Fullerton, CA 92634

, This will halt the flow of most junk mail to someone who is deceased. Use the Deceased Do Not Contact Form.Follow the instructions through the entire process, and be certain to verify the registration after you receive the email.

, Sometimes it will be the same toll-free number that you would call to make an order; sometimes it will be a separate ""customer service"" number. Look around on the back cover and the order form.


Call the university recruitment office and cancel the flyers. Whether you're a prospective student or you've long since graduated, these recruitment materials can be a pain. The best way to stop them is by calling the university recruitment office and requesting it be cancelled.
If you are a high school student already getting recruitment literature from universities, ask your counselor to help set things straight for you.

, Occasionally, the customer service people will ask why you want to be removed. Simply explain that you are not interested in the products offered or that you're not planning on attending this university. Be kind, but firm.


Have the catalog, or at least the mailing label from it handy when you call. Often they will request a tracking number or other code printed there.

, Many catalog and mail-order companies offer opt-outs on their websites. If you prefer the convenience of a web form, look around the catalog or the company's website and you will often find one.

, Many schools get your information when you take the PSAT, SAT, ACT, or other standardized test. When you sign up for such standardized tests, read the form carefully. Likewise, many mail-order businesses, especially printing houses that print checks and personalized stationery, often send other mail and sell the addresses of their customers. Read carefully when filling out any form to make sure you're not agreeing to receive catalogs.


CollegeBoard, the organization behind the PSAT, SAT, and AP tests, states that their ""Student Search Service"" program is voluntary . ACT states in their privacy policy that you have a choice of whether to receive communications in excess of the required ones., Generally, credit card companies purchases information from credit reporting agencies. These lists generally consist of people pre-approved for a credit card based on a particular criteria determined by the credit company.


These criteria are not, however, the same to determine whether or not you'll be approved for the credit card eventually, so often the ""pre-approved"" tag is somewhat misleading.
Make sure you're not agreeing to any mailing lists when if you use a credit agency to receive a credit report or a credit score.

, This one phone call tells all four major credit reporting agencies, including Equifax, Innovis, TransUnion, and Experian, to stop sending credit card offers. Listen to the options carefully on this automated number to opt-out for up to 5 years. You can also request to be permanently removed from their lists.


You can also also make the request using their online form at https://www.optoutprescreen.com/opt_form.cgi


, Even if they come with your bill each month, cash advances usually start accruing interest immediately, so it's not a good idea to use them. If you do receive them and don't plan to use them, you should destroy them.

, The credit agency databases are consistently updated. Cross-referencing of the credit lists will also cause these solicitations to snowball. If you move or receive a credit score, these solicitations may start up again even if you've expressly canceled them. So don't wait, take action as soon as you start receiving unwanted credit solicitations.

, If you live in a larger city, you may get phone books from multiple carriers during a single year. To stop them, or to receive only the one book you prefer to use, follow them to their source. Many have opt-out pages online now.

, Most yellow pages phone numbers are available online, so the best option for you might be opting out entirely. To opt out of a variety of phone books at once, go to Yellow Pages Opt Out at http://yellowpagesoptout.org/. Once you create an account, you should see a selection of phone books for your area. You can choose which ones you wish not to receive. Verizon/Superpages and Dex both use Yellow Pages Opt Out as their opting out service.

, Most printed phone directories may be recycled with your regular paper recycling. They're also good for starting campfires or charcoal grills.

Mail your letter.",How to Address a Letter to an Embassy," Handwritten letters are hard to read, and may not get any response. If you want your letter to be read and taken seriously, it's important to type it neatly using a recognized business letter format.Use a standard word-processing application, even if you plan to deliver the letter using email. It typically is better to send an attachment than to write your letter in the body of an email. However, you should probably check with the embassy first to see what is preferred.
Most word-processing applications have a template that you can use to create a business letter. These templates typically will set your margins and paragraph styles for you.
Use a standard, readable font such as Times New Roman or Helvetica, in a 12-point size. Do not use script fonts. #Search for templates. In most cases, you'll be writing to the embassy regarding an immigration issue – either on your own behalf or for a friend or family member. There are a number of immigration assistance websites that have letter templates for various issues.These templates give you suggested language to use so you can more easily write and address your letter. Don't copy them verbatim, though. Read them carefully and make sure the suggested language suits your situation. If any of it doesn't apply, don't include it.
Look into the background of the website before you use their suggested language. Most of these websites have an ""about"" page where you can find out who is in charge of the website. Make sure it's an individual or organization you can trust.

, Traditional business letters are written in single-spaced, left-justified paragraphs with a double space between paragraphs. Using a double-space means you don't have to indent the first line of each paragraph.If you're writing in a language that is read from right to left, such as Arabic or Hebrew, your paragraphs would be right-justified.

, The first line that you type will be the date that you are sending the letter. Your word-processing program may automatically insert the date if you're using a template. If you don't plan on mailing your letter for a few days, you'll need to adjust this date to reflect the date of mailing.Generally, you shouldn't worry if you end up being a day off. For example, you could finish your letter intending to mail it that day, but not make it to the post office until after the close of business. That would mean you'd have to mail your letter the next day, but you wouldn't have to print up a new letter with the different date.
However, while delaying a day or two is fine, if you end up not being able to mail the letter for a week or longer, you probably want to print a fresh copy with an adjusted date. Your reader will expect the date on the letter to be identical or close to the date of the postmark.

, The top of your letter will include an area for you to write your own name and address, then the name and address of the person to whom you're writing. Call the embassy or check its website to learn the address to which you should mail your letter.Keep in mind that many larger embassies will have different addresses for you to use depending on the reason for your letter.
If you don't already know, you'll also need to find out the correct person to address who can help you with your issue. Internet sites, such as Project Visa or Embassy World, as well as Internet searches for the country and the word ""embassy"" can help you identify the right person. You also can call the embassy directly to identify the best contact.
Type the name of the person you are addressing, the name of the embassy and the address of the embassy to which you are writing. Write this in the same format as you would write it on an envelope for mailing.
For example, if you're writing to an embassy staff member at the Canadian embassy, you would write ""Mr. Potter, Canadian Embassy"" on the first line of the address block, followed by the physical address. If Mr. Potter is the ambassador, you would write ""The Honorable Mr. Potter, Ambassador of Canada, Canadian Embassy."" Note that for many countries the correct title for an ambassador is ""Excellency,"" as in ""His Excellency Mr. Potter, Ambassador of Canada, Canadian Embassy.""

, Following the addresses, include a line that lets the recipient of your letter know why you are writing and what the letter is about. You don't have to include your name in the subject line, and it doesn't have to be a full sentence.For example, you might write ""Request for tourist visa for parents"" or ""Invitation to French Consulate party.""
If you're writing in English, the subject line typically is preceded by the letters ""RE,"" a Latin abbreviation that essentially means ""regarding.""
Your subject line enables the person who receives your letter to direct it to the right member of embassy staff, in the event that you've sent it to the wrong person. With a subject line, they can do this quickly without having to read the whole letter. For this reason, a subject line is particularly important if you haven't been able to identify a specific person.

, Different countries have their own formalities and diplomatic protocol for addressing ambassadors and other members of embassy staff.You may be able to find this information on the embassy's website, or by doing a quick internet search using the country's name with words such as ""etiquette,"" ""diplomatic protocol"" or ""forms of address.""
Keep in mind that in countries that have a monarchy and recognize nobility, there may be nobles who serve as ambassadors or in other embassy positions. These titles may supersede any general title for members of embassy staff.
Your letter should be written in a formal tone, using the utmost in politeness and courtesy. If you're writing in a language that has a formal ""you,"" such as French or Spanish, you should use that.
Pay careful attention when writing to the ambassador specifically, as the title differs depending on whether you are a citizen of the country for which the individual is serving as an ambassador. If you are a citizen of the same country as the ambassador, you may address them as ""The Honorable."" However, if you are a citizen of a different country, you typically must call them ""Her Excellency,"" following diplomatic custom.Make sure you have the correct gender – don't just assume based on the name.

, After you've finished the address blocks and subject line of your letter, you're ready to begin the letter itself. Use a formal greeting and address the person to whom you're writing by their full title.To address the person correctly, you'll need to follow the correct etiquette or diplomatic protocol based on your research.
If you're addressing the consul general or any other embassy employee, you'll generally use their full name. For example, you might write ""Dear Mr. Potter."" However, pay attention to any other titles the person might have, such as if they are a member of the nobility or have a doctorate.
Use ""Dear Honorable Ambassador"" if you are addressing the ambassador directly.
If you don't know the name or gender of the person to whom you're writing, you can begin your letter ""Dear Sir or Madam."" However, you should make every effort to address your letter to a specific person. If you get the wrong person, it can always be rerouted.
Follow the greeting with the punctuation customary in the embassy's country. In some, a comma is appropriate, while others follow the greeting with a colon.

, Double-space after your greeting and being your letter by letting the receiver know who you are. Include any identification information necessary, such as any application numbers or reference numbers that are related to the subject of your letter.The first sentence should state your name and your country of citizenship. Follow that with any additional identification information that is relevant to your reason for writing.
Follow the first sentence with a brief description of your reason for writing. This should be no longer than a sentence or two.

, In the remaining paragraphs of your letter, you will elaborate on the background of your case, including any information the recipient will need to properly respond to your letter.The length of your letter, and the contents of the remaining paragraphs, will depend on your reason for writing. If you need to give an extended background or timeline of a situation to which you want the ambassador or another embassy official to respond, this may be lengthy.
If you're writing for a procedural reason, such as to request a visitor visa, your letter typically shouldn't be more than three paragraphs long, and shouldn't go for more than a page or two at most.
Keep your writing clear and concise, and use formal language throughout. If you address the person to whom you're writing anywhere in the body of your letter, use their official title and follow any other rules of etiquette you gleaned from your research.

, The final paragraph of your letter typically is only a sentence or two that tells the recipient what action you want them to take in response to your letter. If you expect a response within a certain time frame, it should be mentioned here.If you need something specific from the person, state what that is and the timeframe within which you need it. Remember to allow for time for mailing.
Be careful giving a deadline, particularly if you're writing to the ambassador or a higher-ranking staff member. Instead of making a demand, say something like ""Please be advised that I must have the document I requested within one month or I'll not be able to complete my application,"" or ""Please respond by the end of this month so I can meet my deadline.""
Follow that with a sentence thanking the recipient for their time and attention. For example, you might write ""I appreciate that you have many demands on your time. Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.""
If you are unsure whether you sent your letter to the correct person, you may want to include a note to that effect. For example, you might write ""If there is someone else at the embassy better capable of handling my issue, I ask that you kindly forward this letter to them.""

, When you've finished writing your letter, proofread it carefully and correct any typographical errors and mistakes in grammar or punctuation. You may want to read your letter out loud to make sure it reads easily.End your letter with a closing greeting such as ""Sincerely yours,"" and leave a few blank lines for your signature. Below that, type your name and address, along with any other identification or contact information you think is necessary, such as your phone number or email address.
If you're including any other documents with your letter, list them at the bottom of your letter so the reader knows what attachments to expect. You also can use this list as a checklist for yourself to make sure you've included everything necessary.
Print your final letter and sign it using a pen with blue or black ink. Check the date on your letter before you send it and make sure you don't need to adjust it forward.
When you've signed your letter, make a copy of the signed letter for your own records.

, If there are any additional documents that you need to include with your letter, make copies of them. Find out if you are expected to send originals or if copies will suffice. If you must send originals, make a copy for your own records before you send the document.If you're sending original documents, it's generally best to use a larger manilla envelope that will allow you to mail them without folding them.
For copies, use a standard letter-sized envelope unless you have more than three or four sheets, in which case it's generally better to use a larger manilla envelope and leave them flat rather than folding them.
Mark each copy or document carefully in case they get separated from each other.

, Once you have everything in an envelope, you'll need to make a trip to the post office to ensure you have correct postage on the letter and have formatted the address correctly, particularly if you are mailing it to a foreign country.Include your name and the return address on the envelope. This will be written either on the back of the envelope or on the upper-right-hand corner, depending on the country's custom.
The name and address of your recipient should be written in the middle or lower-right portion of the envelope, again depending on the country's custom. Use the recipient's formal title if applicable.
You may want to wait until you get to the post office to address your envelope, or research formatting ahead of time.
If you're handwriting the addresses on the envelope, use a ballpoint pen so the ink won't smear, and print carefully or write in all caps. Don't write in cursive or script on the envelope, as it is difficult to read.

Clean everywhere!,
The hallway.,
Be sure to clean the living/family room.,
Clean the kitchen.,
Be sure the dining room is clean.,
Don't forget your bedroom.,
Definitely don't forget the bathroom.",How to Clean Your House for a Sleepover," Even though you may be in your bedroom all night, you will leave it eventually, and your house needs to look clean; no one wants to stay in a dirty place all night! If any rooms are strictly 'out of bounds', like your parents room or an office, then don't worry about that, just keep the doors to them rooms closed.;
, It's the first place your guests are going to see, it needs to be inviting! You will need to:


Hoover - people walk in and out of your hallway all day, so this might take some time.
Polish anywhere - some people have surfaces in their hallways, or vases, make sure all flowers are fresh and there is no dust lying about.
Tidy away any clutter - the most common clutter you are going to get around the hall is shoes, put them in your wardrobe, or on a shoe rack, just make sure they're put away tidily.

, It's normally the place families spend most of their time, so make it look cozy and clean!


Hoover - again if you have pets or a family member with dirt shoes, your carpet could look dirty and smelly. If you have wooden floors, then wash them! Vacuum your carpet and put baking soda or cornstarch to get rid of smells and stains.
Polish - polish all surfaces, and photo frames, if you have family albums, and the television screen and multimedia players.
De-clutter - make sure everything is looking neat and tidy, all living rooms are different, but make sure all wires are not visible, laptops are safely out of the way, and anything else is neat, arrange photo albums, and stack up any DVD's and music cases.
Last touches - if you have a reclining sofa or chair, make sure that it's pushed in and not in the way, and close all the entrances, closed doors will add to a neater feeling.

, This can be a hard place to clean, considering your family could be making stuff all day! Just make sure you clean this room about an hour before. How dirty can one room get in an hour?


Wash the floors - kitchen floors can get mucky easily, so clean them up sweep up and food or clutter.
Clean surfaces - clean all the surfaces around your kitchen, if you have a stove get an adult to clean that, because it could still be hot, and you don't want to burn yourself!
Clean away mess - personally we have a lot of clutter around like mail, and keys, keep this as minimal as you can, and put away and food items

, This is where you and your guests are going to eat, you really don't want it to be dirty!


Hoover or wash the floors - again, everyone will see your floor so it must be clean!
Wash and polish the dining room table - if people are going to have food here, it needs to be spotless.
Clean the place mats - just give them a wipe over with a damp cloth, and dry of.
Wash cutlery - do the washing up! Clean all your glasses, and mugs (in case people want some hot chocolate later) and plates, also wash knives, forks and spoons.
The computer room / office - if you don't have a laptop, and you and your friends are allowed, clean the office.
Hoover - yes, yes, hoover will be on every one!
Polish surfaces - make sure you keep all the important paperwork in the same place!
Clean the computer - wipe down the computer screen, keyboard, mouse, and printer ( if you have one.)

, It's the place your most likely to stay all night, so make it look good!


Hoover - again with the hoovering!
Polish - polish anywhere, and everywhere, making sure all photo-frames, and laptops are dust-free!
Clean your bed-sheets - keep these smelling fresh, and make sure your bed is made!
Keep the curtains open, and let in light.
De-clutter - if you're a teenager, the chances are your room won't be that tidy, but make sure it is! You need a place to hang-out with your friends and if there is mess about, space will be taken up, put away clothes, shoes, and general clutter, including your dirty laundry out of sight!

, Chances are a guest will need the bathroom at some point, so make sure it's crystal clean in there!


Floors - you know what I am going to say ... wash the floors!
Wash everywhere - clean the toilet, shower, bath and sink, and polish the mirrors!
Keep sanitation items neat - keep these in groups, or in your cabinets, also you might want to get anything embarrassing out of sight!
Finishing touches - keep the toilet seat down, and the bathroom door closed all the time.

Games and Activities:


Bobbing for apples.,
Treats 'n Guts- Fill a bucket with slimy foods to represent body parts.,
Tell scary stories.,
Go all out with decorations.,
Dress your brother up in your clothes.",How to Have a Fun Halloween Sleepover (for Girls)," They shouldn't mind much. Explain you won't keep them up all night and you won't be a bother to them. You might think this is pointless, but if you put yourself in their shoes, it wouldn't be too good trying to sleep with a bunch of racket coming from the room next door.;
, You should only invite up to four or five, but a lot of the time, it can be easier for your parents and more fun for you if you keep it at two to three girls. Also, if you plan on doing any partner activities, invite an even number of friends so no one is left out.

, Use black paper as a backing and cover the main text paper with tea and put it in the oven. Burn holes in it if you wish. This will give it a spooky, old look. Wrap your invite in the fake cobweb you can get in places like Tesco and, if you live in the US, Walmart will probably sell them. Add a couple of spiders for a real effect.

, Try mixing drinks like Fanta and Cherry Ale with Coke and Lemonade. Add an ice hand to make a bit of a stir. Look in the recipe book ""Roald Dahl's Book Of Revolting Recipes"" for more recipes. Serve sweets if you don't want to go trick or treating - but trick or treating is a great way to fill time at a sleepover, and for most people is a tradition. When you return, spill all your treats on your bedroom floor. High sugar levels are good for you at sleepovers but not so good for parents. Don't get too hyper.


Prepare ghoulish Halloween food. The Internet has many ideas for Halloween treats. Make a bloody punch with a hand floating in it. Make a cake that looks like a graveyard. Serve big bowls of bloody spaghetti guts. Display your food with flickering candlelight and a decorated table.

, Get enough large bowls of water for each guest to have their own. Put apples in each bowl of water, whoever first gets all the apples out of their bowl using their mouth, wins.

Prank call people but don't overdo it.
Watch scary age-appropriate movies.
Play with a Ouija board.
Get one of your parents to jump out on your friends.
Have a costume contest.
Tell spooky ghost stories outside or with all the lights out in the room when it gets dark.
Liver Toss- Put guests into pairs. Fill up a water balloon for each pair. Have each pair throw their water balloon to their partner. The last pair that didn't pop their balloon wins a prize.
HALLOWEEN Words- Give each guest a piece of paper with the word HALLOWEEN on top. Each person makes as many words using the letters in Halloween. After time is up whoever has the most words wins.

, Put prizes at the bottom, and have the children try to find the prize.


Pass along Jack- This game is like Hot Potato, but with a small pumpkin.
Pin the Nose on Jack- This game is like Pin the Tail on the Donkey, but instead you are pinning the nose on a paper Jack-o-Lantern.
Mummy Wrap- Put the guest in pairs. Have each pair use toilet paper to wrap up their partner. Their partner's body must be completely covered with T.P. except for their eyes and nose. The ""Mummy"" must then be unwrapped by their partner and that person must be wrapped and unwrapped the same way. The 1st pair to complete this process wins a prize.
Sno-caps- Each person gets a straw and a cup. Everyone gets in a circle around a plate in the middle. The host pours Sno-caps on the plate. Everyone rolls a die and tries to get a 6. If a person gets a 6, she tries to pick up as much Sno-caps as she can with her straw and puts them in her cup until another person rolls a 6. That person repeats the process. The process repeats until all of the Sno-caps run out. The person with the most wins a prize.
Shadow Puppets
Psychiatrist- One person is chosen as the psychiatrist. The psychiatrist goes into another room. The rest of the guests agree on their ""problem"", such as, they think their elderly people with chickens on their heads. The people with the problem act like they have it, and the ""psychiatrist"" is called into the room with the rest of the people. The psychiatrist has to figure out what the problem is.
Apple Race- The guests get on their hands and knees and push an apple with their nose to the finish line. The person who gets their first wins a prize.
Bobbing 4 Worms- Cover gummy worms with a lot of whipped cream, and have the guests find their gummy worm without using their hands. The first person to find their gummy worm wins a prize.
Guess the Number of Candy Corn
Ghost Bingo- Bingo, but with Halloween characters
Halloween Character Charades
Halloween Who am I?- The Game Who am I?, but with Halloween characters
Halloween Hangman- Hangman, but with Halloween items/characters.
Piñata
Scavenger Hunt

",How to Have a Birthday Sleepover at a Hotel," It's up to your parents if throwing a hotel slumber party is in their budget. It's a good idea to have your parents sleep in the room next to you and your friends. Getting an adjoining room would be a good choice.;
, There are so many themes to choose from. Themes can be pretty much anything; from TV shows to Winter. If none of these appeal to you, go to a local party store and try to find an idea, or choose a color scheme.

, One with a pool would be a good thing to look for, so at the beginning of the party, or when it starts to get boring, you could head for the pool and the sauna.(an inside pool is really fun)

, Pick your BFF's first, then add who ever else you want, unless you want to be exclusive, then only invite your best friends. You could also have a pool party with a lot of people and only have select people stay over. If you are planning on doing that, make sure that you keep it to a small number(3 or 4) so no one's feelings get hurt.

, Be creative! Designing your own invitations is a lot of fun! It shows your creativity & you can make it special for the theme of your party! If you choose not to make them on your own, store-bought invites will work too, especially for young ones. Or you can e-mail the invites. You could also hand out invitations and send reminders via e-mail to those who have not yet responded. And make sure to add the hotel name, and number of the room your staying in, and everything they should bring, including CD's they may want to listen too, and bathing suits if you have a hotel with a pool.Make sure to have the pick-up time at least a half-hour before check-out time, so you can take off the decorations. Also make sure to tell them that the pick-up time is sharp! You don't want your guests to be waiting in the hallway until their parents get there!

, Send them at least 3 weeks ahead of time, so everyone will be free on that day. Send invites in the mail, if they have email, then email them, or hand them out.

, The décor can/should relate to your party theme. Don't put up decorations that you don't expect to clean up though. Confetti can be iffy. If you are willing to pick it up, you say it's okay, but you would have to talk to the hotel before making this choice.

, For this topic you could also plan it according to your theme, or you could just have a traditional birthday party meal (pizza, soda, candy, etc.). If you have a color scheme, get foods in that color! Also try to plan it around your friends allergies and food preferences. You don't want your friends to starve because they don't like or cannot have what is being served.

, You could buy goody bags at the store, or buy some plain, small tote bags and jazz them up! Include things having to do with your party theme. If you have a color scheme, buy cute little items in that color.

, Your guests may want to bring games with them, it they would like. You can have games like,Wii, watch movies, dance to music, play flash light tag, tell scary stories,and play games according to your theme, and traditional party games.

, Move all tables to the walls, so you have space for dancing and games. Pick a table (or bring one that you can carry) to use for snacks. Dress-up the snacks by putting them in tall glass bowls, and on fancy trays. You can put a tablecloth on the table that relates to your theme.

, When guests arrive, put all bags in the closet so they are out of the way. Put on some cool music. If you are going straight to the pool, put on swimsuits and get towels. If there is a small amount of people, have them put pillows and blankets on the bed or side of the bed the are sleeping on.

, Dance, eat,swim in the pool, watch movies, and have fun! And order room service (if your parents give you their permission)!

, Eating breakfast at the hotel is kind of cool, since many hotels have continental breakfast (free breakfast) with many choices.

Keep in contact with the boys’ parents.",How to Host a Sleepover (for Boys)," Your son should have some input of course, but be careful not to let him invite too many boys, or to invite any boys you know to be troublesome. Be sure to have all of the boys’ contact information so you can talk to their parents beforehand and make sure they’re comfortable spending the night.;
, Ideally sleepovers should happen on a Friday or Saturday night. Friday can be good because the boys will be tired from a day full of school and might actually get some sleep. Keep in mind some families might have obligations for religious or sporting events, and expect their sons back early in the morning. Begin the sleepover at a reasonable time. For example, start with dinner around 6:00 PM so the boys will have ample time for fun and still go to bed an appropriate hour, usually midnight or 1 AM at the latest.

, If there are other younger siblings, you might ask a relative to host them overnight so they are not overwhelmed by the activities of their brother and his friends. Try putting younger siblings to bed early in case they try and pester the sleepover guests.

, As a host you are responsible to provide food for your son's guests. Always ascertain what dietary restrictions the boys may have so you can plan food accordingly and make sure everyone has snacks they can enjoy.


Ask your kid what he would especially like, and go shopping together once you have a plan.
Finger foods and dry foods are encouraged as you can easily clean up with a vacuum. For example: popcorn, pretzels, chips, crackers, etc.
Make or order a dinner that they'll eat at the table but which is easy to serve and clean up. Use paper plates if you can. Pizza is a great example of an easy dinner.
Consider healthy options. Consider ordering a thin-crust pizza with cheese and spinach, or serve up homemade sweet potato fries instead of fast food.Serve a simple and easy breakfast before you get them out the door: cereal, muffins, bagels, etc.

, Know before the sleepover if they will be picked up or you will drop them off or both. See if any of the boys live close to each other so you can arrange carpooling options. Some parents may be late in picking up their child, so make sure to make them feel welcome while they wait.

, When you come up with a set of clearly defined rules for the sleepover be sure to talk with your son about them to make sure he understands. Ask him if he thinks if the rules are fair and if has any suggestions for additions or alterations to the list.

, After dinner is a good time to talk about rules so they understand boundaries before playing. There are a variety of rules you should consider depending on their ages.


No leaving the house without asking.
No prank phone calls.
Stay in designated areas (this makes for less cleanup the next day).
Mandatory quiet time after a certain hour.
Make it clear that you have zero-tolerance for bullying and teasing. It's one thing to have a playful argument over which movie to watch. It's another to single a boy out and ridicule them. If something like this persists, call the boy's parents and send the bully home early. No inappropriate language or content allowed.

, Make sure you have the supplies to handle sudden medical emergencies or surprise messes. Young children are prone to mishaps so understand the risks involved with hosting a sleepover.


If a guest gets homesick, be ready to call their parents and maybe even have your partner give them a lift home while you keep an eye on things at home.
Bed-wetting. If the unthinkable happens, try to help the boys maintain their dignity (feign a tipped over glass of water, for instance) and show them to the bathroom where they can clean themselves up. You could help them by grabbing a spare set of their clothing from their backpack.
If your son becomes overwhelmed by all the activity, ask him to help you for a moment and give him a good pep talk when you're alone. If this happens a lot, sleepovers might not be the best idea for a while.
Know of any pre-existing medical conditions beforehand. Immediately inform their parents if any guest needs to go to the hospital and be sure to give the doctors as much information about the guest as you can. , You can use the excuse of checking on them to see if they need more snacks, for example. Be sure to allow them enough space to have fun and be themselves.

, This should just a little bit later than their normal bedtimes, but don't be surprised if you have to come back in the middle of the night to settle them down. Give them a little lee-way with their bedtimes but don’t be afraid to be forceful when telling everyone they need to sleep.

, Have a plan of how to structure the evening, but it’s important to ask the boys for feedback. You show the boys respect and compassion by including them on the conversation of what to do. Don’t be too obsessive and remember that your son's guests already know what keep them entertained.

, This is ideal for younger sleepover guests, but there are a plethora of board games that are fitting for older guests as well. A board game is also ideal because it gives you a chance to have fun with the guests.


Have an assortment of family-friendly (but not too childish, if they boys are reaching the ages of ten or more) and fun games for the boys to choose from. Sorry, Operation, Scategories, and Youth Trivial Pursuit are all acceptable options. Some boys may be into more strategy-based games such as Risk or Settlers of Catan. See if the sleepover group has any interest in these games and consider purchasing some for the sleepover.
Make sure they clean up one game themselves before starting the next.
Offer prizes in the form of small snacks for the ""winners"" of a game if you like.

, It can be hard to find a good craft boys will enjoy depending on their age, but it is possible. Crafts can also be a great way to teach the boys something practical and creative instead of just consuming television or video game programming.


Teach them how to make origami. Origami is an excellent craft they can take home as well.
Small boys may enjoy making costumes out of paper, such as knight's armor and weaponry.
Keep coloring books on hand with an array of crayons. Try to choose interesting coloring books like those based around animals or landscapes.
Print out monster mouths and try to see who can make the scariest monster sounds.
If you’re at a loss for ideas, search for arts and crafts websites that are geared towards children. , This is an excellent option for keeping guests entertained with little effort on your part. Talk to your son before the sleepover to get a handle on what sorts of movies the guests will enjoy.


Choose a few movies that would be acceptable for everyone there to watch (keep in mind other families' rules and beliefs and so forth). Let them pick one to three of them, depending on how long they are and how much time they have available before lights-out.
Put out enough pillows, blankets, and chairs so everyone has a place to relax and enjoy the movies.

, Depending on the boys' age, this can be an indoor or outdoor sleepover theme. Keep the indoor option handy in case weather doesn’t permit an outdoor sleeping option.


If necessary, provide some heavy-duty sleeping bags and tents (outdoors only).
Lead the boys in singing some traditional campfire sing-alongs. Make s’mores, either over a campfire (supervised!) or in the microwave. Lead the boys in telling not-too-scary ghost stories around the fire, or with flashlights indoors.
Check on them in the middle of the night, especially if they are camping out in the backyard.

, This one will especially be popular with older boys in their teenage years. There are a number of considerations you need to make when choosing video games to ensure the selections are both fun and age appropriate. Pick a few video games that all the boys are allowed to play when they are each at home. It's important to respect each family's individual rules.
Pick games that can accommodate two or more players at a time. Make sure you have as many controllers as necessary.
Make sure everyone gets a turn to play if there are more guests than video game controllers.
If one boy complains of being left out or of not being able to play a game he likes, mandate a change in the way things are going. Alternately, you can offer the ultimatum that the sleepover will quickly turn into a movie night or something else.
Boys can get wound up playing video games. Make them switch to another more relaxing activity a half hour or more before bedtime, such as watching a movie or show, storytelling, playing a board game, etc.

, Leave out some comic books and snacks or something of that nature to keep them occupied without waking you or the other boys up too early. Put on some quiet, early morning television so the early birds are easily subdued and entertained.

, After the sleepover you could be left with an intimidating mess. It's important to include the boys in the clean-up in a way that's fun to encourage responsibility and reduce the time you spend cleaning alone.


Make sure everyone has their belongings packed. Ask the boys which shoes, clothes, toiletries, etc are theirs and then make sure they are all packed with the right person.
Try to make it fun by offering small candy bars or other snacks for the boys who finish cleaning up the quickest. Get creative and think of other ways to incentivize clean-up time.
Intervene and show them the proper way to clean if they're confused. For example, show them how to correctly fold clothes, make beds, or clean up small stains so they will know for future incidents.

, Many young boys from toddlers to teenagers hate waking up early, but you need to set a time when they have to leave. If they’re being especially resistant, there’s a few tactics you can use to get the sleepyheads out of bed. Pick a wake-up time that’s close to their school wake-up time. Kids are more likely to awaken at times that coincide with their usual routine.
Use food to entice them. Bring in a fresh stack of pancakes or a steaming plate of bacon as incentives for getting out of bed.
When all else fails, turn on the lights and loudly announce that it’s time to wake up. This method may annoy them for a time, but sometimes it’s necessary to be the disciplinarian.

, Check in with their parents to make sure they had a good time or to keep tabs with a guest that had to leave early. Forming relationships with their parents can also be a good method to entice them into hosting sleepovers in the future.

Make sure it's okay with your parents.,
Check if any of your friends are allergic to chocolate.,
Send out invitations with information like:


Event, time, and place
What to bring, such as: a toothbrush, toothpaste, change of clothes and to bring their favorite games, movies, music, etc.,

, It's going to be pretty hard on them while you're munching on your Mars bars and they have to sit in the corner eating lettuce.

, Do not forget chocolate! Tell your guests to bring their favorite sort of chocolate.

, If your walls are brown or orange, bonus. Brown helps everyone get into the mood. It is a CHOCOLATE party, after all.

, If you have spare beds, that's comfy. Slumber party beds and mats are nice too. Fold-A-Beds - not so much unless you mind sharing.

, If it's only that, your friends will get bored and want to eat something else. Put some fruits and candies there as well. Play games like: Truth Or Dare, Would You Rather, Trivial Pursuit, Monopoly, etc. If you have Wii's or 3DS's, connect them and play a multiplayer game together. If you have a game console like Xbox 360 or PlayStation or even a computer, that's fine too.

, Comedies are good, but not a tearjerker, that could really bring down the mood. If you all like a certain book series, try to get the movie based on the book. Sheer fun. Twilight and HP are good.

, You can stay up all night, don't be the first one asleep. That's just dull and you miss out on all the gossip, but don't be the last one, either. Everyone will be mad at you for keeping them awake. Be 2nd or 3rd.

, Leave out any snacks that won't spoil overnight. This is just in case somebody needs a midnight snack.

Invite guests that are nice, and friendly.,
Invites.,
If you have a big finished basement hold the party there!,
Keep your guests entertained, right?,
If drama springs up in your party; don't pick a side - even if someone is seriously acting up.,
If you can, play games like Bloody Mary and Ghost in the Graveyard.,
You should set up a small stand next to the sleeping bags so that you can set bowls of Doritos, Pretzels, Chex Mix, etc., onto it.,
You need energy drinks, Mountain Dew, Pepsi -- anything that has caffeine in it so that you will stay buzzed.,
Have pillow fights.",How to Host an All Night Slumber Party," Make sure that they don't 'hate' each other -- or ones that start rumors.;
, You can easily send out invites on Facebook and WhatsApp -- but if your friends don't have a Facebook or WhatsApp account, just make a cute little card out of colorful construction paper and a wacky colored Sharpie. Make sure they don't talk about it or everyone who wasn't invited will feel left out.

, You can easily set up sleeping bags, snacks and games down there if there's enough room. If you don't have a basement then just use your house. But remember to keep it clean. You will need enough space for everyone to sleep comfortably, and there should be adequate heating and cooling available.

, Well then, get board games (for younger kids) or do something more 'in your age group' like truth-or-dare. You can also play some video games. Even though some people may feel uncomfortable playing some games, they will eventually get used to it.

, Just simply say ""can we all get along? I invited you here to have fun -- not to fight"". And after that, do a comedy act or something to cheer everyone up and create a good atmosphere.

, Also take turns telling ghost stories -- it's sure to keep people up for the rest of the night! You can also watch some scary movies. And don't forget to take lots of pictures.

, Make sure everyone that's going to your party has no allergies to the food!

, You can also have pizza, burgers and ice-cream.

, Pillow fights are ALWAYS fun to do! But make sure there aren't any breakables around -- you don't want mom's antique lamp crashing to the floor on your fun friends night.

Eat out.",How to Host a Teenage Sleepover," Who are you inviting? How many people are you planning on inviting? Is it just one person, or a big bunch of friends? It's best to make this decision first as your choice will determine what you can do.;
, Where will you hold your party? Most teenagers like to have sleepovers in their bedroom, or a big spare room. Think about the number of people you are inviting. If you are inviting one, maybe even two people (depending on the size of your room), you could stick with your bedroom. But, any more than that, maybe take over the lounge room or the guest bedroom. Make sure everyone has enough room and space, people prefer to have their own space.

, When will you hold it? What is it for? If it's for your birthday, obviously keep the date of the sleepover relatively close to your actual birthday. If its just for fun or a catch up, do it on the weekend, Friday night... Don't make it a school night, you will not be able to stay up late for one, and in the morning its twice as much fuss. If it is the holidays, go ahead! Just always make sure that times suit both you, your friends and your family.

, Definitely the fun part! Blow up plenty of balloons and have them all over the floor, hang streamers from the ceiling, make it a pillow wonderland... have fun with it! Don't go overboard though, and make sure that there is some room for the beds.

, These are essential to any fun sleepover. The chocolate game is an oldie but a goody, truth or dare is a very common slumber party game, but how about something a bit different? A fun balloon game you could play involves players to tie a balloon onto a string, then tie the string with the balloon on it to your ankle. The players run around and try to stomp on others balloons and protects their own. No hands are allowed, and the winner is the person left with a non-popped balloon! Or to mix it up a bit, have multiple balloons on strings tied to your ankle!

, Every teenage girl deep inside has a love for dressing up. So get you and your friend/s together and do each others hair, makeup, clothes, shoes...

, Get wet in the pool! If you have a private pool, blow up balloons and throw them on the water!

, Mix your own CD with songs that you and your friends love, then put it in the CD player and dance!

, This is always fun. Search wikiHow for ideas, such as simple friendship bracelets and collages!

,





Pizza is everyone's favorite! If your parents don't want to cook, this is a goldie. Or, get some ingredients and make it yourself!
,





Pasta is an easy meal which is quick to cook and loved by anyone! Make some pasta and experiment with your friends' favorite sauces!,

Takeaway or restaurant - heaps of fun!"

Food and decorations.",How to Have a Sleepover (Young Girls)1," Especially if you are having this as a birthday party, you need to confirm with your parents/guardians how much money you are going to spend. Remember to check in a few different stores before buying decorations and food; you may find somewhere that sells stuff for a much cheaper price.;
, You might want to have food - like cake - and decorations all linked to the same idea. Here is my favourite theme idea:Disney - You can watch a Disney movie, get some cheap Minnie and Mickey Mouse decorations, put on the Frozen soundtrack CD*1 or Now that's what I call Disney CD*2 and dance along, dress up as Disney characters and maybe even plead for a Disney cake!*1: £10.99 in Disney Store/£7.00 in Claires. *2: £12.59 from base.com

, As you're girls (unless if you couldn't read 'For young girls' bit at the top), I suggest inviting only girls to the sleepover - it can get out of hand if boys come. Also, don't invite anyone who you don't get on with because if you fall out, it's unlikely that her parents will get out of bed to fetch her!

, The most original method is to use paper invitations which you can buy or make yourself. If you have a theme, try to find or make invites that somehow link to the theme you have chosen.

, Depending on your budget, it's a good idea to choose food that everyone enjoys. Pizza is a great choice: if you're tight on cash, you can buy a pack of pizza bases from somewhere like Tesco and find enough ingredients around your house to customize your own pizzas, you could order Domino's if there is enough money or, if you're prepared to splash the cash a bit, you could try taking your friends out to a restaurant. Now onto decorations. Poundland and 99p Store are great places to go if you want to liven up your house but your budget is low, but party pieces and party delights have a wide range of themed decorations if you are ready to give more than £1.

Set aside one room planned for every four guests who've responded to the invite, that are only to be used as changing-rooms.,
Think about some mellow and quiet songs that set the tone/mood for the slumber party.

,
Prepare for the chance that some people will have forgotten their sleepers and you'll need to distribute one to them for use.,
Plan in some fun and blanket-sleeper safe pre-sleepover activities you can do while dressed in your sleepers.,
Plan a specific time the lights will be required to be lowered for the night, to be placed in the invitation/card so your guests will know how long they'll have their games be available to be played by all of them.

,
Allow ample enough parking areas for your invitees and their parents to park.,
Decorate the rooms a bit to provide the theme for the party and sleeping areas.,
Mention that since blanket sleepers provide adequate warmth, each party guest shouldn't need to bring any other sleeping items.,
Give each invitee an alternative to wearing their blanket sleepers if they are adamant about coming to the party, but refuse to wear the sleeper.,
Prepare some party favors for all of your invited attendees, and keep a few more on hand for any others that may have come uninvited and ready to attend the slumber party.

,
Plan some party food that you can make that are blanket-sleeper themed.",How to Host an Adult Blanket Sleeper‐Themed Slumber Party," Depending on how you and your friends communicate most effectively, you'll either need some note cards or paper or a telephone and your invitee list containing phone numbers. If your need to, try sending e-invitations from such companies as eVite, or send invitations through social networking feeds such as Facebook or Twitter. Throw an extra flare and post it on any and all blogs you own and write often into.;
, Tell these people that although some people may shy away from wearing items when they hear they have to wear a sleeper while they are there, that blanket sleepers have come back into style for many adults as well as teens, and can be bought at their nearest superstore (Target and/or Walmart) on the adult lingerie racks and online at either JumpinJammerz or one of the few other reputable companies.


For those who are thin or short, some people (mostly tween and early teen girls) may still even fit into the biggest-sized toddler-sized ones available there as well, so they can try them on too.






Let them know that to effectively enter your sleepover, their sleeper must be nearby (with or on them) and that if they aren't dressed in it when they show up, they must change into it moments after they step into the house.







,, Be sure that the room will not exit into any other room that requires others to change their clothes also.


Be prepared in the event that four people will arrive at the same exact time and will be ready at those exact same times. One person can use the room while others must wait their turn.







,, Purchaseseveral sets for yourself and others. Unless you know their size, always try to purchase a few of different sizes.

, Always think about the negatives in all activities you plan.


Set up more than one room, if the attendees vary in age. Inviting relatives of family members of your invitees should be allowed to come in, as long as those unplanned guests can wear blanket sleepers themselves, and their adult chaperone (if needed) can attend too. The adult chaperone doesn't have to wear a blanket sleeper, though it is greatly encouraged that they do wear one to keep with the same theme.







Stash an extra blanket or two for the adults that chaperone these smaller children to use that night.Although the blanket sleeper will provide enough warmth to suffice, for those who feel terrible showing off their blanket sleeper, they can have an extra layer of security.






Include board games, computer games, appropriate races (watermelon race, wheelbarrow race) as part of any games you might be able to play while waiting for ""lights out"" to arrive. For each age group, for those kids who are teens who enjoy talking about the 'opposite sex' or playing Spin the Bottle or one of the many other weird dare games most teens and tweens like to play, as these too, can be done too just like at other slumber parties but make sure it doesn't get too rambunctious and out of hand.







,, No one likes to walk very far for a slumber party, and especially not when they have to wear something this strange out in public, so why force them to walk too far.

, The party area shall be of a calm, serene nature, and the sleeping area should be even serener.

, If they want, they can bring in ""sleeping pals"" (teddy bears of all sorts), but these sleeping pals may get in the way and aren't necessary.

, Tell them they must wear it, but they can cover themselves up with a blanket or sleep in a lighter-weight sleeping bag at the host's choice.

,, Make cookies that look like sleepers, or make something to suit the occasion.

Decide when it's best to hold the slumber party.,
Consider what time you'd like the girls to come to the sleepover.,
Consider how long you would like the girls to stay the following morning.",How to Plan a Girls' Slumber Party1," There are several important considerations here:


Do you want to hold it during school term or during the vacation time? During school term limits the options to weekend nights, while during school vacation, some of the friends might be away.
Are there any big events on that might stop guests from coming? For example, big sports meet-ups, local drama plays being staged, try-outs for teams, etc.
Are there known issues about some friends being tied up doing something on any particular dates? Especially if they're BFFs, don't plan the party if they're not going to be able to make it.
Is it near or around exam time? If so, do not hold the party as it will distract the girls and many of them probably won't be allowed to come anyway.
Is the weather going to be appropriate for the sleepover? Although the girls sleep indoors, this could impact outdoor activities or outings to things.
If you're a parent planning the party, ask your daughter if she knows of anything that might prevent guests from being available on a specific date. If not, and you've considered the above possibilities, you're good to go.;
, A late afternoon start is fairly standard, such as around 4pm, 5pm, etc. This allows time for the girls to settle in or for you take them somewhere, such as to see a movie, to go bowling or to have a pizza meal out. Obviously, the time will depend on whether or not you've planned an external activity.


Be sure to seek the permission of parents if taking the girls out of your home. They may prefer to help with transportation arrangements.

, It's nice to let the parents have a little sleep in or take their time to come and collect their daughter the next morning and the girls usually love staying in one another's company a little longer. A 10am, 11am or noon pick-up time usually works best. It does mean that you have to include breakfast.

If you are using invitations, mail them one to two weeks prior to the party.,

The address/where the party is
Day of the party and time it begins

What to bring (pillow, blanket, costume, makeover goodies, DVD, etc.)
RSVP (how your guests contact you to say if they can come or not). That includes your email address and phone number.

, It's fast, it's easy to track and most people are not the slightest bit surprised to receive invitations via emails. Just be sure to offer the option of calling you as well as emailing back, as some parents will still prefer to talk to the household parent or guardian in person.

Before the slumber party, tie balloons on your mailbox or near your front porch.,
Decide on what you are serving at the party.,
Plan activities.,
While you wait for the guests to arrive, clear a spot for everyone's sleeping bags and suitcases.,
Have fun at the slumber party!",How to Plan a Girls' Slumber Party3," If you want to be more creative, you could write the girls' names on the balloons.


Other decorations could include streamers, a lovely table setting for the dinner or buffet, etc. However, think about if you want a theme or not and consider what mood you are going for.

, Have plenty of snacks, as well as dinner. You could also have dessert, if you want. You'll also need to include breakfast foods for the following morning.


Good slumber party foods include: Pizzas, hamburgers, pasta, fries, takeout, etc.
You could go for more exiting foods as well such as: coke floats, pop tarts and other things that will be fun!

Snacks might include: Dips and chips, candies, fondues (cheese or chocolate), brownies, cupcakes, etc.
Drinks might include: Sparkling water, sodas in different flavors, juice, plain water and hot chocolates.
Keep in mind the possibility that some of the girls might have food allergies or foods they don't like. Ask them the menu to make it clear when they RSVP that they have any such issues.
Suggest some of your guests bring snacks too! ( you could have a midnight feast,)

, There are lots of possibilities for activities but it's a good idea to plan them ahead and not leave anything to chance. Choose activities that are fun and easy. but don't make the sleepover too planned. it would be boring if you and your friends/the girls have no time to do what they want to do.


For younger girls, a slumber party should be more structured, becoming more independent with older girls.
Board games,movies, scavenger hunts, crafts, makeovers, group video games etc. are great choices.
Visiting somewhere can be an option if you can arrange transportation. For example, going to the movies, ice-skating, ten-pin bowling, go-kart racing, eating out, etc.
Be sure to leave plenty of room for spur-of-the-moment activities and chatting.

, A living room, family room, den or a spot with lots of room and a TV are ideal places.


Be sure to accommodate the needs of every other household member. Let everyone know which rooms are off limits, both ways; the guests should know where not to go to avoid bothering siblings or parents and the family members should keep out of the way of the guests.

, If you're the girl of honor, enjoy yourself. If you're a parent, give them some space so they can have a nice time.


Parents usually like to retreat to another part of the house to get some quiet space. Just make that the girls know where you are if the need you.
Other siblings can sometimes become annoying if the birthday girl wants some time alone with her friends. Be sure that there is enough space for the birthday girl to have time alone with her friends.

Practice positive self-talk.,
Learn to say no.,
Conceal but don’t ignore your feelings.,
Stand up for others.",How to Act Tough at School1," Your internal monologue informs how you think about yourself. If you’re constantly telling yourself that you’re weak, you’ll feel badly about yourself. If you learn to tell yourself that you’re a tough and worthwhile person, pretty soon you’ll start to feel that way.Notice your internal monologue. If you start feeling sad or weak, listen to the thoughts going through your head.
If the thoughts are negative, for example, “I’m such a loser,” interrupt those thoughts and substitute positive self-talk. For example, replace “I’m such a loser” with “I’ve dealt with hard things before and I know I can deal with this, because I’m tough.”;
, Tough people don’t need others to tell them what to do. Learning to say no—whether it’s to bullies or to activities that you don’t want to engage in—will let others know that you’re tough and self-assured.Start by saying no when people hassle you. If someone bullies you, don’t laugh it off and pretend you don’t care. Instead, make it clear that you don’t like being bullied and you won’t tolerate it. If someone pushes you, say, “Did I say you could touch me?”
Don’t give into peer pressure. If you want to look tough, you need to stand up for yourself when you don’t agree with your friends. If your friends are going to a party but you don’t feel up to it, say, “I hope you guys have fun but I’m going to stay in tonight. I’ll come next time.”

, Part of acting tough is not letting others know that they’re getting to you. If you present a tough exterior people even when you’re afraid, people will come to respect you.


Presenting a tough exterior doesn’t mean you should ignore your feelings. It’s important to have a friend, family member, of counselor with whom you can express yourself freely.

, If people see you standing up for others, they’ll know you’re not afraid to stand your ground. Standing up for others shows that you have a strong sense of right and wrong and won’t take abuse.If you see someone getting bullied or teased, step in and tell the bullies to stop. If the bullies says it’s none of your business, say, “I’m making it my business.”

Start early.,
Ensure that you have the needed documentation.,
Consider what type of accommodations you may need.,
Talk to your school disability specialist or disability office.",How to Deal with Your Exams when You Are Autistic1," Don't wait until two days before the exam to ask for help. Talk to your school's disability specialist or disability office at the beginning of the school year. This way, there will be plenty of time to get everything in order, and you can focus on studying by the time of your first exam.


If you are in college, you will be expected to advocate for yourself, instead of having your parents/guardians handle it. The disability office can help walk you through the needed steps.;
, Depending on your school, you will need some sort of proof of your disability. This may mean making an appointment with a general doctor or a specialist, who can write a note.


If you have gotten accommodations at this school in previous years, you most likely will not need to bring in any more proof.

, Accommodations are meant to help you focus and feel less stressed; they are intended to ""level the playing field.""


Extended time (1.5 or 2 times the allotted time)
Ear plugs/ear defenders
Private room; this can limit distractions, and allow you to stim freely without worrying that you will disturb others
Stim toys (tangles, gum, etc.)
A reader to read questions out loud
Weighted lap pad or blanket for deep pressure
Supervised rest breaks during the exam

, They can help you figure out how to get what you need. You may be doing this for the first time, but they have plenty of experience, so they can help you through the process of getting accommodations.


Starting early makes things easier on them. They will be happy to see you being proactive.

Get a new wardrobe.,
Develop muscle.,
Practice good hygiene.,
Stand up straight.",How to Act Tough at School2," The clothes you wear can influence how people think of you. Poorly-fitting clothes often project a lack of self-confidence. Well-fitting clothes, on the other hand, project self-assurance and toughness.Make sure your clothes fit. No matter what your body type, well-fitting clothes will make you look better. If you can’t find clothes that fit will, or you don’t have enough money to buy a new wardrobe, take your clothes to a tailor. For just $5 or $10 a tailor can make the shoulders of your shirts fit your frame and the width of your pants follow the lines of your body.
Try wearing simpler clothes. A plain white t-shirt with a straight black hoodie will often look tougher on a guy than a colorful shirt with patterns. For girls, blue jeans and a well-fitting leather jacket project toughness.

, You don’t need to be hugely muscular to project toughness. But you should do some amount of weight-lifting that will show off the toned muscles on your body.Lift weights three times a week. If your school has a gym, go there for one hour on three days of the week. Focus on working out your shoulders, biceps, chest, back, and legs.
If you don’t have access to a gym, there are other ways to develop muscle. Chopping and stacking firewood is a good way to develop upper-body muscles. Pushing sleds on a football field is a good way to build your leg muscles.

, A clean, put-together appearance demonstrates that you value your appearance and won’t let others mess it up without a fight.Shower regularly. Try to shower every morning and anytime you work out.
Brush your teeth. You should do this at least twice a day.
Comb your hair. Combed, styled hair is classic sign of toughness.
Wear deodorant. If you’re a guy, choose a masculine scent like pine needles. If you’re a girl, choose a neutral scent that doesn’t smell too flowery.

, Posture is one of the first things people notice about you, and good posture indicates toughness and self-confidence.When you’re standing up, keep your head straight in line with your back. Don’t let your chin droop down. Keep your shoulders back and your chest extended forward. Let your arms hang naturally at your sides.
When you’re sitting, don’t slouch. You can lean back if you want to, but try to keep your shoulders back at all times.

Choose your friends wisely.,
Be a leader.,
Learn to defend yourself.,
Don’t be a bully.",How to Act Tough at School3," If your current group of friends puts you down or makes fun of you on a regular basis, it’s time to find new friends. Choose friends who treat you with respect and don’t make you the butt of jokes.Seek out friends that you share things in common with. Part of being tough is knowing what you want. So, don’t join a group just because they “look cool.” Instead, choose your friends based on shared interests.
If you have trouble making new friends, join a club or sports team.
Don’t be afraid to approach new people. If you hear a group talking about something that interests you, such as football, join the conversation and offer your own input. For example, you might say, “Did you guys catch the game last night? That pass in the third quarter was insane.”
If new people reject you, don’t pout. Realize that they’re not the kind of people you need in your life anyway. Move on to a new group.

, Take the initiative in your group of friends. Tough people are leaders because they’re not afraid to voice their opinions and make suggestions to others.If you know of an activity your friends might enjoy, bring it up to the group. Try to be specific. For example, if there’s a concert coming up, say, “Hey guys, let’s get tickets for the concert this weekend. They go on sale this afternoon so I’ll come by and pick you up so we can be first in line.”
Include everyone in your friend group. A good leader never leaves someone out. If you include everyone whenever you talk or make plans, everyone in your group will start to look up to you as tough and reliable.

, Standing up for others and not taking abuse from others means that you might find yourself in a fight, even if you’re not looking for one. It’s important to learn how to defend yourself if someone attacks you.


Attend self-defense or martial arts classes. If your school doesn’t provide classes, try your local YMCA or other gym.
Remember that fighting should only be a last resort. A truly tough person is able to ward off fights and deflect tension before it escalates.

, Being tough does not mean being a bully. Sometimes bullies put on tough attitudes, but this is just a façade. A truly tough person doesn’t need to belittle others to feel good about themselves.If you find yourself being a bully, or realize you’ve been a bully in the past, apologize. A willingness to take responsibility for your behavior is a hallmark of toughness. It shows that you’re not afraid of being wrong or deciding to do the right thing instead of going along with the crowd.

Know where your exam is.,
Gather all necessary equipment early on.,
Write a social story all about exams.,
Create a calm down sheet that you can look at at home.",How to Deal with Your Exams when You Are Autistic2," It is also worth asking that if you struggle with background noise or feel more anxious in a large examination room, whether or not it would be possible to take your exam with less students, or on your own completely (individually). If you know where your exam room is, you may be able to pick a spot which you prefer sitting at for each of your exams.

, Consider putting it in a clear pencil case or plastic bag. You may need or want the following...


Pencils and eraser
Stim toys
Gum, jawbreakers, or lollipops
Medication
Reading rulers & colored overlays
Colored pencils & colored highlighters
Clear water bottle

, This can include where the exams will take place, necessary preparations and how to deal with exam anxiety etc. Including lots of pictures and even an exam timetable can be very useful. Remember to use positive language during your social story, which may be good to read through just before you go into an exam.

, This can include lots of different strategies that you can use to reduce stress during your exams. You could include techniques such as different breathing techniques, mindfulness, EFT and using fidget toys, etc.

"
"
Read the questions through at least twice.,
Use visuals to your advantage.,
Take small breaks as needed.,
Go back over the exam, if you have time.",How to Deal with Your Exams when You Are Autistic3," Make sure that you read everything on the page, even if it looks irrelevant at a glance. It may help to read the questions aloud (if you are in a private room) or have a reader.

, If you struggle to write down what you mean, then sometimes it may help to draw a picture, especially if it is something like a science exam. It is always better to put something down than nothing, even if you are not sure of the answer. Remember; if you have time at the end then you can always go back to the question. However, be aware that irrelevant doodles could make your GCSE exam invalidated.

, If you find your focus slipping away, stop. Take a break to stim, stand up and stretch, rock in your chair, et cetera. Having a private room is especially helpful, because you don't need to hold yourself back when stimming, and you can get up to pace and re-orient yourself.

, It can be helpful to ""re-take"" the exam by reviewing all the questions and calculating your answers a second time. Checking your work can help you find little mistakes and raise your score by several points.

Get extra school supplies.,
Organize.",How to Cope Until School Starts (for Eager Back to Schoolers)," Sometimes, it's not school itself that makes you yearn for it. It may be a relationship, the company of friends, or, a certain activity in school that attracts you to the school. Identifying the reason will eventually help you appreciate the holidays because then, you will be able to look at the perk specifically, and not view the school as a ""heaven"" just because of one thing.;
, Some schools assign a list of books you need to read before the fall. You might check for other classes, for example ask your science teacher if there are any extra-credit science experiments to do over break. You can ask your math teacher if you can have a textbook and start studying it, so you can get a head start on the new school year.

, For example, you could see how many books you can read before the Fall, or you could try to learn 30+ new vocabulary words. This can be fun and it will sharpen your skills for next year! You could also set a goal for how many math problems to finish each week or even each day.

, Websites like kids.gov are great for all your favorite subjects. This can help you hone your skills in your subjects, and, will give you a taste of being at school.

, Doing this you will be motivated to think about what you are going to do when you do get back to school and you can do a little bit of work over the summer towards them.

, In this way you can count the days back to school, make notes of your achievements or you can make it more of an album by also sticking photos from your summer in it. You should have a mix of fun and schoolwork if you are eager for school to get back in session, because if you don't, once you do go back to school, you will be burnt out and then you likely won't enjoy school as much.

, Search on a website for some online lessons. There a lots of videos about subjects that are really interesting.

, If school has just ended, and you face a long summer with nothing to do, find a project to work on. For computer fans, you might try to learn Linux. If you're good at writing, try writing a work of fiction. Whatever you do, though, make sure you enjoy it.

, Life isn't all about reading, writing, and math! Maybe meet some friends, go to a movie, and go out to eat! You don't have to be learning every second of every day! You can also ask your parents to go out for a vacation.

, This will help you get your mind off school, and, hopefully, will allow you to appreciate the holidays more.

, You can write a book about your school life or even the world. Who knows, maybe by the end of the summer, you can publish your book and your friends and family can read all about it.

, This will help you keep track of what you did over the summer, so it's a good idea to start it early on. Whether you're a guy or a gal, be sure to keep it out of the wrong hands.

, There are many ideas on a creative project and you can search WikiHow for many helpful ideas. Your art teacher (if the school has an art program) will gladly accept the project.

,, They may offer some sort of story time (for younger kids), or, interesting materials that teens often find interesting.

, This will inspire you to try new ideas, and you'll never be bored. Read both fiction and nonfiction, depending on your mood at any given time.

, Read about everything that interests you, and be sure to share what you learn with friends.

, If you gather enough people (or dolls) You could see what its like on the teachers end, and, eventually, appreciate them more. This will be beneficial to you as well when school starts.

, Whether it's your own blog or wikiHow, make something for other people to see. It can be anonymous, or you could tell all your friends and ask for their advice.

, This is not only fun, but also good to refresh your memory just in case you need to remember it, but haven't practiced in years.

, If you're really bored you can always get a couple round for things. Outings and trying to complete fun and special tasks like making a message in a bottle or building a giant fort can make the summer truly memorable.

, Maybe it's just the loneliness that you are feeling that makes you yearn for school, not an actual yearning itself.

, Either you're spending your days with your parents, grandparents, or uncles there are surely plenty of things to do together. Another good idea is to ask your parents to go to a summer camp. You meet people, have a good time and pass your days without even noticing it!

, Most kids wait until nearly the last day of August to get their school stuff. But if you search for your school supplies in like June or July, you can get cool little things like cute erasers, neat pencils, sweet binders and notebooks, etc.

, Near the end of your holiday break, you could start going to shops for stationery and back-to-school clothes so that you can get the best things.

Wait for the right time.,
Raise your hand.,
Tell the teacher you have a question.,
See if you can come up with the answer yourself.,
Calm your nerves.,
Speak in a clear, audible voice.,
Keep your question brief.,
Ask for specific information.,
Listen attentively to the answer.,
Save multiple questions for after class.,
Write down questions you have about homework.,
Email the question instead.",How to Ask Questions in Class," Most teachers give their students a chance to bring up questions and concerns at the end of a lesson. Hold onto your question until you’re prompted for it. That way, your teacher will be able to reach a good stopping point and give you a detailed answer.


Familiarize yourself with the way things are normally done in your classroom. Your teacher might encourage students to ask questions during the lesson, or they may prefer that you save them for a designated time.
If the teacher doesn’t invite questions, wait for a pause before asking.;
, This is the most common and courteous way of letting your teacher know that you have a question. Raising your hand lets you signal quietly so that you don’t interrupt the lesson or disturb your classmates. It will also help you get noticed in a room full of students.Keep your hand up until your teacher acknowledges you. They may not see you right away.
Don’t wave your arm around in an effort to be seen. This can be very distracting.

, If your teacher fails to notice that you have your hand up, you can politely alert them before you get left behind in the lesson. Simply say “excuse me,” or get their attention by saying their name. Wait until you’re called on before you begin talking.Be respectful. Pestering or talking over your teacher will just make you look like you’re trying to cause a scene.

, You may already have the information you need to find out what it is you want to know. Before you ask a question, think it over and make sure it’s something you can’t find out on your own. Review your textbook and notes and look for the answer there.


Learning to search for answers independently can improve your study habits and make you more resourceful.
It can be somewhat embarrassing to ask a question when the answer is right in front of you.

, A lot of students tend to be shy about asking questions, but there’s no reason to be. Think of questions as a tool you can use to make learning more effective. Even if the answer is a simple one, the fact that you had the presence of mind to ask will show that you’re engaged with the course material.Chances are, someone else in the class has the same question and is too timid bring it up.Once you’ve gotten comfortable expressing yourself in class, you’ll be more confident about asking questions in the future., Articulate your words and make sure the teacher and the rest of the class can hear you. That way, you won’t be forced to repeat yourself.


You should talk loud enough to be heard clearly, but try not to shout.
Muttering or talking under your breath may make you hard to hear.

, There’s no need to ramble on and on or preface the question with other sorts of statements. Make it short and to the point. Your teacher will be better able to answer you, and you won’t lose any important class time.To avoid confusion, the first thing you say should be a key question word: who, what, where, when, why or how.

, Point out exactly what you need clarified. This could be anything from a particular date, figure or spelling to more involved questions like the meaning of an idiom or a breakdown of the individual steps in a biological process. The key is to word your question carefully so that you can receive the information you’re missing.“What year did the French Revolution start?” is a better question than “when was that, again?”
You could also phrase your question as a request—for instance, “could you spell that?” or “would it be possible to see that previous slide again?”
Avoid asking questions that are vague or open-ended.

, Look directly at the teacher while they’re answering you, or take notes so that you can look them over later. Nod occasionally to indicate that you understand what you’re being told. Once the answer has been explained satisfactorily, thank the teacher.If you’re still having trouble grasping something, ask the teacher for clarification before you move on.
Don’t interrupt or let your eyes wander around the room. This could be considered rude.

, There may not be enough time to answer all of your questions, especially if it’s near the end of the period and other students have questions of their own. In these cases, you can approach your teacher after class and have them clear up anything you’re still uncertain about.Lay out your questions one at a time so your teacher will have an easier time answering them.
College students can also schedule an appointment to speak to their professors during office hours., Make a list of difficult problems and concepts that you encounter in your out-of-class assignments. You may discover the answer on your own as you continue studying. If not, you can get your teacher to address these questions before the beginning of the following class period.Identifying ideas you don't understand will help you do better on future assignments.
Show up a little early for the next class so you’ll have an opportunity to discuss your questions in depth.

, If you just can’t overcome your anxiety of speaking in class, it’s okay to type your question out in a message. Email is convenient because you can one anytime a question arises, whether you’re in class or not. You’ll still get the same response, and you’ll have the freedom to check back for an answer throughout the day.Put the main idea of the question in the email’s subject line so that your teacher will know what to expect from your message.
If time is a factor (such as right before a big exam), be sure to send your email well enough in advance to ensure that you’ll receive a reply in time.
Another benefit of email is that you can archive it and look it over later should you happen to forget the answer.

Trust in God.,
Reading the Bible daily can give you encouragement and helpful advice on living a life full of the presence of GOD.,
Use prayer.,
Remember the words you speak are very powerful (Proverbs 18:21) so use your words to praise GOD and others instead of gossiping.,
Do your homework.,
Have patience and determination.,
Get help.,
Don't listen to those who are a bad influence.,
Remember, your heavenly Dad loves you so much more than you could ever think.",How to Excel in School As a Christian," To succeed in life, you have to trust God and know that what He's doing is best for you. You'll certainly go through trials in this life- No doubt! But ""Be of good courage"" (Joshua 1:9),remember that trials are allowed by God to both strengthen you in your faith and see if you trust Him. Sometimes he even causes them to allow you to grow in faith. If you pass these tests by trusting God, He will move you to a higher level. ""Complain and remain; Praise and be Raised.""-Joyce Meyer;
, God loves speaking to His children and one of the ways He does this is through His word. If you're facing a stressful time at school, simply reach for your bible (or search for bible verses online) and look at all the comforting bible verses God has for you.

, Prayer is a powerful tool, because it is a spiritual sword of God. Don't worry, it doesn't have to be you getting on your knees for hours; it's simply talking to your heavenly daddy like you would a friend, for example ""Hi God, how can I make you happy today?"" Keeping your mind focused on God, can help you keep your priorities straight.

, Instead of speaking negatively about yourself- for example; ""I'm terrible at math,"" declare what God says about you (James 1:5)-""If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask God, who gives generously...""

, Anytime you get homework from school, make sure you complete it! That means no ""I'll do it tomorrow for sure"" Don't kid yourself. Try to Revise/Study for at least 45 minutes every day on the subject you have learned. You can revise the way you prefer so if you prefer studying on the internet than you do from a book, then hop on a computer and study.

, Two of the qualities you need to succeed in life are patience and determination. These two qualities can determine your success in life. You're not always gonna feel like getting your homework done, or studying, but always be determined. Remember, school isn't gonna last forever.

, If possible, try to find a Christian group that relates to you. (i.e Youth christian group for youths.) This can give you the encouragement needed when you feel like giving up on your Christian walk with GOD. It's important to stay connected to the positive influences in your life.

, Even if your friends aren't Christians, make sure they don't influence you to do things you know God wouldn't approve of, like drinking alcohol and smoking. These things can lower your morals as well as affect your health.

, It doesn't matter if others have rejected you, God will never reject you when you come to Him and ask Him to guide you through life. It doesn't matter if you're a convicted murderer or you cheated on a class test! He just wants you to be His and to give your life to Him. Hey you're His child, why wouldn't he love you. If you want to become a Christian, confess in your heart that Jesus is the Lord of your life, then ask Him to come into your heart and cleanse you from all your sins. God will forgive you and will release you from the guilt of any sin you have (and will have) committed.

Learn to relax.",How to Cope In School," If the school doesn't have a uniform, wear nice, fashionable but affordable clothes. Wear jeans and a plain shirt if you want to look low key. If you have a uniform, keep it clean and dress it up with nice earrings or a bright bag. Don't try too hard to look fashionable, it's only school, not a fashion parade.


If you go to a school without a school uniform, wear an outfit that is clean and stylish but that is practical for the day. for example if you have PE, don't wear a jump-suit or dungarees as they take a long time to remove and put on again.
Make sure that your PE kit is always clean but don't wash it all the time or you may need to buy a new one too soon.;
, As well as books, take a pencil case with extra pens and pencils, a ruler, an eraser, a pencil sharpener, scissors, a glue stick and sticky notes. Have all of your maths equipment, for example, a protractor, compass, and a scientific calculator. In your schoolbag, you may also want an 'emergency kit' with plasters, a bit of extra cash and emergency phone numbers in case anything happens and a water bottle in case you want a drink throughout the day.

, Shower regularly and always wash your face and brush your teeth in the morning, as well as wearing deodorant. Brush your teeth twice a day, floss and use mouthwash.


If you wear makeup, keep it simple as there is little reason to wear lots of it. Keep it to concealer, powder, mascara and lip balm/lip gloss.
Have clean hair, and if you have a problem with frizz, sort it. A cool look in school is to straighten your hair, poker straight. However if you have wavy hair, smooth it out with some cream for loose sexy curls.
Have fresh skin and try to keep spots away by taking any make up off at night and using a cleanser, toner and moisturizer.

, If you don't feel like there's much point in going to or enjoying school, then ask yourself why and how you can solve those problems. Find solutions rather than posing constant problems, and you'll already be on your way to finding it more bearable.

, This could be things like friends, grades or social life. After this, come up with ways you can correct these problems. For example, if you want to improve your grades, you could do some extra studying or go to the teacher for help.

, It could be the start of a school year, next school term or next school week. Vow that from that day, you will use your solutions to make school a better place for yourself.

, You can do your work and still have a good time. Ask your teacher if you can work in pairs. This can make new friends. But keep quiet and do some work, or the teacher will probably split you up. If working in pairs is not an option, either talk very quietly to the person nearest to you while working, or get your head down and concentrate very hard. It is important to revise before tests and exams, and always try to get high grades. Do your best on homework, and always bring it on time. Remember to bring all the equipment you need.

, There will be teachers that you don't like, and teachers who don't like you. Pay attention in lessons and they should like you more. As for teachers you hate or simply don't get along with, get through the lesson by distracting yourself. Think about what you are going to do that night, but don't daydream or stop doing your work. If you are really good, you will be able to do the work while thinking about other things.

, Be nice to everyone, don't give anyone a reason to be your enemy. Don't do anything trashy, like steal your best friend's boyfriend or get into a fight. Be nice and gentle with people, remember your manners and never lose your temper. You could get into a lot of trouble at school if you lose your head and go mouthing off at the wrong person.


If you are unhappy with your friendship group, then find other people to be friends with, even if they are not in your school year. However, don't leave the friendship group suddenly as it may make you look bad and people may be mean to you for it.
In the end, if you don't have many friends, remember that when you leave school, you probably will never see those people again, so don't let negative people get you down.

, Don't be the person who hides in the corner and never approaches a boy/girl. Be friendly and casual with boys/girls, treat them like your friends and they will start seeing you in a new light. If you have a crush on someone, don't scare them by running over and declaring your love. Also, don't send them love notes or they will think of you as weird. Subtly ask them to the cinema, or tell them that you think they are cute or something. Don't be one of those girls/guys who dates everyone, and don't ever ever get desperate and date a total idiot. Respect yourself and never try to get a boyfriend/girlfriend by telling them you'll put out.

, There will always be people who don't like you for whatever reason. You shouldn't be giving them a reason, so don't ever shout anything offensive at them or lose your temper. Remain calm and ignore them. They are probably just jealous. If they ever challenge you to a fight, walk away.

, Say hi when walking past people in the corridor, help someone if they ask you to, and so on. You don't have to be everybody's best friend but never be mean to somebody 'just because'.

, You can make school seem better if you prepare well in the morning. Make sure you have everything packed, get a shower, take time to focus on your appearance. Also, it is important to eat a good breakfast. Try toast, cereal or crumpets! Also, drink a lot of water throughout the day and smile!

, At some schools, they do random locker checks, so don't use your locker as a dump. Keep your PE kit in there, as well as some extra stationary and paper in case you have homework or lose you stuff. It is also a good idea to have an empty water bottle in your locker in case you or one of your friends want a drink.

, Always get to school on time in the morning as it can look bad if you always show up late and you miss some of your education. Only stay off school if you are contagious or have been sick. If you have a stomach/headache, just take some pain reliever and cope with it (but do get your parent's advice first).


Always turn up to your lessons on time. You don't have to be early just make sure you get to your next class by the bell. If you get let out of class late by one of your teachers, just politely apologize to the teacher at your next class and say you were let out late.

, Join a club or a sports team that you are interested in. Or if a class has a drop in session at lunch, go there to catch up on or improve work. Be active after school. Join clubs, be social, go to netball or football practice. Or invite your friends to the cinema or bowling, or to a dinner. Have fun, but always have enough time that night to go home and do any homework that you have. Also, getting sleep is important too, and remembering to pack your bag the night before.

, If you fail a test in middle school, who cares? No college will ever look at your middle school report card. You can ask your teacher for extra credit, but even if they don't give it to you, you can still resolve to work harder in the future and bring up the grade. If you have psychotic parents, talk to them about lowering their impossible expectations a little bit. If you worked your hardest and still got only a B-, that's fine! Don't be hard on yourself, as it will have no major impact on your life.

, You don't have to do it the night you get it but make sure its done so that you have time to go back and check it.

, Make sure you get at least seven to eight hours sleep at night as well so you can function properly the next day.

, Don't spend more than an hour a day on revision though, as you could get bored and not remember any of it.

, Don't start doing work the minute you get home from school. Give yourself half an hour to get a snack, change clothes if you want and just relax a little. Always leave time to relax, and don't get too worked up over tests or projects as it may affect your health, work and social life.


Get out a little, even if it is just a walk or run around your neighborhood. Always have a few hours at the weekend that you can go out with friends or just relax.

, Start rough and general, then get specific.

, Learn the content of the essay well.

,, These should be key points in your outline (to keep you on topic) and details and statistics (that would be too difficult to remember).

Figure out why you are nervous.,
Be prepared.,
Talk to someone.,
Practice, practice, practice.,
Rehearse.,
Stay calm - before and on the big day.,
Do your best and have fun with it.,
Do not dwell on your mistakes.",How to Get the Confidence to Speak in Front of a Class," Are you afraid to get a bad grade? Do you think you may embarrass yourself in front of the cute guy in the first row? Once you identify these thoughts, begin to find reasons why they won't be true. For example, when you think, ""I am going to make a fool out of myself in front of Brendan."", think something more positive such as, ""I am going to be so prepared, I will sound really smart and Brendan will be really impressed."" Obviously, your thoughts and examples should be specific to you.;
, It is easy to feel nervous when you only began thinking about your subject or speech notes the night before the big day! Begin preparing yourself as soon as you find out you will be speaking before the class. It may seem like a pain at the time, but the effort you make will be well worth it once you get in front of the class (and when you see your grade). Now, this doesn't mean you must have your speech memorized three weeks before the due date. It simply means that you should follow a logical time line and know what you're talking about.

, Talk to a respectful friend or an adult you can trust. This person shouldn't be the type that will increase your speaking fears. Ask them how they handle big presentations and what they would do in your situation. Maybe they will offer to be your practice audience!

, Practicing is not the same as rehearsing. When you practice, you are making mistakes and finishing up your final product. Rehearsing is presenting your performance just as it will be for you real audience. Practice your speech in front of a mirror with your notes in hand. Add to them when necessary, and cross out unneeded information. Streamline your notes so you won't fumble through them if you forget your place during your presentation.

, Remember that friend or adult from the third step? Ask this person if they will listen to your speech and give you constructive criticisms. Build from their advice, and do at least one more presentation, this time for at least four people. That way, you are experiencing the feeling of having more eyes trained on you, and you can get a feeling for handling crowds.

, It may be helpful for you to look into a few breathing exercises or different ways to reduce stress. Keep calm beforehand so you don't scare yourself too much before you even get to class.

, Don't mumble too much or read mindlessly off of your notes. You've worked hard to make sure that this speech goes well, so show it! Your classmates will appreciate watching someone who has a bit of fun with the material instead of listening to Johnny Nobody drone on endlessly from his notes.

, Congratulate yourself for having the courage to get up in front of your peers, and don't be over critical of yourself. You will always be harder on yourself than anyone else will. Very few people will actually care if you made a mistake, and many probably didn't even notice. Do, however, ask yourself what you could do better for next time. Focus on the present and future, not the past.

Identify your triggers.,
Focus on one task at a time.,
Set small, specific goals.,
Create a weekly study plan.,
Ask for extensions on assignments.,
Wait for the hallway to clear of people at school.,
Integrate exercise into your routine.",How to Handle School when You Have Depression1," It may be helpful to identify any emotional triggers related to school that contribute to your depression so you can make changes to avoid or manage those things. Try writing about your experience with depression and see if you can identify if something prompted the episode. For instance, you may notice that your depression often follows right after you've been assigned to work on a group project, or that it began when your best friend started hanging out with a different group. If you can identify a trigger, then it may be easier for you to avoid it or, if that's not possible, learn healthy and productive ways to deal with it.Research indicates a connection between depression and academic performance, and in some cases a connection between depression, self-esteem, and social standing. Consider if either these contribute to your depression.Other triggers might be stress related to upcoming tests or assignments, crowded halls, assemblies, grades, self-image, and peer pressure.
It may be helpful to work on this list with a counselor or therapist, who can also teach you positive coping skills.;
, When you have depression, it can be hard to motivate yourself to get out of bed and get dressed for school. Start by focusing on one task at a time. Get up out of bed because you have to, not necessarily because you want to. Then, brush your teeth and comb your hair. After these tasks are complete, move on to getting dressed. Check each task off in your head as you complete them so you can feel more motivated to get out the door to school.If you are having trouble getting out of bed, try to focus on one important task you need to do at school that day, such as take a test or turn in an assignment. Keeping your focus on this one thing you must accomplish may help you feel motivated to get out of bed.
Though it may be difficult to do, try not to give yourself time to dwell on how bad you are feeling. Get ready quickly for school by completing one task at a time. Doing this can keep you on track to getting out the door to school on time, ready to do your best despite your depression.
If you know you struggle in the mornings, prepare everything you will need the night before. Put all your books in your backpack, lay out the clothes you plan to wear, and make your lunch.

, Go easy on yourself and set the bar low. Do not try to do too many things at once when you have a bad bout of depression. Set goals that are small and specific. This could be as simple as having a goal to get out of bed in the morning. Or you may have a goal to wear clean clothes to go to school. Or you may have a goal to eat breakfast in the morning before school. Goals that are small and specific can help you stay motivated as you prepare for school.Once you are at school, set small specific goals for yourself. This could be handing in your assignment in class or getting to class on time. You may set a goal to say ""hi"" to one person in your class or to speak once during a class discussion. Keep the goals small and manageable so you do not feel overwhelmed.

, Another way you can handle school when you have depression is to stay organized. Make a weekly study plan to help you stay on top of your assignments and due dates. Write out the study plan on a whiteboard in your room or make one on your phone. Make sure you plan enough time for all your assignments, as well as time for breaks. This way, you do not feel overwhelmed or unmotivated. Instead, you can feel organized and focused, even as you also deal with your depression.Organize the study plan based on your energy levels. For example, if you tend to be more of an active person in the morning, schedule difficult assignments for the morning. Then, do the less challenging assignments at night.

, Having depression may make it difficult for you to meet due dates and deadlines for assignments or tests at school. Rather than feel overwhelmed or unmotivated, speak to your teachers and ask about getting extensions on your assignment. Let your teachers know that you are struggling with depression and need more time to complete your assignments. Your teachers should try to accommodate your needs and make you feel supported at school.Your teachers may offer to give you extensions on assignments, where you hand them in separately from your peers. They may also ask you if you’d prefer to have different dates or times for any tests or exams, especially if your depression is getting in the way of your time management.
Do not be afraid to ask for extensions on assignments due to your depression. Most teachers will be understanding and work with you to ensure you do well in school.
If your school has a counselor or student resource center, you should speak with them about making special accommodations for your depression. You may need to bring a note from a doctor.

, If you find being in crowded spaces overwhelming or stressful due to your depression or find that it triggers a depressive episode, hang back at the end of class. Wait until the hallway is clear of people to venture out. This way, you will feel less stressed and more comfortable at school.If you have to get to classes back to back, let your teachers know that you may be a few minutes late because you like to wait for the hallway to clear out to avoid feeling stressed.

, Getting exercise a few times a week can help to boost your mood and make you feel more energized for school. If exercise isn't already part of your daily routine at school in gym class, try to integrate exercise into your school routine so it becomes part of your daily habits. Bike, walk, or run to school in the morning or from school to your home. Schedule a workout in the morning before classes or after school is done.You can also join a sports club at school and exercise that way. For example, you may join the swim team or the track and field team at school.
You can also do recreational sports like softball or basketball outside of school to integrate exercise into your routine.
Your school may have a student gym that you can use for free.

Rely on your old friends.,
Form a solid group of friends.,
Ask your siblings to help you find your place at school.,
Turn to teachers or other adults for help.",How to Stand Up to People in Upper Grade (Freshman Year)," As you are in high school already, you must have gone through tough middle school years and have made some really good friends along the way. Its time to help each other. Know that you are not alone in high school. In addition to your old friends, you have plenty of new people to meet and get to know. Hold these people close to you. Rely on them in any situation, and let them know that they can rely on you.
, Chances are your old friends know some people that you don't; befriend them. Get to know several new friends and integrate them with your old friends to form a strong group. Having friends at school makes high school much more fun, and having a group to rely on can help keep you safe and secure.

Bullies tend to pick on the weaker targets. A herd of sheep is stronger than a solitary dolly. Having a group of friends will discourage any bullies from picking on you and your friends.

, If you have an older brother or sister already established at your high school, ask them to help you get acquainted with the school. They can introduce you to teachers or administrators and show you around campus so that you'll never get lost. They can also help you meet people and make friends, and they'll always be there for you when you need them. And if your sibling is popular in school, then you are a celeb already. Nobody messes with the brother of the prom king., You should never feel unsafe at school. If you're being bullied, or if you just feel threatened, immediately ask a teacher, your parents, or even the school principal for help. Your school should have procedures in place to deal with bullying, so although bringing the issue up to an adult can seem scary, this is the best way to get it solved quickly."

Use positive affirmations.,
Do deep breathing.,
Listen to a calming playlist.,
Write your feelings down in a journal.,
Join a school club.",How to Handle School when You Have Depression2," It can be a struggle to stay positive when you have a bad bout of depression. To stay focused and upbeat, use positive affirmations before you get to school and while you are in school. Say the positive affirmations out loud in front of a mirror several times to help you stay energized for the day.


For example, you may use positive affirmations like, ""I am strong and motivated to go to school today,"" or, ""Today I am going to have a good day at school.""

, If you feel depressed while at school, prepare yourself for the day by doing deep breathing. You can do deep breathing and meditation at home, on the drive to school, or in front of the school before you go inside. Deep breathing and meditation can help you stay calm and relaxed. It can also help you set a good intention for your day, even as you are dealing with depression.


To do deep breathing, close your eyes and inhale slowly through your nose for four counts. Then, exhale through your nose for four counts. Do this several times until you feel calm and relaxed.
You can even do deep breathing while seated at your desk or walking to class.

, Listening to calming music on headphones can help you stay relaxed at school. Make a playlist of music that you find soothing or calming and listen to it at school or on the way to school. Look up calming playlists and upload to your phone or music player so you can listen to them.If you find yourself getting depressed before school, try listening to the playlist to help lift your mood. Though the lift may only be temporary, it may be what you need to get through the school day.

, Another way you can cope with depression is to keep a private journal where you write down your feelings. You may keep the journal in your backpack, in your locker at school, or at home in a safe place. Write down thoughts once a day to help you release your emotions.You can also use the journal as a way to help track your progress as you deal with your depression. Note days when you felt good or energized and days or moments where you felt unmotivated or depressed.

, You can also cope with depression at school by getting more involved in student life. Join a club at school or get involved in school events. This will allow you to get more involved with the social aspect of school and feel like you are part of a community of peers. Often, depression can feel isolating and lonely. Joining a school club can make you feel more included.For example, you may join a club that focuses on a hobby or activity you enjoy, such as art, photography, debate, or dance.
You can also join a club that focuses on something you want to get better at, such as chess, the performing arts, or math.

Speak to a mental health professional.",How to Handle School when You Have Depression3," Having depression can be a lonely experience. Rather than isolate yourself from others, reach out to those around you. Enlist the support of your teachers so they can help you do well in school. Speak to them one on one about your depression. Ask them for assistance with assignments or class discussions outside of class. Most teachers will work with you to ensure you succeed in their class, even as you deal with the challenges of depression.Your teachers can also refer you to resources at school to help you cope with depression. This could be an afterschool program or the referral to the school counselor.

, Make an appointment with your school counselor to discuss your depression. School counselors know how to listen and help students dealing with depression. If your school counselor is trained in mental health, they can act as a therapist and support you. If they are not trained in mental health, they can still be a good resource for you to get help from a doctor or mental health professional.Your school counselor can give you tips on how to manage depression at school. They can also speak to your teachers for you and help you get accommodations for assignments so you can do well in your classes.

, If you feel more comfortable talking to someone you know, reach out to family and friends. Tell close friends that you are struggling with depression. Speak to a close family member about your struggles. Lean on those closest to you so you feel less alone with your depression.You may confide in a family member or friend that you trust and comfortable being honest and open with. Let them know that you are looking someone to listen to you and support you, not to judge you or make you feel worse than you already do.
Your family and friends may recommend that you speak to a mental health professional at school or through your doctor. Be open to hearing this advice.

, If your depression is getting in the way of your ability to function and do well in school, it may be time to speak to a mental health professional. Talk to your primary care doctor and ask for a referral to a mental health professional. Go to a mental health clinic in your area. Ask friends for a referral to a therapist or a counselor.The mental health professional can help you make a treatment plan. The treatment plan will detail your medication needs, your therapy schedule, and any other details relating to your treatment for depression.
The therapist may recommend time off or a temporary leave from school, depending on your condition and your needs. Discuss this with your therapist in detail so you feel comfortable making it part of your treatment plan.

Exercise.",How to Get Through a Bad Day at School," When you notice yourself getting anxious or frustrated, taking some deep breaths is a great first step. You can do it anywhere, even in class. Your teacher and classmates probably won’t even notice.Try breathing in deeply through your nose and then breathing out through your mouth.
Take ten deep breaths like this. If you don’t feel calmer after that, repeat. However, usually taking ten deep breaths will help.;
, You might be having a bad day because one big thing happened that upset you; or many small upsetting things may have happened. It may be a case of bad luck or it could be caused something more significant such as bullying or doing poorly on a test. Take some time to think about what it is that has turned this into a bad day.Once you’ve named the problem or issue, try to avoid thinking about it too much. Sometimes a bad day is made worse by fixating on the problem. See if there's something more positive you can turn your attention toward. For example, instead of thinking, ""I can't believe I left my homework at home,"" you can think, ""I'll tell my teacher what happened and bring it in tomorrow. And anyway, I've got drama club later today, which will be really fun.""
You can also decide that you’ll spend some time later, at home figuring out how to deal with this issue fully.

, Strong friendships can make school much more manageable. You might not be able to talk to friends during class, but try to connect with them during lunch or between classes if you can.It can be useful to get or give a hug when you’re having a bad day.
If it’s possible during a break, you can write a note or send a text to a friend. But don’t do this during class, course. A note can be a way to vent, such as, “Today just seems to go on forever!” or to express care for someone, such as, “I wish you were in English with me. I always feel lonely in that class.”

, Some teachers will understand that when you’re having a really bad day you may need a break. After all, they’ve had bad days, too. If you have a teacher whom you trust, you could say something like, “I know that what we’re doing is important but I’m having a really hard time focusing today. Would it be okay if I took a short break and came back in ten minutes?”Taking a break might mean sitting quietly in the back of the room with your head down, or sitting in the hall by yourself for a few minutes.
Taking a break could mean going to the library, the nurse, or the guidance counselor’s office until you feel ready to come back to class.

, When you get home you might be coming into a house full of parents, siblings, pets, or even friends. Before you engage with others, try taking some time to yourself to cool off.Gently tell your family that you had a bad day and need some time by yourself. You can say something like, “I had a really hard day today. I think I need a little bit of time to myself right now. You don’t need to worry, though. I’ll let you know if I need to talk about anything.”

, You probably spent most of the day at school dreaming about being home and doing something that you’d rather be doing. Take advantage of your time at home and do something that feels good to you.You could do an art or craft project or play an instrument.
You can listen to music or watch TV or a movie.
Get outside for some fresh air or exercise. If you’ve spent all day indoors at school, being outside can feel very refreshing.

, It’s possible that your parents are the last people you want to talk to about your bad day. However, if your bad day was caused by serious issues, such as bullying, being picked on by a teacher, or because you’re actually struggling with one of your subjects, you need to let your parents know what’s going on.If you’re being bullied, your parents may need to step in and talk to the other parents or to the school administration.
If you’re struggling with your studies, your parents may be able to talk to your teacher about possible causes or arrange for you to get extra help or tutoring.
You may even want to talk to your parents about minor things that made your day bad. They’ve had plenty of their own bad days and may have some helpful advice for you.

, Do what you can to make sure that tomorrow is a little better. This usually means getting plenty of sleep so that you can start the next day refreshed.Study for the next day. Even if you don’t have a test the next day, you’ll feel good if you’ve reviewed your work and are ready for tomorrow’s class.
Do what you can at night to make the next morning less stressful. Lay your clothes out, pack your lunch and prepare your bookbag. This way, you won’t be scrambling to get ready in the morning.

, It can be helpful to identify not just what made your day bad, but also what makes a day good. That way, you can try to take positive steps toward having more good days. Some things that might make a good day are:Having gotten enough sleep
Wearing your favorite outfit
Getting to sit next to a friend on the bus
Having your homework finished on time
Having plans with a friend to look forward to after school

, School is a lot of work and being organized can help you stay on top of all of it. Create systems that will help you manage your school work and prepare for each day so that you can avoid being overwhelmed or falling behind.Designate a time each evening to review your assignments and study or complete your homework.
Put your lunch box, book bag, and anything else you need in the same place each evening, so that you know where it is in the morning.
Use a wall calendar to keep track of assignments, dates of tests, and your weekly schedule.

, You’re likely to have a better day at school if you’ve got other things going on that make you happy. For example, if you are on a sports team that you enjoy or you take fun after school classes, you know that you have other things to look forward to. If you don’t have extracurricular activities that you enjoy, consider signing up for some.Look into after school clubs at your school. There may be academic clubs, a student government, or a club that takes fun trips.
Look into art or music classes in your town. These can be fun and can offer a way to express yourself creatively.
If school sports are too competitive for you, consider joining a team or league outside of school.

, You might not think you have enough time for exercise since you have to get up so early to get to school. However, even a short walk, jog, or bike ride can give you a burst of energy and endorphins that will put you in a better mood for the school day.You can shoot some baskets in your driveway or take your dog for a walk before school.
You can put on your favorite music and dance around your room.
You can get to school early and run around the track.

Find a support system.",How to Get Out of Special Education," If you weren't placed in special education recently, you may not remember much about the placement process. Learning about the laws may seem hard at first, but if you really want to get out of special education, it will be useful for you to learn about the legal issues and the placement process.Your first step is to learn about your IEP. This stands for Individualized Education Program. Your IEP is a written plan made after you were tested for special education. It lists your educational needs and outlines a plan for meeting those needs.
Throughout your time at school, there will likely be several meetings of people involved with your IEP. One or both of your parents will attend these meetings, as well as a general education teacher and a special education teacher.
In some cases, you (the student) will also attend the IEP meeting. This would be a good place for you to ask questions about moving out of special education.;
, If you are trying to change your school plan, you should know about the basic laws that regulate special education. When you talk to your parents or teachers about getting out of special education, they might mention laws, or terms like FAPE. By learning about these laws beforehand, you will be ready for these conversations.


FAPE stands for ""Free Appropriate Public Education"". It is a right that applies to every kid in every state in the United States, as part of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA).FAPE says that you should get an education that will meet your needs. That means if you have been diagnosed with a learning disability (LD), the school needs to find a way to teach you effectively. Sometimes that means getting lessons outside of the regular classroom.

, Under federal and state laws, your school is required to provide you with what is called a ""least restrictive environment"" (LRE). This means that the school must figure out which services you need and how to provide you with those services.Special education is not necessarily a place, but rather a set of services. That means that you might spend parts of your day in different classrooms in the school, or just meeting with a different teacher. It's not about going to one special classroom, but about getting help to learn in a way that helps you to do well.
The school needs to figure out the best way to meet your needs while you are alongside students without additional needs. If that can't be done, you may be ""pulled out"" of the classroom to meet with a special education teacher.
Your IEP team is in charge of determining your LRE. They will decide where you need extra help outside of the regular classroom, or if you can just get help in your normal classes.

, Whether or not you are in charge of your education depends on your age. If you are under the age of 18, your parents will almost certainly have legal power over your education. If you are legally a minor, you will need your parents' permission to get out of special education.Each state has different laws about at what age you are considered a legal adult. In most states, you are legally an adult when you turn 18. You can check the website Sex Etc to find out the rules about the age of majority in your state.If you are 18 or older, you can legally be in charge of decisions regarding your education. You will still need to talk to your IEP team about making changes.

, As your legal guardians, your parents have the final say in whether or not you are in special education. If you do not live with your parents, your legal guardian might be a relative or foster parent. If that's the case, the legal guardian is the person who can request to remove you from special education.The school district needs to have permission from your parents to test you, or place you in special education. Your parents have the right to take away their permission at any time.
In most school districts, your parents must take away their permission in writing. This means that your mom can't just call one of your teachers and ask for you to be placed in the general classroom.
Each school district follows its own rules and policies. Ask your IEP team if there is a special form that your parents must fill out in order to stop giving permission.
It is important for your parents to understand that they cannot pick and choose which of the suggested programs you stay in.For example, your parents can't decide to take the IEP-recommended help in Math, but not in English. Your parents can elect whether to have you in special education at all, but they can't decide they only want you to have services in one area and not another, if both were recommended by the IEP team. The IEP team has to make those kinds of decisions as a whole. If your parents stop giving permission, the school district must stop providing special education services to you, so you might lose some options that really do help you.

, You may feel like you do not need to be in special education. It is normal to feel that way, especially if most of your friends are in a different classroom. However, it is a good idea to think about the positive parts of being in special education.When you are thinking about trying to get out of special education, think about the ways that it is useful to be there. Try making a list.
Write down the good things. For example, you might say, ""It is great to be in a smaller classroom. There is always a teacher available to answer my questions.""
You might also think about how your needs are being met. For example, you might say, ""I know I sometimes have trouble concentrating. It's nice to have a teacher who understands how to help me focus.""
Remember that being tested and placed in special education is a lengthy process. If you decide to leave the program, you might not be able to easily get back in.

, A good special education program can actually help you focus, learn, and thrive in school. However, if you don't feel like it's the right place for you, think about your motivations for getting out. If you are under 18, you will need your parents or legal guardian to help you with the process. In order to get permission, you will have to convince your parents that getting out of special education is right for you.Before you talk to your parents, think carefully about your reasons for wanting to leave special education. Try making a list of your reasons.
Think about what you like and dislike about school. Use these preferences and feelings to help explain why you don't want to be in special education.
Write down your feelings. For example, you could write, ""I feel like I am doing better work in the general classroom.""
Maybe you are thinking about your future. For example, you could write, ""I want to prepare myself for college. I think I can do that better outside of special education.""

, It can be scary to have a serious conversation with adults. Even if you have a great relationship with your parents, it can still make you feel nervous to bring up an important topic. Take some time to figure out what you want to say.Preparing to talk to your parents about your education can make you feel less nervous. It's a good idea to take some time to plan in advance what you want to say.
Write down your main points. You can use your list of feelings and ideas from before. You can say, ""I want to get the best education possible, and I feel like that will be in the general classroom.""
Practice what you want to say. Talk to yourself in the mirror or ask a friend to listen to you practice your argument.

, Your teacher can be very helpful in this situation. After all, your teacher is familiar with both your strengths and your needs. Try talking to your teacher about what you want to get out of your education.Be respectful. Try saying, ""Mr. Smith, I want to talk to you about the classes I'm in. Can I make an appointment to speak to you?""
Be honest. You can say, ""Mr. Smith, I feel like it would benefit me to leave the special education program.""
Ask questions. Ask for specific information. For example, you can say, ""What do I need to do to be moved out of special education?""
You can also ask for support. Try saying, ""Would you be willing to talk to my parents on my behalf?""

, After you have gathered your information and thought about your feelings, it is time to approach your parents. Your goal is to have a positive, constructive conversation. Make sure to make your needs clear.Choose a good time. Try saying, ""Mom, I have something I'd like to discuss with you. Do you have time to talk after dinner?""
Try not to be emotional. This is obviously a really important conversation, but if you stay calm and clear-headed, your parents will be more likely to listen to you.
Explain your point of view. You can say, ""Dad, I feel like I will learn a lot more in the general classroom. It's something I would like you to consider letting me try.""
Avoid yelling or getting upset if you don't get the answer you want. This won't make your parent or guardian think that you should be in general education classes.

, There are several things you can do to make these conversations better. Whether your are talking to your parents or your teachers, there are steps you can take to communicate effectively. Be prepared to communicate verbally and non-verbally.Be prepared. Whenever you are having an important conversation, it is helpful to figure out what you want to say. Don't be afraid to carry some notes with you.
Use non-verbal cues. You can show people that you are engaged in the conversation by maintaining eye contact and using facial expressions. If making eye contact is difficult for you, try faking eye contact by looking at another feature on the person's face, such as their nose or their chin.
Listen carefully. You want to show respect by listening to what your parents and teachers have to say. Feel free to ask questions if you don't understand their points.

, Even if you have good reasons for wanting to be in general education classes, you probably won't be allowed to be in them unless your grades are stable and your teachers can say that you aren't having any problems. Show up to school on time every day and be prepared to learn.



Keep your grades high. Aim to get As and Bs in your class or classes. If your grades are Cs or lower, the school may not want to put you in regular education because they're worried that you'll fail.
Participate in class activities. Don't sit grumpily at your desk if you're doing a subject you don't want to do. Participate in the activity - raise your hand, ask questions, and work with your classmates when allowed. This will show your teacher that you're able to work well in the classes that you have already.
Don't goof around! If you spend more time passing notes or making silly faces at your classmates than working, you're more likely to be viewed as a distraction to your classmates than as a student who should be in general education.

, Your parents or teachers might want you to show that you are ready to get out of special education. There are several things you can do to show that you are a successful student. Making a study plan is one way.You want to let them know that you are serious about improving your education. Show your parents and teachers that you can take responsibility for your learning.
Write down a schedule. Block out specific times of the day when you will study.
Try studying in small blocks of time. For example, work on your Biology homework for half an hour. Then take a break before you come back to your Spanish homework.

, Reading is one of the most effective ways to learn. No matter what you are reading, you will increase your knowledge base. Spend more time reading so that you will be better prepared to succeed in school.Read things that you enjoy. For example, if you are learning about the Civil War in school, ask your librarian to help you find a novel about that time period.
It's possible that learning might be hard for you. If that's the case, practice will help.
Devote some time each day to reading. This will help show your parents that you are serious about learning.

, Some students may have trouble managing what they're feeling and get placed in special education for that reason. This doesn't mean you should hide your feelings and pretend that nothing's wrong when you're upset, but it's important to find ways to stop an outburst before it happens.


For example, if you're autistic, notice what things will overstimulate you. Do crowded rooms cause you to have a meltdown because of all the people around you? Does the sound of the school bell upset you and make you start crying? Learn what will trigger a meltdown or shutdown for you and find ways to avoid it or cope with it - for example, don't go to large school assemblies, or bring earplugs and your stim toy to school with you for when the bell rings.
If you have emotional problems, try to figure out what triggers them. When someone yells, for example, do you start yelling back? Watch for warning signs that you're getting angry or upset, and use coping strategies (such as focusing on something else, deep breathing, or meditating) to calm yourself down.

, A big part of doing well in any classroom is learning how to get along with other people. If you fight a lot with other students, or even just ignore them, you're not showing your teacher and parents that you're ready to be in a general classroom.


When you're given a group project or activity, try to work with everyone else and do your part. Talk to your fellow group mates and try to get everyone working together. This can be tough for some people, though, so don't worry if you have trouble with working with people;
Consider trying to help other students. Listen closely to your teachers' directions so you can follow them, and try to get your classmates to follow them, too. Be supportive and helpful to others. One of the best ways to show you know something is to teach it to someone else. However, be careful with how you do this. If someone asks a question, don't spring out of your chair and start blurting out the answer - that won't make your teacher happy with you!
Socialize outside of the classroom if you can. Talk to people at lunch and outside of your lessons. This is a great way to show you're a team player, but the benefits of making friends go beyond the classroom. Making friends will help you build a support system, too.
Don't react strongly to bullying. Unfortunately, there are mean people in school, both in and out of special education classes. Special education students are more likely to be picked on by bullies,but how you react to someone bullying you may be thought about by the IEP team. If somebody calls you a name or takes away your things, hitting them is a bad way of dealing with bullying. Instead, walk away, even if you're upset, and tell the teacher that someone is bothering you. Don't worry about being a ""tattletale"" - it doesn't matter who you are, bullying is never okay, and telling someone about bullying isn't ""tattling"".

, It can be really frustrating to be in a situation that you don't like. For example, you might be unhappy in your special education classroom. Find people that you can talk to about your feelings.Talk to the guidance counselor at your school. They might be able to help you deal with your feelings.
Have fun with your friends. When you are frustrated, you might feel better if you do something fun with people you enjoy.
Talk to a family member. If you're having trouble getting through to your parents, try asking an aunt or uncle to help you talk to them.

, Ask your friends to bring any they have over, as you can role play with them!

, You can use such items as fake grass, leaves, flowers or vines to make one part of the house look like a forest. Make some pillow forts to serve as Clan Camps. If wished, you could hang up images of cats from the books.

, Warriors normally dip their head to greet someone, so you can dip your head in greeting when they come in.

, You can use soft toys or you can pretend to be the cats yourself. If you have a good amount of friends coming over, there can be multiple clans and you can play-battle. Or, if you only have one or two friends coming over, you can be Loners or use the soft toys.

, You could set up a tent outside and use it as a Clan Camp. Or, you could stay inside and make pillow forts with sleeping bags inside. Each sleeping bag can be a 'Den', but since you're all very special, you can each have your own den and feel like Clan leaders for the night.

, Of course, you're guests are going to get hungry. To keep it Warriors-themed, you could have mainly meat-based products. Call it ""fresh-kill"".

, In the evening, you can browse online for Warriors related things, continue role playing, or you could read the books together (ask friends to bring the books you don't have yet).

, Exchange some midnight snacks and gossip, but not about whether or not your Clan is starving, but about the average sleepover stuff, like cute boys or the most annoying teacher at school, but don't fight too much at the Gathering; StarClan, (your parents) will get annoyed!

, In the morning when they leave, tell them that you hope StarClan will light their path.

What you want to achieve this year or what you want to do in your life. Remember: Dream big - really big. Stick it up on the wall or on your cork board, in your workplace. That way, when you feel discouraged,your goals will motivate you to achieve them.;
, Summarize what the teacher is saying. Write down the important points rather than the unnecessary information. Don't pay much attention to spelling and grammar. This is just a rough draft of your summary.

, There is no point in going to school to learn, if you're going to leave the class in a confused mess. When students do not understand a concept, they usually don't accomplish well in their exams. Do not be afraid to ask. Teachers are always more than happy to help.

, Don't go around passing notes to your friends, doodling on your notebook or twiddling with your pencil. You won't understand a single thing, and when it comes to exams and homework, you'll be begging your friends for help.

, Homework usually revisits the essential concepts that must be learned.Try making homework time fun. Bringing along friends can be fun too. Just don't start chatting, instead of working! Do not copy your friend's answers. You will not learn. Avoid any distractions that you may encounter while doing your homework and be sure to focus.

, When studying and doing homework, you can't go on forever. Information just won't stick in your head. Instead, have 10 minute breaks every hour or so. Do whatever. Read, exercise, write or even lay down. Just make sure that what you do doesn't set you off task.

, Rewriting the notes you took in class on the same day, allows the information to stick in your head. Make sure you understand everything you write. If you don't, make sure you ask your teacher the next day. Reading your notes won't get the information a hotel room in your brain.

, Using colored pens always makes things fun. Make sure you have subheadings and vocabulary in different colors. Try to write things in your own words rather than copying straight out of the textbooks. Make your notes neat and organized.

, Keep a binder for each major subject. Type up all your notes and summaries. Make them pretty. Put the vocabulary in bold type or italics. Again, make sure you are typing it actively rather than passively. It needs to glue into your brain. Put on some music for some extra fun.

, This amazing music is especially made by the superb composer: Dennis Kuo. It was created for hard-working students to listen to while studying. The beautiful music is a must for any study session.

, Buy an organized workstation and a comfy chair. Not too comfy, though. Boxes, drawers and shelves are great way to arrange things in an organized manner. Label boxes and put a cute pen cup on your desk. Good lighting is an essential must. You don't want to get tired while doing homework because you can't see. A cork board or whiteboard is good too. You can put up a calendar and write down important dates. Corking up your goals list is a great idea too. Add some pictures of family and friends.

, This is more organized than cramming everything into one large, heavy binder. Have tabs like: homework, tests/quizzes, etc... Have some loose leaf paper and plastic sleeves at the back. Keep your notebook at the front as well as your weekly timetable. Don't forget to be creative: decorate the inside and outside of your binder.

, This is a real must. You cannot rely on your memory. Jot down due dates, homework, your weekly timetable and test dates. Keep this 'book of miracles' with you and make sure you actually use it! It is a guarantee that you will never forget about homework again.

, Pile things neatly and put a shelf or two (unless you have a small locker). Put in a pen cup and a magazine file with your notebooks inside. Clean out your locker every week. Decorate your locker as cute as possible. (Optional). Try not to put food inside so your locker doesn't stink.

, Make sure it is big enough for all your books and binders. Lots of pockets will also help you organize your belongings. Put the larger and heavier objects closest to your back so that you can spread the weight over your shoulders.

, When it comes to tests, teachers love to ask their students for definitions. Memorize the meanings of the main concepts.

, Write when you will do homework, when you will study and when you will have breaks. Especially when you panic, this method will help you calm down and realize that there is enough time to complete everything. It also gets your tasks done quicker.

, Memorize those formulae and do an endless amount of exercises. Practice is the key to math. There isn't another way to study math and many people do not realize that until years of school.

, Tutoring isn't only for the 'dumb' kids. Tutoring can help even the best of students to further understand the given topic. An hour or two a week is usually sufficient to refresh your mind about what you are currently learning.

, Write down class notes and summaries, formulae and exercises, anything important when studying should go in either your binder or notebook.

, Put the question or word on one side and the answer or definition on the other. Have these in your pocket and test yourself wherever you are. Ask your parents to test you as well. Using flashcards is a helpful way of studying.

, Dictionaries, thesauruses, encyclopedias and math books are all essential when you need something to refer to while studying or doing homework.

, Always go to school happy to learn. Take pride in your work and always try your very best. Don't ever copy those lazy students who do not care for their priceless education. They are the ones that will regret it when they are older and you will have the better job in your life; achieving the best.

, If your art class or soccer training is getting in the way of your schoolwork, then you better take it aside. It doesn't have to be permanent; it can be temporary. Because as you know, school always comes first.

, This useless 'technique' never works. Studying at least 3 days before is more successful. Cramming too much information into your brain causes you to have 'mind blanks' during the test. No-one likes these little devils as they cause you to panic in a test.

, These bright, handy tools are excellent for reminding you to do things. Putting little tabs in your textbook can tell you the important pages to study. They can also help to remind you about what you need to do.

, Mind maps are a great way to summarize information. PowerPoint is fantastic for notes and summaries as you can choose how many slides you want on a page.

, Invest in a cheap folder to file away those old worksheets and papers. In future years, you will definitely need to refer back to them.

, In the bus or during that boring visit to your grandma's - study. It always recovers you from boredom and it makes the best use of your time. Carry around some flashcards for that spare moment. It all adds up at the end.

, Studying with friends can always be fun! Testing each other is a great way to learn. Make sure you do not get distracted, though.

, Write a list of the people in your clique (generally 3-5 people) that you'd like to invite. Then, make invitations. These can be on Facebook, e-mail, text, phone, IM, or face-to-face, but e-mail or mail is usually best. E-mail invites can sometimes can be tacky, so if you choose to use them, use a fancy brand like Papyrus, and send them out.

, Pick a big room so you can do a variety of things. Pick one far away from your parents room so you won't wake them up. DO NOT have it in your bedroom, as personal things will be messed with or misplaced. Also, it's impossible to fit your entire clique onto your bed. Another bad place to have it is in your living room. It may seem perfect because it has a TV, couches, carpet, all that stuff, but it makes your party less private because when you and your friends could be gossiping your parents could be eating next to you. A great place to hold a sleepover in your house is a furnished basement.

, Move all the furniture that will interfere with the sleepover out or to the edges of the room. Dust the remaining furniture and vacuum the carpet/flooring. Set some sweet pea or lavender candles out on a small table or counter. Keep it away from the sleeping area of the room. Lay some comfy blankets on the floor around the room. Close the doors to the room to keep it untouched.


Remember, no movies allowed! Massie specifically said in ""Invasion of the Boy Snatchers"" that DVDs are off limits at her sleepovers. Still, keep the remote near unless you want to watch some TV.

, This formation makes it easy to talk and distribute gossip points. If you did not provide the other sleeping bags, put place-cards to where everyone else should put their bags. Make yours at the ""head"" of the room, being the host and alpha. Put your beta's right beside you.

, Put all of the best snacks on a large table in the main room. Have a snack bowl for each guest full of their favorites. Ask ahead what kind of drinks your clique likes. Make sure you have healthy snacks and junk food. Everyone needs sugar to stay up. If you can afford it get big sushi platters (custom to what your clique wants), put them in cute colorful bowls. If you can't afford some of the expensive food try cheese and crackers, a bag of shrimp from H-E-B, and for drinks try vitamin water or Sprite with a bottle or Grenadine. Great drink choices are Italian sodas or French lemonade.

, Once you have all your supplies, make different stations. A spa station, an eating station, a game station, and a sleeping station. Your friends will love how organized you are! Get together a bunch of magazines, you don't want your friends to be bored. If you have a pool in your house, tell everyone to bring a swimsuit.

, If you really want to be like Massie Block, go to sleep in a satin-like robe and a sleeping mask.

, Put lit scented candles in the bathroom, put a new roll of toilet paper on the holder, make sure the soap container is full, and keep fresh towels in the bathroom. Only put shampoo, conditioner, and body wash that you want the guests to use in the shower/tub. Avoid confusion by not making guests feel overloaded by tons of old, raunchy containers of shampoo. Also, give the bathroom a spritz of room spray to match the candles' scent. Make sure that you're close to the bathroom so it allows easy bathroom-breaks and no rushing.

Keep in touch with your school counselor throughout the school year.,
Understand the reasons why a student would attend summer school.,
Acknowledge that summer school is ""squeezed time"".,
Attend class every day.,
Take strong notes.,
Allow to give yourself a break.,
Take Physical Education/Gym during summer school, if possible.,
Use summer school as a way to redeem yourself.",How to Succeed in Summer School," They are your advisers and can guide you through the best schedule route to take in order to succeed. They may modify their decisions based on your class grades and offer advice if you need to attend summer school or not.;
, Over half of the students attend simply to make up a class they have failed or repeat a class needed to graduate high school. Other students prefer to take courses to get ahead in their grade or to advance & allow potential college courses in their high school schedule. If a student plans their high school schedule correctly with summer school, and passes all classes, they may have the chance to graduate earlier than their expected year.

, Majority of the schools only offer classes for four to six weeks, usually cut in half as ""Session One"" and ""Session Two"". In reality, this means cramming an entire school year's worth of study in that allotted time.


It is as hard on the teacher as much as the student, as they need to prepare tight curriculum in the time frame. Because of this, you may see yourself going through double the amount of work/chapters.

, It does a burden on the body when there are no breaks, but attending class will give you the utmost experience needed. Summer school dropouts and poor attendance are the most common reasons and results of why schools do not offer classes to begin with.


Go to bed early. Allow between 8 1/2 to 10 hours of sleep, which means if the school day starts at 8 am, be prepared to hit the bed between 8 and 9:30 pm the previous night.
Never consume caffeine/energy drinks to ""stay up"" and study. You might stay up for a prolonged time to review lessons, but in the end, you will not get the proper sleep your body needs and may end up crashing in class.
Have time for a good nutritious breakfast before leaving the house.

, Because of the heavy amount of material needed to be studied, ask the teacher if you are allowed to bring a tape recorder with you so you can record notes. Write down important key lines; avoid trying to remember everything at once.


Get your family and friends to test you. If you need to complete a ""Chapter Review"" page for homework, have them browse through the chapter (or previous ones) and choose random problems for you to solve.

, Studying and learning all the time are bound to drive a student insane and not wanting to focus anymore. Have a social life during the summer with friends or outdoors - but don't let it overtake your studying time away. Try enrolling in a summer afternoon class, organization, or activity that starts after summer school. This way, you can have the fun and a structured schedule at the same time.

, In many schools, Physical Education (P.E.) is being included in high school graduation requirements. To get it out of the way and still get the credits for it, take it prior to your incoming freshman year. By doing this, you would only have to do it for a month or so, while your other classmates are required to attend an entire school year.

, If you have failed a class, don't shrug it off for the next school year. Make this as a second opportunity to do something good for yourself and be a better student.

Don't make a scene if your parents don't agree straight away. They may need time to think about it and if you throw a tantrum, that'll color their view negatively.;
, Invite all your close friends. Don't invite someone just because they are one of the ""popular group"", because they will either make it awkward or might play mean tricks. Invite only people you trust to come to your house.


Check with your parents how many people you're allowed to invite over.

, The best way to make sure everyone can come is to, before you send out invitations, ask everyone if they are free on the date planned.

, These can be made at home using a printer or you can purchase them if preferred. Write in the date, time, place and the names of each person invited. If they need to bring anything, make that clear too. Send the invitations out with plenty of time to spare.


A cute invitation idea: Pink and purple with cute red hearts.
It helps to remind your friends to bring PJs, sleeping bag and a pillow. If they also need to bring a stuffed toy, costume, DVDs, snacks, etc., write it down too.

, If you want something scary then play ""Nightmare on Elm Street"". If you're going to play a funny girl's movie then play ""Pitch Perfect"".

, Snacks are important. If you and your friends like spicy food then make some popcorn with chili pepper. If you like cheese, then get some crackers and make cheese dip.


Go to your local store and grab some junk food and soda! Cookies, soda and candies are essential. Also make sure that there are at least a few healthy options to eat such as fruit, juice and smoothies.

, Get drinks, cake, food, make up, games, CDs, and some movies. When you are at the store, be sure to get some nice air freshener too, you don't want your house to smell unpleasant.

, Prepare space for your guest to sleep. If you have a blowup mattress than get that for your guest and prepare it before they arrive. If you are going to have a movie marathon, maybe set your living room out to sleep there with your guests so if you or your guest/s get tired you and your guest/s don't have to go to the trouble to go your beds and can just fall asleep right where you are.

, Make sure you have some good things planned out to do while your guest/s are there as it can become boring when there isn't anything to do. Maybe have a board game, video games, movie marathon, makeovers, karaoke night, etc. That way there isn't much chance really of you or anyone else getting bored.

, Try such activities as using bikes or scooters. Run around outside playing tag or other games. Roll down hills. Toss candy in the air and try to catch it in your mouth.


If it's summer, try swimming and water games.

, Have a mini trampoline inside for bouncing up and down. Have a pillow fight using pillows as shields and long pillows as swords. Prank call your classmates (friends only though!). Make a fort. Hang out inside the fort.


Cook breakfast together in the morning.

, Set up a big table for the drinks, food, and cake. Grab your cutest pajamas and softest blanket. Make sure your party room looks totally hot with posters, cool lights, and make up stations.

, Set a good image for yourself and smile lots. If you're rude, than people might remember your slumber party as bad, instead of an unforgettable night of awesomeness.

, Give the party guests a tour of the party room or area, so that they feel comfortable. Do all events in order to keep the party organized and under control.

, If you make new friends, you'll grow a great reputation. If you throw great parties, you will soon be very popular!


Have fun! Don't be all uptight and have a schedule for when certain things need to happen. Chill out, have fun and get a little sleep if possible, that's if you're not pulling an all-nighter!
If you're going somewhere with your guest/s the next day and have to wake up to be ready by a certain time, make waking them up fun! Sing a silly song, spray them with silly string, you get the idea.

, This will finish the event beautifully. Include things that you know your friends will enjoy, such as candies, scented erasers and small bottles of nail polish.

, you should go to bed at this time so you can wake up early and be happy-cheery. Plan a vibrating phone alarm in your pocket (or nearby in your sleeping bag if there is no pockets) so you can get up first to put breakfast on plates and make sure you are presentable.

, You should be up first, by at least 30 minutes. Wake at 8:00A.M and do your makeup. Get dressed, then head to the kitchen. Make breakfast or get it ready and put it on a serving tray. If you are allowed to eat outside of the kitchen, take it the sleepover- room. If not, set out the appropriate silverware and plates for the meal and put it all on the breakfast table. Go wake up everyone else if they aren't already awake. Make sure you're in a different outfit than yesterday and that you didn't reuse ANY part of it. Shoes + Designer bag included.

, Make sure that you're not just sitting around waiting for them to leave! Either be on Facebook as a group, gossiping, on a Wii, or something else. Most importantly, you should be doing something fun and easy. Don't have many crafts in the morning, as they will be tiresome and messy.

, You should have party favors of some sort, whether it be store bought, like lipgloss, or not, like a craft you made. As the parent/guardian/driver comes to pick everyone up, walk your guests to the car and wave/hug goodbye to each.

Have your parents write a note.,
Pretend you've twisted your ankle.,
Say you've got a migraine.,
Forget your clothes or equipment.,
Don't use excuses too often.",How to Avoid Physical Education Class1," When trying to get out of your physical education class, you might try asking your parents to write an excuse. Schools and physical education teachers will often accept parent's notes as valid excuses. Try asking your parents to help you skip the occasional gym class by getting them to write you a note.


You might have your parents write a note saying that you are sick and unable to participate.
Your parent might write a note saying that you sprained an ankle or wrist and need time to heal.;
, A classic method you can use to get out of a physical education class is to pretend your ankle was injured. You wouldn't be required to participate if your ankle were actually injured. For this reason, successfully faking an ankle injury can get you out of a physical education class.You might try limping when you walk to help make the injury look real.
Don't get caught running or jumping as this will make it clear that you aren't injured.

, Headaches and migraines are often very painful, preventing you from engaging in physical activity. Normally, you would avoid the exertion that physical education classes demand, waiting for your headache to pass. Faking a headache can get you the same break and let you skip a class due to your “migraine”. Rubbing your forehead with your palm can help express the idea that your head hurts.
Don't move around too much while you are having your “headache”.
Remember to make your face look as if you were actually having a headache. You don't want to overact though.

, Often times you will be required to wear athletic clothes or shoes in order to participate in your class's activities. If you forget your clothes or equipment, you might not be allowed to play. Conveniently “forgetting” your clothes can be a simple way to get out of a physical education class.This excuse may not always work, depending on the instructor and the class activity. Some schools supply spare clothes for physical education classes, so use this excuse only if you are sure that your school doesn't do this.
Swimming classes are the most likely activity where this tactic will work.

, The more often you use excuses, the less likely they are to work. You may also fail your physical education course if you miss too many classes. Only skip gym class once in a while to avoid hurting your grades and to keep your excuses effective.


Keep an eye on your grades. Don't skip physical education classes if it will cause you to fail.
Using the same excuses every gym class will cause your instructor to question if you really are unable to participate.

Remain calm.,
Go fast, but don’t run.,
Be vigilant once you get outside.,
Be careful where you spend time after sneaking out.,
Take precautions if you choose to re-enter the school.,
Have an excuse.,
Avoid bragging about sneaking out.,
Prepare to accept the consequences if you get caught.",How to Sneak out of Your School Without Getting Caught," If you plan on sneaking out of school, you'll need to spend some time familiarizing yourself with your surroundings. This can help you formulate an escape route that will minimize your risk of getting caught sneaking out.


Watch out for cameras. Many schools have security cameras around the school, especially near doors and exits. Be aware of where the security cameras are in your school and how to best avoid triggering them. For example, if you notice a security camera near the front exit you might be able to make use of trees and other shrubs to avoid setting the camera off.Be aware of all possible exits for your school. There may be exits in places you would not expect, such as in the locker room or basement. Try to find an exit that people rarely use. You are less likely to run into a teacher or other student if you leave through an exit that tends to get less traffic.Watch for windows. You want to know where precisely all the windows in your school are located. You do not want to successfully bypass cameras only to be seen by a teacher through the window as you make your way out of your school.;
, Timing is just as important as your escape route. Pay attention to what time might be best to sneak out.


Know when exits tend to be most crowded. If there's an exit near the gymnasium, for example, it might not be a good idea to sneak out when a PE class is finishing. However, you may be able to easily sneak out when a PE class is in session if the doors are closed and you're unlikely to be seen.If your school allows upper class-men to leave campus for lunch and you're still a freshmen or sophomore, you may be able to duck out with the older students. You will not be listed as having left school and therefore no one will look for you when lunch period ends.It may be easier to sneak out during certain class periods depending on the teacher you have. If your study hall teacher does not require hall passes and is usually not particularly attentive, you may be able to sneak out during this class period without anyone noticing., Getting outside isn’t the end of your journey. You will need to pick a route that either keeps you completely out of sight. Conversely, you can also choose a path many people use. This way, if someone sees you there, they may not recognize you or realize that you shouldn’t be there.


You might sneak out when a different part of the school has class change. This way you will be able to blend into a crowd.
You could also choose to sneak out and take a low key route until you're out of sight of the school. If your school is near a wooded area, for example, you could go through the woods., Panicking when sneaking out can cause you to forget certain details. Remain calm despite the pressure of the situation to avoid getting caught.


Learn how to slip into autopilot. If you pay too much attention to your movements when nervous, you're likely to fail. Try to multiply numbers in your head or recite song lyrics as you move your way through the school. This will help you avoid stumbling or walking in an unnatural way that might call attention to you.Breathe normally. When nervous, people often neglect breathing or take sharp, shallow breaths. This can call attention to the fact you're hiding something. Take deep breaths as you would normally. If you notice your breathing becoming labored, pause for a moment to regroup.Try to ignore panic signals or reframe how you think of them. Try to tell yourself sweaty palms and an increased heart rate are not signs of failure. There just signs that you're taking a risk and doing something fun and exciting., Once the teachers turn away, get on your way. It is better to be quick and quiet rather than sprinting loudly out of the school. Keep a faster pace than usual without running or doing anything to call attention to yourself. Be prepared to duck into an empty doorway or stairwell if you hear someone coming down the hallway. Make sure you don’t duck into a spot where there is a camera.

, Once you get outside the school, keep up your vigilance until you're out of sight of school grounds. Watch out for windows, cameras, teachers, and fellow students. Follow the escape route you planned carefully to avoid a snag in the plan.

, Once you're safely away from the school, you should not throw caution to the wind. Try to lay low for the remainder of the day. You do not want to be seen by a parent, friend of a parent, or someone associated with the school taking a break or a day off.

, If you're only sneaking out for a few hours, take precautions when re-entering the school. Try to plan a similar escape route, one involving avoiding cameras and finding less populated entrances. You do not want to get caught re-entering the school after having successfully snuck out.

, Most schools keep track of attendance. If you sneak out, your parents might be notified if your absence is not accounted for. Find a way to come up with an excuse for being gone.


Try a fake phone call. You can call the school from a pay phone or your personal cell phone and claim to be your parent or guardian. However, be careful. Your school may ask certain questions to verify and the receptionist may recognize the sound of your voice.You can also send an e-mail to the school posing as your parents. It's fairly easy to set up an e-mail address using your parents first and last name. However, this method can fail as well. The school may call your home for verification. It may be best to include something like, ""I'm at work for the day, so call me at this number instead."" Then, put your own cell phone number.

, You may feel inclined to boast if you successfully snuck out of school. However, it's best to avoid bragging as a teacher or school official may overhear. Even if you tell your friends outside of school grounds, they may discuss it at school when you're not around.

, No means of sneaking out of school is foolproof. Even if you take precautions, there's still a good chance you'll get caught. Know the risks of sneaking out in terms of both your school's disciplinary policy and your parents likely reaction. Make sure it's worth the risk before committing to sneaking out.

Utilize bathrooms.,
Keep your mouth shut.",How to Wander the School or Skip Class Without Getting Caught," How does your school record absences? Do they call attendance in each class? If you have a teacher who regularly forgets to record attendance, you’ll have an easier time skipping their class than a class where the teacher has meticulous records.


Depending on the number of absences you’ve already accumulated, your school might not even care if you skip. If you’re a known skipper with many absences already stacked against you, proceed with caution.;
, Decide which class or classes you’ll be skipping. Plan where you will go to hide out. If you have access to hall passes, stock up on a few of these, as they may come in handy when wandering the halls.


Note where the cameras are in your school. If possible, avoid walking past them when you are supposed to be in class.
Do not skip classes where you have significant tests or projects due, as this only increases your chances of getting caught. If you’re skipping class to avoid having to turn in a project or take a test, you might be better off faking sick and not going to school at all. For tips on faking sick, check out this article.

, In the event that everything goes awry, you’ll need a credible excuse to fall back on. It doesn’t matter what your excuse is, as long as it’s believable and you’re committed to the lie.


If you’re a bad liar, keep the excuse as simple as possible. The best lies have elements of truth in them, so include truthful specifics in your falsehoods to make them easier to swallow. Don't use the dead relative excuse or the family emergency excuse, those excuses should be hinted weeks in advance, if you are planning your skip later. You could say that you were looking for something you lost if you absolutely need an excuse. If asked what you lost, say a key or a flash drive. , No matter what you’re doing, people are more inclined to trust and believe you if you act confidently. Be aware of your body language; walk tall with your head held up.Assuming an authoritative stance will make it easier for you to get out class undetected.

, If you pass someone in the hall during your skip, make sure to look them in the eye. Avoiding their gaze makes you appear suspicious and like you have something to hide (which you do.) Looking them in the eye puts them at ease and makes you appear trustworthy. , Wandering the halls or stopping to chat with friends only prolongs your escape and increases your chances of getting caught and sent back to class. Stick to your escape plan and remain focused during the entire execution.

, Do not hide somewhere obvious or somewhere teachers expect students to hide, like the cafeteria. Some schools have a music wing with practice rooms, which can be a good, safe and quiet option. Avoid highly populated areas or spaces that are out in the open.

, If you’re not planning on skipping the entire day, consider hanging out in a restroom. As long as you don’t draw attention to yourself, you should be able to stay there for a period or two without notice.


If someone enters the bathroom, keep your feet out of sight to avoid detection.
Switch stalls every so often, just in case someone is monitoring bathrooms to ensure no one is hiding inside.
Bring activities to keep your mind occupied (like a phone or a book) but make sure they are quiet and do not arouse suspicion amongst other bathroom goers.

, Talking about your successful skip day increases your chances of getting caught. If nobody knows you skipped school, nobody can rat you out. Refrain from bragging about your exploits; you don’t know who might be listening.

Check your school’s absence policy.,
Make a plan before you skip.,
Inform the school about an upcoming absence.,
Plan your transportation ahead of time.,
Know the best exits in your school.,
Split up if you are sneaking out with friends.",How to Skip School Without Parents Knowing1," Find your school handbook, or any packet of policy information that you’ve received, and review the attendance policy section. Specifically find out if they will call your parents if you have an unexcused absence. If they automatically call when you don’t show up, you’ll need to find a way to make sure your parents don’t get the call.


Get your hands on your parents’ phones and block the school’s number the day before you skip. Deceiving your parents and tampering with their phone can get you in big trouble, so weigh the risk before you do this.
If your school does not call when you’re absent, you won’t have to worry about your parents hearing from the school.
Skipping school frequently is called “truancy” and can get you suspended from school. You may have to go before a judge who can order mandatory counselling, extra school, detention, or probation. Skipping school can lead to truancy, which will remain on your permanent record.;
, Pick a specific day that you want to skip school, rather than deciding to skip spontaneously. Give yourself enough time to take some precautions and make arrangements. Take into consideration any tests or special events that you can’t miss.If you miss a big test or project that has a significant effect on your grade, your parents are much more likely to find out that you skipped.
A day when you don’t have much going on will have less consequences when you show back up to school than a day where something important is happening.

, One way to avoid having the school tell your parents that you skipped is to turn in a note for an excused absence a few days before you skip. Write the note in good handwriting and sign it with your parent’s name. Turning in an excuse note before you skip helps you avoid detection.


Practice your parent’s signature so it looks authentic.
Give a simple reason for why you will be gone. Say you are visiting a relative out of town, taking a one day vacation, or doing some work around the house.
Keep in mind that lying to the authorities at your school is never a good idea. If you lie about skipping, you may get in serious trouble.

, If you ride the bus to school, you need to come up with a way to get back home. If your house is close enough, you may be able to walk. Catch a city bus or get a cab if possible. Get a friend or older sibling to drive you home or wherever you decide to go.This is a tricky step, but it is important. If you get stuck at school with no way to leave, you really have no way to skip.
Another option is to tell your parents that a friend is picking you up that day so you don’t need to ride the bus. Then once your parents leave, just stay home.

, If you plan to leave after you are already inside the school, use a door that you aren’t likely to be seen using. If you know of a door that's out of the way and not a lot of people use, this is the best bet for sneaking out. Make sure there aren't a lot of exterior windows or teachers will see you leaving.


Your best bet is to not go inside the building at all, but if your parents drop you off or teachers see you when you arrive, sneaking out of the building is your only option.
You may even have to hide somewhere until school starts so you’re less likely to be seen walking out of the building.
If you get caught leaving school, the punishment could end up being worse than if you hadn’t shown up at all. Leaving school can be risky, so make sure it is worth it to you.

, When you're leaving school with friends, don't walk out of the door together. Go one or two at a time to avoid drawing attention. If possible, have everyone use a different door, too. Establish a meeting place and time, somewhere off of schools grounds, if you can.


If someone doesn't make it, assume they got caught. Don't go back toward the school to find them.
Meet as close to the school as possible but still off of school grounds. You don’t want to have to travel too far before you meet up.

Keep up the act to make it believable.",How to Skip School1," If you are going to pretend to be sick, tell your parents that you don't feel well a couple of days beforehand. Your sickness will be more believable if your parents see some symptoms before the actual sick day.


To fake a stomach ache, tell your parents that you may have eaten something bad at school.
To fake a cold, say that your throat has been feeling a little scratchy.
Amp it up the night before by waking up in the middle of the night and telling your parents that you’re feeling bad. Either mimic your stomach/cold symptoms from earlier in the day, or just say, “I feel like I’m getting sick” or “my body just doesn’t feel right.”;
, Get up a little later than you should. Tell your parents you’re not feeling so great. Act like you’re sick.


Walk around slowly, like your muscles are achy. Don’t fix your messy sleepyhead hair.
If you’ve been faking cold/flu symptoms, cough and sneeze a little and say you’re feeling dizzy. If you’ve been faking stomach symptoms, rub your stomach and moan that it hurts.
Don't eat too much breakfast. Sick people often lose their appetites, so this will help with the illusion.

, Your parents will probably want to check if you have a fever or not, since a fever can be the sign of true illness. To convince them you’re really sick, you’ll need to make them believe you have a temperature.


Before your parents ask to feel your forehead, wet a cloth and then heat it in the microwave for thirty seconds. Make sure that it’s cool enough not to burn you, and then put the towel on your forehead for a minute or so. This will heat up your head and body, and your forehead will be nice and warm.
Boil some water on the stove (this is only recommended for older kids). Pour the boiling water down the sink, and when steam rises, stand with your face over the sink until it feels flushed. This will warm up your face, and when cool air touches you, you’ll also feel clammy.


Do not put your face directly over a fire, stove, or boiling water to fake a fever. These methods can be unsafe and may result in burns.


Warm a mouth or underarm thermometer by rubbing it in your hands until it reaches about 99–101 °F (37–38 °C) (any higher and you might risk a trip to the hospital). You can also warm the thermometer under running hot water until it reaches a high temperature. , If your parents ask if you want to stay home, don't say yes immediately. You need to act like missing school is a really hard decision to make.


Think about it for a minute or two and say something like, ""But I want to go to PE."" Then tell them, ""On second thought, I'm not sure I can make it all day at school.""
When your parents agree to let you stay home, you are free to do whatever you want.

, Even though you have a day to yourself, you’ll still have to pretend to be sick all day long, at least while your parents are around.


Act really sick all morning long, then slowly pretend that you’re feeling a little better throughout the day.
The next morning, act like you still don’t feel your best, but are just strong enough to go to school.

Change your clothes without worry.,
Survive getting picked last.,
Manage a period.",How to Avoid Physical Education Class2," Many people feel uncomfortable changing their clothes in the locker room. Feelings of embarrassment, judgment, or anxiety can arise when faced with changing in the locker room. If you feel nervous about changing before gym class, you might try some of these tips to help maintain a feeling of privacy and comfort:


Try changing in a bathroom stall.
You can try wearing your shorts and t-shirt underneath your regular clothes.
Wear athletic clothes as part of your normal style.
For swimming class, wrap a towel around your waist and change into your trunks underneath it.
Some women put a sports bra on over their under-wire bra. The under-wire bra can then be taken off while wearing the sports bra., Team selection can be a real source of dread for anyone in a gym class. No one likes being the last person picked to join a group. Being picked last often results in feelings of lowered self-esteem or self-worth. However, it's important to keep things in perspective and stay positive, even though you may still feel hurt.Avoid getting angry or feeling resentful. Bad attitudes will only push people away and increase your negative feelings.
Connecting with a friend or your teammates can help you feel better about the initial rejection. Don't let getting picked last cause you to reject those around you.

, It may happen that you have your period during a gym class. This can make many people feel self-conscious and want to skip class. However, you can still participate during your physical education class and make it less stressful for you. Try using some of these tips to help you feel more comfortable:Use the stall to change any pads or tampons before class starts.
You may need to re-check after class as well.
If you have to shower or swim during gym class, you might consider using tampons.

"
"
Dress for class.,
Stick with your friends.,
Know that it's actually good for you.,
Check the minimum requirements.",How to Avoid Physical Education Class3," If you have to go to your physical education class, dressing for it properly can help make it more comfortable. If you wear your regular clothes, such as jeans or a sweatshirt, you might feel too warm or be unable to move well. Always pack some proper exercise clothes if you know that you must take a physical education class.


Bringing a t-shirt can be a good idea.
Wearing shorts or athletic pants can help you to stay cool and move freely.
Make sure you have some sneakers or athletic shoes that you can wear.

, If you have friends in your physical education class, sticking with them can help make the class less uncomfortable. You can talk with your friend while you are doing the class activities to help pass the time and keep your mind off the class. Try teaming up with or staying near your friends during physical education classes to help the class go smoothly.


Whenever you have to join a team, join one with your friend.
Any team activity can be done with a friend.
Try to stay near your friend during larger group activities such as basketball or kickball.

, Even though you may not enjoy your physical education class, focusing on the positive aspects of it can help. Exercise has many positive effects on both your physical and mental health. If you start to feel uncomfortable during a physical education class, try reminding yourself that you are getting these benefits from it:

, At some point, physical education classes may be optional. Each school will have it's own requirements when it comes to how many physical education classes you need in order to graduate. Ask your guidance counselor for more information, allowing you to learn if you need to take physical education in the first place. "

Act confident about what you are doing.,
Stay home instead of going out.,
Leave the house for awhile before your parents come home.",How to Skip School Without Parents Knowing2," Whether you answer the telephone at home, are questioned by a stranger about not being in school, or are asked something by a teacher, give a confident answer about not being there. If you sound suspicious, you are more likely to get caught.


Speak loudly and clearly rather than in a soft mumble. Give straightforward and simple answers so it doesn’t sound like you are making anything up.
If you answer the phone at home, disguise your voice so you sound sick or try sounding like one of your parents. Overall, it’s best not to answer the phone unless you know it’s very important.
If you are seen outside of school and are questioned about it, say, “I’m actually working on an assignment, so I was allowed to leave school. I’ve got to get this done quickly, though, so I can’t stay and talk.”
Say, “I’m on my way to an appointment, but I wanted to make a quick stop while I was passing through this part of town.”

, When you skip school, it’s tempting to go out on the town and have a lot of fun. The downside to this is you increase your chances of someone seeing you, maybe even your parents. Have a fun rest day at home so that no one will see that you aren’t at school.It may not sound fun to stay home all day, but think about how often you actually get the house to yourself. Take the time to do whatever you usually can’t do with people around.
Lounge around in your pajamas all day. Turn the TV up loud. Take a long bath without being bothered. Get a friend to skip with you and hang out together so you don’t get bored.
Being in school is important, and you will miss a lot if you skip. Make sure you make the day something to remember and use it wisely. You’ll regret skipping school if you waste the whole day.
Keep in mind that skipping school is never a good idea and the fun you might have is not worth the trouble you’ll get in if you get caught.

, If you go out for the day, make sure to come home around the time you normally do so your parents don’t question the time difference. If you stay home all day, go out somewhere so your parents don’t come home to find you there before you are usually home.


If your parents typically get home late, you may not need to leave because they’ll expect you to be there anyway.

Start acting sick the night before you plan to skip school.,
Spend a long time in the bathroom in the morning.,
Fake a fever reading on a thermometer.",How to Skip School Without Parents Knowing3," As the evening goes on, start to sneeze every so often. Blow your nose a lot in a place where your parents can hear you. If you start faking the symptoms of sickness the night before, your parents are less likely to question you when you say you’re sick in the morning.Sickness comes in various forms, with many different symptoms. Decide on a few to use, such as an upset stomach, sneezing, or nausea, but don’t go overboard with too many symptoms.
If your parents are very cautious, it may not be a good idea to pretend to be sick. They may get so worried that they rush you to the doctor immediately. If they know you lied about being sick, your punishment might be worse.
Lying to your parents about being sick is worse than skipping school and will break their trust in you.

, As soon as you wake up, go straight to the bathroom. Make noises as if you are sitting on the toilet and not feeling good at all. Pour some water in the toilet to simulate the proper sounds.Be sure to flush the toilet at least two or three times to enhance the effect.

, Heat up some tea and hold the thermometer against the outside of the mug until it heats up to 101℉ or 102℉ (38℃). Be sure not to let the thermometer read 104℉ (40℃) or more, as this causes alarm and may get you taken to the doctor. Be sure to add other fever symptoms like making yourself sweat a little and saying you feel cold.The combination of the fever reading on the thermometer, visible sweat on your forehead, and saying you are cold should be enough to convince your parent that you’re feverish without raising too much concern.

"
"
Know the risks.,
Leave school at the right moment.,
Keep an eye on the time.",How to Skip School2," Many schools have monitors, cameras, security guards, and teachers on the lookout for people leaving school. You may have to take some big risks if you decide to skip school this way.


Read up on your school’s rules before your skip day, and be ready for the consequences if you get caught.

, If you want to get off campus for the day, you need to get away when you are least likely to be noticed. This is usually when there are lots of students around.


Leaving at the very beginning of the day will probably get you noticed, since most kids are going into the school and not away from it.
Try going to your first class so you can at least be seen, and then slip away in between classes. You can also do this between afternoon classes, or around lunchtime.

, You don’t want to alert your teachers and parents that you haven’t been in class by being late coming back. While you’re out and about, check the time every so often to see how much free time you have left.


Give yourself enough time to change back into your school clothes (if you’ve changed out of them) and get back on school grounds by the time the last bell rings.
Be sure to turn up at the regular time and place your bus arrives or your parents pick you up at the end of the school day. If teachers see you and ask where you’ve been, say that you‘ve been in the bathroom sick or at an appointment. Just make sure your parents don't hear from a teacher that you weren’t in class.

"
"
Pretend not to finish your homework.,
Miss your bus.,
Change your parents' alarm.",How to Skip School3," In the morning, make a big deal about not completing a really important assignment - act panicked, pretend to cry, and furiously try to finish your work. If your parents see you so upset, they might take pity on you and let you stay home to do your homework.This won’t work with every parent. Some parents will send you to school so you can learn a lesson about finishing your work on time.

, If your parents expect you to get to the bus on your own, simply missing your ride will guarantee you a day off. Walk really slowly to the bus stop so you miss the bus, or just hide until the bus is gone and go back home.


You can also leave the house late (without making it look deliberate) and then run behind the bus, pretending that you don't want to miss the bus. Then, pretend to be sad that you missed your bus. If students in your school don't live in your area, you can roam around to avoid being caught by your parents. Otherwise, walk straight home and pretending to be sad, tell your parents that you missed your bus.
If your parents are strict, and are still at home after you were supposed to catch the bus, or if they come home from work midday, you will have to sneak around so they don’t know you aren't at school.
Know your risks! If your neighbour sees you missed the bus, they might tell your parents.

, This can be simple if you do it carefully, but it also poses some risks: you're almost sure to get found out, and you may make your parents late for work.


Take your parents’ alarm clock or phone while they’re sleeping and turn the alarm forward 1-2 hours. (So if the alarm is supposed to go off at 6am, change it to go off at 7 or 8am.) Then put the alarm back. When the alarm rings, your parents will panic about being late and (probably) won’t have time to take you to school.
If one parent sets the alarm, you’ll only have to change one clock or phone. However, if there are multiple alarms, you’ll have to change them all.

"
"
Fake a note from your parents.,
Talk about your fake missed day where teachers can hear you.,
Ask to make up the work you missed.",How to Skip School4," When you’ve skipped a school day, your school will want to know where you’ve been. Write a pretend note from your parents to explain why you missed a day.


You can choose any excuse that sounds real, like you had to go to a funeral, had a dentist appointment, or that a pet died.
Type the note instead of writing it by hand. Your handwriting probably doesn’t look like an adult’s handwriting to a teacher, so it won’t be convincing. Typing the note is safer, and it will also look more official.

, Make up really good details about the day you had when you were out of school - what happened, who you saw, how you felt. Then, use those details to have a conversation with your friends in earshot of a teacher.


Say things about how sad it was to see so many crying people at a funeral, or how long and annoying it was to get your teeth cleaned at the dentist.

, Most teachers know that kids skip school to get out of doing work, so your teachers will never guess that you skipped if you ask for makeup work the next day. This will also make you look a like a responsible student.


To make it even more believable, act like you really want to do the work, even if you don’t.

Follow your typical morning routines.,
Fit in with the older people.,
Pack an over-sized lunch with lots of goodies.",How to Ditch School and Take a Mental Break1," Get dressed, shower, and eat breakfast as if you are going to school.;
, Do not wear really tight skinny jeans and tight imitation prep tees like, American Eagle, Hollister, Abercrombie, or Aeropostale. You don't want to scream teenager from afar or even up close. You must dress like you are older, so pull out the old sweater, boots, looser skinny jeans. You might even wanna try sweatpants.


Girls: Do not wear jeans that look like they came out of a spray can; drop that. Wear preppy sweaters and fitted boot cut or loose denim. Trouser pants are better. You should wear minimal make up, lip stain, and mascara. Do not carry tote bags, but opt for medium sized purses that have structure. Avoid tacky-looking glittery or bags with childish designs as well.






Boys: Drop the baseball caps and skater styled sagging pants. Yes, this means you must use a belt and keep your boxers in tact. Wear some of your dad's shirts, or maybe his sports coat. You want to appear to be over the teen crowd.







, Fruits, sandwiches, and drinks would be ideal. If you snack a lot, think, it is going to be a fun 8 hours, you need energy to keep you alert.

If you get to school by yourself., this step will be easy.,
Bring some tape, a piece of plain white printer paper, and a sharpie/marker.,
If you wanted to walk around freely or bring a friend along, then continue reading.,
Make sure your friend is well educated on your plan, and that they won't snitch!,
Some of your classes will probably be far away from the bathroom you're hiding in; they would probably be extra classes, such as art or health.,
When the end of the day comes around, brainstorm a way to get out of the building without being caught.",How to Skip the Entire School Day While Never Leaving School," Walk into the school like it's any other day; be sure to stay calm! Instead of going to your locker, go into one of the bathrooms.;
, Write ""OUT OF ORDER"" on the piece of paper and tape it to the front of whatever stall you want to hide in. once this is done, simply duck inside the 'out of order' stall and wait.


Try not to make the 'out of order' sign look too similar to your own handwriting or you will get caught. Also if you have seen 'out of order' signs on the stalls before, copy them to further reduce suspicion.

, Wait in your 'out of order' stall until 10 minutes after your first period class has started. Once your class has started, simply walk out of the stall (make sure nobody's around!) and roam for a few minutes.

, When the end of first period comes, what do you do? Grab your stuff (if you brought anything) and sneak back into your out of order stall, then simply wait until the next class begins.

, If they're too far away, such as in another building, then you might want to move closer just in case.

, Keep in mind that nobody had seen you in any of your classes. For example, you could try bringing a wig and a lot of makeup (for girls) or hair gel and borrow some makeup from your mom, sister, girlfriend etc (for guys). Then, simply walk out of the building calmly and either walk home or catch the bus!

"

Ask your friends for the best cutting route to become unnoticed.,
Stay undercover.,
Leave school fifteen to twenty minutes before school starts.,
Once you leave school, relax completely.,
Find a place to go.",How to Ditch School and Take a Mental Break2," Make sure to do this a couple of days before you cut school, or they may want to tag along.

, Try not to be noticed of seen by many people in the hallways. Hiding in the bathroom stalls normally works.

, Security guards don't check the cameras until five minutes to the bell. If you drive, this will be fairly easy. Just get in your car and pull out.


However, if you walk, this will be easy as well. Just walk the route most kids of your school walk. If a teacher asks you where you're going, which they rarely to almost do, tell them your running to the gas station to get chips for lunch, or getting a drink of water or something out of your locker.






If you catch the bus, make sure to know a different route than everyone else. Nothing is worse than having 30 kids see you at school.







, Enjoy the feeling that rides over you from fear and happiness. Your head will feel clear and free. Take a moment to enjoy it, close your eyes and bask in it.

,


Hitting small thrift stores while cutting school can be fun and easy. No one usually shops during morning hours, so the selection will be greater. Even if you hate thrift stores, you can browse through the racks. It's always temperature controlled in places like that. Make sure to bring about $10 to $15 dollars in hand.






Libraries are cozy and safe. You can catch up on music, read books, write stories, anything! You can even stay away from people in small, secluded corners.






Try the park. It's free and you'll be basking in the nice air.






Go to the movies. No one can distinguish who you are when you're sitting in a dark room. Morning movies are cheaper, so you'll be able to catch the latest blockbuster at a low price.






Avoid real public places. This includes malls, amusement parks, and around other schools. Many officers patrol areas nearby, and might ask questions if you're seen.

Behave.,
If an adult speaks to you, it is best to smile slightly and nod.,
Do not be afraid to speak and sharpen your vocabulary at tad bit.

,
Never return to school the day you ditched school.",How to Ditch School and Take a Mental Break3," Adults walk straight, and slower than teenagers. Teenagers tend to walk with life. Older people do not while adults tend to look around slower than most teenagers. Try to appear as a young college student at most and be realistic. Confidence is key. People 18 and over are usually more confident than younger teenagers when speaking in public and interacting with one another.

, Carry out the conversation taking longer breaths.

,, Go home at the time you'd usually arrive home. If a parent asks you what you did in school, calmly say something along the lines of, ""School was alright. We read a couple of chapters in _________ and I ran around a bit in P.E.""

A class or two before the one you want to skip, start telling your friends that you feel a little sick.,
During the class before the one you want to skip, for the first half act sick, but not too sick or the teacher may send you to the nurse.,
About 2 minutes into the class, ask the teacher if you can go to the bathroom.,
Go to the nurse and tell her exactly what you told your teacher in case she/he asks your teacher.,Make sure you have something interesting to do when you are in the nurse's office, such as listening to music, playing games, reading, or doing homework.,

, Hold your stomach or prop your head in your hands.

, Say that your stomach really hurts, you have a bad headache, or that you just feel bad all over. You may want to get out of there fast because you don't want to have an accident!

, Convince her that you are sick, but not sick enough that you should leave school.

,, Say that it must have been something you had eaten, or that you still don't feel great but you feel good enough to go to class.

, You've successfully avoided the class you wanted to miss.

"
"
First, we'll go over the four basic subjects.,
Maths is actually the most basic out of the four.,
Sciences are quite like maths, the answers are in the book right in front of you.,
Languages are mostly vocabulary.,
If it's a foreign language such as Spanish or French, think of it like an English class.,
History is one of the most textbook intensive courses.",How to Study for Each Subject in High School," Mathematics (Algebra, Geometry, etc) Sciences (Earth Space, Biology, Chemistry, Physics) Languages (English, Spanish, Latin, French, etc) and History (World History, Euro History, etc);
, The answers are almost always right in front of you. Your teacher will give you some example problems and do them on the board, and hopefully give you practice time in class. They may hand out worksheets and say they're due next class, but don't wait to do them just because you don't understand them. Usually in math class, you have a huge math textbook, whether you use it or not it contains hundreds of examples and problems for you to practice on your own. If you do ALL of the practice problems (Even though 15-20 should be enough if you know how to do it) there is no chance you'll make a mistake on a test unless it's a careless one.

, Usually the tests are part vocabulary, part fill in the blank or multiple choice, short or long response questions. Sometimes the long response questions will be extra credit. Familiarize yourself with the vocabulary first, with flash cards. After you've read the chapter, take notes. If your note-taking is thorough and you have a basic understanding of how things work, quiz yourself with the questions at the end of each section whether they've been assigned for homework or not. Some teachers teach straight from the book, some expect you to learn most of it yourself. Either way, it helps to know the chapter inside and out just so you won't feel overwhelmed when you take a test. Just knowing vocabulary isn't enough.

, If it's an English class (And you live in North America obviously) it'll be a mixture of reading Shakespeare and other old-English works, as well as being able to write essays on articles and such. The occasional project usually involves whatever it is you're currently reading, so once again make sure you know it. Vocabulary words aren't a huge deal anymore, but don't hesitate to make flashcards.

, You've learned a language already and are fluent in it. It's mostly vocabulary and as you progress you'll get into parts of speech, sentence structure, paragraphs, and before long you'll be standing in front of the class presenting your own writing and speaking abilities. Memorize the vocabulary because if you don't know what important words mean, tests are beyond frustrating.

, It's solely based upon your ability to memorize dates, names, and events. If you aren't interested, it can be deadening and soul destroying. What you can do is make the all-purpose flash cards. Make them for dates, people, places, and then make new ones, putting certain events together so you know who did what where and when they did it. You'll definitely need to read your chapters thoroughly to really understand what's happening.

Figure out which class you want to skip.,
Get a good place to hang out where you're unlikely to be caught.,
Know what the PE teachers are doing that day.,
Prepare excuses for if you do get caught.,
Use the farthest stall away from the door when using a bathroom.,
Be quiet.,
Always be listening for someone to walk in.,
Be careful when texting.,
Watch the clock.,
Don't brag.",How to Skip Class in a High School with Campus Security," You probably have a pretty good idea of where campus security guards normally sit stationary. You should also know where on campus is secluded. You need to figure out which class to skip and where to go during the period, and what to do afterwards.;
, These include the base ball field/diamond, or the bathroom.

, They might just happen to be doing PE out near where you're hiding; then security will be called and you'll be caught. A bathroom will probably be the best place to hide.

, If you choose to hide in the bathroom, there are a few good ones you can use. If you're a girl, you can say that you started your period and that you are trying to clean up. You can also say you're trying to see if your mom can bring you a change of underwear and a tampon, but only if you know that the security/teacher won't care that you used your phone during class time. You can also state that you have a stomachache, and that you'll be out soon. Saying that you plan on going to the nurse when you finish is also a good idea; that way, you can either go in for real and pretend to call a parent, or have them call a number you know won't answer, then go back to class, when you're really going back to the bathroom. If you do that, don't go to the same one. Go into a different stall or go to second nearest one. You can also fake going in then go back to a bathroom; though again, not the same one.

, It's harder to see your feet from the door, and you can hide your backpack/bag in the corner.

, Never play music or even try to use your phone at all without it muted. If you must listen to music, put head/earphones in with low volume. Even with earphones, if the surroundings are quiet enough and the audio is loud enough, others can hear you.

, If security comes by, or another student comes in, turn your music off and wait for them to leave. Usually, students moving around during class will have a security escort.

, You may trust your friend not to rat you out, but someone might read over their shoulder and tell, or their parents might see it and tell your parents. Their teacher may be suspicious if a student is texting another so frantically. In most places, teachers cannot look at a student's phone, but be cautious anyway; your friend might rat you out because the teacher said they will take their phone if they don't spill the beans.

, About a minute before the bell rings for passing period, slip out of the stall and stand in front of the mirror. Once the bell rings, let students start to flood the bathroom and slip out so security or teachers won't notice you.

, If you brag, someone might get irritated or angry and tell on you.

Understand what a thesis statement in general needs to accomplish.,
Define your point of view.,
Write your thesis statement in the form of an organized and clear complex sentence.,
Analyze; don't moralize.,
Avoid generalizations.,
Although the topic of this sample thesis sentence is rather trivial and uninteresting, one should be able to see how sentence 2 is superior to sentence 1 when launching a point of view.",How to Write a Thesis Statement (High School Students)," Your thesis needs to express a ""considered point of view."" Note that a considered point of view is different from an opinion. Anyone can express an opinion. You can say that you prefer chocolate to vanilla ice cream, to which another can either agree or disagree. This kind of exchange, however, neither leads to further conversation about nor investigation of an issue. Blanket opinions are conversation stoppers. A thesis statement is a conversation starter.;
, Once given your assignment, take notes or write in a less structured way (this is called ""free writing"") in order to sort out your thoughts on the issue at hand. You may want to create a table listing the pros and cons of two opposing positions before you make your final decision. This will provide you with clarification and perhaps a line of argumentation for the body of your essay.

, Complex sentences, as opposed to simple sentences, allow you to communicate rich thoughts. They give you room to unpack and elaborate in the body of your essay. Consider the following pair of sentences, the first simple and expressing a mere opinion, the second expressing a considered point of view in a complex sentence:


I hate San Francisco weather in the summertime.

While San Francisco weather in the summer can be variable and unpredictable, once one has mastered “the art of layering,” it can be quite pleasant.Statement 1 gives a mere opinion, to which one can respond in only one of two ways. One can agree (I hate it, too) or disagree (I love San Francisco weather). Either way, the statement does not begin a conversation, but rather shuts it down from the beginning (as with the chocolate ice cream example). It is a flat, blanket statement.Statement 2 offers much more to a writer and a reader. Notice first the structure of the sentence. It is a complex sentence with two subordinate clauses in front of the main, independent clause. Looking at the sentence from its structure alone, one can see how much richer it is.The subordinate clauses in this sentence give the writer room to write. In order to elaborate on the thesis successfully, the writer would have to talk about what s/he means by calling San Francisco weather variable and unpredictable. S/he would have to explain and illustrate with examples. The writer might also give a descriptive narrative about encountering such unpredictable weather (experiencing sudden shifts in temperature, or different weather conditions in different parts of the city).The writer would then be able to talk about how s/he found a solution (layering) and how s/he has made layering into an “art.” The writer could give examples of this. At this point, the writer is then poised to discuss the conclusion built into the thesis (San Francisco weather can be quite pleasant). S/he could then extend the discussion and further confirm the thesis in the conclusion by comparing San Francisco weather to other climates (for example, the heat and humidity of New Orleans).

, Avoid using the words ""should"" or ""must."" Statements dictating what people should or should not do are off-putting. On the other hand, offering a fresh or interesting way to think about a controversial or complex issue is inviting, even if there are flaws in one's line of thought.

, Instead of resorting to terms such as ""everyone,"" ""no one,"" ""all,"" etc., try using ""many"" or ""some."" Making universal statements about all of humanity can set your thesis up for easy attack.

, It not only expresses a richer point of view, but paves the way for the successful execution of the actual essay!

, Is this going to be a weekly paper, a monthly paper, or even a paper that comes out once a semester? Choose what's best for you and your group.

, Some ideas may include book/movie review, mini biographies of famous people in history, etc. Obviously there will  be school news in it too! Make sure there is at least one topic for everyone in your group to write about.

, How many pages will it be? Will there be a section with fun stuff (jokes, facts, word searches, etc.)? Remember, don't go crazy with it! Make your newspaper a reasonable size.

, It should probably include your school's name, initials, our sports mascot. It should also include a name that could be used for newspaper (Sun, Scoop, Ledger, Times) Here are some examples:


The Hornet Times
The Academy Sun
The SHS Ledger

, Now it's time to set up a meeting with the principal to talk about your idea. Make sure everyone in the group is there. Show the principal your ideas, layout, and all your plans. Talk to them about having a teacher advisor and about permission to use your school's computer lab (if your school has one). Remember to be honest and try only to show the cons of your idea.


Try not to be too upset if you're told you can't start a newspaper. Maybe there's something else you could do like a newsletter!

, If you got a ""yes"", congratulations! Make sure you keep up with your promises and always have a plan for each paper. Don't forget to have weekly or monthly meetings with your staff and keep everyone on track to get the paper going.

When you're at the school, introduce yourself to your teachers and make a good impression; they'll remember your name during class.,
Set up and organize your locker and memorize your combination.,
Make sure you know where your classes are.,
Attend orientation.,
The first day of school: pay attention; the teachers will introduce themselves and tell you what to get for their class if it's not on a supply list.

Sign up for clubs.,
Remember to use technology.,

Get your academic life in order before making a really big social life.,
Just be yourself, and you'll make friends you want to keep.

",How to Survive a Private High School," If you don't have uniforms, read the dress code, and ask students what they know they can get away with.


For those who have uniforms, make sure everything fits; you will look very odd if something doesn't fit. Uniform shirts are usually a bit big, so be careful what size you order. Don't be afraid to accessorize your uniform. Wear a watch, a headband, a hair ribbon, whatever. Cute clips and colorful shoelaces are adorable.
For those without uniforms - you're lucky! You can wear your normal-styled clothes.
Shoes tend to be very lenient style wise. Ballet flats or cute sneakers are great.
Wear natural makeup. If you want to do something more wild, make sure that you can pull it off, and that it's allowed.
Pertaining to hygiene, shower every day, but if you're a girl, try washing your hair only every other day. You won't have time to deal with your hair every day, and it's unhealthy to wash it every day.;
, It's a great way to meet people before school starts, and if you're really nervous, ask your school for a buddy if they don't give you one. A buddy is your personal welcoming committee; he or she will show you around school, help you find your locker and classes, sit with you at lunch, and just help you in general.

, In some schools the student-teacher relationship is weird; the teachers are a little more casual and friendly, and you'll enjoy talking to them about everyday things and having real conversations, but purely in school; never outside of school, unless it's school sponsored.

, Choose a durable lock and keep the combination somewhere safe such as your phone or a piece of paper disguised as something else.

, It's really embarrassing to show up in the wrong class.

, It's really helpful, and you'll meet other new students. You can also just go to orientation to reunite with old friends and meet the new students. Politely introduce yourself to the secretary or someone who looks like they can help so they can help you in the future.

,, If at any time you can't see the board, tell your teacher and they can probably help/move you.

, This usually happens about two weeks after school starts. Sign up for at least one club if you're not on a sports team. Try to sign up for one even if you are on a sports team, whether it's for the fall season or the whole year.

, Cell phones are great, especially if you need to call a parent or a friend. Some schools require you to get a laptop. They are often picky about which one you get. Consider getting the extended warranty, because you will be getting a lot of use out of your computer and it can end up saving you hundreds of dollars. Some schools do allow students to use their phone while in class, to record the lesson.

, Don't be afraid to be supportive of your school. Besides, clothing with your school name on it is usually some of the comfiest stuff you may ever own. Go to a sporting game or two. A really big game is usually where you can find a friend; plus, the energy of the crowd is breathtaking.

, It's easy to fall behind if you don't study. There are many methods of studying, so be sure to find a method that works for you.

, If you fail a certain amount of classes, you will be put first on academic probation, and then get kicked out if you don't improve. Yes, people can buy their way back into the school, but that's not a good option now, is it?

Do your work.,
Don't get caught up in the never-ending drama.This can be hard, but the less drama, the better.,
Stay positive.,
Get involved in school.,
Stay true to yourself!,
Seniors, juniors, and even sophomores will see the freshmen as ""easy targets"" for such things.,
When in-doubt, just focus on school.,
Have fun!,
Enjoy it!",How to Survive and Thrive in Your Freshmen Year of High School," No one is ""too cool"" for schoolwork. Your grades start counting towards college now so it's important to stay on task. Doing homework is one of the most time consuming things existing on planet earth, but your work will pay off when you get the satisfaction of good grades. (failing is not a good feeling, at all!)


Try doing homework right after school so then you can have the rest of the night to relax.






Doing your homework while listening to music can help make it more fun and music can actually relax you a little.





;
, Drama just causes unnecessary stress, and who wants that Don't try to start drama either, that's never appreciated.

, The workload and drastic change from middle school to high school can be kind of scary, but don't let it bring you down. If your grades drop from, say, the 90's to the 80's, don't sweat it. Freshmen year is a transitional year, it's expected.


Keep smiling, no matter what. Even a forced smile can usually help you feel better!







, Try joining or trying out for a sport, or join a club! There are a billion in every school, so find one that bests suits you!


It's okay if you and your friends don't all do the same thing. You can always make some more friends anyway.






Clubs and extracurricular activities look great on a college application, especially if you started getting involved your freshmen year and continued throughout senior year.






Drama plays/musicals are also a great option because not only it's loads of fun, but you also become so close with everybody, even the upperclassmen.







, Don't try to change just to ""fit in"" or ""be popular"". You'll find plenty of people who just like you for who you truly are.


Don't do anything you don't wan to do.






Don't let anyone pressure you into smoking, alcohol, having sex, drugs, etc. Doing all that stuff doesn't make you ""cool"", it just gives you a reputation and you'll probably lose the respect of not only the freshmen class, but the upperclassmen will also talk.







, Stick to your morals though. Do what you feel is right, but remember, once you do something, you can never take it back.

,


It sounds ""nerdy"", but your grades and how you do in school is extremely important, so don't slack off too much. You'll regret it.






Study for tests and quizzes because it honestly makes things so much easier.






Stay after if you have questions, or if you need extra help. Don't be too shy to ask for extra help either, because teachers are more than happy to help! They want to see you succeed and thrive!






Teachers are usually happy to share your grade with you, so if you're ever curious, just ask them what your average for the class is and they will usually let you see. This is a great way to keep track of things!







, It sounds hard to have fun, but freshman year will fly by in the blink of an eye!

, Laugh, make jokes, meet new people, get involved, try new clubs and activities, etc. You'll look back on these years and laugh, so don't overstress (but don't necessarily ""under stress"" either).

Do you hate getting called at in class? Do you hate sitting alone in the cafeteria? Write down everything you hate about high school, from the smell of your old classroom to the people who gossip behind your back.;
, If you don’t like waking up early and staying up late doing homework, you could categorize those two things under a phrase like “high school cuts down on my sleep.” For example, take a look at this list of things someone hates about high school:


Getting called on in class
Cafeteria food that makes you sick
Gym exercises
Strict study hall monitors
Having few friends
Getting gossiped about
Getting judged
Uncomfortable uniforms

, At first glance, the items on your list might seem unrelated. But if we take a closer look, we can see some bigger categories forming from them. Take a look at the following few items from the list: 1) Cafeteria food that makes you sick; 2) uncomfortable uniforms; 3) gym exercises. Notice anything similar about these three items? They all have to do with being physically uncomfortable. Whether you’re throwing up after eating mystery meat, itching all day from your overly-tight uniform, or aching all over after gym, your body is experiencing physical discomfort. This is one category that can help organize your list. Other categories might be social discomfort, or academic discomfort.



Social Discomfort might include having few friends, getting gossiped about, getting judged, navigating exclusive social groups (cliques), or attending school dances.

Academic Discomfort might include getting called on in class, strict study hall monitors, boring classes, or getting bad grades.

, Your “problem category” isn’t necessarily the category with the most number of items. To figure out the problem category you hate the most, think about the individual items on your list and notice how you feel. Does thinking about gym exercises make your chest clench? Does thinking about gossip bring a lump to your throat? Circle the problem category that bothers you the most. Now that you’ve figured out what you hate most about high school, it’s time to start coming up with specific, useful solutions.


Do keep in mind that this is only a starting point. You can, and should, go back to each category and repeat the next steps as many times as you need to.

, When creating a plan, you need to know the exact things that your plan is going to address. In this step, figure out why you hate what you hate about high school. This might be hard to do at first, but keep asking yourself “why do I hate this?” when you look at the items under the category you circled. Here are three examples of ways you might reason through why you circled a certain category:


“I circled ‘Physical Discomfort.’ I hate beating up my body every day in gym class, and our uniforms are itchy and too tight. But why do I hate gym class and uniforms so much? Well…when I wake up every morning I feel like I can’t move my legs, and there’s this weird rash on my back that isn’t going away. Those are two things that are making going to high school literally painful for me.“
“I circled ‘Social Discomfort.’ I never get asked out to school dances, and I’m hearing gossip about me every day. I guess what makes things like gossip really bad is that I don’t have a group of friends I can fall back on. No one’s there to back me up against the gossip, and I don’t have anyone to hang out with when school dances roll around.”
“I circled ‘Academic Discomfort.’ Math is the most boring subject in school, and I hate it when the teacher calls on me. Every minute of class drags on, and whenever I get called on I don’t know what to say. I’ve had boring classes before, but this class feels like torture. I guess this class is especially bad because I didn’t get a chance to learn half the material we’re covering in middle school, and I can’t even figure out how to do most of the homework.”
The point of this step is to figure out the reasons behind your dislike of high school. Write down your reasons on a separate sheet of paper. Now that you’ve identified why you hate high school, you can take specific steps to solve the problem.

, For example, if you don’t feel like you have a group of friends you can talk to and rely on, write down some possible ways to make new friends. Don’t limit yourself here! Come up with as many ideas as you can, even if you can’t imagine yourself doing them. Here are a few examples of ways you might write out your thoughts:
Problem: I need a group of friends who I can fall back on.Ways I can solve this:1. Try out new student clubs I’m interested in.2. Sit with people eating alone in the cafeteria3. Help out people struggling with things that I’m good at.4. Try talking with other students sitting quietly on the bus5. Join activities and organizations outside of school.Problem: Math class is covering material I never learned, and the teacher is always making me participate in class.Ways I can solve this:1. Talk with my teacher and explain the situation.2. Figure out what areas I can work on, and borrow the right textbooks from the library.3. Ask someone if she wants to study for math together.4. Write down everything I don’t understand, and bring it up during class.5. Ask my teacher to slow down.Problem: Gym class is making it painful to get up from bed.Ways I can solve this:1. Try to stretch more after gym2. Go to the doctor and see if something’s wrong.3. Talk with my gym teacher and ask her for advice.4. Find ice and bandages to apply to my legs after class.


Keep this list handy. It’ll be useful as you come up with your action plan.

, These people might be your older siblings, your close friends, or your parents. Ask them for their thoughts on the problem you’re dealing with, and whether they have any ideas on how you can resolve it. Add any ideas they have to your list of solutions.

, The best solutions aren’t necessarily big or dramatic. The best solutions are practical—solutions that you can start working on as soon as you walk into school tomorrow, or even today.

, At this point you’ve written down ways you can fix the problem. The more you stick to those ways, the faster you’ll be able to solve the issue. You might find it helpful to tape up your solutions in a location where you’ll see it every day.

, Parts 1 and 2 of this article explain how you can face problems in high school head on. If you’re trying all the solutions you can think of and they haven’t been working for a while, it might be time to consider alternatives to your high school.

, Make sure to highlight how you’ve tried hard to solve the problems you’re dealing with, but have seen no real progress or success from your efforts. It’s important to make a strong case for transferring, as your parents will probably have the final say on your decision. Here are some objections your parents might have to you transferring, and possible responses to them:



You should wait a little longer. Things will get better over time.
By this point, you've already identified why high school is such a painful experience. You've created a set of possible solutions, talked them over with others, and tried them all. Yes, you could wait--but should you? By this point, waiting is no longer a productive option.

You'll hate the high school you transfer to even more.
Some chance is better than no chance at all. And after trying many possible solutions, you know that your high school doesn't offer you much of a chance for happiness and well-being. Establish the fact that you need to transfer, and are willing to take a risk. Later steps in this section will help you make sure the high school you transfer to will be an improvement over your old one.
For more help with this step, read How to Convince Your Parents to Let You Switch Schools.

, You can find the numbers of high school registrars by searching though the online directories of high schools in your area. In each of your phone calls, make sure to do the following:


Ask what documents you need to transfer. You will most likely need your official academic transcripts.
Ask if you will lose any academic credits by transferring. Depending on the high school you’re considering transferring to, you might have to retake classes or meet new requirements, which will force you to graduate late. It’s probably a good idea to send your transcripts to the registrar so she can check whether or not you’ll lose any credits in the transfer.
Ask if you can visit the high school you’re considering transferring to. You don’t want to leave a high school you hate to go to a high school you’ll hate even more. Visiting a high school is a great way to get a feel for whether it has what you’re looking for.
Ask where you can get more information about the high school. Doing some research on the classes and activities offered by each high school in your area will help you decide which one to transfer to.

, You’ve gathered all the information you need to make your choice. All that’s left is for you to decide which choice presents the best option over your current high school.


To help you make your decision, try writing down the Pros and Cons of each high school you're considering, then comparing them.
Make sure that the high school you're transferring to will effectively deal with the problem category you circled in Part 1.

, Before you leave, tie up any loose ends at your old high school—thank anyone you need to thank, and forgive anyone you need to forgive. If you can manage it, it’s best to leave your high school on a pleasant note.


It's a small world. You may end up meeting people in your old high school

, You’re entering your new high school with a clean slate. Try to make the most out of this opportunity as possible. For help specifically with this step, read How to Change Schools in the Middle of the School Year.

, Part 3 of this article explains how you can transfer high schools. High school offers many academic and social experiences you won’t get at home. If you’ve tried transferring and are still hating high school, it might be time to consider getting academic credentials through the General Educational Development (GED) test instead.


Note that there is some controversy over the value of a GED. There is debate over whether most colleges and employers see getting a GED as equivalent to getting a high school degree. However, most people would agree that having a GED gives you more options than not having one will.
17 American states currently offer alternatives to the GED, and 10 states don't offer the GED entirely.Contact your high school registrar for more information on whether your state offers the GED or an alternative testing method. If your state doesn't offer the GED, schedule a meeting with your registrar or academic counselor to get more information on how to get alternative credentials.

, Depending on your age and the state you live in, you may be legally ineligible to drop out of high school. Talking to your guidance counselor is a good first step to get the information you need. For more specific information on this step, read How to Drop Out of High School.

, An average of just 60% of high school graduates pass the GED . What this means is that for 2 out of 5 people, four years of high school aren’t enough to get a passing grade. If you drop out of high school, you’ll need to spend a significant amount of time preparing for the GED.


If you don’t think you’ll be able to pass the GED, realize that it might be difficult to find work without a high school diploma. In this case, it might be worth it to stay in a high school you hate it.
For more specific information on getting a GED, read How to Get a GED.

, Make sure to highlight how you’ve tried transferring to a new high school, but have realized that high school really isn’t for you. By this point you’ve been to multiple high schools, hated all of them, and couldn’t solve the problems you had at each one. The high school experience is seriously hurting your basic happiness and quality of life. Also highlight your plans to work to get a GED. It’s time that you tried something other than high school, and you need your parents to understand that.


This will probably be a difficult conversation. You might find it helpful to write down a rough outline of what you’re going to say beforehand.
You may have to make your case multiple times before your parents realize how serious you are about your decision.
Passing a GED practice test and showing your parents your scores will demonstrate that you’re up to the task of passing the real thing.

, At this point you’ve decided that you need to leave high school for your own basic happiness. It’s time to leave and start on what you want to do next in your life.

, Again, for more specific information on getting a GED, read How to Get a GED.

, Well done! You tried many different solutions to deal with high school, and eventually realized that high school wasn't for you. Now, with the credentials offered by the GED, you're taking your future into your own hands.

Say goodbye to friends who are going separate ways and if you want to keep in touch with them, exchange contact details or stay in touch online. Then it's time to get excited about your new school and moving on up.;
, Go a little after the supplies are in stores, and you will get a first peek at everything! If you wait longer, there is a chance of many good binders being taken, which would stink.

, Familiarize yourself with the school and its surrounds. Get a map of the school so that you can study where everything is in your own time.


Meet your new teachers if this is possible.

, Get a good night's sleep by tiring yourself out during the day and going to bed nice and early.

, If you have a uniform, wear it as it should be worn. If you have casual attire, choose neat and comfortable over fashionable items that cause you to feel uncomfortable. Prepare your clothing the night before and keep this as a habit throughout school.


If you want to wear makeup, keep it natural and minimal. You don't need to wear makeup, so if you don't want to, simply don't.

, Compare schedules with friends. Now you know who your study buddies are, and who to share fries with at lunch. Talk about where you want to sit, which teachers seem nice, what the subjects are about, etc.

, If you don't have any existing friends at the new school, reach out to others and say hi. Offer to sit with people or to show them around the school. Strike up conversations about the subjects, timetable or teachers. Eventually you'll connect with a few people whom you like and wish to spend time hanging around with.

, Although it's early yet, getting into a good routine now makes a lot of sense. Set up a homework timetable, take good notes in class and be prepared to ask questions about things you don't yet understand. Remember that if you don't know it, it's likely that there are many others who don't know it either and will be grateful that you asked.


Make a suitable homework area at home for nightly and weekend studying. Add stationery, computer and anything else needed to help with the studies. Pin your homework schedule up for ease of reference.
Use a diary to help you keep track of assignments, homework and tests. Use it regularly to get into a good daily habit.
Know your learning style. This may help you to learn with more ease.

, It's important to be organized from this point on as you are more and more responsible for your own work and meeting your own needs. Teachers will not be as hands-on with directing you to be timely or ready anymore–-that's now down to you. As already suggested, use a diary and schedules to keep up with things and make use of binders, color coding and post-it notes to keep track of all the things you're learning.


Clean out your binders, locker and backpack regularly. This will ensure that you don't lose important notices, assignments and old lunches.
The sooner you complete homework and assignments, the sooner you're free to do other things. Also, this reduces last-minute stress and that awful moment when you realize you forgot to borrow the right book to help you with the assignment due in the morning!

, Don't gossip, spread rumors or provoke fights. School is about learning and socializing, not developing dramas. If you have a tendency to whine, complain or get your own way by throwing a tantrum, now is a good time to learn to stop these childish behaviors and to become a stronger, more assertive and independent individual. Middle school is your chance to grow up.


Be aware that there will always be people you like and don't like and people who like and don't like you. The trick is to not go around hating or feeling victimized. Instead, be friendly and polite to those you don't like and realize that the nasty things some people say to you are more about themselves than about you. Don't take it personally. If you need to talk to someone about it, do so––there is no shame in getting support to help you get through any rough patch.
Don't do anything to make someone not like you. There will be people who don't like you anyway, now is not a good time to provoke them.
Keep your passwords, locker/lunch codes, very personal information to yourself. Stay safe by not sharing information that others don't need to know. This includes friends. These types of information are best kept in your head alone. If you are having trouble knowing what to keep secret, ask a teacher, parent, older sibling, or guidance counselor.

, The more you do, the more fun you'll have. The more you do to take your mind off drama or challenging schoolwork, the happier you'll be. You'll also make new friends with the same interests as you.


Do other activities at home. Hang out with friends, go for walks, babysit, go for bike rides, play sport, see movies, etc.

, While it may not seem like now, the time will fly by and before you know it, you'll be off to high school. So make the most of this special time in your life because you're also transitioning from child to teen and many personal and physical changes are happening too. Learn all that you can about yourself, your fellow human beings and the world around you.

, You don't want to spend a week in wrinkled, stained, torn, or dirty clothes! Make sure you do laundry before the first week and iron every single clothing article you have. For the first day, wear your best T shirt and pants. Skip this step if your school requires uniform.

,, An hour and a half before school is a good time if it's far away. Now don't just sit back and watch cartoons for an hour! . Get ready quickly and run like the wind. You want to make a good impression on your teachers.

, A quick five minute shower will save precious minutes. Also remember to put on deodorant. After all, if you smell on the first day you may be called ""Skunk"" for the rest of the year or even worse names.

, Get there 10 minutes in advance and wait with your parent until you're picked up. When your picked up, sit alone unless a friend from elementary comes. Wait until the third or fourth day until you ask a stranger to sit with you. If you ask a random person to sit with you that person may end up being a backstabber or bully.

, It's really easy to get lost within the never ending halls full of lockers and classrooms that all look the same. Try to keep a map so that you don't get lost resulting in you to live in a locker and treat the halls like the wilderness.

, There's a good chance that that's where you'll sit for the rest of the year. Choose your seat carefully.

, There is a good chance that they will introduce you to their friends.

, You usually have no choice, but some schools have ""a la carte"" which means you can get whatever you want. Choose the best food available if your school has a la carte. If it's a no choice menu, then make do with what you have even if it looks like throw up.

, There's a basic table for every group: The popular girls, the cool guys, the outcast girls, and the outcast boys. When you decide which group will most likely accept you, go to the table and sit there. Try to socialize with the table's kids.

, This will personalize it perfectly. If you're a girl, a mirror is great to keep for when you want to apply makeup or lip gloss. Add posters of your favorite singer, a few books, and other items to make it your own.

, Know if your combination is 21, 17, 23 or 23, 17, 21. Try making a math equation, such as 23-21=17. It may be incorrect, but if someone is trying to find your combination, its better to be ""The girl who can't subtract"" than ""The girl who got her stuff stolen.""

, If you are bringing lunch, use a lunch box instead of a brown paper bag, just so you don't waste.

, Many schools don't allow kids to carry their backpacks because it takes up a lot of room. And besides, a heavy backpack can be bad for you, so it's best to avoid them.

, Something as simple as being well nourished in the mornings can make a big difference on your happiness and overall success in school.

, There are lots of things you can do to make the first day an easier one., If you're late for one or two classes on the first day, it's understandable. Don't stop and chat unless you're completely sure you can get to class on time. Get your books and head to class. Stop at your locker for a minute if you need to. Depending on your school depends on the time you have between classes. So don't stay in the hall too long, or else you may get in trouble.


Get a pass by your teacher to stop by your locker. This way, you can get your stuff and not be in trouble for being late.






Find shortcuts to get to class. Maybe if you go through the middle staircase, you can get to second period quicker!






Don't stop and talk! This is no excuse to be late.






Don't let slow people make you late for class! If people are being slow, give them a shove while saying, ""Excuse me."" Don't push or hit them, just lightly push through.







, Be kind, friendly, and patient. Many people want to be your friend based on who you are, not what you look like.

, Don't get your teacher mad. Some teachers mean what they say, and play no games.


Taking your time, talking, or being unprepared can give you supervisions! Supervisions are detentions! You don't want detention on your first year!







, Procrastination leads to stress and poor grades, so it's a better idea to start your homework 30 minutes or so after you get home. Avoid being around distractions like the TV, your computer, or your cell phone while you're doing homework. Feel free to take short breaks while you're working, but be diligent about getting back to work once the break is over.

, While it's tempting to spend time on the computer before bed, you will sleep less if you do this. Instead, find a good book and wind down by reading.

, Give your parents details about your day when they ask (or even if they don't!). Help out around the house—offer to do dishes, set the table, or take your dog for a walk. The good behavior will pay off when you ask to do things with friends.

, Remember that the number of boys you date or the amount of makeup you wear won't make you popular, and more importantly, it won't help you do well in school. And try not to cause drama either. It will make you look like a bad friend.


Avoid gossip as well. Nobody likes to be friends with the girl who's in everyone's business, and in every conversation. And not in a good way.






Don't get into other people's business. Its not your business!







, If you constantly feel as though you're your friend's shadow or vice versa, work to even the playing field or find a new group of friends.Try to keep a small group of best friends, maybe 2-4 will be good!

, Take a little time each day to relax by yourself. Get to know yourself—middle school is a time when everyone is changing, and you're more likely to love those changes if you are working to know yourself.

, Some girls are going to try to get you to change for their needs. Don't Forget, that your true friends will accept you for who you are. So don't try to change for other people, because if you mess up and get people mad at you, it may affect the rest of your middle school year., Most of all, learn to appreciate living in the present while being focused on your future. This is a skill worth cultivating., You don't have to wash your hair that often, but washing your body will help mitigate acne and body odor. ""Clean and Clear In-Shower Facial"" is a great product to use to wash your face.

, Don't overdo it—you want your makeup to look natural, not trashy. All you need is some mascara, maybe some natural color eyeshadow, and blush! It will look beautiful and natural!. But don't forget to wash it all off before bedtime! Makeup can create pimples and zits from getting into your pores!

, This sounds like a no-brainer, but bad breath can hinder any semblance of a social life.

Always be yourself.,
Always have a small, close group of best friends.,
Don't let your social life ruin your academic life.,
Don't be too concerned with what other people think of you.,
If you care about what people think, don't change yourself.,
Have fun!",How to Survive Seventh Grade1," That is the most important thing you can do to have a good year socially. You are probably thinking Oh, I've heard this hundreds of times... but it doesn't mean you won't do it! Many kids get in huge trouble when they don't act like themselves. Sometimes people think that they can just pretend to be someone they're not; the thing is if you have ever tried that, you will know that if someone finds out that you aren't who you say you are, everyone soon knows, and it's very embarrassing!;
, In that close group of friends, you know you will be able to share everything with them. You will know that a silly little fight won't ruin your friendship. Hang with each other through thick and thin. If you need to take a break from them (because of a fight, or you just need some chill time), you have other friends who you can be with. However, this does not mean you have to limit your social life to those people. Keep a few close friends, but have many friends. You may need them later in life.

, Too many kids always get too involved with friends at school, and forget the reason why they are at school, to learn! They get in big fights and they start to just think of school as a place for them to mingle.

, If you try too hard to be popular, all of the preppy snobs will just laugh at you, and you might have a tough year.

, Take a deep breath and stride into school confidently. Be who you are. Smile, joke, play, and laugh. More often than not that's what people want. You will be liked.

, Be crazy and weird! You only have one life to live. Make the most of every moment you have and be adventurous, happy, and be that person that everyone wants to be around because they're so much fun! Be inspired! Never let a guy/girl get between you and your best friends. The relationship probably won't last forever, and while it's great right now, it won't be when you break up. Seventh grade is hard! Always remember to take a deep breath, and relax often. Just remember to try not and do things you'll regret later on.

",How to Study To Do Well in Middle or High School," This is a must! It will help you very much especially in science or history.. Go out and buy several note pads, one for each of your major classes.;
, Whenever your teacher mentions a future assignment or a test, try not to be away that week. You don't want to miss a thing they have to say,write all the details down.

, They're handy and a must. If you have a school agenda use it to write with in it because it will make it look less complicated.

, That could be a big mistake if you find you need them for reference later. If you have major yearly examinations, then they will be vital when you go to study. Keep old work in a separate binder or folder so you don't lose it and it doesn't take up space in your normal binder.

, Having friends that you know are reliable and hard working will pay off. They can help you study, give you tips, and be good long term influences. If you have a group assignment or class work of that nature then work with somebody you know will be serious, not lazy and do their share of the work. It is not fun staying up till 2:30am the night before a massive assignment is due because your partner(s) has not done their share of work.

, If you wear glasses or have weaker eyes, this is important. The teacher will let you move because, believe it or not, they want you to do well.

, It is so easy to just not bother but it's really not worth the worry. Plus, if you start when its given and work steadily until its due you will be more relaxed and therefore do better work.

, It is very helpful, unless you have a photographic memory. Most schools supply them. If they don't, places like office stores, newsagents, stationary sections, etc. supply them. There is really no excuse not to have one. There is so many things to remember for reference later. It is almost impossible to function without one.

,, They can be a complete drag at times, but just cringe and bear it. Most of the time it really isn't worth the argument.

, The same deal as with your teachers. They are only useful if you're on talking terms.

, This will improve you on all fronts. The more familiar you are with the subject matter, the easier it will be to remember details during tests. It will make your homework easier, and make the work easier in class. The more time you spend in reading now, the easier it will be when you have to hit the books at exam time.

, If you have none, reread old material. If homework is set, just do it because the more you review, the less pressure you will have later.

, Don't waste a lot of time reading material you haven't covered yet, but it helps to become familiar with it.

, Don't lose them. File them with their class notes.

, Just have it all because organization is important, and it's no fun having to borrow a pen from a furious teacher under exam conditions.

, This just makes it easier if you keep everything organized.

, Your study area should be a large, quiet place where you won't be distracted. Organize your study room. You are going to spend a lot of time there. Keep it quiet or turn on music, depending on what helps you concentrate. Keep the room comfortable, light, and cool.

,,, Something like a supportive desk chair works well.

, Keep a separate binder or folder for each subject. Cover any folders and books according to the subject, i.e., Red=English; Green=Science; etc.

Stay up-to-date.",How to Survive the First Year of Middle School," Get up around an hour before school starts and do your normal routine. Eat a good breakfast and make sure you have a lunch, if needed. You never want to go hungry during school, so always carry back-up lunch money to buy a meal if you ever forget your lunch at home. Try to leave home a half-hour before school starts so that you can be sure not to be late.;
, Raise your hand if you have a question and don't call out answers without being asked for them. Don't be the ""Class Clown"" who creates disturbances for others; no one wants to be around a troublemaker. Smile and keep quiet while others are speaking, and behave well in front of your teachers and other students. You don't need to be a ""Teacher's Pet"", just turn in your homework when it's due, be respectful, and try not to get on your teacher's bad side. Remember, teachers may lower your grade if you misbehave, or deny you the opportunity to go on field trips.

, Have all your pens, paper, books, etc., packed the night before your first day. Teachers appreciate it when you have your supplies with you. Keep them neatly stacked in your locker during the day and always replace items you have run out of as soon as possible. You won't always get to visit your locker between classes, so be sure to have the things you absolutely need in your backpack or book bag. Teachers may allow you to return to your locker occasionally to retrieve a forgotten item if you ask promptly and politely.

, Everyone recognizes those who try hard. You will be rewarded for the effort by building up your knowledge. Seek help if you have areas of study that you find too difficult; other classmates, a tutor, or your parents may be possible sources of help.

, Tutoring classes are a good way to distance yourself from friends or family whose help may be limited by their own knowledge. Tutoring is a good way of improving your skills with extra practice.

, If he or she seems nice, ask for help from them; they'll know the school and will probably make your day easier. Be polite and don't encroach on their personal time with friends.

, If you're nervous about asking questions in class, ask another teacher. Any teacher in the school will be happy to help you with a problem, or point you to someone who can. Make sure you understand the content of what is being taught before you walk away. Don't forget to thank them

, It makes your day easier if you know where everything is. Binders with separators, and even folders, are a big help for this process. Staying organized in middle school will help you throughout life, in the workplace and in your home.

, The more comfortable you make others feel in your presence, the more comfortable you will feel in middle school and beyond. Broaden your base of friends to include as many people as possible, and don't give off the impression that you feel you are too good for anyone.

, For instance, if you know where the AV (audio/visuals) supplies are stored, you can help others find a camera when they need one to complete an assignment. Or if another teacher or student needs directions, you can provide them. The more independent you feel the more positive your experience will be.

, There is no need to take middle school too seriously; you're there to learn and you will get through it faster than you think. Middle school can be really fun as long as you let it be.

, It'll save you a lot of trouble in middle school. It will also help you get you better grades and stay on the teacher's good side.

, Your teachers probably know you can answer it; they have to see if others can do it too.

, There's lots of opportunities to take advantage of. Join a club or try out for a sports team. You'll meet new friends and learn more about life and the opportunities you'll have in the future.

, If you end up sitting by someone who is very distracting, ask your teacher if you can move.Also try to sit in the front.br>
, Stay in touch with your friends, listen to the latest songs, and (if you have one) check your Facebook at least once a week. Staying up-to-date with your friends and with other people will get you a good reputation with multiple people. People will know you and appreciate you if you drop in for a conversation from time to time.But you do not have to if you do not want to.

Stay on top of homework.,
Know that teachers will be very strict.,
Try your hardest.,
Do your work.,
Work together with your classmates.,
Aim for an A.,
Try to invite your friends over and study for tests.",How to Survive Seventh Grade2," In elementary school, some teachers didn't care if you didn't have your homework that day, and it wouldn't hurt your grade. In seventh grade, it does. A lot. Missing one homework assignment might get you after-school detention, and for most schools missing seven or more will get you into summer school.

, Lots of the teachers will not approve of silly behaviour and slacking. Some teachers will even send you to the principal or head teacher without a warning, and that is bad.

, This is the most important thing you can do in your academic life. If you don't understand something in class, stay after school or during lunch to have the teacher explain it. You may hate this teacher, but when it comes to learning and asking real questions, teachers have a soft heart.

, This is the most important thing. In elementary school, if you didn't do your work, or you had a D or and F for your grade, you would still move on to the next grade. That doesn't happen anymore. If in any of your classes you have an F, you can bring it up if you try hard. One failure won't keep you back for another year. But if you get an F in most of your classes and don't do anything about it, you might have a problem...

, It's so much more fun having a study group to work with!

, Get all the help in school if you don't understand something. Study with friends. Just do something to enhance your education if you need help in school.

, This is effective since you can have fun and study at the same time!

Understand that eighth grade is a new world.,
Prepare.,
Review your schedule.,
Be friendly to everyone.,
Make new friends.,
Don't plan up some insane scheme to become popular.,
Avoid looking confused if you get lost or don't know what to do, especially if people from lower grades are around.,
Feel free to share those hobbies of yours with others.,
Decorate your locker.,
Consider high school preparation.",How to Survive Eighth Grade," Whilst navigating the maze of popularity, people, and teachers, we are told to be lovely role models for the lower grades, and for those whose middle schools only go up to eighth grade, we're not really sure how to go about this 'role model' business, since we don't quite remember ever idolizing the eighth graders. Or perhaps you remember admiring them with a kind of bemused 'so that's what they look like'.;
, On the day before school (or even earlier!), start to figure out what you are going to wear. Since it is the first day of school, try to make a lasting impression on your new classmates - even if you already know them. Remember your looks aren't everything, but, in middle school, it is very important for you to look presentable and neat.], The last thing you want is to show up to school, and have no idea where you are supposed to be going. If you are new to the school, try looking around when you go in to register. If you still don't know where your classes are, don't worry because on the first day there will always be a teacher to show you where you are supposed to be. If they have a meet the teacher, try going to that, because it will give you the chance to see where you will be sitting, and who you will be with in your classes.

, Do not pick on the younger kids; it is common for those who are at the top to pick on those who are at the bottom. Understand that just because you're ""at the top"", does not mean you can beat up on those who are at the bottom. Put yourself in their shoes and think about how you would feel if the younger kids picked on you.

, It's okay to still hang out with your old buddies, but try to find some new people that you get along with, so that you can be more sociable - this will help with having good times throughout Grade 8.

, Popularity is relative, and being popular isn't what it's cracked up to be.


Dress up appropriately, but to your standard of clothing, not to the kind of standard of 'wow, I look cool/cute/whatever'. After that, you can conquer anything, even the meanest math teacher who you are convinced came from the depths of Hades realm exclusively to drag you down with her algorithms and algebra.

, Sixth graders tend to give you strange looks if you ask them for a teacher's room, since they expect you to know your way around the school.


Go find a teacher without a class or another classmate who is either looking very confident or is very good at the 'try not to look like a confused lamb' strategy.

, Even if you're a girl, have a taste for skirts, and love American Girl dolls- or maybe you dislike Twilight, or love Gone with the Wind, or know lots of web games - either way, don't hide something just because it doesn't fit your 'stereotype'. Chances are, that other girl or boy might know something about it too.

, You've had time to test it out in seventh grade - you were too unsure in sixth grade, but now is your time to shine. Get some of that stick-on wallpaper (easily peel-able), cut out a strip or so, or get some pictures and tape and cover the back of your locker with Jack and Sally (Nightmare Before Christmas) or Wolverine or Colossus or whomever you want to. Whomever or whatever. It isn't like people think you don't like it - which, if they do, you can tell them otherwise.

, You are only a year away from moving on to high school! If your school offers any high school preparation classes, consider taking one. Ask high schoolers for tips on how they are getting through the year, as advice might be of help.

Make sure to have everything you need.,
Change your wardrobe Middle school can be a big time ""clothes picker"" excuse!,
Get the school supplies.,
Make the most of orientation day.",How to Prepare Yourself for Middle School1," Some things you need are your school clothes, supplies, and anything else you think is necessary. If you don't have everything you may not perform as well .Remember to double check at home and review the list!;
, Start with clearing out your closet. Clothes that don't fit you anymore give them away to others! Clothes that are torn, ripped, or damaged should be thrown away. This should help you store much more clothing you'll need! Going shopping alone can be difficult. Have somebody else tag alongside with you to help out! The best people to bring with you is someone who is in or was in Middle School. They know what it's like.Make sure they are approved by your parents.

, School supply shopping is a little harder than clothes shopping. To have everything you need, copy the supply list down from your school's website or a good list that you think you'll need! The best way to save money on shopping is to go to a cheaper store like the Dollar Tree, (etc.)! But anyway you should get what is really needed. Like pencils, pens, erasers, binders, highlighters,(etc.)!

, On orientation day, look around (if they don't give you tours). Listen to your principal and teachers of classes you have to take, you'll get a feel for what they expect, personality and how they want things done.

Pick out your outfit the night before.,
Don't feel that you have to wear makeup.,
Take a shower in the morning.,
Take only what you need.,
Seek help from people already in middle school.,
Make some friends while you're waiting for school to open.",How to Prepare Yourself for Middle School2," You don't need to rush in the morning just because you spent half an hour picking out your outfit! Go for something between casual and original. But remember you are making first impressions so what you wear kind of dictates a part of your personality, so don't go o far outside your comfort zone!

, Expectations are overrated. You just got out of elementary school, no need to wear make up or do anything fancy with your hair. If you're not comfortable with it, don't do it! All these middle school girls you see in magazines, have makeup on solely for the advertisements. Going your first day with no makeup is quite the bold move itself, as it shows you have confidence in yourself and that you don't need makeup to attract attention!

, This will wake you up and make you smell fresh and feel great. ( Remember some nice deodorant to top it off.)

, You do not need to haul your whole home with you. All you really need for your first day really is a few snacks and a pencil or two and the recommended stationery and texts. Bringing extra pencils and snacks to share is a good way to break the ice with people you haven't met!

, The higher grades don't bite! If you're feeling daring enough, go and try to make some friends who are older than you, as they have experience in the area of grade 6 and may be able to give you some pointers.

, Mingle with some other stranger that may be hanging around too. If you can't find a loner to make friends with, go take a look at a map of the school and try to get the know the place, after all you're going to be spending a few years here.

Think about acne.,
Try to prevent acne.,
Have appropriately nice, fresh healthy hair to start middle school.,
Skin.","How to Start Middle School Nice, Fresh & Healthy (Girls)1"," As you start seventh grade in middle school, you may start to get acne. Acne is normal, so do not be afraid! For some people, acne can be really bad and they have to see a dermatologist. For others, it's not as bad.


Do not try to pop them acne blemishes. You may think ""Oh, I know what I'm doing..."" but odds are you don't. Popping your pimples can  cause the puss inside to leak all over your face or it may find it's way into your other pimples. Also, don't let anyone else to do it either. In the experience of some, allowing other to squeeze pimples, even those who claim to know how to do so safely, can result in pain and small scars.;
, Try these methods:


Before you go to sleep, tie your hair back in a ponytail or behind your face. Sure, you may like your hair loose and flowing, but no matter how many times you clean your hair, it still has oils and possibly dirt. The oils irritate your face, causing acne to breakout.
Wash your face, but not too much. Maybe twice a day, before school and before bed but if you wash your face too much, it may dry out causing more pimples and breakouts!
Get tons of sleep. Eight or more hours. Sleeping often reduces stress, and stress may cause your face to breakout.

, You may want longer hair, or a hair-cut. It's your decision, here are some important steps:


For African-American Hair: African Americans often have thick hair. This means unlike Caucasians, your hair can't be just loose and flowing all the time. Your hair is often more oily and because it is thick, it may take hours for your hair to be nice long and flowing. There are books which will advise you how to care for your hair, just for them Try to find a style you like. Another thing , a lot of girls school who are African American have weave. If they have long hair, it is never natural and one week they have long long hair then the next, it's short. They always have excuses like ""I uh- donated it to cancer."" (It may or may not be true.). If you are thinking of getting weave/extensions, rethink it. It takes hours for it to be applied and sometimes your real hair is a lighter or darker color than the fake hair.
For Caucasian/Asian Hair: Your hair is often thin. Sometimes you can get away with a bed-head or not. It is usually easy to brush and wash. So first of all, don't fidget with your hair! If it is in a pony-tail, and your hair slips out then it's fine to fix it. But if not, don't keep taking it out every ten minutes, it may fall out or break off. This actually happens to all hair types. Also, don't wash it too much. Washing it a lot can make it thinner. One last thing, don't dye your hair or dye it too much. This can make you loose hair. It you dye it, keep it. But don't dye and re-dye over and over. As a result, it can end as a wrong color or it can make/cause your hair to fall out!

, As you grow up, your skin can be smellier, oilier etc. Here are ways to keep it healthy:


Wash up or take a shower daily. Every morning take a shower. Not once a week. You may have gotten away with that in second grade, but now you sweat more and it skin needs to be cleaned.
Another thing: wear deodorant! As you sweat more, you get smelly under your pits. So it's time to buy some deodorant girls.
Try using cold water. It make may skin softer. You do not have to do this, but it's just something to throw out there.

Go to open house, especially if it is a new school.,
Have Your supplies.,
Know your locker combination.","How to Start Middle School Nice, Fresh & Healthy (Girls)2"," You get to meet your teachers and not only that but you get important papers, like a handbook, your schedule, locker combo etc. Also, at open house, you can usually sign up for clubs or sports. Such as art club, the co-ed basketball team or soccer team for example.

, Teachers, and sometimes your classmates, hate it when you do not come prepared. Here are some supplies most school ask for. Others are optional:


A Binder. Some schools do not allow zippered binders. Also, a 3 inch (7.6 cm) binder is what most schools require.
2 folders. Often, one for homework and another for Friday folder. A Friday folder is usually a folder that you give your teacher at the beginning of the week, and when it's Friday you get it back. It has your graded tests and important papers like field-trip forms.
Composition/notebooks. A lot of times, some classes require you to get a notebook to write notes.
This is optional: binder tabs. These go inside your binders and if you write notes, or get an assignment you place it in the tab.
Now the basics:
Backpack, not messenger bags because they put pressure on your shoulders. A one strap or two strap is better.

Pencils and a pencil pouch. Have more than 20 pencils or at least six mechanical ones. Keep a pouch to hold them, along with your sharpener, eraser (s) and high-lighters.
Lunch box or lunch money. Bring a lunch because school lunches are not as gross as they are on TV, but they often are not good either. Don't bring a plastic bag or paper bag. They can rip and your lunch spills out and they are always thrown away. A waste of a bag...



, Your locker is one of the best things about middle-school! Unlike the cubbies in second grade, you get a locker! Only you know the combo so no one can break in. Plus, it can be decorated and has more storage. Tips for decorating:


Use magnets, not stickers. You may not want to add stickers, but if you do never use them. Schools often have this rule. Stickers are well--sticky. They are hard to remove and if removed improperly it leaves a black gummy gunk left for the other kid who has to use it: gross. There are fun magnets too! Like iPhone app ones or doggy faces ones.
If it doesn't have shelves, you can buy them. Plastic shelves can easily slide in and out of your locker. They come in different colors and patterns.
You can apply magnetic dry-erase boards or cork boards in your locker. Dry erase boards have fun markers in many MANY colors. Cork boards need tacks. Also, you can get magnetic mirrors.
Also, carry/keep a kit inside here's how to make one:

Get a bag. Can be plastic or it can have a zipper.
Inside put: Band-Aids, pencils, hair bands/elastics, pads or tampons, socks (for after gym), make-up if your allowed to and want to, a small bottle of lotion, mints (never gum), deodorant and a list of emergency numbers just in case your sick and need to call home.


Tips for remembering your combo:

Make up a rhyme or poem for it. Rhymes are easy to remember but if you forget, write it on a sticky note and place it in your binder. For example: your combo is 9-12-32. A rhyme you can use is: I was once nine , and now I leave it behind. I'm now twelve not a 32 year old elf.
Also try a math problem. Use a sticky note to remember: 9+12=32! It's not right, I know but it's easy to remember.

If you're at a new school, find a clique or group with people you can relate to.,
It's okay to have a crush.","How to Start Middle School Nice, Fresh & Healthy (Girls)3"," If you like sports, hang out with sporty kids or girls. But here is an easy way to make friends:


Find someone you think seems nice.
Try to smile at him/her.
If they smile back find a seat near them.
If they don't say ""Hey, move it! I'm saving this seat for like Jenny. So like beat it."" start a conversation: ""Hey, do you like (insert-subject-or-thing-here)?"" ""Hi. I like your hair."" and there's always ""Hey. I'm (name) what's your name?""

, But don't be bothered about dating someone. If you have a best friend who's a guy, people might think your dating. This bothers me. Some kids are immature, so don't be bothered by it. Ignore them. But Middle-school dating sometimes does not last long and it's usually something like this:


Hand-holding or hugging
Taking to each other
Going to the movies with adult supervision
Texting each other
Skyping or IMing

Be prepared for every class.,
Don't lose anything!,
Always do your homework!,
Always pay attention in school.,
Find out which study method helps you most.,
Have a designated study area.,
Take your time.",How to Pass Any School Test in Middle School," Bring all the supplies you'll need. Binders, pencils, pens, paper, erasers, sharpeners, textbooks and loose leaf or notebooks. Don't ""forget"" these things at home; you'll need them and you don't want to be milking them out of your classmates, it'll make you look irresponsible to your teacher and will most likely annoy your classmates who always have to lend you their things. Being prepared is one the most important things in any school, and in any class.;
, Be organized! Keep all your notes in a binder for that class or teacher and keep them in order by date. Never throw out any notes. Even if they are from last term or the beginning of the school year, you never know when you'll be doing a full year review or exam. If old notes are cluttering your binder just transfer them to a pocket folder or duo-tang for safekeeping. This is good if you want to pass the MSP or any state test; taking notes is important preparation for any test. Always keep your notes!

, One of the important things in any school is that you always have to do your homework. During the whole school year think about how many homework assignments you've done. Even if you don't get A's on all of your tests at least you'll get an okay grade because all of your homework assignments. To you, homework that isn't graded might seem useless and a waste of time, but in reality it's preparing you for quizzes and tests and constantly refreshing your mind on the subject. It also shows responsibility and dedication to schoolwork, which teachers always appreciate.

, This way you won't have to do as much studying. Also, instead of trying to remember the work, jot down some fast and easy notes during class.


Learn how to take notes properly. If you want to make sure you hear and remember everything take quick jot notes, only using the most important details of each sentence.You can remove transition words such as ""the"". For example, instead of writing ""The fox chased the rabbit down the hole"", write ""Fox chased rabbit down hole"".







, For example, making a song on the work and then just remembering the song.

, Always study in an area where you won't be distracted. Turn off the TV and computer (unless you need it to study, in that case log out of things like social networks and e-mail) and any other electronics. Tell your family members that you are studying and ask them to try to be quiet. If you find yourself distracted in one area, move to another.


Places that you shouldn't study in include your bed, and in front of the TV or any high traffic area (where everyone walks through).







, Read all of your notes and go over past worksheets or assignments. Make sure you cover everything you don't understand or are having trouble with multiple times.

Finally, after you are done with your homework, put away EVERYTHING.,
Try hard, be patient, and you will get better grades, more time, or whatever you are reading this for in the end.",How to Manage School Work in Middle School," For example, saying ""I can do it, I can do it!"" It may be demanding, but after you get it out of the way, you will be relieved.;
, If there are events or happenings that you can't miss, find a time to complete your studies.

, Really make an effort to keep your finished homework in your planner.

, It helps a lot.

, School doesn't come easy. To have fun free time, it takes work and effort.

, In order to make this easier, eat a decent breakfast and get a some sleep the night before so your mind isn't set on food or sleep while you are in class.

, This is helpful, just in case there are any last minute tips your teacher may give you about a test, quiz, or just the topic you're learning about.

, When you are in class, you will then have something to keep you going throughout the day, in order to get to your free time to be able to do that activity. This tactic does take self control, however, it is up to you to get all of your homework done rather than skipping it to get to that one activity.

, If you have to study, then make sure you have flash cards to do it with.

, It is always better to do your homework right away, rather than doing your fun activity with the thought of your homework hanging over your head.

, That way, as your tolerance of the homework lessens, so does the required time spent, focus, and thought. This will make it infinitely easier for you to get your homework done efficiently, and thoroughly.

, You don't want to be behind because you forgot a binder, or homework. In most schools, you don't even receive credit for the homework you've done. SO DON'T FORGET ANYTHING!

, Thanks for reading!

Be enthusiastic.,

Have a reward waiting at the end.",How to Survive Standardized Testing in Middle School," Don’t try to “cram”, or study all the material at one time right before the test, because this has been shown not to help improve your test score. Cramming is also mentally exhausting, so you are better off studying small amounts of material each day for several months before your standardized test. This way, you will build your test-taking skills over a long period of time.


Some middle school students are naturally good test-takers, while others are not. You can speak with your teacher (or ask a parent to speak with your teacher) to find out if she has any personalized suggestions to help you prepare for your standardized test.
Ask your teacher for any tips and tricks for preparing for your standardized test. He may be able to offer you some methods (such as activities, or books, or computer games) that can make your test review more effective and more enjoyable as well.;
, You will want to make sure you know all of the material that was covered by your teacher in each of the different subjects. This should include basic concepts in mathematics and verbal comprehension, including phonics and reading comprehension.Review old concepts while practicing new concepts. You need to review old material that you may have covered in class months before the standardized test is given so that you can refresh your memory. Make review of old class material one of your top priorities.

, Make test review a consistent part of your schedule. Aim to review one to two times a week (or more often if you’d like to have shorter review sessions). If you can, set aside a set period of time at the same time each day. For example, you may want to review from 4:00-4:30 in the afternoon. That way you can come home and have a snack, do your review, and then relax before dinner.


Attempt to schedule these review sessions at a time when you feel that you will best dedicate his or her energy and attention to the task at hand. Don’t try to study very late at night when you might be tired, or right before dinner when you might be very hungry.

, Seeing progress in a visual way will help you feel that this standardized test is manageable.

, The best way to prepare for a standardized test is to practice taking a standardized test. When taking a practice test, you should try to take the test in the most realistic way possible. This means that you shouldn’t take breaks or get up and walk around whenever you feel like it. Instead, you should pretend that this is an actual standardized test. It will help you feel more comfortable with the experience that you will have on the day of the actual test.


Search online for practice tests. A Google search will lead you to example standardized tests and test questions that cover different topics that may be helpful for constructing a practice test. Alternatively, you can ask a parent, friend, or teacher to help make up an appropriate practice test.
Simulate real test taking situations. Standardized tests are strictly time and have instructions that must be followed precisely.When you give practice tests, make sure that you time yourself to make sure that you take the test within the time limit.
Practice answering different question types.This should include multiple choice questions, fill-in-the-blank questions, and questions that follow reading passages. You can read about different strategies for answering each type of question by searching online for test-taking strategies.

For example, you may want to eliminate answers given as options for a multiple choice question that you are certain aren’t true, even if you don’t yet know the correct answer. Simply drawing an “x” through the option or crossing it out will help you remember that you are certain that one answer isn’t true, and will give you a better chance at guessing the right answer.



, Reviewing for a standardized test will probably not be high on the list of things you want to do. In this case, making test review as fun as possible to help ease yourself into test review sessions. Try to start each review session with a small game or use fun study techniques as a motivating tool to review for the standardized test.


Try a quiz-show format.Practice for your standardized test with a friend, parent, or teacher using the same format as in the TV show “Who Wants to be a Millionaire.” To make it extra special, dim the lights and add music to make it a real game show experience! This is a great way to practice multiple choice questions.
Reward yourself. Rewards are an excellent way to review for her standardized test. You can ask your parent to provide a small amount of money or some candy, and keep track of how many rewards you earn for each question you get right on a practice test. Alternatively, you can talk with a parent or guardian abut receiving a larger reward for successfully completing a set number of review sessions each week.

, Remember that the standardized test is supposed to challenge you and make you think about everything you’ve learned so far in school. Try not to get frustrated by the test. Instead, remember that by doing preparation before the test, you are helping yourself to get the best possible score.

, Standardized testing is a little bit different in each state. In addition to covering basic skills, some states will include sections on specific content areas, such as a section about science. Ask your teacher what will be covered on the test, and see if he can make you a list of topics that you should review.


You can also do a Google search for the specific test you will be taking to find out more information about what will be covered on the test. This will form the foundation of your study plan to help with preparation for the upcoming test.
In addition to learning what material will be on the test, make sure you understand the scoring of the test as well. For example, are points taken off the score for a wrong answer or a skipped question? Make sure you the test’s system for scoring so that you know whether it is better to make a guess or leave a question blank., You might want to ask an older sibling, a friend who has already passed through middle school, your parent or guardian, or your teacher about the test. This includes small details, such as what to bring into the test, and larger topics, such as the worries you might have about the test. Talking to someone who has taken the standardized test already can help you feel much less worried and anxious.

, Here are some expert suggestions that will help with test-taking.Always read the directions carefully. Following the directions is an important part of being successful on a standardized test. You should read the directions more than once if you need to.
Read each question more than once. This will ensure that you understand the meaning of the question and don’t get tricked by a confusing sentence structure (which you will probably encounter on a standardized test).
Underline or highlight important words when you read. This can be especially important when you read a long reading comprehension paragraph. Highlight things such as the main focus of the paragraph or key words.
Skip hard questions and come back to them. Doing easy questions first will ensure that you answer as many questions correctly as possible (that is, you won’t run out of time thinking about hard questions and not get the chance to answer easy questions that are later in the test). This is a good strategy for getting the highest score possible on your standardized test.

, Ask your teacher what you may need for the test. Some tools you might need include a pencil, eraser, and calculator. Make sure that you have an adequate supply of any needed equipment before he or she goes to take the standardized test- for example, you don’t want to run out of lead in your pencil during your test.


Avoid the temptation to purchase an overly complex calculator. Make sure you feel comfortable using his or her calculator before going in to the standardized test.

, While your child will likely not want to spend a great amount of time reviewing for his upcoming standardized test, adequate preparation for this test is crucial for success. Being involved with your child’s test preparation will help him to do as well as possible on his upcoming standardized test.


Be available to answer questions. If you child can’t figure out the answer to a question, it will be helpful to him to have you around to help figure out the correct answer. Even if you don’t know the right answer, you can show him how to look it up in a textbook or using an online resource.
Help locate or create practice tests. Practice tests are the best way for your child to prepare for a standardized test. Help him to locate age and school-level appropriate tests online, or make up one for him if you are familiar with his curriculum and with the types of questions he will be asked on the standardized test.
Speak with his teacher if you have any concerns about his academic performance or readiness for this standardized test. As his teacher may be as or more familiar with his academic work and performance in the classroom as you are, he can be a great resource for helping you recognize how much additional preparation your child needs to do for his standardized test.

, Having a good night of sleep the night before (and preferably, the week before) the test and eating a nutritious breakfast the morning of the test will help to ensure that your child has the energy and focus needed to take her standardized test successfully.

, Reassure your child that the standardized test is one part of school, and that he or she will not be judged solely on the result of this test. Many people believe that standardized tests are not a true reflection of intelligence, since individuals vary so greatly in test-taking ability. Ensure your child that as long as he tries his best, you will be proud, and remind him that the scores do not reflect what kind of person he is.

, Listen to your child’s worries and fears about the standardized test, and acknowledge that test-taking stress is real, but remind them that there is nothing to be worried about or fearful of.If possible, put the standardized test in perspective for your child. It is important that they try their very best, but this test is not the most important academic venture they will undertake! Having an open conversation about the stress associated with test taking is an important part of testing success.

, Provide your child with some ideas of ways that he can relax if they start to feel anxious during the test.This can include taking 10 deep breaths, or thinking of a favorite memory or a beloved pet. You can even provide a “secret word” that they associate with something calming or pleasant to help him get through the test.

, Use classroom games as a way to review content that will be covered on the standardized tests. Games will help your students to stay engaged with the review and will work to solidify the information that you worked so hard to teach.Make a game similar to Jeopardy, where you are Alex Trebek and your students are the contestants.If you think that the format of Jeopardy (where the contestant answers in the form of a question) would be confusing to your students (or too difficult for you to create), make each column a different subject (such as grammar, geometry, mathematics, etc.) and ask a different question of increasing difficulty as the prize amounts increase.

, As the week of the test approaches, give your students some “brain breaks.” These can be short sessions which you play games, do art projects, or run around outside. You’ve probably been fitting in as much review time as possible in the past weeks, so as the test date rolls around, allow your students’ brains to have a rest before they are required to perform on the standardized test., No teacher particularly enjoys standardized testing, but it is important not to let your students see what may be your true feelings toward the testing system. Instead, be their cheerleader (extra points if you actually bring in pom-poms and make up a cheer for them!) Get them excited and enthusiastic about the test, remind them of their skills and preparation, and assure them of your confidence in them.


Create a test countdown. Countdown the number of days and hours until the test begins and they get the chance to show everyone how much they have learned over the last year in school.

, Let your students know that they can come and talk to you if they have any concerns about the upcoming standardized test. Offer to listen to questions, anxieties, or worries, and do your best give advice and guidance as the test date approaches. You may find that students you never expected to be concerned about a standardized test are the ones that come to you with worries about their performance.


Provide an opportunity for an open question and answer session at the end of a class period where your students can ask questions or express concerns about the test that might be shared by other students as well. This is a good way to get some of the more common questions out of the way in front of an entire class instead of having to deal with the same question repeatedly.
In addition to an open question and answer session, provide “office hours” during which your students can come talk to you one-on-one about any personal concerns they might have about the test that they do not feel comfortable talking about in front of their whole class. This gives any students who may have a situation such as a learning disability or a personal issue a chance to express any anxiety surrounding the test.

, Incentivize your students to get through their standardized testing by having a reward waiting for them on the other side. Think of a fun activity like a movie in class or a pizza party, so that your students will have something to look forward to at the end of the standardized testing period.

Enjoy yourself.",How to Make the Switch from Elementary School to Middle School," The summertime is fun, and relaxing- with all of the free time, children tend to forget lessons that were taught in the past year. Teachers expect you to be prepared and to understand concepts that you’ve been over before. Take 15 minutes each night during the break, to review those past skills. Each little bit helps. You’ll see that this understanding of past material, will make future lessons in middle school a whole lot easier.;
, Try to prepare yourself for that first day of school. See if your local middle school offers a tour, in which you’ll be shown the location of the classrooms, cafeteria, restroom, water fountains, etc. Take notes on these locations, to place in your backpack on the first day. If possible, set up a meeting with your soon-to-be teachers, just so that you can see what they’ll be like. Try to have a general idea of the school.

, Talking about your feelings on middle school is important. Discuss with your friend what you’re looking forward to, what you’re scared about, and how you want this year to be the same or different than the last. Maybe your friend can help reassure you about something you’re currently frightened or unsure about. Or maybe you can do the same for them. Even if this doesn’t occur, letting out the rush of excitement and fear before the first day, can help it go smoother.

, The night before your first day, make sure your backpack is ready to go. It’s a good idea to have your clothes laid out, your toothbrush in a quick to reach spot, and an alarm clock ready to go. never hit the snooze button on the first day of school (or any, for that matter). It’s important that you are on time, and show that you’re ready to learn. Go to bed at a reasonable hour, so that you’ll be alert and energized the next day.

, When you walk in that door, be completely confident in yourself. Smile and be pleasant toward teachers and other classmates. Dedicate hard work to everything you do in class.

, All of them will have different preferences, guidelines, and grading techniques. Get to know each of them and know what they’ll expect as the year proceeds. Learn how to work with all different personalities. Even if you hate a teacher, try your best in their class- it can’t hurt and it certainly can make your school day easier!

, Making the transfer to middle school, will bring new friends to your life. However, you need to have time to bond with old friends and get to know your new friends.

, Making any big change can be stressful. Don't overcrowd your schedule or go out of your way to get an A+ in every single class. Having good time management is really important, and can help prevent those stressed out panic attacks. Try to relax, and instead of focusing on your mistakes, fix them. One bad grade on a quiz is not the end of the world, as long as you study a little harder next time.

, Middle school is usually the beginning of cliques and other unpleasant ""popularity"" contests. Stick with your priorities; you're cool no matter what- sinking to the level of catty-ness is not going to get you anywhere. Show that you're more mature than that, and can live above it. Be who you are and not what the ""popular"" kids want you to be.

, Middle school is usually the time where girls and guys develop crushes. Nowadays, some kids begin dating in sixth, seventh, or eighth grade. If you are dating someone, don't just go out with them to be cool. Don't set your Facebook status as ""I LOVE BILLY,"" one week and ""I LOVE TOM"" the next week. You should actually like the person, and they should always treat you with respect. If you're not dating someone, remember that you have plenty of years to go! In high school, there's many more options for relationships. And the later you wait, the more mature you'll be when you have to make decisions about these relationships.

, This is probably the first time you'll be exposed to rumors and gossip...and it is not a very pleasant thing. Rumors blow things completely out of proportion, and can really hurt people. The more you help other people become less gossipy, the less people are going to gossip about you.

, Try to participate in many activities, and get involved at your new school. You’ll get new friends, learn something, and have fun. Take this new environment as a new opportunity to try something you've never done before!

, Middle school years are some of the best. Although you should always have schoolwork be your top priority, try to slip a little fun in your day too.

Before you know it, the year will fly by.",How to Make Seventh Grade an Amazing Year at a New School," When summer begins, find fun ways to stay active. Get a group of friends together and play outside. Try playing football, soccer, or kickball. Ride your bike or skateboard around. Get creative! Exercise doesn't just mean hitting the gym or playing outside. Even simple household chores, like walking the dog or cleaning the house will get you up and moving!;
, Grains, like breads, pasta, cereal, and rice, give your body energy. Nutrient rich veggies, such as broccoli, peas, tomatoes, carrots, and green beans, contain important factors such fiber, vitamin C, and potassium, all important for a healthy you. Fruits like apples, strawberries, peaches, raspberries, pears, bananas, blueberries, and oranges, are naturally low in calories and fat. Fruit contains many nutrients in which your body needs. Different unsaturated fats include olive oil, canola oil, and peanut oil are considered the healthiest, but should still make up a very little portion of a healthy diet. Consume plenty calcium rich milk products for strong bones. These include milk, yogurt, and cheese. The important thing about meat and beans is that it helps you maintain your protein balance. In fact, your muscles, organs, and immune system are built of mainly protein. Find just the right balance for you to create a healthy diet for you. You can refer to a food guide pyramid.


When consuming food, do not eat past your limits. When you feel full, stop eating! Don't force yourself to shove down food you don't need. Eating using a smaller plate will trick your mind into thinking you've had your fill.

, Drink plenty of water. A healthy amount is about six (6) glasses a day. Milk is a healthy choice as well. Stay away from energy drinks, such as Red Bull and Monster. They are tempting, but extremely dangerous! Face it, Kidney stones are no fun, and who wouldn't prevent cancer that can be prevented? Don't take the risks of energy drinks. Another downer to energy drinks is that they spike your sugar levels, and then they go right back down. So after that killer energy hype, you're going to crash.

, A lot of teens don't establish much of a routine, but they are very important. We need 8-10 hours of sleep a night. So if you have to wake up at six, you should go to sleep around nine. This means you should be in bed relaxing and trying to fall asleep at about 8:30 PM. This can be adjusted to your preference, depending on how long it usually takes you to doze off. Try to create a set way of doing things. Do you like to shower at night before bed or in the morning? How long does it take you to get ready in the morning? Take into consideration the time you will have to leave every morning and how long it takes you to get ready each morning. These are the factors to take into consideration when creating a routine. Set aside time in the morning to shower, eat breakfast, style your hair, get dressed, do your makeup, etc; Just make sure you have enough time. For your evening routine, establish times you will use to study and do homework, and shower, if you shower in the evening. Also, figure out how long it takes you to get ready for bed each night.

, That would be a bad way to start an amazing year. Take time before school starts to buy all the supplies needed. School is a structured learning facility, and without proper supplies, you won't learn to your full potential. Most schools provide grade specific supply lists. If your school is one to do this, go by that list. If not, buy plenty of supplies on your own. Recommended supplies are:


Pencils
Pens
Spiral Notebooks for note- taking and classwork. It's a great idea to supply yourself with one notebook for each class.
One folder for each class
Highlighters
A binder to organize schoolwork
Erasers
A 4- function calculator
Index cards
Notebook paper- get plenty of this!
A few composition notebooks

, It should have plenty of space for all your supplies and provide good back support. Never wear a backpack with only one strap. Use both to avoid injury. It may look 'cool' to wear your backpack with only one of the straps, but it will have damaging effects in the long run.

, This part is a lot of fun. Since you will be attending a new school, try something new. Basic wardrobe supplies include:


A variety of jeans (Bootcut, Skinny, Jegging, Flare, etc;)
Graphic tees (These have endless possibilities )
Hoodies (You can buy them in all clothes stores in different colors and patterns)
A few cute blouses
Skirts
A simple belt that will go with everything.
A few pair of shoes that you feel confident in.

, However, extremely baggy clothing or clothing that doesn't fit right and is way to tight is very, very, unattractive. Never force yourself into clothing that makes you feel uncomfortable. It's okay to experiment with different styles and find what suits you.

, Lay out a flattering outfit in a place you can find it when you wake up. This will be the outfit you wear tomorrow, so choose wisely. Go through your evening routine and drift off to sleep. Let all your first day worries drift off to bed with you and be prepared to wake up refreshed and prepared for a wonderful first day. Set your alarm 15- 30 minutes earlier than you would usually wake up for school just in case anything unplanned happens. Make sure you know prior to the start of school what form of transportation you'll be using to get to and from school to avoid the first day rush. If you are planning to ride the bus, you may have obtained a bus pass that you will need to present to the bus driver as to enter the bus. Make sure that is with everything else you plan to take to school. Pack your backpack the night before school each night, starting the night before the first day. It's a good habit that should be obtained and sustained.

, Think positive. While you are getting ready, if allowed, play some upbeat, positive music while you prepare yourself. It shouldn't be too loud, and surely not sad at all. You want a positive outlook on the day. To begin with, allow yourself five to ten minutes to wake yourself up and get moving. This ten minutes may include using the bathroom or splashing cold water on your tired face. Once you are awake, begin your morning routine. Take a look in the mirror to make sure you look exactly the way you want to, and then take a look over your backpack to make sure you have everything you need. When it's time to leave, smile as you walk out the door, assuring yourself the day will run smoothly and perfectly.

, It makes you look friendly and approachable, which you are. Since you are new, it would be okay to walk up to a fellow student in your grade and ask about the school. First impressions are important, because you will never have a second chance for a first impression. Who knows, you could make new friends!!

, Politely introduce yourself to your teacher. Remember: First impressions are everything. Repeat this with all of your classes on the first day. Most of the time, teachers take the first few days for kids to adjust to the new grade and get situated before throwing out any real assignments. In the case that this doesn't happen and your school has you jump right into assignments, take note of it. Most schools supply the students with their own planner to write down important dates and assignments. Make writing in your planner a habit from the first day to the end of the year. As soon as you get an assignment, it should be taken note of in your planner, and continue doing so throughout the year.

, You will get more respect from fellow peers and mentors by doing so. Become very well knowledgeable of school guidelines and procedures and abide by them. Never do something bad because all the 'cool' kids are doing it. The really cool thing to do is follow the rules. This will give you a more pleasurable learning experience. Remember to never disrespect your teachers, seeing as they take time to educate you for a good future.

, Build your social group with loyal, trustworthy, and kind people. It is perfectly okay to have a social life and friends and plans, but your social life should be balanced with your school life. School life should always come before your social life.

, Trying to add romance to your life is a bad idea at this point. Face it: hormones are raging, and you are unlikely to make good decisions. The chances of you marrying somebody you date in seventh grade are very slim. Save the romance for a more mature point in your life. Focus on school.

, Doing so will make you a very reliable student. Truth be told, teachers don't intend assignments to be mid-evil torture devices. They are only meant to better you as a student.

, Always take notes in class and study. If you rush when taking notes, keep two notebooks for notes: One of which can be done fairly sloppily in school while to rush to take notes, and one of which you copy the rushed, sloppy notes into neatly and orderly. Always begin studying one week prior to a test, and never wait until the night before. A positive benefit of studying is that even when you have an unexpected pop quiz, you will be prepared with information obtained from studying. Study even when you don't have a test on the way. Studying will help you obtain good grades and positive school habits.

, Never say never. If you get a bad grade on a quiz, study harder. Did those mean girls tell you your outfit was ugly? Just laugh and say, ""Okay, if you think so"" and ignore them. Don't let them ruin your self confidence.

, You can go home on the very last day of school, knowing that you had an amazing year.

",How to Pass Sixth Grade," This goes without saying, but having all the proper materials for school can mean the difference between getting an F or getting an A.;
, Write down all your homework by day, and be sure to make sure you do it.

, By sitting up straight, it is scientifically proven that your brain becomes more active and you will learn more.

, Not only is it rude and can get you in trouble, but you will become distracted and won't hear what the teacher is saying.

, Depending on your placement, thirty minutes to and hour and a half will suffice.

, Not only is it fun but it's also great so you can all celebrate the great grade you get on the test later.

, Much more productive to study before school than to talk.

, Make sure your nails are trimmed, hair brushed, and clothes aren't wrinkled. Doing this will make you feel good about yourself and less afraid to ask questions in class when you need help. 

,, Do it at least 45 minutes a night. Whenever a big quiz is coming, study 2 nights before. Don't play with electronics all the time; study some days.

Strike up a conversation.,
Be nice to others.,
Mingle.,
Invite people you like to sit with you or visit your house.,
Join your school's societies and clubs.,
Consider joining a clique or forming a friend group.,
Be a good friend.,
Be nice.,
Be fair to all of your friends.",How to Make Friends in Middle School," Making friends can sometimes be tough, but bringing up a conversation can lead the way! Start by talking to the person you are sitting next to in class. How about saying something like: ""Where did you go before coming here?"" ""Did you watch the new scary movie that was so cheesy?"" ""I like your pencil case, where did you get it?"" Be funny and sweet. If you have nothing to talk about, just listen to what happens in the room (but don't be a snoop!) , or if you know what the person's hobbies are, then talk about that! Also, a friendly smile can go a long way!


Find interesting topic starters. You will not get an answer every time from ""What's up?"" Ask them about the weather, or what kind of music they like.;
, To make friends, be nice to everyone, every person from every culture and religion, so you can be known as a friendly person! Give people some compliments, but don't lie about them, or go overboard with your compliments. If you don't have anything nice to say, don't say it. Some people can get really offended at the smallest thing.


The best way to make friends is to compliment them. Say something like, ""I love your shirt! Where do you go clothes shopping?"" Or point out something funny if they look like they need a good joke. You could even ask if they live by the school too, but don't just say where do you live because that might creep them out.

, It always helps to go to dances or social events. This shows people you care about things like having fun and friends. It also showcases that you know how to have fun.

, If you have started your conversations with your future friends, you can invite them over to sit with you at lunch! Or, maybe invite friends that you've gotten to know for quite a while already to your house, or somewhere else, such as the movie theater.

, A club or a society is a great way of making friends. You'll have common interests and plenty of opportunities to get together outside of classes.


You can discuss everything with club members after meet-ups or activity sessions. This will help you to make friends.

, If there is a clique at recess or at some other place, perhaps you can join it. If you see someone in the clique that's quiet, start making small talk to her/him. You will most likely make friends with them. Don't be discouraged if it doesn't work immediately, persistence is key.


Do not forget to be yourself. If you can't be yourself around them, then they aren't worth it.
If a clique isn't your thing, form a looser friendship group with varied friends who don't necessarily have to copy each other or live in one another's pockets all of the time. This freer grouping may allow you to have a wider range of friends with varying interests than a clique would otherwise provide.

, When your future friend has told you a secret, make sure you don't tell anyone else no matter what. They trusted you enough to tell you something that no one else can know! Or if she/he gives you a compliment, don't get confused and say: ""Umm, thanks, I guess?"" Because that would hurt their feelings.


Make sure you care about what they say, and be a good listener! That's always a good way to make new friends or replacing old ones, and to make a good conversation! But nobody's perfect so remember to forgive and forget.

, Being nice will always pay off, and that's a good thing! Continue to be true to yourself and stand up for others and yourself. Do not lose sight of yourself by being too nice.

, Never ignore them, and try to make time to hang out with all of them if some of them don't get along. Nobody likes anything less than when a friend starts ditching them for anyone; whether they're their best friend who's in another class, or one of the popular kids. It feels terrible; and it can turn people away from you and make you lose your friends.

Build up your self-confidence.,
Avoid blaming yourself for the teasing.,
Remember that their words are not a reflection of you.,
Confide in close friends.,
Let your personality be seen.",How to Make Boys Stop Teasing You in Middle School1," Building your self-confidence takes time and patience, but working towards higher self-confidence can help you to feel better about yourself even when you are dealing with a bully. Some things you can do to build your confidence up include:Making a list of your achievements. Writing down all of the things you have achieved in your life so far, big or small may help you to feel more confident. Try writing down as many achievements as you can think of and read the list often. For example, you might include passing a difficult test, making the winning goal for your soccer team, or finishing a really long book.
Identify your strengths. It is also helpful to list all of the things that make you special. Try writing down a list of your strengths, such as your kindness, honesty, or loyalty. You can also include things like skills, special talents, and any special knowledge you possess.
List your goals. Making a list of things you hope to accomplish one day can also help you build self-confidence. These can include things like, get an A in math class, attend college, become a lawyer, etc. Make a list of all the goals you have, short and long-term.;
, Many kids and teens will blame themselves for being different when they feel bullied or picked on. This only feeds the cycle and gives people more power to pick on you. Instead, you should recognize that the person teasing you is at fault.For example, if a person is teasing you for being “too smart,” it is likely a result of their insecurities with their own grades.

, When being teased, kids and teens often start to build their identity around the hurtful things that are said. You need to remember that there are many good things about you and your personality, and that the teasing is more of a reflection of the bullies personality than yours.Someone saying something like “You’re boring,” does not make you boring. They do not speak for everyone, and the insult is typically just a way to upset you.

, Talking to your close friends can help to eliminate the feelings of isolation that often plague the victims of teasing. It will make you feel connected to your peers, and will also give you the chance for an emotional release. Your friends might also be able to help you stop the teasing if they are aware of how much it bothers you., Some kids and teens withdraw in an attempt to avoid teasing. Instead, you should let your personality show. Being confident will send a message to anyone teasing you that you are in control of your life. It can also make it easier to make more friends, which will often help to defer the teasing.For example, if you are being teased for being bad at a sport, do not let this prevent you from showing off how good you are at singing.

"
"
Ignore them.,
Try using humor to turn the focus back on the bully.,
Confront them.,
Let your friends help you.",How to Make Boys Stop Teasing You in Middle School2," Teasing is usually done to get a response from the victim. You can send a clear message that you do not care what they have to say if you simply ignore the teasing. Just walk away holding your head high and confident. If the teasing takes place online or in text, do not reply., By saying something humorous, you can show the bully that you are not affected by their words and also turn the focus on them. This may be enough to get them to lose interest and stop.


Try saying something like, ""You must really like me! You put all your time and energy into noticing everything I do. I'm flattered!""
Or, you can try, “Look, I’d really like to stay and chat Billy, but I don’t want to be late to class. You can stay out here as long as you want though!”Then, just walk away.

, You should avoid a physical confrontation. Physical confrontations can quickly escalate to someone being hurt, and can get you into a lot of trouble. Instead, stand your ground and tell the boys to stop teasing you.Saying something like “I would appreciate it if you kept your opinion to yourself,” can send the message that you do not care what they think, but will stand up for yourself if they continue to harass you.
For example, if you are being teased, you might look at the person doing the teasing and say “I would really appreciate it if you stopped trying to tease me.”

, Teasing is often done in an attempt to gain attention from other people around. If your friends stand firmly with you and send the message that nobody is amused by the teasing, this can help to stop the teasing. Tell your friends how the teasing makes you feel and ask them to help you stop it.Just having a friend around can deter the bullying. Ask your friends to hang out with you in places that you know you would normally have to deal with the teasing.

"
"
Ask advice from your parents.,
Talk to someone at the school.,
Make an appointment with a counselor.",How to Make Boys Stop Teasing You in Middle School3," Your parents are there to help you be successful and happy. If you are being teased in middle school, both of these things become harder. Explain the teasing to your parents and ask them what they think you should do. Depending on the severity and the type of teasing, the school may need to get involved as well., If you feel unsafe or think that you need help controlling the teasing at school, talk to one of your teachers about the situation. Alternatively, you could reach out to your guidance counselor for support concerning the teasing. If necessary, your principal may also get involved.Report any type of teasing that is physical or sexual in nature immediately. This includes any hitting, slapping, or shoving, but also includes verbal/written sexual harassment. Tell a teacher that you are comfortable with, or go straight to the principal to report these issues. If they are not taken seriously, you should tell your parents and ask them to help.

, If you are having a particularly hard time dealing with the teasing, and do not feel comfortable opening up to parents or teachers, ask your parents to make you an appointment with a professional counselor. Counselors are trained to listen to you and help you work through your problems. Counselors will also help you build coping skills to manage the stress in your life."

Try to get all A's.",How to Make the Best out of Middle School," Nobody wants to be around someone who is always looking disgusting. Make sure you shower every day, brush your teeth, comb your hair, and wash your face daily.;
, To do this, just simply get an alarm and set it for about an hour and a half before you have to be at school.

, Try to make new friends, even if you already have a lot of friends. This way, you will always have someone in all your classes to talk to.

, This way, you don't get in trouble, you don't have to worry about getting your homework done in class before its due, and you don't get points taken off for being late.


Put your cell phone in another room, don't turn on the T.V., and save the IMing for after your homework is done. If you do all of your homework when you get home, you won't have to worry about trying to get it done after dinner or whatever.







, Pack your backpack, take a shower, and pack your lunch before school starts so you have more time to sleep in in the morning.

, Just be yourself. Wear the clothes that you like, not the exact same clothes that the ""popular"" girl wore yesterday. You can base what you buy on some of the looks that they wear, just don't copy them.

, Try to be in some sort of music class, AVID, sport, foreign language, and outside of school clubs.

, That way if you get a really bad grade, it won't mean that you'll be failing the class if you would have been if you had a C in that class. Always turn in your work on time so that if you accidentally left your homework at home, your teacher might go easier on you.

Be healthy.,

Choose a seat at lunch, and choose your lunches wisely.,
Know that there will be bullies.",How to Know What to Expect in Middle School," If you have a heavy backpack, put the heaviest things at the bottom and have the lightest things at the top. If your school doesn't have lockers, it's okay. It just means you have to carry everything in your backpack. If you don't want to carry everything on your back, get a roller backpack so you have less strain on the things you have to carry.;
, In middle school, there is more homework than in elementary school. Homework should be done first thing when you get home.

, Make sure you know you locker combination! You don't want to be late for class and risk detention!

, Most school buses in real life are not like the ones in movies or on TV, and most buses are not fun. If your school lets you bring an iPod, listen to it on the bus. If you can't bring an iPod, then bring a book to read, or do something else.


It's usually rather difficult to do homework when the bus is bouncing up and down and there are people being annoying. If you do homework on the bus, sit in the front because it's a less bumpy ride.
Find some friends or make some new friends who ride the bus. It will make your trip to school more enjoyable.

, The school's good or bad reputation does not define what the teachers will be like. Every teacher is different, and you should just adjust to the way the class is (e.g. if your science teacher does not like interruption, practice on being quiet in science class).


Not all teachers are ""evil"" and ""out to get you"". Usually teachers have better things to do than torture little kids and fail them all. That is usually all myths. Remember, teachers want you to do well! They don't want to sit in a classroom all afternoon after the final bell rings grading some tests with all F's.

, Have fun in class with people you know, but make sure that your teacher does not get annoyed with you. Be quiet when your teacher is talking, and definitely be respectful.


Some teachers are very nice, and some are not so nice. To find out who they are, talk to friends' siblings and look at him/her if you can.
Don't be afraid to ask questions! It shows the teacher that you are paying attention and you're interested in the subject. The teacher also might like you better.

, Along with focusing in class and completing all of your homework, grades should also be one of your areas of focus. Strive to do your best and be happy with the grade you achieve. The study habits you develop now will carry through to high school and college/university.


When taking notes, think about what the teacher considers important, because that stuff will most likely end up on a test.

, Make sure you wash your hands, brush your teeth, wash your face, and take baths or showers regularly.

, Find people who are nice to you and seem like great people. Sometimes, you won't really be friends with anyone in your classes, and all of the people you're friends with are in other classes. That's okay; maybe they will be in your class next year.


Ask your parents if you can let some of your friends sleep over sometimes, or if you can meet them for lunch somewhere.

, There will be way more boys and girls than who was in your elementary school. However, you need to remember that school is the most important thing in your life right now.


If you do find that special boy or girl, make sure he/she doesn't interfere with your schoolwork. Most of the time, middle school relationships don't work out. Save your love life for high school. Middle school is not for dating. You're tweens, but dating isn't really that important. Just have fun!

, You'll probably have more selection now that you are in a bigger school.


Make sure you have your lunch money, as well as money for sodas and snacks.
Plan a spot where you and your friends will sit together. At some schools, there is assigned seating. However, as annoying as it sounds, this is a place to make friends and talk freely.

Sit next to different people. This way, you might be surprised as to what comes up in conversation. You might even meet new people!



, Try to avoid them and not get involved with fights. Learn some techniques for dealing with them.

"
"
Never get caught up in trying to be popular.,
Try to make a lot of friends, but.,
Always be yourself.,
Don't let friends ruin your grades.,
Never Fight.,
Be prepared all the time.,
Actually do your homework.,
Stay Organized.,
Lockers.,
Listen to the dress code.,
Lunch.,
This is the most that anyone will be able to give you.",How to Get Used to Middle School," You should know one thing about popular people. They think that just because they have the coolest fashions, then they rule the school. However, one thing is for sure: many people would rather have intelligence over popularity!;
, Keep a close group of best friends. You'll know that you can always trust each other and discuss things.

, When you are yourself, then you feel comfortable, right? If you're someone you're not, then people are bound to find out that you aren't being yourself. The charade won't fool anyone for more than a little while.

, Good Grades are something you need to have in Middle School. In Elementary, if you got an F, then you still got to go to your next grade. In Middle School, you will get held back if you receive a grade lower than 59 average. If a friend gets a better grade than you, sure, you'll be upset, but don't get competitive. Be happy for them and keep working hard on the assignments.

, Fighting isn't only bad for yourself physically, but also mentally. You'll start to get into fights all the time. This could result in getting into trouble and possibly getting detention back.

, Teachers really hate if you forget something in class. It disturbs both the teachers' teaching and the learning for other kids. You should have all of your supplies in your backpack, not at home or in your locker. You can make a mental checklist of everything you need to have when you leave class so that you don't forget anything.

, If you do all of your homework, even if you don't get it, then it will boost your grade up. It can actually bring you up from a failing grade!

, Read other wikiHow articles on how to stay organized. It is very important in middle school, since you will have 6+ classes to keep track of!

, One of the most exciting things in a 6th graders' first year. Now, some schools only let you go before school, after school, before lunch and after lunch, so be aware. But, otherwise, lockers are great for storing things that you won't need at the moment. Don't let your locker get messy. It'll be a hassle when it's time to clean it out.

, The entire reason that the dress code is there is for you to follow it. In many schools, if you don't follow the dress code, you will get Deans' Detention That is where you miss a whole day of school in order to sit in the Deans' office to do work (including during lunch), and then you'll have to do your missed work later.

, Yum, Cheese Pizza. Nasty, Mystery Meatloaf. Look at your school's lunch menu. If you don't like what they are having, then bring your own lunch. Who doesn't like knowing what you eat, and how it was made? In school, it's all behind scenes, so you have no idea what they do. -Warning: Schools may have extremely long lunch lines. Therefore, if you have a short lunch, then you won't have time to eat. If you don't have lunch money, or you don't have a lunch don't freak out! If you find yourself in this situation ask 5 of your friends for 1 dollar, if they give it to you then try to get a protein filled item from a vending machine (if your school has them)-

, Please go to school and stay in school; it's the best thing you can ever do in life

Get a notebook.,
Figure out why you have low grades.,
Why are those reasons happening?,
How can I improve?,
What should I improve on?,
Once you are positive you have improved, cross that off and move down the list.,
Stay devoted to getting better grades.,
Keep in mind that middle school is a lot of responsibility, so is improving your grades.,
After a few weeks, you should notice an improvement in your grades if you were responsible and made an effort.,
Know the biggest message: Every student is different!,
If you don't want people to know that you are studying so you don't get seen as a know-it-all or a geek, but still don't want your grades to drop, do your studying in your room when you know you won't be distracted by your friends or anyone else.

",How to Improve Your Grade in Middle School," Start by dividing one sheet of paper into three columns. Label one 'Reason', another 'What?', and the last one, ""Improvement"". Seeing what is distracting you will help you improve your grades in any subject whether it is hard or easy.;
, Are you doing your homework? Are you spending time studying for tests? Do you pay attention in class? Do you put school before social events and sports? Sit down and write down all the reasons why you think your grades have dropped underneath the 'Reason' column. Number them from the biggest problem to the smallest problem. Always work on the hardest problem first, then eliminate the smaller ones.

, For example, instead of ""I don't do my homework"" you could write, ""I don't have a quiet place to do my homework, because my siblings are too loud"". Or next to ""I don't pay attention in class."" you might write, ""I have a hard time paying attention because I don't get enough sleep."" Write that in the 'Why?' column.

, If the reason column said ""I don't do my homework"", and the Why? column said ""I don't have enough time because I play too many sports"", in the Improvement column, you might write ""I will drop one sport and set aside an hour every evening for studying and homework"".

, Pick one item from the 'Reason' column to improve on. This part varies for every person. Start with the biggest problem and work your way down. If your biggest problem is that you can't pay attention in class, and your improvement is getting more sleep, then start doing that.

, You'll be amazed how fast you can check everything off and how fast your grades will begin improving.

, Don't be a slacker! Try whatever techniques work for you. Some people may write down that they will study 20 minutes every day for three days before a test. It's up to you to figure out how to study! Many people like flashcards, others like games, and others prefer just to read the material. Try a little of each and give yourself a mini-quiz after to see how well you remembered the material. Whichever works the best you should use everyday.

, This guide doesn't tell you exactly what to do to improve your grades. You need to be a judge of that yourself. You may just need to study harder or you may need to approach a teacher and ask for after-school help. Be responsible and don't expect everything to just happen overnight.

, Don't stop being a good student now! Keep up your habits.


Sure, sacrificing a shopping trip or an hour on Facebook may seem horrible now, but, once you get your report card, it will be worth it.

Remember to reward yourself after completing a task so you feel more confident and you have something to push yourself when trying to get to your goal.



, Studying with friends isn't always the best idea because every student learns things a different way. Find out which ways help you learn better, and use it.

Think of the consequences. If she goes and tells an adult (which she should) you probably will get in trouble. Do you really want to?
If you aren't the bully, but you are the victim, stay calm. Ignore them if they are verbally bullying you, and walk away.

Navigate the middle school's website with your child.,
Visit the school with your child.,
Find out if there are any summer sessions (enjoyment-based or education-related) at the school.,
Read over the student conduct policy with your child.,
Keep in mind that most secondary schools have lockers and locks.,
Consider buying a wristwatch for your child.,
Teach your child how to make friends.,
Teach your child how to start a conversation.,
Go over different social rules.,
Know what after-school activities the school offers.,
Consider whether the school has an Individualized Education Program (IEP).,
Seek for updates about chances to meet your child's teachers.,
Over the summer, create a practice schedule for your child to follow.,
Create a homework schedule.,
Sit with your child while he or she completes his or her homework.",How to Help Ease Your Child's Transition to Middle School," There are some things that you will need to know about the school before sending your child, including your school's:


Student conduct policy
Dress code
Bell schedule (meaning the number of class periods in a school day, and the times when class periods start and end)
Notices, such as enrollment orientations and fundraisers
Tour opportunities for aspiring new students.;
, There should be an ""open house"" for him or her before school starts; bring your child to that. Get to know the schedule, rules and regulations, principal, teachers, and everything else that you and your child need to know about the school.


Ask for a printed copy of the period class schedule. Help your child to get to class on time. For example, if second period starts five minutes after first period ends, attempt to see if your child can walk from one classroom to another in five minutes.

You should also advise him or her to avoid conversations with friends (just saying ""hi"" on the way is okay, but not trying to engage in deep conversation) because both of you are trying to get to your next class. Unless your child and his/her friend have that next class together, deep conversation should be saved for the class (or classes) that the friends have together, during lunch period or after school.



, You could register your child for one of these sessions, so that his or her fear can be calmed over summer break.

, Talk over the rules that your student will need to follow, and ask the administration for clarifications if you have any doubts.

, Purchase a combination or key lock for your child (dependent on what is easiest for him/her) and help your child in learning how to open and lock the lock. You will not be there to help when your child is at school, so it's important to practice with him/her in advance.

, This will help him/her keep track of time so that he or she is not late to classes, and knows when the bell is going to ring soon.

, At any new school, it can be difficult to fit in with a new group and make friends. It is important to be friendly and make a good first impression.


Teach your child how to be a true friend. A true friend is a good listener, helps protect his or her friends when they are vulnerable, is loyal, and forgiving. There are many other qualities of a true friend; have discussions about this preferably before school starts.

, Learning to initiate a conversation and making small talk are key to making and keeping good friends. Go over some examples of good and bad conversation topics, as well as conversation starters. Practice conversing with your child to alleviate his or her fears of starting a conversation.

, There are many social rules that your child hasn't learned yet; the transition to middle school is the perfect opportunity to teach them! For example, talking with your mouthful could be considered rude, and it is important to drop the headphones when your child is in the middle of a conversation. , The school may offer an activity that your child is interested in. For example, if he or she is into chess, see if the school offers a chess club. Joining a club is a good way to find things in common with other people, and potentially make a new friend!

, If so, schedule a time to meet with the people in charge of the program, not after the Spring semester before the year when your child gets into middle school. Explain to the IEP people what makes a suitable teacher for your child; this will help make sure your child gets good placement.

, These could include back-to-school nights, where your teachers talk about what your child does every day in his or her classes. Ask your child's teachers any questions if you have them. Set up a parent-teacher conference if you want to talk about your child's progress with your teacher.

, Try ""imitating"" the school's schedule; set a time frame from each subject, as well as break and study times. Pretend that you are the teacher and work with your child on advanced skills.

, Assign your child homework and give him or her a time frame for each subject, as completing homework on time can be more challenging in secondary school. Work on time management skills as well, as they can be especially important.

, This can be considered support, as homework completed in isolation can make a child feel as if he or she is being punished. Encourage your child to complete his or her homework by him/herself, but help him or her if needed.

Be sure to stay on top of your courses.,
Stay on your teacher's ""good side."",

Don't worry too much about being one of the ""popular"" kids.,
Don't get sucked into drama.,
Do some fun things outside of school.,
Go to school sponsored activities.,
Don't get caught up in having a ""boyfriend."",
Relax.,

Don't change who you really are.,
Look at many resources to help you through middle school.",How to Have a Great Time in Middle School," Do your homework, study for tests, etc. The last thing you want to do is fail a class. It can make middle school ten times more stressful.;
, It may seem like a good idea to impress your friends by acting up in front of the teacher, but it won't be all fun and games for long. Things will become a lot harder for you if you act out in class. It's not ""cool.""

, Electives will bring new friends, new interests and new ideas. But don't choose an elective just because your friends are doing it. Do something that you enjoy! In the beginning, it may seem like a great idea to choose ""Typing"" as a class. But think about the homework load, the tests, and other things that might prevent you from enjoying more free time. Classes such as PE, choir, or art are super fun, with a smaller homework load.


Take fun electives such as: Chorus, journalism, art, Spanish, and peer counseling, just to name a few. Usually the sixth graders only get a few elective choices, but in seventh and eighth grades, many more become available.
Other electives in seventh and eighth may be a teacher's aide. It can be fun, boring at times, but extremely easy. Tutor kids, organize papers, and run errands for the teacher.

, Even if you are of a mind to be antisocial, middle school is much more fun when you have some friends by your side. Find something in common with someone, and go from there. You never know where it may take you in the future!

, First impressions are important. You may not like everyone you meet, but try to get along with them.

, Being you is all that is important. Trying to be popular is not going to help you make friends. It might even make some people not like you!

, If you hear a rumor making it's way around, don't be the one to spread it. Most likely it's not true, and it can end up coming back at you. Become friends with people who won't backstab you, or anyone else. Don't socialize with mean, rude, or immature kids. They could ruin you entire middle school ""reputation"" and they've got a lot of growing up to do, so you probably don't want to be their experiment or their nursemaid.

, School can get really stressful. So, go take a break at the local pool, or at the mall. This is a great way to relax, and make memories that will last forever.


Join clubs and sports. It's a great way to meet new people, and they're kind of like additional electives without the grades and homework. Student council can be extremely fun. Look for clubs such as a book club, an animal club, a Bible club, an anti-drug club, and a math club.

, Choose things such as the dance. It's a great way to meet new people from your school and have fun at the same time!

, You don't need it. Going through a breakup will make your world fall apart, so why bother with the time and emotions? It won't make you any cooler, whether or not you have had your first kiss. Just enjoy your middle school years before things get really complex.

, Middle school is only one part of your life. It's okay if you get embarrassed, it's not the end of the world. If you get a bad grade, don't stress about it. Middle school is a place to get through your awkward stage, and it won't all matter when you are an adult. Make good choices, and keep yourself in order.

, If you are having troubles in your classes, get help. Maybe you shouldn't go to that movie tonight, it would be wiser of you to study for that really big test. It's okay if you miss out on one event. Getting good grades comes before going out.

, Be yourself! It's the best way to make friends. Don't change your attitude to fit in with the ""popular crowd."" Remember that none of this stereotyping is going to matter once you become an adult.


Don't be stereotypical. Judging someone because of how they look or who they are friends with is not right or nice. Preps, jocks and nerds are just names for people who are social, enjoy sports and are smart. Judging people like that will make you some enemies, so it is best to judge someone on who they are.

, Wikihow is a great place to get information from real people. YouTube can also help you get through middle school. Plus, your actual school can be a great resource to help you learn about having an Amazing time in middle school.

Go school shopping.,
Don’t bring all of your supplies at once - walking into the school on the first day with a crippling backpack is not a good idea.,
The night before the first day, set out the clothes you are planning to wear.,
Get your needed amount of sleep.,
On the morning of the first day, get up early enough to have time to spare.,
Smile, and enjoy your first day of eighth grade!",How to Get Ready for Your First Day of Eighth Grade," If you were provided with a supply list, follow the guidelines on that list. If you were not, there are a few things you will almost definitely need: A pack of pencils, a pack of pens, two or three spiral notebooks, one or two composition books, and a one-inch binder. These supplies are all that you will need the first week or two - anything else can be picked up at a later date.;
, The first few days will most likely not be instructional, as they are usually spent reading the code of conduct. All you will need is a binder for any handouts, and a pen or pencil. Bring in the rest of your supplies when you receive a locker, and store them in that.

, Be sure that they coordinate and will not distract you or make you uncomfortable - you should be confident and comfortable so you can make the best impression possible. Also, have your schedule memorized - clogging up the hallway while you stare bewilderingly at your schedule will only cause disaster. Make sure to bring your schedule, anyway, just in case you forget the exact room number of a class. Also, be sure that you are not breaking your school's dress code.

, This varies from person to person. Be absolutely sure to get at least eight hours of sleep, at a minimum. 9-10 hours will give you a well-rested feeling without having to go to sleep at a crazy hour. A good idea would be to try to fall asleep between nine and ten, and wake up at about six. This may need to be adjusted, depending on your school’s start time and your morning routine.

, Be sure to eat a healthy, filling breakfast. Take a shower, get dressed and brush your teeth well. Style your hair the way you like it. Do everything you need to feel prepared and confident for the day ahead.

, You will create a wonderful start to the last year of middle school.

Choose your topic.,
Before you start working on your speech, Ask yourself, ""What points -- one or two -- do I want to make in this presentation?"",
Use your own books, online libraries and encyclopedias, and search engines.,
Write your speech down and then practice it in front of your family or a friend.,
Make a little cheat card on a 3x5 card that you can hold in your hand or put in front of you on the podium if there is one.,
Tell the audience your name, unless the teacher has announced you, then you can say ""Good morning,"" or ""Good afternoon,"" whichever it is.

,
Tell your audience what your topic is going to be.,
Summarize the points you've already made, this time in just a sentence or two.,
Say thank you to the audience and sit down.

",How to Give a Presentation in Front of Your Seventh Grade Class," Remember that each of us has something -- a hobby, a skill, a family history, etc. that will interest others. Whether you choose your own speech or are assigned a topic, the steps are the same. Tell the audience what your topic is, make your speech, and summarize your speech.;
, Then research your topic. Be sure your facts are accurate, and always try to avoid plagiarizing.

, Don't worry if you get too much information, you can discard what you don't need or want to use. Having more information is better than not having enough information.

, Ask them to help you time how long it takes for you to make your speech if you have time limitations. Your teacher can help you with how long the speech is expected to be.

, On this card, write down the key points so that you can go back to them if you forget anything while you are speaking. Do not read an entire speech from what you wrote. Speaking extemporaneously with only the little cheat card for help adds credibility and sincerity to your presentation.

,, Then tell them all the interesting things you've learned and they may not know. Make eye contact with the audience.

, For instance, if your speech is about catfish farms, you might end by repeating how many there are in the United States and why catfish farming is important.

"
Know what your goal is.,
Plan ahead.,
Stay in contact.,
Be up-to-date.,
Be socially active.,
If you aren't very popular yet in your class, you could start by sitting next to a different person in class/ lunch, and starting out a small chat with the person next to you.,
If you want to be popular, getting a boyfriend or girlfriend usually helps.,
Have a good reputation.,
Go with the flow.,
Be confident.,
Don't smell of BO (body odour).,
Look good.,
Attract the better of you.",How to Get Noticed by Your Class in Middle School," Is your goal to get a guy's attention in class or do you want to get into a certain clique?;
, Write down some questions on a piece of paper or ask if you don't know what to say.

, Follow everyone's AIM or Facebook pages to keep in touch with your class. Every once in a while write them a friendly ""hi"" or comment on their pictures on Facebook. Don't write too much and don't comment on every photo. If someone comments on yours, just say thanks and when someone says something funny just type 'lol' (laugh out loud).

, Download new music every once in a while, go shopping to get the latest fashionable items and so on.

, Meet with people often and throw get-togethers every once in a while on weekends. Try to meet a different person every time to make things interesting and expand your group of friends. Also it's good to choose different activities to do each time: Go to the pool/beach, local hangouts (ice cream shops, cafes..) go to the movies, go ice skating etc.

, Practice small talk with people and you'll get the hang of it. Don't ask random questions and stick to the things around you.

, It's not nice to use someone but it's middle school (and it's not exactly using). Be nice and flirt when you are around them. Don't be desperate but don't play hard to get them. Middle schoolers can't afford it yet.

, First impressions are super important because if you mess something up on the first impression, that will be your reputation for a while. Be clean, don't be mean to anyone, and be positive.

, If your friends are talking about shoes, just talk about it too. Don't stick around if you've got nothing to say, though. But don't say "" Hey, my dad took my boarding last weekend"" if they talking about something which is not related to that. If they are laughing, laugh along but do put your opinion into the conversation.

, Don't let them know you were reading about how to be popular on wikiHow just to get the courage to come up to them. Make them think you aren't intimidated by them and talking to them is as casual as taking a shower or brushing your teeth at night.

, It may cause a stain on your reputation and isn't good if you want a boy/girlfriend. Keep a deodorant and pads in your bag, extra pair of clothes and take showers daily.

, Take care of your body, drink lots of water, and exercise daily. That is a lifetime tip though, not just a popularity tip. Wear clean clothes, brush your hair and style it everyday, and get a manicure every so often.

, Everyone has the one thing that makes them feel pretty, if it's their eyes, or their hair, or even if you like your fingers, make sure they can be seen! Put a cool hairband in your hair, paint your fingernails a cool (but not too extraordinary) color and such.

"
"
Prepare yourself.,
Shop for school at least a week before your start day of classes.,
The night before that first day of school, get together everything you will need for the next day.,
On the first day, get up as soon as your alarm goes off, that way if you need extra time, you have it.,
Have a binder with dividers for each subject helps you stay organized throughout the school year.,
As soon as you get home from school, have a snack (if needed) and start on your homework right away.,
Approximately three months before your graduation set a budget with your parents that includes the cost of your hair, nails and toes, jewelry, and dress.

,Make sure you've purchased a dress that fits and book any appointments for your hair and nails a couple months in advance.,
Make sure that you also have a pair of shoes that match your dress and that you can easily walk in them.

,
On the morning of graduation, sleep in to whenever you want (just make sure you don't miss any appointments you may have that day!)",How to Do Well in Eighth Grade," A week or so before school starts, begin going to bed approximately an hour earlier than you did in the summer. This will ensure that you are adequately rested for school, and by the time school rolls around, you will be used to the new sleeping schedule.

If you have trouble falling asleep, or are extremely nervous, go to bed half an hour early and read until your time is up. That way, you are already relaxed when it's time to actually sleep. Other ideas - you could listen to music, or drink a cup of warm milk.;
, Before you can start school you need a few supplies. Your school may or may not have provided you with a list, and if they have, use that as a guide for your back-to-school shopping. If they haven't, find a list on the Internet and use that. You may also want a few new wardrobe items for school. Usually a cute shirt, jeans, and a nice pair of flats will do.

, Get everything in your backpack that you may need, and even pack your lunch. If you carry a purse or another bag, get that together also. Make sure you have your outfit picked out. Go to bed at a reasonable time, and set an alarm for the morning. It's really important that you are well rested.

, First thing when you get up is to eat your breakfast, that way if you spill any of it on you, it won't be on your outfit.

Go upstairs and wash your face and brush your teeth. Then get dressed, and style your hair. Be sure that you look decent; if you are wearing a t-shirt make sure your armpits are shaved and that you smell good. Definitely put on deodorant and maybe a small amount of perfume. Slip on your shoes and head out the door.
Make sure that you look confident. Keep your back straight and your shoulders pressed back with your head held high, and don't forget to smile!







, Each subject has it's place and if you need to bring anything home you have all of it with you so you don't forget anything. Having a notebook with all the assignments written in it is also quite helpful. Try doing both of these things.

If you've had a bad day, talk to someone you trust or maybe just relax and listen to music you like. Music is the best way to calm down. Make sure you pay attention in class, and stay focused each day so you can strive to get straight A's.
Remember, at graduation there will be awards, and you want to win them. To help achieve and/or win these awards; it often helps to join extra curricular activities! As long as you're involved in something, you have a better chance at winning an award. It can also help with your popularity.
If you find you have a crush on a class-mate, then just take a deep breath. For guys, just treat her nicely and never tease her! For girls, just talk normally to him and be yourself! Be sure to study for tests.
Take notes in class that you can review at a later date if needed.







, This leaves you plenty of time to do what you want afterwards.


Getting close to graduation doesn't mean you can start paying less attention to your school work. You have to study just as hard and think about graduation in your spare time.







,,,, When you do wake up, eat a healthy breakfast, and dress in some comfortable clothes. Then attend all of your appointments.

Be very careful not to mess them up. Then head on home and put on your dress, shoes, and jewelry. If you want to, add a touch of makeup.
When completely ready go to graduation and have the best time!

,


Start with making a simple list or plan. Write all of your ideas and all of the others ideas. Often, when the plan is done, it tends to be a little too much of all your ideas. When you work together to find the best ideas, let loose of the ones that aren't as impacting or important. Don't try to be sneaky and have the outcome end up being all of your ideas. The other people will notice and get annoyed and might even say something. Make sure the outcome consists your ideas and the other peoples ideas.


Plan times when everyone involved is free and you can get together and work on the project. Don't get mad at them because of an accidental mistake. Academics always come first if you want to get good grades. Try to get as much done as possible at your meetings so the project/paper will be done fast. Usually people get into fights about what to contribute to the assignment. This shouldn't happen in your case, because of the plan.


Make sure you listen to what other people have to say. This will help your overall report card grade because you would have worked well together and gotten the project/paper done on time.


When you get everyone to make the plan, make sure everyone else knows and agrees that the outcome is the final decision and there is no switching around. This will really avoid fights.


, If they complain that you're being too bossy, apologize and try to be less bossy.
, Now you should have great grades which lead to happy parents.
, Nobody is going to like you or appreciate you for the true gem you can be unless you're nice, kind, sweet, and caring!
, Don't copy other peoples ideas, make your own personal creative ones that really show your personality. If you have to; ask people before you use their ideas.
, Don't compliment the same people day after day. It might get really annoying for that person; not to mention, the other people will start getting jealous.
,, Everyone is at least worth a chance to be your friend! When you do this you'll eventually figure who know who is a backstabber, who is nice, who is a good friend, and who is smart.
, They will realize you guided them in to the right place and can be really thankful and really want to be your friend! Plus, they'll always think of you as ""the true friend that has been nice to me from the start"".
, This step may even give you a good friend from just a simple act of kindness.
,

If you know who the popular people are, talk with them.
Don't be afraid to make friends of the opposite gender.
Don't be afraid to get involved with those people outside of school.
Be nice to the younger kids.
Respect the older kids.

, Dating and perhaps kissing is fine. Don't go too far though. Remember having a boyfriend is not a big deal and is not worth your time to be obsessed and worried over. Be happy with your friends and yourself.

,,, If you use the right brand for you, antiperspirant will not only make your sweat smell less; it will also make your armpits stay dry.

, This will really screw them up and make the hair just grow darker and faster. You can wax your arms, but no shaving your arms.
, Any brand is fine, as long as it is good quality and works.
, While the conditioner is in your hair, comb out the knots in your hair with a nice wide tooth comb. This way once your hair dries, it will feel nice and smooth.
,, Dead skin is gross and unattractive.
,,, It's unattractive and will make your shirt look like an Appaloosa with all of it's wet spots.

, Nobody will like being around you if your breath stinks and you have tons of food globs in between your teeth!

,, The key is to not overdo it. Nothing looks worse than too much makeup. Also, do what works best for you and what you feel most comfortable in. For most middle school girls, a cute simple look would be mascara, eyeliner, blush, & pink or clear lipgloss. The mascara color depends on your eyelash color.

, If they're brown or any other color, use brown.

, Black can look totally natural on some people, but really fake on others. Test out both and decide which is most natural. A thin line on the bottom lid, top lid, or maybe both is all that is needed to avoid the ""raccoon"" look.

, If you have more faded colored lips, then pink lip gloss is better, or even a little lip stain before the lip gloss for even more color.

, (This depends whether your skin is light or dark. Use powder for light skin, bronzer for more tanned or dark skin.)

,, Experiment with the way you look and see what fits you!

,, There are some people who only wear jeans and Uggs/Converse/All Stars, everyday, but they won't really look sophisticated. Yes, I suppose it is ""trendy"" but it's also a really boring look!

, This is important, because if you buy one that's too loose, it'll gape when you're bending over, and if you buy one too tight, it will be very uncomfortable.

, This isn't necessarily important unless you like to wear form-fitting pants or skirts.

,,,



If you get Fuggs try them on and compare them to real Ugg boots. They need to be good quality knock-offs because how embarrassing would it be if your Fuggs just fell apart when you're out. People will remember you as the cheap girl who wears cheap Fuggs if that happens!

, If you can get more than one pair, high-tops, low-tops, and different colors are all great! Only buy real Converse or All Stars, if you can't afford them (they are only like $20-$40, it depends where you find them) then don't buy them. Do not get the fake converse sold at Payless/Justice et cetera. They are terrible quality.

,,, If you have curls, let 'em show girl! Hot waves? Hit the beach babe! Straight haired Hun? Throw it out of that bun!

, You're natural color is usually what looks best on you.

, A good trim every month or so for healthy ends works. Maybe an occasional cut for when you want a change.

,, Do whatever your heart desires!

For girls, a pair of nice and well-fitting jeans along with a cute top would look great! Make sure your sandals and accessories match, too! For boys, some jeans that fit, sneakers, and nice tee-shirt or polo shirt should do the trick.


If your school requires uniforms, make sure that you are in full uniform on your first day.Then you may do your hair fashionably and different to make you stand out.If your school doesn't require uniforms, make sure you follow the dress code carefully on the first day of school.





;
, If you are new, walk up to a group of kids that look friendly and smile. Say, ""hi, I'm new here. My name is (insert name."") Then, wait for them to respond. They likely will state their names and say hello as well.

,, Put in any binders and supplies you brought with you inside. It's a good idea to bring a locker shelf, too. Save the decorations and locker accessories for later.

, You'll be glad for it later. Even though school hasn't officially started, teachers will take this time to start giving your workbook, textbooks, and multiple folders to keep up with.

, Whatever you do, try to not be late for class. It makes a bad, first impression.

, Try choosing a seat in the front or close to it. This gives your teacher an impression saying that you are ready to learn. If you're going to doze off, sit at the back. If you want to make a really good impression on your teacher, ask him/her how their summer was, then sit down after that. Make sure you have some necessary supplies with you.

, Ask people questions and sound interested in what they are saying.

,, Sit up straight and don't fool with your hands. Look like you know what you're doing and walk with stride. Hold your head high, but not TOO high. If you're a girl, cross your legs or don't spread them apart. Guys, don't slouch too much. It comes across as uninterested.

, Ask him/her questions and smile. Tell them that they look great, and that it's good to see them!

,, Socialize with friends until your ride gets there and head on home. You have now survived the first day of junior high!

Help others.",How to Fit in When You're in Middle School," If you are late, it will go on your attendance record. If you are late/absent often, you might have to attend summer school, or be held back if it is severe. This will also lessen your chances to get friends, because they might not want to involve with who seems to be bad influence.;
, Try to keep your supplies, binders, and even your locker well-kept and up to date. This will make it easier to find the things you will need for the day and will reduce the time you spend trying to figure out what you need to bring home. Also, it makes you get to your classes faster, and your friends won't need to wait for you.

, You want everything to be as easy as possible, so have your own schedule on how you operate.

, Tests/exams/quizzes will make up a huge part of your grade, and it's important that you get good grades. You will feel good about yourself, you will be seen as a smart, good person to hang with, and your parents will be very pleased, and might reward you. Also, in the future, you will have to spend a lot of time studying, so it's a good idea to train and get used to it right away.

, Don't be afraid to ask your teacher for help. They don't want you to fail in school. If you don't want to ask in front of your class, ask privately after class.

, You don't absolutely need to fit in. While it might be fun, it could make you more stressed trying to constantly conform to expected standards. By accepting that what you have to offer as being as worthy as what others do, you can feel less needy about having to fit in. By all means be open to learning how you can improve things about yourself that make you feel better and more capable but don't feel that you have to become something you're uncomfortable with.

, Gravitate to the people who have similar interests and hobbies. This will make your school time much easier.


Seek out friendships with people who do not expect you to change the essence of who you are.
If your friends accept you, they will try to understand you without asking more of you. However, they will also be supportive of you as you go through the changes so typical of your age group. After all, you don't want to be stuck back in time when you're ready to move onto the next phase of life. In turn, be supportive of their personal growth too.
If you end up hanging out with kids who have a bad influence over you, check yourself. Do not participate in bad behavior or activities and seek to extract yourself from such situations. Find friends who are not going to bring you down.

, Most schools offer after-school clubs and activities to join. These are useful ways to meet new people, and find others who enjoy the same things you do, and it will make you enjoy school more. This also is a chance to improve your knowledge and skills in a certain area, which is always good.

, If you help someone else you might get a new friend or they might help you back in return.

The ideal character for your ""BFF-to-be"" is fun, bubbly and really friendly to you, but she can be mean to others. This makes you sort of unapproachable and cool.;
, Wear clothes that the ""popular"" kids wear, like Hollister and Forever 21. But make sure you have your own style; Queen Bees stand out, not fit in. Follow the clothing guide below for starters:

Casual: Baggy tee + Skinny jeans/ leggings/ jeggings + flats
Boho: Baggy blouse with thick belt + boyfriend jeans + stretchy Toms/ flats + bangles
Edgy: Graphic tank top + distressed jean shorts + studded Converse
Girly: Logo tank top + high waisted shorts + wedges + cute earrings

, Make sure there are only friends that will support you and no backstabbers. The ideal number is around four to five people, or a larger group depending on your choice. They should be pretty and somehow outstanding in any ways. If they all want to be queen bee you have a disadvantage since they might replace you. Make sure they are loyal., Make yourself smart (you don't have to be a straight A student, just make sure you're not flunking any classes), pretty (kill your zits! Do makeup if that's alright for your school, you need your beauty), presentable (you have to be confident or else people will bring you down easily) and mean (you don't want to be Miss Goody do you?) to some people. This may cause you a lot of effort and consume a lot of time but it's worth it.

, This means ""perfect in other people's eyes"" not ""Flawlessly perfect"". Just show others you can beat them in many ways and you're actually the best among all. But this one is hard to achieve since everybody has weaknesses - you just need to brush up what's already good and improve the things you're not that good at., Join as many as possible - it gives you time to socialize and show off. Just remember don't look like you're desperate, do it like you're really happy to. This list will help sort you into activities that would suit you (refer to related articles for details):

Sporty/ active = sports club/ cheerleader/ Pep club
Movie buff = Drama club
Geek = School Newspaper/ Yearbook Committee
Musician = Band/ Choir

, Wear clothes that are appropriate and clean and follow your school dress code. Put on makeup (don't overdo it!) and style your hair nicely. You can find a lot of articles here about braids and other styles. Look as if you tried but don't look desperate., Do simple workouts, jog around your neighborhood, do whatever works for you. There are tons of articles here about how to shape up.





, Only post things that do good and never humiliate yourself online, more people will see it than you think. On Instagram, post high quality photos and edit them to make them look perfect, there are lots of apps for that. On Facebook, post things that make your life seem awesome, and attach photos to make them realistic. Never post fake statuses on Facebook though, someone will bust you.

, Make sure you are not that mean they'll tell you off, though. Important: being mean doesn't mean bullying. It just means you perfect sarcasm and stand up for yourself. Never be a bully, people hate them. Refer to related articles on how to be mean without bullying. It makes you more unapproachable and seem more Queen Bee-ish.

Buy a good book bag or tote.,
Purchase supplies.,
Make sure everything has a place and stays in it!,
Try setting up a schedule in the morning that will help you with staying organized.,
Always have backup supplies!,
At home, set up a drawer or area in your room for extra school supplies.,
Only buy the types of supplies you need.,
Label everything, and label it correctly, so you know where everything is.,
If you like to draw or make up stories in your free time or while waiting for the bus, keep an ""extra folder"" for all your papers.

,
If you have teachers that often give you big assignments, keep a spot in your notebook for keeping up with all the info and supplies for that project so it won't be mixed in with daily work.

,
Keep hole punch that goes in your binder so any papers your teacher hands you, you can put them in your binder (if you keep a binder).

,
Do not shove all papers into your backpack; this will make a mess and you will not be able to find anything you need!,
Make sure to pay attention.,
If your school has lockers, consider buying a locker organizer.",How to Be Organized in Middle School," Don't get book bags that fall apart easily. Get a book bag that has enough zippers and compartments so that everything has a place, but not so many compartments that you're constantly looking for things. It's better to get a backpack if you will be carrying a lot of heavy books or binders, because the sling bags can ruin your shoulders. Recommendations for carry weight is 10% of your total weight.If your school allows it, it's a good idea to have a medium sized book bag or tote to carry around class to class also, though some schools don't allow any bags, many will say no backpacks but totes or book bags are fine. This really helps as you will not have to carry around a huge load of books, as most will fit in your bag.;
, A key to having everything organized in middle school is having all the supplies you need, nice and clean and organized. Some schools give you out the supplies you'll need, but you can generally buy supplies cheap at stationary stores, especially at the Back-To-School times. Here are some purchases you should make:


Check each teacher's supply list to make sure you have everything you need. Have your parents or guardians get everything on the lists so you're not the last student to have supplies. At the very least, you should have notebook paper, pencils, and folders for each class. Remember, you will be changing classes and taking your things with you to your next class so there is no need to purchase multiple packs of things like colored pencils or highlighters.






Buy, make, or reuse a pencil case. In the pencil case put things in like pencils, pens, erasers, sticky notes, etc.






Keep your planner with you. With your planner, your whole homework schedule and after school activities can be organized. Write things in it like homework, events, meetings, etc.







, Math papers don't belong in your English notebook or your pocket. Be consistent. Keep papers in their corresponding notebook at all times. It will make things so much easier. You won't have to be worried on the way home about which binder something is in (and you forgot one of your binders). Many schools or teachers will require you to have a binder for their class and even schedule ""notebook checks"" where they make sure that you have all your papers in the right places in your binder.

, A sample schedule might be: Wake up and shower at 6:00, get dressed at 6:20, eat breakfast at 6:45, do your hair and makeup at 7:00, and leave at 7:15. It also helps to pack everything you can the night before, like putting all your homework and books in your bag, so all you have to add is your lunch. With the schedule, make sure you allow extra time in case something goes wrong (ex: you wake up late and don't have time to do something).When you have LOADS of homework: Take a sheet of paper write down all the subjects you have, then write the time you think you will need for each subject. Then try to put that time for homework in your weekly schedule.

, You want to have backup supplies just in case you lose any of it, or you forget it somewhere. Make sure to have a couple of extra packs of paper and pens/pencils in your locker.

, This really helps as you know where everything you're not using is. It is also a good idea if you plan to buy bulk packs of things, which is very cheap, but can be hard to keep track of. If you have a ""School Supply Drawer"", you will always have a place to put extras, and know where those things are when you eventually need them.

, If you are in 8th grade, you probably won't need to buy lots of glue sticks and crayons, while a 5th grader won't need a graphing calculator. If you only buy what's on your supply list, and anything else you KNOW that you will use, you'll have a lot less junk to keep track of.

, Labeling your notebooks and folders makes them easier to find. If you can make the folder and notebook for a class the same color, that helps too.

,,,, All of your papers will also get crumpled and ripped, and you don't want to hand them in like that!

, If you do not pay attention and one of your teachers calls on you, how will you know the right answer? You could use your study guide if you have one and know where it is.

, Otherwise, do your best to divide it into several sections. Example: One for textbooks, one for notebooks, one for binder, and another for a backpack.


Keep a magnetic pencil holder and a whiteboard on your locker door. The magnetic pencil holder is for spare pens, pencils, highlighters, erasers, and supplies. The whiteboard is where you will write your assignments, classes, and memos on.

, You don't see your name on the list. It's one of the worst feelings ever. Before you have a breakdown, take some deep breaths.

, Going to the bathroom is the most common place. Let it all out. Sometimes, doing this can make you feel a whole lot better. After you're done, leave the bathroom looking okay.

, Most sports teams in Middle School (excluding wrestling, cross country, track, and swimming) only take 14-25 athletes. Most teams in an average size school will have at least 30-70 athletes trying out for sports like basketball, volleyball, softball and soccer. So remember, you're not the only one who got cut.

, Of course you're upset. You may be angry, sad, disappointed or just plain confused. All of these feelings are normal, and gradually these feelings will fade away.

, It isn't varsity. You're not going to college for free because you got on the seventh grade basketball team!

, Do you like a certain club like drama or languages? Or maybe you'll play a new sport! Find an activity that's entertaining and offers more opportunity for you to participate and grow (who wants to make the team but be stuck on the bench during games, anyway?).

, If you got cut from volleyball, but want to make basketball or softball, practice that! Maybe you'll be better prepared for that sport next season.

, If you don't make it this year, try again next year! Who know? Maybe you'll make it!

PE class is usually a great opportunity to try new sports. You can also sign up for recreational leagues at local community centers, youth gyms, or parks.


If you don’t have access to these organizations, you can also find other kids in the neighborhood who like to play most sports, such as basketball, soccer, baseball, or roller hockey. Don’t be shy to ask if you can play. Almost every sport is better with more players!;
, Start saving money, or ask your parents if they will help you get the right equipment for your sport. You can try bargaining with your parents. If you receive an allowance, suggest giving it up for a year in return for football equipment. Or offer a deal: “If you buy me soccer cleats I will do twice the chores I already do for two months.”


Instead of buying new equipment, you can look into renting, or you can ask your school if you can borrow their equipment.
Do a little research about what you'll need. If you want to play soccer, you’ll need shin guards. If you want to play roller hockey, you’ll need roller blades. If you want to play football, be sure to get the right protective equipment.

, You’ll want to practice your sport as much as you can. No one gets good overnight. Set aside time a few days a week to play your sport with others, and if you can’t find anyone to play with, you can always practice alone.


If you don’t have anyone to play with, there are a lot of sports you can play alone. For basketball, you can practice dribbling and shooting. For soccer, you can practice dribbling between cones, kicking the ball against a wall, or juggling.For hockey, you can practice skating with a hockey stick and a tennis ball. Even if it’s just you, it’s fun to pretend like you’re in a real game scenario, so use your imagination!

, Stay active when you aren’t practicing your sport, even if this means running around the block a few times. Not only will it help you play your sport, but the coach will see you are in shape and are serious about the sport.

, It’s important to eat well if you’re trying to get into shape. Cut back on the potato chips and load your plate with fresh fruit and vegetables. Cut out empty calories like cookies and replace them with nutrient-rich snacks like carrots or orange slices.Drink lots and lots of water. Water is like fuel for your body when you’re active. If you don’t have enough, you’ll feel tired and weak., Watch games that your high school team has to see how they play. The more games you watch, the more you will know about the game. Feel free to talk to the players and ask them how they learned the sport. They will love to brag about themselves to you, and you might just learn some tricks along the way.

, Be sure to get enough sleep the night before so that you have the energy to perform your best. If you have homework that needs to be done, try to catch up so that you aren’t worrying about it while you’re trying to get ready for tryouts.

, You’ll want to eat a lean meal rich in carbohydrates so that you’ll have the energy to stay active. You’ll also want to drink plenty of water throughout the day. Think of it like you’re storing up water to be all used when you’re running around.


Don’t eat right before your tryouts. Eat a couple of hours before you need to tryout, so that you have time to digest your food. Avoid dairy products like milk or any fatty or fried foods before you are active., Make sure you don’t get there late, or the coach will think you don’t really care about the team. If you get there early enough you can also have a chance to meet the coach, which will make them more likely to remember you and like you.

, It’s important to make a good first impression, and the best way to do this is to introduce yourself so they know who you are: “Hi, I’m Elizabeth. Nice to meet you. I play forward. I’m excited to be on the team!”


Not only will the coach decide who gets on the team, but once you’re on the team it will be important to maintain a good relationship with them.

, Wear the right clothing so that you can perform well and also so that you don’t stick out. If the coach asked you to bring a white shirt and you wear a red one, you’ll look out of place!

, Remember, tryouts will be a workout. You’ll need a lot of water to stay hydrated. Bring a big water bottle.

, If your sport is a team sport, be sure to do what’s best for the team, not yourself. Sometimes this means passing the ball instead of keeping it, or shooting. While you want to show your skills, being a ball-hog will only show the coach that you aren’t good at being on a team!

, If you accidentally knock someone down, help them back up. Remember, they will hopefully be on your team in the near future. And even if you both don’t make the team, you might be able to make some friends who share an interest with you.

, Remember, sports are just games, and games are supposed to be fun. The more fun you have at a sport, the better you will perform, and the better impression you will give the coach. If you make a mistake, that’s OK -- just keep playing!

, After you try out, you just have to wait and hope that you make the team. If you make it, great! Celebrate! If you don’t make the team, don’t worry -- you aren’t the only one. Sometimes tryouts can be really competitive, and what matters is that you tried, even if if it didn’t work out.


Keep in mind that everyone has different skill levels. The sport you picked might not be the best fit for you, or it might not be the best fit for you at the time. You can always try again next year, or in high school.

, Just because you didn’t make the school team doesn’t mean you can’t keep playing the sport. Find a community league or a group of friends who like playing, and you can keep having fun without the pressure of being on a more competitive team.

Do you know what its like to be made fun of?",How to Be Yourself in Middle School (for Girls)," You can't possibly be you, if you have no idea who you are! If you love soccer, tennis, and volleyball you are a person who loves sports. If you love makeup, clothes, and anything girly you might be a girly - girl. Whoever you are, you need to realize that now. Perhaps you want to write down some hobbies that you have, or what you like most, to help you determine this.;
, Imagine this: A puppy is in a horrible home, with a horrible owner. The owner beats it and he doesn't properly feed/water the pup. Most dogs with this life become aggressive. Same with humans. If you grow up hanging out with aggressive people, you'll probably become aggressive. Or if you hang with people who bring you down, you might start to believe it. The pup might not have had a choice, but here the great thing about being a human - you can choose! If you have any friends right now who is/has brought you down, tell them that you'd like to take a break from the friendship for a little while until they start to appreciate you as a human, and a friend.

, Almost everyone tries to go by the brain... but sometimes you shouldn't. When people say ""listen to your heart"" they mean your feelings, your thoughts. Of course, sometimes using your brain is the right thing to do, like when someone offers drugs. But listening to your heart is also important, and its an important skill. Imagine if no one listened to their inner thoughts and feelings! This world would be unstable.

, Be honest. When was the last time you felt embarrassed, pressured, or scared around someone else? Listen, you're not alone. You probably answered 5 hours ago, or last week. Even the president feels this way sometimes! Everyone feels this way. There's no reason why you shouldn't be yourself just because of others. They probably feel just as scared as you do - but if you stand up for what you believe in when they didn't, you'll be a hero to others and might even be looked up to for people who want to be as confident as you.

, What do you see? Put all looks aside. I mean really. Look beneath the skin, the eyes, the hair. Do you see a fun-loving, confident girl who isn't afraid to be herself? Or do you see a scared, helpless girl who is frightened at the thought of others making fun of you for being ... you? The look in your eyes says it all. If you take an online eye quiz, you'll see. People can tell when you're not confident, and people who aren't confident they want to make fun of them more. You might think its the other way around, but it isn't. People who aren't confident are putting targets on their heads.

, What are you unhappy about? Is it your obesity, tangled hair or the glass is half empty attitude? Fix it. Wear baggy clothes for now to hide the obesity, and go out for a jog every now and then. Brush your hair, or ask an adult or older sister to show you how. Be more optimistic about yourself, and others. Now that you've fixed things you don't like about yourself, look at what you DO like. If it your blue eyes, your tan skin tone or your happy attitude? Show those. Put a little eyeliner to make your eyes shine and pop out. Continue being happy and encourage others. You'll start to feel more confident when you think this way. Confidence will help you love yourself.

, Probably. Remember what it felt like? Would you want to put that pain on someone else? No! Don't bully others!

, Walk with your head held high and even put a little spring in your step. Act as if you know where you're going and as if you need to get there quickly. Not only will this make you look more mature, it'll make you less vulnerable to bullies.

, If you want to get along with people, nothing succeeds more than being happy and polite all the time. No one wants to be around someone who complains, is grumpy or depressed or puts down on other people.

, Consider wearing clothes that make you seem more mature and ""professional"". Avoid the suit and tie, but stay away from the cartoon t-shirts, find a happy medium that fits you. There are lots of fashion blogs you can look at to get an idea of what's fashionable.

, There's a fine line between laughing hard at something and laughing inappropriately, it will make you look like you're five. Bite your tongue if you have to. Once you stop, fiddle with your backpack strap or locker to keep from laughing again. If you have trouble finding the fine line of laughter, take the safe approach and not laugh at all. You can always play the situation as being ""too mature"" for the humor or not understanding it. Also, don't forget that just a simple smile will do as well to acknowledge a joke, it's also much less obnoxious in class.

, This will make you more mature, and help you prepare for high school and college.


Study groups are also great for meeting people, but don't make the primary purpose socializing.

, Don't do stupid things to get attention, because it's really annoying. For example, don't act crazy and jump around in the mall and wear ""over-done"" clothes so that people look at you; it is not pleasing to look at. Act like you have dignity and common sense.

, It's never okay to be someone totally different at school than at home.


For example, if you wouldn't cuss at home, don't cuss at school. (Besides, swearing is banned in most schools.)

, A messy binder can make you seem immature.

, Go through all those old clothes you loved in 3rd grade, and only keep the ones you will actually wear. Go through your dressers, cabinets, and drawers. Throw out or give away as much as you can. Repaint your room a more sophisticated color like white, gray, or beige. Buy some new, bigger, and better furniture. This room will now be fully updated! You will definitely feel much more mature and like a better you.

, This may sound boring or ridiculous, but mixing in a few complex words like ""oblivious"" or ""incredulous"" to your vocabulary will make you seem older. Also, avoid using filler words such as ""um"" or ""like."" Instead of saying a subject is ""like"" another, say ""it's similar to."" When your friends don't understand your vocabulary, you'll feel like the most mature one in the room.

Get a good haircut that flatters you.,
Always wash your hair.,
Try to change your hairstyle.",How to Be Hot in Middle School1," Ask a hairdresser what your face shape is, then look below for some reference on what styles might look good on you.


Round face: The best hairstyle for round faces definitely has to be long length, long layers, and a long fringe, hair parted down the side. If you have the length already, get to the hair dressers and add some face shaping, wispy layers - you will be surprised at how much difference this can make to your style.
Oval face: There isn't ""one"" best hairstyle for oval shaped faces - there are many! Lucky for you, you suit almost any hairstyle, as long as it doesn't hide your features, and is styled correctly. If your hair is short at the moment, and you feel you have the will power, then grow your hair out. Experiment with angled and long, wispy fringes or layers, whilst its growing, to give your style new looks. This will also stop you from getting bored and having it cut short again.
Heart face: The best hair styles that will do wonders for you heart shaped faces will include the following: Side parts, long, soft layers, a soft side sweeping fringe, highlights/low lights, long, full waves and curls minus the frizz. Just remember, you need to create volume around the bottom of your face, and make it soft and sleek at the top, to balance out your face shape and show off your features!
Square face: Hairstyles that have long, soft layers towards the top of the head are an instant disguise for a square jaw. Soften your square face with waves and curls, which will also add some femininity to your style. Whether you opt for a long or short style, remember not to go too short or too long. A couple of inches below or above the chin is perfect. Add a sweeping side fringe to soften your wide forehead, and you will look fabulous.
Diamond face: Most hairstyles would look complimentary on you, but hairstyles that would look great on you are ones with side parts and/or layers.;
, All shampoos are meant to clean your hair, though some could also de-frizz hair, moisturize dry hair, protect colored/highlighted hair, or deep-clean oily hair.


If your hair is greasy, try going to a salon or looking online for tips and tricks on how to get it less greasy. Also get shampoos and conditioners that suit your hair type.

, You can do a lot of things with hair. Try straightening, curling, or crimping it, or style your hair into beachy waves, a fishtail braid, a side ponytail, a messy bun... the possibilities are endless.


If your hair is frizzy or dry and you don't have any time to do anything to it, try an anti-frizz spray, mousse, or a leave-in conditioner. Then, wear it however you wish. For example, you could wear it up in a ponytail, or down naturally.

Try flirty fragrances, and choose one that is totally ""you"".

,
Enhance your face with makeup: In many ways, makeup can make you look gorgeous by highlighting your features and enhancing your face.,
Wear clothes that accentuate you.,
Take care of your body.",How to Be Hot in Middle School2," Everyone knows the basic rules of hygiene. The first step to looking good is being clean.


Bathe. This is an obvious one. Shower or bathe twice a day.
Brush, floss, and use mouth wash. Your smile is one of the first things people notice about you, so keep it white!
Use deodorant before you leave the house.

, If you have problems with acne, make sure you wash your face twice a day (once when you wake up, and once before you go to bed). Of course, everyone's skin is different, but for some, what works the best is to use an oil-free cleanser, (helps with oil) an exfoliating scrub, (helps with black heads) and an oil-free moisturizer that won't clog your pores (helps with dry skin).

, Pluck, shave, wax, or do a hair-removal treatment to your upper lip, legs, pubic area, and underarms. However, don't do any of this if you don't feel the need to.

,, For a great everyday look, read How to Apply Makeup for a Natural Look.


Use concealer. Skip out on the full face foundation. Get a concealer that matches your skin tone as close as possible. Use this to cover up small imperfections such as pimples, discoloration, white/black heads, and dark circles.
Use eyeliner. Eyeliner is great! It defines your eyes, and makes them pop! Try to stick to a brown eyeliner. Black is dramatic, but brown gives you a more subtle, natural look.
Use mascara. Mascara make your eyes look awesome, but be careful, it can also become very smudgy or clumpy, and completely ruin the look. Use a clear mascara, as it clumps less, and doesn't smudge noticeably. Try an eyelash-curler beforehand to make your eyelashes more curly (so mascara is less-likely to ""clump"") and stand out more.
Care for your lips. Don't wear lipstick, as it would make you look older than you are. Instead, try lip gloss, petroleum jelly, lip butter, lip shimmer, etc. If you use lip gloss, put on chapstick with it, so that your lips do not become chapped.

, We all have something that grabs other people's attention, whether it's a proof that you will have a great figure, maybe you own great legs, maybe you tan easily, or perhaps you're just one of a few that looks good in all colors.


Try clothing stores such as Abercrombie, Hollister, Forever 21, Charlotte Russe, Delias, Aeropostale, Dillards, Target, or Kohls. However, if none of these are your style, you don't have to wear them! In fact, it's totally cool to just wear team jerseys with jeans.
It's no secret that the way a girl wears her clothes can get her far in the girl world, so make sure your clothes fit and flatter you.
Wear colors that look good on you.
For shoes, skip heels and Crocs. Instead, try ballet flats, canvas shoes, T-strap sandals, or Uggs. Make sure your shoes are easy to walk in and comfortable.






Don't feel as if you have to go to brand name stores to look pretty, as you can find plenty of really nice clothes for much cheaper. Try second-hand or vintage stores like Plato's Closet or BlueTique. They're much more affordable. You could get a brand new pair of Hollister jeans for $20, or you could get a used pair for around $10.
Be humble. Don't wear skimpy clothing to be cool. In reality, it will just make people think badly about you. Instead, try wearing a fitted top along with loose bottoms, or a loose top with more fitted bottoms.
Also, never stuff your bra, or choose a bra that is too big for you just to be ""hot"". People will see right through it. Wear one that fits you properly.

, Eat right, exercise, and drink lots of water every day. If you care for yourself correctly, you will look fresher in return. Your body will thank you! Within a period of time, you'll notice a big difference in your skin, health, and complexion.


Get your beauty sleep! Most teens should get at least nine or ten hours of sleep. You have to be awake at every moment of the day, because you never know what great things during the day await you.
If you're trying to exercise to become thinner, try running, dancing to fast music that you love, using an elliptical, using a treadmill, or even taking a bike ride.
If you want to look more muscular and strong, and not ""skinny"", consider trying knee push-ups, sit-ups, wall sits, wall push-ups, or lifting weights or your own backpack. Focus mainly on your biceps and triceps.

Be mature.,
Be courageous.",How to Be Hot in Middle School3," You can't be considered ""hot"" if you remind people of a stereotypical little girl by complaining constantly, over-reacting, and picking fights with others. Work on having common sense, keeping your attitude cool, and being polite to everyone you come in contact with.

, In order to be considered ""hot"", you have to put yourself out there. Make good first impressions, and have fun with those who lift you up. Laugh often, be charming, be inclusive, and try to talk to as many people as you can in one day, but don't overdo it, or people may think that you are annoying.

"
"
Be confident, and be yourself.",How to Be Hot in Middle School4," This one is kind of tricky. Middle school is a time in your life when you begin to define yourself as a person. You develop your own style and personality, and sometimes it can feel as if you don't fit in. Don't feel as if you have to fill some sort of mold. ""Fitting in"" is something that every middle schooler worries about at some point, but in the end, you'll laugh at yourself for believing in such a thing, and realize that ""fitting in"" isn't all that important.


Stand up for yourself and others if you or the ones you care about get bullied.
Laugh at your mistakes, but try to work to get better at them.
Most importantly, don't let anyone else tell you how you should live your life. As Oscar Wilde said, ""Be yourself. Everyone else is already taken.""

Keep your locker tidy.,
Use your student planner.,
Keep a copy of your schedule on you all the time.",How to Be Successful in Middle School1," Having a locker can be a big change. You need to learn your locker combination and remember it.

, Make sure you know when your tests are coming up and when big assignments are going to be due.It is your responsibility to make sure you have your work done on time and are prepared for any exams. Your middle school teachers will expect you to.

, You will eventually learn your way around your middle school, but it's important to keep a copy of your schedule on you until you master your daily routine. Middle schools are often larger that elementary school and following your schedule can be confusing at first.

Listen to grunge music.,
Be yourself.,
Care about political issues.,
Avoid negative aspects of grunge culture.",How to Be Grunge in Middle School1," If you want to be grunge, spend some time familiarizing yourself with various grunge bands. You should listen to well-known grunge bands that started the grunge movement in the early '90s. You can listen to grunge music on accounts like Spotify, or buy grunge albums off iTunes.Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Alice in Chains, Sound Garden, Stone Temple Pilots, and others are all iconic grunge bands. Try listening to them in your spare time to get a sense of grunge music.
Pay attention to the lyrics. Many grunge artists sing about nonconformity and social issues. These things are major aspects of the grunge attitude and lifestyle. In addition to listening to the bands, you can read the lyrics online to try and get a sense of what different songs mean.
You should also learn a bit about the artists behind the song. Reading interviews or watching them online can give you a sense of the opinions and philosophy associated with grunge culture. You can also get a sense of grunge style by observing how people act and behave.;
, An important aspect of grunge culture is the idea of nonconformity. People associated with the grunge culture do not care about what others think. If you want to be grunge, you should strive to be yourself.However, it can be difficult to be non-conforming in middle school. Cliques are a major component of your average middle school, so you'll have to take efforts to be an individual.Find friends who are genuine. Choose people who you genuinely like, and you feel are kind and supportive of you. These kinds of people are more likely to allow you to be yourself, and will not expect you to follow certain styles or trends to be cool.
Speak up. If you feel like your friends are beginning to become a clique, point this out to them in a calm and respectful manner. You do not have to be rude, but it can be helpful to point out you feel excluding people due to difference is hurtful.
Sometimes, you may feel like you want to change. That's OK. You may want to work on bringing your grades up or having a better outlook. It's normal to change your style, opinions, and beliefs when you're young. Don't feel like a desire to change is against the grunge/non-conformist attitude. As long as you're changing for yourself, and not to appease a group, you're still thinking for yourself and therefore adopting a grunge culture.

, A lot of grunge culture is about challenging the status quo. Social movements like feminism, environmentalism, and other political ideas are often of concern in grunge culture. Spend some time educating yourself about social issues and forming your own opinions if you want to be grunge.Start watching the news. Watching the news with your parents can help expose you to a lot of issues going on in the world right now. Try to formulate opinions on things like gender issues, LGTB rights, the environment, and other issues that dominate political discourse.
Read opinion pieces online. Opinion pieces and polemics are often written with the goal of educating another person, while trying to influence their thoughts. Reading a lot of opinion pieces, from opposing sides, can help you see multiple sides of an issue, allowing you to have an informed opinion of your own.

, While grunge culture can be fun to emulate in middle school, keep in mind that there are some negative aspects of grunge culture. Social alienation, sadness, and depression are often aspects of grunge songs and the grunge mindset.While it's normal to feel a certain amount of angst and alienation as an adolescent, if you're feeling depressed or alienated for a long period of time, you should talk to someone. It's important to seek help if you're feeling sad. You can be grunge without having to feel alienated or alone.

Find an activity that's right for you.,
Join a sport.Some sports are open, such as cross-country and swimming, so there can be as many people on a team as want to join.,
Join an academic club.,
Attend school functions.,
Stay connected with your friends.",How to Be Successful in Middle School2," Consider your interests, abilities and the available free time you have first, then decide which activities suit you best.For example, if you want to make a difference in your middle school, consider student government. If you like running you can join the cross-country team. There are more opportunities than ever to try new things in middle school, so take advantage of them.

, Some teams that can only have a certain number of players still need team managers that can support the team while they work on improving their skills.

, Academic clubs are a great way to learn more while making friends and having fun. There are clubs for science, art, music, history, math and more. You will get to spend time with teachers that know a lot about the subjects they teach and other students that share your interests.

, Middle schools will have school dances, shows and other events for students to attend and socialize.It's a great opportunity to make new friends and to showcase your talents.

, Make plans with your friends to meet up with them during lunch time. The cafeteria is a good time to socialize, so make sure you let your friends know you plan to spend your lunch with them before the lunch period. This way you can save them a seat, or they can save one from you. Being with friends makes lunch much more enjoyable than sitting with strangers or eating alone.

Do your homework.,
Go to every class.,
Take good notes.,
Be healthy.,
Get enough sleep.,
Seek help early in the semester.",How to Be Successful in Middle School3," You will typically get 1-2 hours of homework each day in middle school.Do your homework first while the instructions or lessons are fresh in your mind. Always do your assignments before going out to play or watching television.

, Be on time. Teachers will keep track of your attendance and whether or not you were at the class on time, or not. If you are late or absent without being excused, it can negatively affect your grades.

, Learn and use a good note taking strategy.Write down key points from your class lectures and discussions. Listen for indications from your teacher when information is likely to appear on your future quizzes or exams. You can review your notes at home to quickly go over the topics and lessons you covered. Even if you feel like you know all the material, learning to take good notes now will be a major asset when you go on to high school and college.

, If your body feels good then so do you. Take up sports and physical activities, but don't overdo it or starve yourself, do what feels right to you. The goal isn't to have a 'perfect body' but rather to be on top of your health and take care of yourself. Also, the junk food that kids eat isn't good and should be replaced by healthy substitutes whenever possible.

, It is important to go to school well-rested and ready to learn. If you are tired from being up too late the previous night, you will have a difficult time focusing and retaining the information being presented to you in class. Make sure you get at least 7-8 hours of sleep each night to be ready for the next day.

, If you are having trouble understanding the lessons in one of your classes, ask your teacher for help before you fall too far behind. The more material you have to catch up on, the harder it will be to be successful.


Take advantage of drop-in tutoring centers. Middle schools have a free tutoring resource that any students can use to get up to speed on their studies. The tutoring center can help if you are struggling with a subject, or if you are just looking for some help to get the best grade in the class.

Do not style your hair too much.,
Choose the right makeup.,
Choose flannel outfits.,
Select the right footwear.,
Go for leggings, jeans, and shorts.,
Dress in dark colors.,
Layer your clothing.,
Try band t-shirts.,
Choose the right accessories.",How to Be Grunge in Middle School2," Grunge hair is usually somewhat messy and un-styled. Other than basic washing and conditioning, your hair does not need a lot of extra care if you want to have a grunge look. A lot of the time, grunge hair looks as if you just got out of bed. Avoid brushing or styling your hair too much. Simply let it fall where it falls and do not worry.Do not worry about getting your hair cut too often. It's okay if your hair looks a little shaggy from time to time. In fact, this may make your hair look a bit more grunge.

, Like hair, grunge makeup does not require a lot of work. You should avoid sparkly, colorful shades of eyeshadow and eyeliner. Instead, go for darker shades like blacks, grays, and browns. You do not need a lot of foundation or blush either. You want a more natural look. Some women do like a bolder shade of lipstick, such as a bright red, so this is something you can add to your grunge wardrobe.Some people in grunge culture may paint their nails. As with eyeshadow, nails should be painted darker colors like black.

, Flannel outfits are a staple of a grunge wardrobe. Stock up on flannel button up shirts, which you can wear over a t-shirt. If you're a girl, seek out flannel skirts. If you want to be grunge, you should have quite a bit of flannel in your wardrobe.Grunge shirts do not need to be new, fancy, or expensive. In fact, older clothing emulates the grunge style more. Consider buying shirts at a secondhand shop.
Flannel shirts are a popular, somewhat timeless wardrobe option. You can see if your parents or grandparents have any old flannel clothing. You can also borrow from older siblings.

, When assembling your grunge wardrobe, make sure you choose the right shoes. Generally, bigger and clunkier shoes are preferred. Go for large boots, like combat boots, Chuck Taylors, and Doc Martens.As the grunge style is often non-glamorous, simple sneakers or tennis shoes may be a good option as well.


As with clothing, grunge shoes do not need to be shiny or new. You can keep wearing the same pair of shoes until you've almost worn them out.
However, be careful. It can be dangerous to wear shoes with big holes in them, as your feet won't be protected when walking outside or through your school parking lot. Feel free to wear older shoes, but make sure to get a replacement if you end up with holes.

, There are a variety of types of pants you can wear if you want to be grunge. Leggings are a popular choice, particularly for girls. You can wear ripped, pattern tights under your leggings or with a skirt. Baggy jeans or pants are also popular in the grunge scene. Denim or leather shorts are another good choice., Grunge tends to be toned down. When selecting your wardrobe, go for dark colors. Grays, browns, blacks, and dark greens are appropriate choices to give off the grunge persona.As with flannel shirts, it's a good idea to seek out dark clothing at a thrift store. Older clothing is particularly fitting for grunge style.

, Layering is a major aspect of grunge style. You can wear a t-shirt under a flannel button up. You can wear a skirt with leggings underneath. Don't be afraid to use contrasting patterns or colors. A little mismatching when it comes to layering also gives off the grunge style.Many more fashionable brands of clothing are worn in layers. If you want to be grunge, layers are great but avoid trendier, brighter layered outfits.

, Band t-shirts are another classic aspect of the grunge style. Try wearing a t-shirt advertising a band you like. You can usually find band t-shirts at the mall, but you can also buy them online. If you go to a concert, bands will often be selling t-shirts after the concert lets out.Remember, older clothes are better. Some band shirts, sold at stores in the mall, cost as much as $20. These are not very fitting with the grunge culture.
Vintage may be somewhat fitting with grunge. If your parents are into music, ask them if they have any old band t-shirts. An old Nirvana shirt from the '90s can really help you look grunge.

, If you want to be grunge, you'll need certain accessories. The following are some accessories often associated with the grunge style:Pocket chains
Spikes
Studs
Metallic zippers
Large handbags
Round sunglasses
Headscarves

Review your school's dress code.,
Look up policies on carrying handbags.,
Check headphone policies.",How to Be Grunge in Middle School3," Before you try to be grunge in school, make sure to review your school's dress code. Dressing grunge can be fun, but you do not want to end up in trouble over your new style.


Oftentimes, things like wallet chains are banned by schools. They can be considered weapons in some schools. If your school has a zero tolerance policy for weapons, a chain could land you in trouble.
Make sure any t-shirts you have do not have foul language on them. Sometimes, band names can be sexually suggestive, and could land you in trouble if you wear them in school.
Certain types of jewelry or accessories may also not be allowed in your school. Read over the dress code policy in your school's handbook carefully before adding any jewelry to your outfit.

, As many grunge kids carry large handbags, make sure these are permitted in your school. Many schools have policies that forbid you from carrying a handbag to class. You also may be required to keep purses or handbags in your locker during school hours. Teachers and school officials worry about students carrying items like weapons or alcohol in handbags, so make sure to review policy first before adding a grunge handbag to your wardrobe.

, Many schools do not allow students to listen to headphones during class. Make sure to review the headphone policy in your school. As so much of grunge culture revolves around music, you may be tempted to listen to music between classes and carry a headphone and iPod or MP3 player with you in school. You want to make sure this is permitted first.

Stay positive.",How to Be a Success in Middle School," Your first day of middle school will be, in some respects, like your first day of kindergarten: new places, new faces, new things to do and new ways to do them. Even if your buddies from elementary school are still around, things will still feel different. Chances are you will make new friends and they will too, the dynamic is totally different. Go into it with an open mind. Embrace the chance to try things in a new way. You adapted well to school once, if you can remember that, so you can certainly do it again.


People you’ve known for years may start to seem different to you. You may start to seem different to them as well. This is a natural part of growing up.;
, Is it academic achievement? Being a good person? Perhaps ideally it should be a combination of both of these. The best judge of whether or not you are a success in middle school is you. But you have to know your criteria. A good thing to do is to get the inside scoop from an older sibling or friend who went there to, to make the best first impression.


Your parents will have their own ideas of what success means for you. This is, of course, important as well. Talk with your parents about your goals for middle school and how you can work together to achieve them. Remember: you may disagree with your parents priorities but if you stay professional and don't throw a big tantrum if you don't get what you want you can usually work out a reasonable situation with both sides still happy and talking to each other.

, The middle school years are always a time of awkwardness. You are growing, your body is changing, and your interests are evolving. Yes, you’ll get pimples, trip over your own feet, feel embarrassed to get changed in the locker room, get rejected by that boy or girl you like, and so on. Don't worry it happens or has happened to all of us. A good thing to do is to imagine yourself in other people's shoes and try to imagine how you would feel in their situation and realize no one is analyzing everything you do. So chances are if you have one of those days where everything goes horribly and terribly wrong it's probably not going to be the talking point of the whole school for 5 years after. So just take a deep breath and relax.


For a good list of “survival skills” for common awkward situations in middle school, check out Survive Middle School. Also, don’t be embarrassed to talk to your parents, a teacher, the guidance counselor, you're friends or someone else who can help.

, The pressure to conform, or to be like everyone else, grows as you become a teenager. Don’t let peer pressure dictate who you are or what you want to achieve. Although if it does, don't freak out. It's ok to fit in a little bit despite what all the books say. Do what is right for yourself and what you’re interested in.


Stick up for what you believe in and what you know is right. For instance, turn in someone who is bullying you or other kids. If this costs you a childhood friend, don’t worry. You’ll have plenty of opportunities to make new, better friends in middle school.

, Teenagers may not have the reputation for being the neatest, most organized bunch. But you can work to keep yourself and your school materials in order. Doing so will increase your ability to be successful in school. A student planner book is a calendar where you can write down when assignments are due, when you have soccer or choir practice, and when you have sleepovers with friends. Keep track of your schedule and look at your planner every day. Writing in it after every class can be a good way to start the habit if you're having trouble. , Have one notebook for each of your classes. You may even want to color-code them, so you know that the blue notebook is for History and the red notebook is for Algebra.


Keep these binders organized. Use dividers to separate notes from assignments. The less time it takes you to find your notes, homework, and study guides, the more time you have to actually get things done.

, Go ahead and decorate your locker to show off your personality. Make sure that the things you put in your locker are practical, the biggest mistake is to make your locker an extension of the locker decorations store and not be able to put anything that actually needs to be in there because you decided to buy a locker rug, pool table, chandelier, and minibar. Definitely make sure to organize it so you can be in and out of it quickly. You don’t want to have things spilling out of it every time you open it.

, Carve out a place for yourself at home to do your homework. This will ideally be a desk with a chair and computer or laptop. Keep the desk clear so that you can easily sit down and do your homework after school every day.


Store all your school supplies in one place so that you’re not hunting all over the house for the pencil sharpener.

, Talk with your parents on Sunday afternoon to see what the week looks like. Use this time to remind your parents about your upcoming game or concert. You will also know which nights you might have to help out with dinner.

, It sounds obvious, but it’s a key part of being successful in middle school. Studies show that good grades and consistent attendance in middle school are indicators of future academic success in high school and college.Get to school on time and don’t skip classes.If you need to miss school, make sure you talk with your teacher about the material you missed. While you're gone email him or her and check their website if they have one for assignments. Catch up on your homework as soon as possible.

, Whether you had to do it in elementary school or not, the amount of note-taking you will need to do in middle school will be a new experience. Good note taking doesn’t mean furiously writing down everything the teacher says. Instead, try these strategies to take good notes:Keep your notes organized by starting a new sheet every day. Put the date at the top of the page and what you're learning.
Listen for audio cues by your teacher. She will tend to vocally emphasize what is most important.
Don’t worry about writing whole sentences. Instead, develop your own shorthand and shortcuts. Remember, no one has to be able to read it but you, go ahead a write a squiggle every time your teacher says ""Mitosis"". It's okay as long as you understand it.
Review your notes each day when you’re doing your homework. Rewrite your notes more neatly and fully. This will also help the information stick in your brain better.

, Like note-taking, the amount of studying required in middle school will likely be a surprise. Good study skills do not mean simply memorizing the textbook chapter. Here are some ideas for studying successfully:Learn to identify the most important concepts. Highlight key names, themes, etc., in your notes and put sticky notes in your textbook to mark key passages.
Rewrite your notes so that you can organize the information and make your writing neat and easy to follow.
Create study aids such as flash cards, diagrams, and so on.
Find a study buddy. This is ideally someone who has a good grasp on the material. Working together may help you see things from a different angle. Work hard to stay focused on studying. Talk about music or football another time.

, Tests may be more complicated and you’ll be responsible for knowing more material. To take tests successfully, follow some of these strategies:


Listen to instructions that your teacher gives you. Read all the directions on the test.Pace yourself. Be sure to leave yourself enough time to finish the entire test. Don’t keep looking at the clock, since that might stress you out more. But gauge how long it might take you to answer questions in each section of the test. If a question stumps you, come back to it later.Double-check all of your answers.
Reduce anxiety you might feel about taking tests. When you are more prepared and understand the material, your anxiety will lessen. Take deep breaths before the exam and repeat to yourself, “I will do well on this test.”, There are more demands on your time in middle school. You’ll have more classes, more homework, more tests, and more extracurricular activities. Improving your time management skills is key. Make your schoolwork a top priority, so that you get it done on time.


Try to complete all your homework as soon as you arrive home from school. Do this before distractions and responsibilities take over. If you have to attend to other things as soon as school is over, block out a specific time each evening for homework completion.
Keep limits on your “screen time.” This includes your phone, TV, computer, etc.Don’t play computer games or text with your friends until your homework is done, for example.
Take responsibility for your own learning and homework. Don’t copy your friend’s homework.
If you’re having trouble keeping up in a class, talk to your teacher sooner rather than later. Don’t wait until you’ve fallen hopelessly behind.

, As you get older, more of the responsibility for your academic success rests on your own shoulders. But this doesn’t mean you have to go it alone. There are many different people who want to help you, so let them.


If you’re having trouble with pre-algebra or early American history, for instance, talk to your teachers about additional resources that might help. Your teachers may even be able to suggest tutoring options.

, If you haven’t done your homework, don’t lie to your teacher. Instead, tell your teacher that you will work on it tonight and hand it in tomorrow. Your teacher will appreciate that you’re taking responsibility.


Don’t cheat on tests or copy other people’s homework. If you do and you get caught, don’t try to lie your way out of it. Tell the truth.

, In middle school, you’re in more classes with new people. Instead of feeling sad about how things are different, seize the chance to expand your horizons. There are so many opportunities to get active and get involved when you reach middle school.


Join a club. Math clubs, service organizations, and the student council are some of the opportunities in middle school. Meet new people (or old people in new ways) and discover your passions and what the new, more mature you can accomplish.
Play a sport. Try out for the basketball or soccer team. Even if you end up riding the bench, you’ll enjoy the camaraderie and competition.
Volunteer. Do a trash pickup or help set up a bake sale for a good cause. Recruit old and new friends for the cause. Don’t be afraid to take the initiative.

, As soon as you hit middle school, you’ll be mixed in with new kids as well as older kids. You’ll have opportunities to connect with people who seem exciting and new. But in your preteen and teenage years, it’s important to surround yourself with positive, supportive people. The friends you have in middle school are good indicators of how well you’ll succeed in the coming years, so choose wisely.If you feel like a “friend” isn’t very nice to you, talk with her about it. If she doesn’t change her ways, it’s probably better in the long run to move on.
Make sure to stay away from others who are reckless and get into trouble a lot. Even if they are your friends, don't let them drag you down with them and possibly jeopardize your academic success or other relationships and friendships.

, In middle school, kids are experiencing puberty full-force and hormones start up. You’re probably thinking about that cute boy or girl and whether you might start dating. It’s important during this time to understand what a healthy relationship looks like. Studies show that middle schoolers experience sexual harassment and dating violence at high rates, in part because they don’t recognize what is appropriate or not.


Healthy relationships start with respect, trust and friendship. You should also feel free to have other friends and be independent.
Don’t feel pressured to start dating yet. You may feel that because your friends are dating, you should be too. But some studies show that when you start dating too early, your attention turns away from academics and you may actually perform worse on your school work., People change as they become teenagers. It may well be that some kid you’ve known for years but never really were friends with has become a natural fit for the older you.


Teenagers naturally seem to organize themselves into like-minded groups or cliques. This isn’t always a bad thing, but don’t be too quick to judge and exclude people. Be welcoming and inclusive to others. Set a positive example.

, Treat other people with kindness and friendliness. Put yourself in the other person’s shoes before you say or do something hurtful.


Stand up for others if you see bullying going on. Don’t stand by and let others be bullied. If you are being bullied or see it happening to someone else, report it to a teacher. Bullying is not acceptable behavior.

, Your middle school years are about the time when you start feeling like you can do everything on your own. But keep in mind that there are plenty of people around you who are ready and willing to help. Your parents are great resources, believe it or not. They went through a lot of the same things you’re going through now.Ask for advice on things like taking notes in class, studying for tests, staying out of trouble, even (gasp!) asking a boy or girl to the school dance.

, Older brothers and sisters have more recently gone through middle school. They’re likely to have good tips about how to deal with each teacher, which lunch line to choose, and so on.

, At the start of the school year, talk to each of your teachers about class expectations and ideas on how to do well in the class. Continue talking with your teachers throughout the year to make sure you are meeting expectations. It’s important to take responsibility for your own learning.


Get to know other adults at the school as well, from administrators and guidance counselors to nurses and librarians.

, There is no shame in seeking help when you need it. The school counselor is there to help you, and is knowledgeable about the issues that are troubling to middle schoolers. This person can give you guidance about academic challenges as well as social and personal issues.If you have thoughts of suicide, call the National Suicide Prevention Hotline at 800-273-TALK (8255).

, Life gets busier in middle school, and will keep getting busier after that. Being rested, refreshed, energized, and focused is the best way to stay ahead of the curve instead of falling behind. Your body is still growing and going through changes. You need adequate rest to function at your best. If your schedule is especially busy, you’re using up lots of energy during the day and you need to replace it. Aim to get eight to nine hours of sleep every night.If you’re having trouble getting to sleep, turn off all screens about 15 to 30 minutes before bed. Studies show that your brain is engaged when you are looking at information on a screen, which can contribute to difficulty getting to sleep., Proper nutrition will help your memory, concentration, mood, energy level, and self-image. These are all important components of a successful middle school student. So skip the vending machine and eat real food. Try to get lots of fruits and vegetables, proteins, whole grains and low-fat dairy. Stay away from processed and fried foods, as well as foods high in refined sugar.


Start the day with a good breakfast. Studies show that a good breakfast will help you improve your performance on school work throughout the day.Try a fruit and yogurt smoothie, oatmeal or eggs and toast., Exercising regularly is a great way to reduce stress, boost brain function, and improve your mood. Kids and teens should get at least 30 minutes of exercise every day. Skip watching TV after school and instead, head out for a bike ride with a friend., There will be times when it seems like too much – too much homework, too much pressure, or too many annoying kids in English class. But know that you can and will make it. Keep your goals in mind and focus on what you need to do to achieve them. You can be a success.


You’ll figure things out as you go. You learn by trying, and sometimes failing, and always by getting back up and trying again.

You don’t want to get in trouble with the teachers or principal in your first year for breaking all sorts of rules you didn't even know about. Make sure you learn your school’s dress code as well as the other rules and then follow them! Making the teachers dislike you or making yourself seem like a troublemaker is only going to make things harder for you. Even if your friends are breaking the rules, don't follow their example. Make an effort to stay in your teachers' good books.;
, There will be lots of gossip and some really malicious (mean) rumors floating around. Ignore rumors, even when they’re about you, and if anyone talks or asks you about a rumor, tell them to ignore it and not spread it around. Never start rumors: they only break friendships, create enemies, hurt feelings, and make things worse for everyone. Gossip may seem juicy at first, but it bites at the end. Do your best to stay away from it.


Help to stop rumors and save lives by standing up for people and not participating by spreading the rumor.
Protect other people's privacy and mistakes. You wouldn't want someone spreading your personal secrets around, would you?
Drama is unnecessary. Some people think that a life has to be filled with melodrama to be important and appreciated by others. It does not. Focusing on the things, people, and ideas that are really important is better than worrying about who is going to ask who to the dance.

, This is very important. Be friends with people who don’t start or participate in drama and you’ll avoid the worst things that happen in middle school. Establish a small group of good friends. Every group will face a few problems, but if you suddenly feel like your life could be a Disney Channel show, you might want to consider a more sensible group of friends.


Understand that in middle school, rather intentionally or, in most cases, unintentionally, you will make enemies. The only way to survive is to have a close group of friends who you can trust. You don't need too many close friends; three or four good friends, and then several casual friends is definitely enough. Be nice and friendly to everyone, but don't worry about making everyone love you.

, Similar to the step above, you shouldn't be friends with people who get you in serious trouble. If someone asks you to lie about something important, do something illegal, or do something to hurt someone else, then don't do it. Don’t do anything that makes you feel uncomfortable or what you think is wrong. This is called peer pressure and it can lead to all sorts of problems.


Don’t be afraid to tell an adult if someone asks or tells you to do something really bad. This doesn't make you a snitch: it makes you a good person doing the right thing. If you make a bad decision, talk to an adult you can trust. Talking to friends about it is the fastest way to start gossip. But a warning: They may want revenge if you do that, and if they are willing enough, that may be a bad can of worms to open.

, Just like you don’t want to do something to hurt other people, you shouldn't do anything to hurt yourself. Don’t do drugs, play choking games (or anything else that someone tells you is safe/legal, but you know it's not), or any kind of self-harm like cutting yourself. If you need help, there are always people who will help you.

, Now that you’re in middle school, you’ll start feeling a lot more grown up and you might find yourself wanting a boyfriend or a girlfriend. You’ll definitely have some pretty serious crushes! But relationships are hard, stressful, and usually cause more problems than they solve. You might enjoy having crushes and maybe flirt a little, but stay single and focus on having fun, making friends, and learning things.

, Everyone worries about gym. You've probably heard that you’ll have to change your clothes in front of other girls or boys or maybe you've never been very good at gym and you feel embarrassed. What you have to remember is that everyone is worried and embarrassed, so you're not alone.


You might feel like everyone is watching you while you change, but they are really focusing on getting themselves changed. Nobody will look at you, because they are too busy thinking YOU are watching them. Everyone wants to just keep to themselves and change as quickly as possible!
If you’re a girl and you feel self-conscious about being on your period while you’re having to change, just wear black or brown underwear. No one will notice at all. Middle school is all about those little changes going on your body; if you feel nervous about them, talk to your mom, another trusted adult or a mentor/counselor.

, This is a really important skill, not just for getting through middle school but for getting through your whole life. If you learn good ways to solve problems, you’ll be able to handle anything that comes your way.


For example, you should learn to ask for help when you need it. Sometimes you’ll feel silly asking for help or you don’t want to admit that you’re having problems, but you don't have to. Everyone has problems, and whoever you ask for help will totally understand. They’ve had to ask for help at some point too.
Apologize and accept consequences when you've done something wrong. After making a mistake, refusing to acknowledge that you did something bad (even if you didn't mean to) will just make things harder for you. You’ll feel guilty or you’ll have to deal with people being angry with you, and you don’t want that. If you spread a rumor, apologize. If you lie to a teacher, confess.

Communicate clearly. By doing this, you are avoiding most of the problems people face. A lot of the time, rumors get started because someone misunderstands what you say or you misunderstand what they say. You might also accidentally offend someone if you say something you don’t mean. Be careful, clear and always make sure you know what you’re saying.

, Remember: We won't try to make middle school seem like it's the worst thing that will ever happen to you, it might be really great! But, we also won't try to tell you that it's all awesome and like living in a TV show either. It can be really hard. Just believe that there will be happy times, and there will be sad times, but no matter how bad it gets, things will always get better.

, This will give you a few friends to start off with. You can ask your elementary friends what school they’ll be going to at the end of your final year, just make sure to get phone numbers so that you can make plans to meet up with them at your new school.

, Once you start school, you can also try to make friends with people you see getting on and off at the same bus stop. Friends that live in your neighborhood can be handy, since you’ll have an easier time hanging out and you’ll have someone nearby that you can call for homework help or advice.

, Even if you have a whole bunch of your elementary friends coming with you to middle school, you should still try to make some new friends. If you don’t try to meet new people, you’ll never know what you’re missing. Maybe someone you meet will be your best friend for a while.

, A great way to meet new friends is to join clubs at your new school. Most schools will have at least a few clubs and some have lots! Some schools will let you start your own too, if you don’t find one that sounds good to you. There might be book clubs, a bible study, movie clubs, theater clubs, environmental clubs, cooking club, robotics clubs, or yearbook club (and these are just a few examples).


Don’t forget about sports! There are sports teams if you want to join a team, but there might also be clubs that are just about watching or playing friendly matches if you aren't really good enough or don’t want to join the official school teams.
Volunteering is also a sort of club that will help you meet new people to be friends with. Your school might have a group that volunteers to raise money for events, make cards for elderly people or people in the hospital, clean up local parks, or other great activities.

, You should show what you’re interested in, in subtle ways so that people that like the same thing will know they can come up and talk to you about it. This is a great way to make friends because you’ll know you already have something in common.


For example, if you like Adventure Time, you can wear a Lumpy Space Princess pin on your backpack. If you like video games, get a class binder with a picture from your favorite game on it. If you like a sports team, wear a bracelet for that team.

, If you show people that you think you’re a great person to be friends with, and that you think you have a lot to offer to people, then they’ll be much more likely to want to be friends with you. Don’t constantly apologize and don’t back down if people don’t immediately like you. Speak up for yourself, stand up straight, and celebrate the things that make you unique.

, This is the most important part of making new friends! You’ll never make friends if you don’t talk to people. Join conversations that sound interesting and introduce yourself to people you think you’d like to be friends with.


Don’t forget to speak up so that people can hear you! Talk like you mean it!

, If other people see you enjoying yourself, they’ll want to join in and be friends with you so that they can have fun too. You can do fun things by joining clubs, drawing in between classes, or putting together parties or other activities for after school.

, If you want people to be friends with you, it’s important to be a nice person. Who wants to be friends with a jerk? Nobody! Be nice to everyone you meet, even if they aren't nice back. People will notice that you are a great person and they will be much more likely to be nice to you.


It’s important to be actively nice, not just polite. Help people that have trouble in class, stand up for others when they’re getting bullied, and do nice things for people when you can. Also, give people honest compliments when they seem like they need it!
You never know when someone is going through some really tough times. They could feel like they’re dying inside and they might not show it. Your kind words or deeds could make a world of difference to them.
Remember that sometimes, when people are acting really jerky, they do that because they feel bad about themselves or something that’s happening in their life. They’re mean because they don’t know what kindness looks like! Try to be nice to them even if they’re mean to you. It might help make them a better person.

, If you want to do well in class, the best place to start is to pay attention! It’s amazing how much your grades will go up if you just pay attention and try to absorb as much information from the lesson as possible. Don’t mess with your phone, try not to daydream, and don’t pass notes with friends. There’s always time for fun stuff later!

, Take notes in class. You don’t have to write down everything that the teacher says: just write down the really important or hard to remember information. Write the sort of stuff you’d say if you were explaining the lesson to someone who wasn’t there. This will help you study for tests later and also do your homework.

, This is really important for getting decent grades. If you don’t do your homework, you’re almost guaranteed to get bad grades, even if you ace tests and stuff like that. Find some quiet time each evening and just work to get your homework done. Get help if you need it too! Your homework shouldn't take so much time that you don’t have time to relax too.

, Don’t just shove everything in your backpack. This will make you forget about assignments or lose important papers. Instead, have a binder for homework assignments and organize them by when they’re due. Have another binder for class notes, organized by subject.


Consider getting a planner. You also want to keep your life organized! Get a planner and carefully organize your day. Set aside time for homework, time for hanging out, time for getting ready and eating breakfast in the morning, and everything else you need to do during your day.

, Lots of people develop the very bad habit of procrastinating. This means that they don’t do things when they should. Instead, they wait until the last minute! This is bad, because it means that when you do things, you’ll do a bad job because you’ll be rushed. It will also make you really stressed. Develop a good habit of doing things at the appropriate time and you’ll save yourself a lot of trouble.

, This is a great way to make sure you improve your grades. When you don’t understand something, ask! This way you know you’re doing something right. Even if you do understand something, it’s good to ask questions if you’re curious about something else. Always ask questions and you’ll find yourself getting smarter and smarter.

, If you really want good grades, you’ll need to study. Read all of the books you are assigned and set aside plenty of time to study. Middle school is an important time to develop good school habits, so getting used to studying now will really help you later.

, Don’t worry about getting straight A’s right now. Just focus on learning as much as you can, developing good school habits, and get the best grades you can. You shouldn’t settle for a C- but you shouldn’t worry about a B or B+.

, Middle school is a great time to explore the things you enjoy and figure out what is important to you. You should take electives that you think you might like, learn to do things that you’ve always wanted to learn how to do, and read about things you’d like to do in the future.


Read books about people who inspire you. Figure out what they did to get to where they got and figure out if you want to do the same.
Clubs are a great way to explore things that make you happy! Try joining one at your school.
The internet can also be a great place to explore things you like, especially if you like nerdy stuff! You’ll have a much easier time finding people who like the same stuff. Just be careful because just like the real world, there are lots of bad people out there on the internet.

, Make sure you’re washing your body, keeping your face clean, wearing clean clothes and other things to keep yourself looking nice. This will help you develop confidence and make you feel more comfortable in your body, even if it is changing.

, While it’s important to devote time to learning while you’re in middle school, it’s also important for you to learn how to balance responsibility with fun and relaxation. You’ll drive yourself crazy if you spend too much time studying, but you’ll also have a really hard time in life if you don’t learn how to be responsible.

, You may not realize it now, because many people don’t, but helping others can be the most rewarding thing you ever do. Making a positive difference in your community and the world can make you feel like a superhero because you’ll be one! Volunteer, help people that you see struggling, and find out how you can improve the world around you.

, School is all about getting your mind fit and healthy, but you need to make sure your body stays healthy too. Make sure you eat right, and get plenty of good exercise to keep your body in good condition. Getting healthy now means you’ll be able to look forward to a lifetime of good habits!

, If you’re good at something, you should find ways to do those things! Get better and better at things you enjoy and that you’re good at. Your talents can often be turned into a great job or hobby when you’re older (or even now). Talk to your parents about what you can do, and if they can’t help, talk to a teacher.


For example, if you’re good at drawing, take an art class. If you have a talent for learning songs, join the band. If you’re good at math, offer to tutor other students (for extra credit or money!) the possibilities are endless!

, You’ll be a much happier person and it will be much easier to deal with problems and the stress of middle school if you learn to worry only about the problems that really matter. This can be hard to do, and will probably take a long time to learn, but it’s worth keeping in mind.


For example, don’t worry about stuff like losing a game (it’s just a game!), feeling left out (you’ll find your crowd someday and you’re probably not as alone as you feel), people making accusations about you (their drama is theirs, not yours, ignore them), or other kids teasing you (you’ll be the one laughing at them when they work at 7-11 in twenty years and you have a college degree).
Instead, worry about things like injustice, current events, and the world around you. These are things that matter and that you should always worry about: because if you don’t worry, you won’t do anything about it, and if people don’t do anything then the problems will never get better.

, There will be many times where you will feel different and alone. You might be afraid because you find yourself having a crush on the ""wrong"" person. You might feel like no one understands you because you like the ""wrong"" things. You might feel left out because you and your parents don't look like everyone else. But it is very important for you to understand that no matter how alone you feel, no matter how ""wrong"" or weird you think you are, there are so many people just like you. Someday you're going to meet them and you're going to find better friends and family that you never thought you would...and you will be more happy than you ever thought you could be.


You might notice, for example, that while all the other girls are giggling over boys, you don't feel the same way. You might find yourself wanting a very close relationship with another girl. This shouldn't make you feel like there is something wrong with you because there is nothing wrong with you. Give things time and take things slow. You never know how you'll feel in a few months or even a few years.
You might think that you're weird because your family doesn't look like or doesn't talk like everyone else's. Maybe your parents don't speak English. Maybe you have two dads. Maybe your dad is black and your mom is Asian. The important thing to understand is that families come in all shapes and sizes, and as long as you love each other, that's all that matters. You are just like everyone else. No matter how your family looks.

, This can be a source of lots of embarrassment and nervousness, but it shouldn’t be. All the girls have to deal with the same problems! Be prepared and you won’t have anything to worry about.

, Pretty much all boys will have to deal with this problem at some point. Don’t worry: it’s totally normal! Know how to solve the problem and you won’t have anything to worry about. Try carrying a textbook in front.

, A lot of embarrassing moments in middle school come from tripping, falling, or running into someone or something at the worst times. Work on your coordination and pay attention to your surroundings and avoid your own tale of falling down the bleachers in the middle of an assembly.

, You’re probably worried about having to wear a uniform, since most middle schools these days require them, but still looking cool and being yourself. You can totally do this! With a little creativity, your uniform will be no problem.

, Girls are going to need bras and this can be a kind of scary thing. Don’t worry, though: it’s totally normal. Don’t be embarrassed to ask your mom or dad for help and get help at the store to find the right size.

, Nobody wants to be stinky! Since you’re going through puberty, your body will be a little more likely to get extra stinky and sweaty. Don’t worry: it’s totally normal! With a little effort, you can stay clean and ready for the day.

, As you get your grown up body, you’ll probably have to deal with embarrassing pimples. This is normal, but there’s no reason you should have to put up with it! With a little help, you can keep your skin pretty clear and nice looking.


If you have constant, painful break-outs it might be a good idea to consult your doctor. Many times they can prescribe medicines that will help your skin look and feel better!

, You don’t want to bully, be bullied, or let anyone else be bullied. Be brave enough to stop bullying in its tracks and make your school better for everybody!

, This will be very important, not just in middle school but for the rest of your school career. Get good at studying now and this will lead you to better grades and better opportunities for the rest of your life.

, Many students coming to middle school struggle with opening their locker. Combination locks are hard to work sometimes, even for adults. Learn how to work one, and things will be much easier for you.

Designate a specific study area.,
Create a nightly study schedule.,
Study effectively to learn all you can.",How to Be a Great Student in Middle School," It can be tough to focus on school work, but without motivation, you’ll quickly lose interest in your academic goals. Motivated students are more likely to do well in middle school by keeping up with class work and homework.You can stay motivated by reminding yourself that the work you’re doing in middle school matters and contributes to your overall academic success.


If you’re having trouble staying interested in school and being motivated on your own, look for a study group of students in your year.A study group will help keep you motivated by providing socialization and letting you work with other motivated individuals.;
, In middle school, unlike elementary school, you’ll be responsible for keeping material for several classes organized and accessible. You’ll need to keep your English papers separate from your Math homework, and keep track of which assignments are due on which days. To keep organized, make use of binders, folders, or spiral notebooks—whatever system you prefer to use.Ask you parents to buy you one folder or binder per subject. That way, you can always place papers and assignments in the correct folder that corresponds to the subject.
Rather than shoving materials from multiple classes into your backpack, organize the materials into separate subject.
Also, avoid letting old papers pile up in your desk or backpack, pull everything out regularly to make sure you haven’t missed an assignment or handout.

, Time-management skills are one of the most important things that you can learn in middle school, although many students do not realize this at the time. Managing your time will help you avoid panicking the night before a large project is due, and will help you break your homework up into manageable segments., When you’re given a new assignment, estimate how long the work will take. Then, plan to do a portion of that each day or every other day. This can help you break large, daunting projects down into smaller, manageable chunks.


See if your school provides an agenda book or a day planner. A day planner is a great way to keep track of multiple obligations, including classes, after-school activities, and social plans., You won’t be able to focus and do well if you don’t have the necessary supplies with you, so make sure that you come to class prepared. If you come to class prepared, you’ll show your teacher that you’re there to learn, and you’ll help keep yourself focused as well.When coming to class, make sure you have:


The required textbook and reading materials (handouts etc.).
A couple of functioning pens and pencils.
A notebook with blank paper.
Any class-specific items: for example, a calculator for math class.

, Participation will keep you interested in the material being discussed, and will also show your teacher that you’re attentive and focused. Focus on your teacher’s instruction, and follow along in the text or assigned reading.Show your interest in the subject, and if you are well prepared, try to start a discussion.


To begin participating, see if you can answer a question posed by the teacher or another student.
If you’re unclear about something covered in class, don’t be afraid to raise your hand and ask questions. This will help you learn, and chances are that if you’re confused about a topic, other students are confused also.

, Note-taking will keep you focused in the classroom, and will help you retain a large portion of the material that the instructor tells you. When you take notes, don’t worry about transcribing full sentences—rather, write down keywords to jog your memory later.Also listen to your teacher for verbal cues. If they say something like, “this is important,” or “here’s the main point,” be sure to write down what they say next.


Taking effective notes will also help you study better; you’ll be able to review the material from class without having to guess what the teacher lectured on, and you won’t have to struggle to remember important class points.
Keep your notes organized. Have a separate folder or notebook section for every class—that way, you won’t mix together notes from different subjects., An academic class is a collaborative community, and it’s important that you focus on learning what the teacher has set out for everyone. Don’t pass notes, talk out loud to your peers, or participate in other distracting activities. If you’re focused and attentive, you’ll enjoy class more, too.Although it can be tempting to socialize during class, it’s not worth missing the material you’d otherwise learn. Save the socialization for lunch break and after school, and stay focused and attentive in the classroom.

, You’ll study better if you make homework part of your nightly routine, and if you have a single area that you always do your homework in. Pick a location that’s relatively quiet and set away from distractions, including TV, snacks, and other family members or friends.Make sure that your study area is consistent.You’ll be distracted by new sounds and sights if you study in your bedroom one night, in the kitchen the next, and in the basement the next. Pick a location away from distractions.

, If you get in the habit of working on homework every night, it will become second nature to you. You’ll get into a study routine more easily if you pick a consistent time to do homework. This will reinforce in your mind that studying takes time. Figure out which time(s) of day work best for you to study in: are you at your best in the morning before school, or at night, following dinner? For example, do your homework on weekdays after school from 5:00 to 7:00, and then another hour after dinner from 8:00 to 9:00.

, When you study, review the day’s in-class work, and then move on to any new assignments. When starting a new assignment, apply the concepts from class to the work. Make sure that you understand the problems before beginning to work, and focus on learning and applying the concepts behind the homework.Flash cards are a great way to learn tricky material. Write a problem or question on the front of the card, and the answer on the opposite side. Flip through the cards to learn the material—this can be especially effective before tests.Be aware that some facts—such as periodic elements, will simply have to be memorized.To aid in this process, try coming up with an acrostic or other memory-aid system.
Reading ahead in advance is often helpful if you don’t want to be overwhelmed with the new concepts and information being given to you on the next lecture. Skim the chapter before class to get an idea of what you’ll be covering.

Decide where you want to fit in.,
Pick your friends wisely.,
Don't try too hard.,
Understand that being mean gets you nowhere.,
Help out.,
Don't try to be bad.,
Wear what you want to wear.,
Don't be a pervert.,
Keep a head on your shoulders.",How to Be in Middle School/ Junior High," Who do you hang around with? Are they the crazy type? While you are in Middle school / Junior High you do not want to act like somebody you're not. If you're not generally the popular type, stop trying your luck in that big group of kids. Don't bother to pretend to be something your not or you will be wasting your time completely. The popular kids are usually not the nicest, but at the same time they are still reasonable people. If you're not the sporty type, don't bother joining that sports club just because it looks cool. Find something that suits you and friends who love you for who you are.;
, It's perfectly fine to have friends and be nice with everyone but if you are ashamed of some of the things coming from their mouths maybe its time you find others that don't embarrass you to the point you could rip out all of your hair. In middle school squads are really important.

, You don't need to be trying too hard to be someone else's friend it will make you look desperate. While you're in school it's better to be yourself and have people accept you for who you are inside, even if you are loud and carefree! This might seem corny/ stupid, but I have been through middle school before. You should try to be everyone's friend and be as nice as possible (there's no point having fights just because you can) but don't try to buy the same clothes as someone thinking you're ""fitting in"". Really, you're just looking like a copy cat. If you have to change yourself to fit in with a certain group, change your circle of friends! Keep your secrets to yourself

, If you are mean to people others are intimidated and really want nothing to do with you and that's how it'll stay. You don't want yourself looking like the school bully and an awful person to be friends with. You want to be a really nice person and have both boy and girl friends.Never be the bad guy in a situation.

, If you notice someone if feeling sad, try to cheer them up because then you'll look like a nicer person and people will like you for it. if you help teachers you'll carry out a better reputation and then you'll be less likely to be blamed for any occurrence in the class.

, If you cuss just because you think its funny, its not. Actually cussing is highly unattractive and people won't want you to be at their houses in fear that their parents will hear you and then they'll get in trouble by their parents thinking they're in with the wrong crowd. If you don't usually swear, don't do it just to fit in. Some middle schools have drugs, but trust me STAY AWAY. Is being cool worth having an addiction?

, It's not about the most popular shoes, it's about what shoes you want. Individualism is hard to find in a middle school because people get made fun of for wearing things that others may not particularly like. This is why you'll see kids wearing name- brand clothes so that they'll fit in and look good. Yes, Wearing name brands are in style but are you wearing too much? Take a minute to examine your closet and see how many shirts have brand names like ""Aeropostale"" written across the front. You seem like a billboard wearing things with names written across the front as if advertising them. Try wearing things occasionally that don't have a name across it.

, No one likes a perv. So don't always pop sexual jokes out of nowhere. Don't say anything about rape or having sex with somebody, it really makes you look dumb. If you say something weird that would make someone else think you are stalking them a rumor may get spread and you may get a horrible reputation as the weirdo.

, Don't think for one minute that by having sex when you aren't ready, doing drugs, something illegal, or crude is going to make you popular because it won't. It'll really get you in serious trouble and possibly screw up your entire life. Having sex when you aren't ready(especially in school) could get you labeled as insecure or clingy and to top that off without protection you could be a mommy or daddy. And its really awful to hear a 13- 14 year- old getting pregnant, nobody would like that and it'd screw up job opportunities and other important things in life. Drugs could get you on parole and kicked out of school and really screw up your record. Try to stay clean throughout your school life, no matter how hard it can be sometimes.

Be Prepared.,
Plan your outfit.,
Go to sleep early.",How to Be a Cool Sixth Grader1," Depending on what middle school you are going to, your schedule will either be mailed to you, given to you on the last day of elementary or you will receive it upon your first day. Know when you will receive your class schedule in order to purchase your school supplies. If you receive your schedule upon your first day, some basic supplies to buy include; a pencil, pen, paper/notebook, and a eraser.;
, Whether you bought new clothes or not, the next day will be a lot easier if you have the outfit planned. Depending on your region and when you start school, dress appropriately for the weather as well as your personal comfort. Do not worry about what others may be wearing, be yourself.

, Get a good night's sleep, ranging from around 8-10 hours. The more sleep you get, the more energy you will have in the morning, which will assist you in becoming the 'cool' sixth grader you desire to be.

Eat a healthy breakfast.,
Always get your homework done right when you get home.,
Ask questions when you are confused.,
Don't overbook yourself.,
Respect others.,
Make friends!,
Don't bring phone or other electronics unless you can stay focused with it, it can distract you easily.",How to Ace Middle School," If you stay organized, you will surely have all your materials and be prepared to complete all your assignments and get a good grade. Organizing is one of the basic keys to school success, so be sure to keep your locker and everything you need, organized, though some middle schools do not have lockers.;
, If the class is boring, try your best to pay attention and find a way to stay interested in the subject.


This means taking good notes, focusing your attention on the teacher, and following directions. If you follow directions, you will succeed when you learn. If you don't follow directions, you won't learn, and won't succeed in school either.

, Studying helps you retain knowledge. If you know information from previous years, school will be easier to deal with than you might think. Review all the key points in every subject that you had, and study a little bit more for tests. Try to study for about an hour, beginning a couple nights before your test. Never cram your study time, but instead plan your studying period several days before hand. That way, you'll be prepared with less stress.

, If you can't sleep, see tips on sleeping better. Sleeping will give your mind a rest, making you energetic when school starts. Always get at least 8-10 hours of sleep during your pre-adolescent and adolescent years. Good sleep habits will help you in the long run. It's a good idea to wake up at least an hour earlier than when you have to leave for school. Most 11 year old girls need about 10 hours of sleep to look, feel and BE their best. So remember to have a nice long sleep before you go to school each day (e.g. If you have to wake up at 6 a.m., you should try to be in bed by 8 p.m.).

, Eating healthy things will improve you listening capability to the teachers and will make you ready to go. Make sure to eat protein like eggs or bacon over sugary foods. The sugar will perk you up in the short term, but you will then crash, causing it to be more difficult for you to concentrate.

, This leaves more time for fun things but also makes you more responsible.

, The teacher most likely wants to answer any questions you have about what they teach. If you are too embarrassed to ask in class, (which you shouldn't be), ask the teacher in private, such as after school. You can't learn anything if you don't understand it. Usually when they talk about something you don't understand, and you don't ask about it, it'll lower your grade when you miss those questions on the test. Teachers are there to help you learn, not intimidate you.

, It's good to be involved in sports, clubs, or other extracurriculars, but don't join so many that you are unable to do well.

, Be respectful to your peers and teachers. If you do, people will respect you more and you will likely never get in trouble. Treat others as you would like them to treat you. If you make a good impression at the beginning of the year, the teacher will believe and trust you if you are accused of something. Don't think that that means you can get out of trouble you cause though!

, It's especially important in middle school to make some really good friends. They're your support group and your lifeline in middle school. If you have good friends, they'll be able to support you all through middle school and help you to achieve your very best..

, Don't text in class, it can get you in a lot of trouble, or even get your phone taken away. Only use or have out your phone and other electronics when you have permission from a teacher to do so. Remember that it can be disrespectful to the teachers if you have it out behind their back. If you do have your phone or other electronics with you, keep it on silent. It can detract your peers from learning and interrupt the teacher's teaching if your electronic goes off in the middle of class.

Wake up early.,
Get to the stop/school.,
Find your classes and locker.,
Create positive relationships.",How to Be a Cool Sixth Grader2," Wake up one to two hours earlier than the bus arrives in order to be fully prepared. Eat a healthy breakfast and if you have time, take a quick cold shower to assist in fully waking you up.

, After you are prepared for your first day, head out five minutes early to your bus stop and/or school. This will ensure your arrival safely just in case of traffic or any other incidents that may delay your arrival.

, On the first week, the teachers won't mind if you are slightly tardy.If you can't find them, a teacher or administrator will gladly help.

, If you create good first impressions with both teachers and fellow students, then this will assist in having an easy and great year.

Find out your likes.,
Find your personality.,
Have fun!",How to Be a Cool Sixth Grader3," Being ""cool"" involves being comfortable with yourself. While others may wear other more popular brands or color their hair, you may not feel comfortable doing the same. Find what suits you, whether its flower hair bands or leather jackets, and wear it. If someone dislikes it, who cares? Only your opinion will matter in the end.

, Following with finding your preferences, finding out who you are is a major part in both middle-school all the way to college. If you are often described as intelligent, show it and participate in clubs that will help you with that description. Some examples for clubs that highlight the intelligent trait include; BETA Club, Assisting the Library, and the Chess Club.

, These are the years where you can be you. Whatever you do in school and outside of school, make sure you enjoy it no matter what others say. Celebrate the years with friends while doing crazy adventures with your family.

Become friends with people that have the same schedule as you, so, for example, if you need to get up early in the morning, someone else with be doing the same.

,
Boarding means being away from your family for long periods of time, so make a photo board or have photographs to hang up in your room so you won't be so homesick.

",How to Survive In a Boarding School," A boarding school in a poor country can be good. Try to look at the school's facilities. You may also ask for a taster weekend in the boarding house.;
, You will need them eventually. Remember you cannot go back home everyday so always bring more than enough.

, If you don't have any friends, you will have a rough school life. Living with people 24/7 is very different than just go to normal school. You will know about their personalities and you may not like all of their qualities but you must learn to accept. Nobody is perfect. If you are stubborn, you will have a bad image and others won't want to interact with you.

, Bathe every day and you may want to use deodorant. Nobody wants to share a room with someone that stinks.

, Usually schools put students of different nationalities together. You may want to know more about their culture and respect them.

, Having a bad relationship with a teacher while boarding is not good. Follow the rules even though you may think they are sometimes ridiculous, but it is to ensure you have a safe and disciplined life.

, If there is a bully in the school, tell a friend. If you can, tell one with muscles. If that fails, just tell a teacher. Boarding schools are usually good and teachers will actually bother to help you.

, But remember - it's QUALITY and not QUANTITY of friends that matters.

, This is very important or you will have a very dull life while you spend your time there. You may want to join more activities for boarders and integrate with them. It may be hard in the beginning, but when you have a few friends, you will get the happy atmosphere and eventually win more friends.

, Its easy to lose track of things you have to do without a parent around, so having extra time put aside specifically for your academic needs is very useful.

Be confident.,
Look confident.,
Be enthusiastic.,
Talk with everybody.,
Make sure people know your name.,
Be memorable.",How to Be a Cute and Smart Middle School Girl1," Talk with anybody and everybody, and yes, even do so with the adults. Speak clearly, and don't forget that the way you talk can make your reputation (""slow"", ""talkative"", ""fast"", etc.).;
, Show off your bright smile, and walk with your back straight and your chin up (but don't try too hard, you'll look stiff). Give off an essence of confident, by looking and acting the part. Don't be afraid to wear something that's your style or is different (just don't push it).

, Talk cheerfully, and be creative with your projects and assignments. Try out for the team if everybody thinks you're good enough, and run for school president if you're likable and ready for the job. Give fantastic speeches, and color code your subjects and notes. Be very bubbly and artistic.


Don't be hyper or excited all the time. Enthusiastic means being happy and ready when you need to be. This will create a bad reputation, and it just makes you seem like a child.

, Just chat up somebody whose not busy, introduce yourself to the kids sitting around you, sit down with anyone at lunch, and strike up a conversation with a new person at the end of the day. This is a good start - now about five or six people (at least) know you!

, Imagine how embarrassing it would be for them to have to claim they don't know you in front of a huge crowd? Say your name at the beginning of class, and embellish your binders and notebooks with it (just once for every item, though!) Tell them a bit about yourself, so they'll think about you (that makes the name stick). Ask them about their lives, too - it's caring.

, This is how your name will stay! Ask about them, and be understanding and kind. Tell them some interesting things about you, and compliment them on their clothing or personality if you mean it. Then, tell them goodbye and that you'll talk to them tomorrow. This is the mother of memorable keywords, and I cannot stress this enough, say it! When you say that, they'll keep you in mind. They'll know you'll be in touch.

Make it your goal to talk to at least five new people a day (but don't forget the people you first spoke with!),
Improve your relationships.,
Post, like, and comment a lot on facebook.,
Ignore gossip.",How to Be a Cute and Smart Middle School Girl2," This helps everybody know you, because they'll introduce you to their friends, and it snowballs into a big jumble of friends (which is great!).

, Speak with everybody you've met when you see them (only when they're unoccupied), and help them out (i.e. help carry their history project). When you think you have an established friendship, friend them on facebook or get their skype. Offering to put their number in your cell phone is great too. This is also perfect to let people know you're in the loop!

, Just don't overdo the statuses, or seem like a stalker (poking people a lot is really awkward sometimes). If you don't have a facebook, ask for one! If your parents have facebook promise to friend mom/dad/both. Listen to their posting/commenting rules.

, If somebody says something rude about you, just say, ""whatever, if you think so,"" without care and then walk away. You'll become less of a target. Also, the number one rule is to never spread gossip! It's lying, and you'll lose lots of friends. Just stick to being the kind kid you are.

If you have lockers and carry a lot, get a rucksack. No matter what you carry, if you don't have lockers, you will need a backpack, hands down!

, The looks can also tell your personality. Fully customize your binders, notebooks, pencil boxes, etc. Your stuff should have your style written all over it.A plain, average composition book says you're plain or weird, but a silver one with jewels screams popularity. Try getting a cute colored binder with plastic slips for the covers, and put pictures of your friends and your favorite song lyrics in the front and back slips. If your school doesn't allow you to put anything in the slips, get a wooden binder with a cute design. Get adorable notebooks, a colored ruler, and mechanical pencils (if they're allowed).


If you have a locker and your school tells you to get one binder, there's no harm in getting two! Get two binders, and spread your classes out among them. It reduces space and weight, and you have more to customize!

Socializing with upperclassmen is fantastic, because you'll get known by the older kids. People want to be friends with kids who are in with the older kids - it's a one way ticket out of bullying!

, Try to be one of the first in line, and if the teacher asks if anybody would like to introduce themselves, take the offer. People should know about you - your name, age, what you like. Introduce yourself to the people around you.

, Just take a seat and greet them. Tell them your name. If they engage a discussion, as them what they're into, and then tell them a little about you. Hopefully they'll be a little more chatty by then!

, Make sure they know your name, because you want everyone to! When you have to leave, say goodbye and you hope you can talk with them tomorrow. It makes people know you care about them, and that you enjoy their company. Compliment everybody you meet on their top, pants, shoes, jacket, outfit, necklace, etc. if you mean it. It makes people feel liked.

Talk to more and more people, and improve your relationships with the people you've already spoken with.,
Raise your hand if you know the answer in class, but don't volunteer too much.,
NEVER gossip.,
Learn the difference between snitching and reporting.",How to Be in Charge of Your School Without Being a Snob4," Once you feel you're close enough to this person, offer them your Skype, cell phone number, or friend them on Facebook. You need to stay connected, and having a phone, Skype, and/or Facebook lets people know you're in the loop.

, Don't be a teacher's pet!

, You want to have good relationships with people! Don't be a bystander, and stop gossip and bullying. Step in if somebody's getting hurt physically or verbally. If you can't do it yourself, get an adult.

, Snitching is when you try to get people in trouble. Reporting is when you need to. You're not reporting if somebody's just using a pen when they shouldn't, that's snitching.

Get Good Grades.,
Make Sure You Are Prepared to Take the SSAT.,
Do Extracurricular activities: A majority of the applicants will have nearly perfect grades and SSAT scores, so you need to find something to set you apart.,
Track your Achievements: Keep a detailed list of awards that you have won in the past couple of years.,
Provide Community Service: It's important to show that you help other people in the community also.,
Write good Essays on the Applications: Spend lots of time on the essays!,
Interview: If you interview as part of your application, make sure you practice answering questions that might be asked.",How to Get Into a Boarding School," It's important to get good grades all through middle school, many of the top boarding schools (tenschools.org) require straight-A's (or very close to it).;
, If your SSAT scores aren't great, it will really hurt you. Most schools expect you to have pretty good scores and if yours aren't, they might not even read the rest of your application. To make sure you are prepared, purchase a SSAT book at the bookstore or online and take practice tests. If you aren't satisfied with your scores on the practice tests, figure out which problems were tough and make sure you understand why you missed them and have somebody, like parents or older siblings, help explain them to you.

, Your extracurricular activities could include sports, clubs, teams, etc.

, Some schools ask for these on the application and if you have been keeping a list for the last couple of years, it makes it easier when you need to show them. Remember to include why you won it and the specifics.

, For your community service, you don't have to do something clichéd like working at the local soup kitchen. Instead, it will help you more to have done community service like teaching soccer to the local kids for free (if soccer is one of your strong points) or if you are really into science, then maybe set up a science fair for the local elementary school.

, Think carefully about the topics that are being asked, and come up with answers that highlight your skills or some of your other traits that you want to make sure that the admissions officers see. In your essays it can be a great chance for your to talk about some things that they didn't ask for on other parts of the application. For example, you might want to talk about a hike that you spent a year training for but you couldn't include it in extracurricular activities. Another tricky part of the application can be if they ask you about your biggest flaw or something of the sort. Rather than actually talk about your problematic areas, find something that will seem like flaw but really emphasizes some of your better qualities. For example, Sometimes I try to do to many activities. This can be viewed as a problem, but it also shows that you like trying new things and being involved.

, Some common questions are books you read recently, favorite subject, why you want to go to boarding school, what do you see yourself doing in 20 years, etc. It is also important to dress nicely, look your interviewer in the eye, introduce yourself, and make sure to thank them afterward.

Think twice before taking any step.,
Consider certain questions before deciding anything.,
Get your answers and assess further.,
Recognize your teen's needs properly.",How to Choose the Best Boarding School for a Troubled Teen," Decide if it's really important for the teen or is whether you're just experiencing a knee-jerk reaction? If it is the latter, then, think calmly. You might just be overreacting. However, if you think that your child is slipping out of your hands, then boarding school might be a sensible solution.
, You must be well aware as to whether or not you are placing your kids in the right hands. Ask yourself the following questions and investigate appropriately:

What is the basic information about the school and the number of years it has been operating for?
How do they manage teenagers and what techniques they use to bring them back on track?
What kind of academics do they provide and how will these nurture your child’s future?
What kind of security measures are taken at the hostel where your child will stay?

, Appropriate and suitable answers to all these questions are very important for you to know in order to help you to decide whether the boarding school that you are choosing for your kid is right or not. It is also very important for you to know the options before you choose one of them.

There are several boarding high schools which provide high end education but the need of every student differs from one to another.
It would also be wrong to say that boarding schools are ideal for troubled teens. There are a lot of other students who go to boarding schools to excel in their studies and disruptive students may not be welcome in such establishments, so be sure to make it clear what you are looking for, to see whether the school is responsive to this.

, A teenager who has lost his own track of life may benefit from a school which can bring him or her back and teach him or her a disciplined life with the knowledge of what is right and wrong. As a parent, it is completely your responsibility to ensure that your child goes to the best boarding school. You should not only take into account the current scenario but also the future scope once they graduate."

First find out if your school offers the option to take online classes, or if they will allow you to enroll in an online class concurrently through the local community college.,
Find out if you meet your school's criteria for taking online classes.,
Find out if the classes you need for your graduation requirements are available online.,
Make sure that the college you are planning to attend accepts credits from online classes or check with your high school to see if they notate anything on your transcript that indicates the difference between online and on ground classes.,
Once you have determined that online classes are the way to go, find out what the enrollment dates are and get enrolled before the deadline.,
On the first day of class, log in and read the announcements.,
Throughout the course, make sure you read the announcements regularly.,
Don't miss due dates.,
Don't wait until the last minute.",How to Take Online Classes to Raise GPA," There is a big difference between online classes that are run through a program specifically for a high school and one for colleges. There is more work involved in a college based program, and you are expected to manage your time like an adult. For that effort, you will get 6 quality points in your grade point average instead of 4 though in most cases.;
, In many schools it is considered a privilege, not a right to take online classes, as schools have to pay by the student for the classes so they want to be sure they are only paying for those who have the highest chance for success. Speaking of paying for the class, if you go to a private school, you may have additional class fees for online classes, so be sure to ask about that, too.

, Some online programs, for example don't offer core classes online, but they offer some electives.

, Most colleges have moved into the 21st century, but the last thing you want is to find out that the only thing that will keep you from your dream school is some antiquated policy.

, This doesn't vary from any other type of class. There may be more spaces available, but there will still be a limit.

, There will likely be an enrollment verification that you need to complete and a deadline by which it needs to be done. High school classes may be somewhat flexible, but college classes will likely drop you from the class if you miss the deadline.


The first assignment will likely be something simple like introducing yourself on a discussion board or taking a quiz to show that you understand the rules and policies of the course.

, This is the only way your teacher has to communicate with the class. Your teachers in your classrooms stand up in front of the class every day. Your online teacher uses the announcement forums. You must read them.


You also have to read the assignment postings and the syllabus. In a traditional class you might be able to get away with filing your syllabus in the round metal cabinet at the end of the teachers desk on your way out of the room, but you can't do that with an online class. Your teacher isn't there in front of you every day to remind you when your work is due. You have to read the announcements, the assignment postings, and the syllabus.

, In college classes if you miss a due date, you will likely get a 0. A lenient teacher might give you 10 points off for every day it's late. People tend to make the mistake of thinking an online class is a work at your own pace class. It isn't. It is a flexible schedule class to some degree, but there are assignments and there are due dates and more so than any other type of class, you have to manage your time effectively.

, If it can go wrong it will. Technology fails. Power goes out. Computers crash. The proverbial dog will eat your proverbial homework and your proverbial teach won't give a proverbial -- you get the point. If you wait until the last minute, you will end up missing something. It's never a good idea, and with an online class, it is a terrible idea. Just don't do it.

Avoid skipping the freshman orientation.,
Make friends before school starts.,
Get friendly with upperclassmen.,
Get to know your school's map.,
Get everything you need.,
Be aware of your school's dress code.",How to Survive Your Freshman Year in High School1," This event is usually something your school will hold towards the end of summer, although they may hold it earlier. Not only will it make you more comfortable in your new school environment, and help get you used to a few teachers, but you can also use orientation as a social opportunity. That's right -- instead of hanging out with your mom, you can go out of your way to meet a few new people, and to hang out with your old friends.


Look sharp. Wear your normal clothes, but make sure to put some effort into your appearance and hygiene. You only get to make one first impression.;
, If you're lucky enough to already know a bunch of people going to your high school, then great. Then you can talk to your friends in advance, ask about their schedules, and see who can sit with you at lunch. You can also be bold; make friends with kids at your swim club, at the mall, or from your summer soccer league. You'll feel much more comfortable in school if you do.


If you're the new kid, don't worry. You won't be the only one.

, Another great leg-up in high school is if you know any older kids at the school. If you have an older sibling that you actually like who will look out for you, a neighbor, or even a friend of the family who goes to the high school, this person can be a great help to you, along with being your friend. Upperclassmen can help you figure out the following things:


How to act around certain teachers
Which people to avoid
The low-down on the clubs or sports you're interested in
The game plans for acing certain classes

, This may sound a little dorky, but don't underestimate how much more comfortable you'll feel at your new school if you actually know where you're going on the first day. Not only should you pay attention in orientation, but you should grab a map of the school if you can, so you can begin to figure out the best way to move from class to class. Figuring out how to make those precious 3-4 minutes during passing period count can help you eliminate stress and get to class on time.

, Before the first day of school, you should be prepared with everything you need so you don't have to scramble on the first day. You should have a copy of your schedule if you already have one, all of your books, binders, notebooks, and school supplies, and a change of gym clothes if you have to take gym. Don't be that guy who forgot his gym clothes on the first day or the girl who had to borrow a pencil in every class.

, Some schools have stricter dress codes than others; that is to say, some schools will have teachers that flag you down, send you to the nurse's office, and make you go home if you don't have a change of clothes -- or worse, make you change into your gym clothes. If you have a required uniform, then make sure you wear it appropriately, but if not, look out for the following:


Short shorts. Many schools say your shorts have to be longer than your fingertips. Girls, after you put on your shorts, stand up with your hands at your sides to see if you pass the test.
Displaying your undergarments. Girls, avoid showing your bra straps, and guys, avoid sagging your pants and revealing your boxers. Most schools have a code against this and well, it just ain't classy.
Offensive logos. Don't wear t-shirts with offensive language or offensive references. These could even get you suspended, in the worst cases.

"
"
Be especially outgoing at first.,
Try out different social groups.,
Avoid dating for a while.,
Attend your school's social events.,
Find one friend in each class.,
Find your lunch table.,
Don't obsess over your image.",How to Survive Your Freshman Year in High School2," Though freshmen in high school aren't quite as outgoing as freshmen on a college campus, you should still try your hardest to be friendly before people fall into their normal social circles and are less open to meeting someone new. So, say hi to the girl in your French class, be friendly with your new lab partner, and get to know the people in your home room -- you may be sitting next to them for the next four years, after all.


Get to know the people in your gym class. You may not run in to some of them academically.
Make new friends with people who sit at your lunch table.

, Though you may be worried about finding the place and group where you really fit in right away, you should explore your options as much as you can. There will be the popular kids, the nerds, the cool nerds, the jocks, the stoners, and all of the other groups you may come to expect -- but you don't have to neatly fit into one category. Don't jump to conclusions and get to know as many people as you can first.


Though many people do remain friends with the same social group throughout high school, social dynamics and circumstances do change. If you find that your new social group isn't the right fit for you after a few months but made no effort to get to know anyone else, then you'll be out of luck.
Being as involved as you can in a variety of clubs and sports can help you broaden your horizons and meet as many people as possible.
Though it's important to be open-minded, try avoiding the kind of people who will get you into trouble by making you smoke, cut class, or cheat on tests.

, Though you may have met your dream lover in your first period physical science class, it's wiser to hold off before you start sending the kid any love notes. If you get wrapped up in a high school relationship right away, you won't have time to branch out, make friends, and figure out what actually makes you happy. Also, let's face it: 98% of high school relationships don't last, so you could put yourself in an awkward situation when you break up and all you have are mutual friends.

, Though you may think you're too cool to go to the school dance or the Homecoming game, you should definitely make an appearance to make some new friends and for people to know who the heck you are. The drama kids may not go to a football game and the jocks may not go to the school play, but if you go to both, you'll be meeting more people and realizing that high school can actually have a lot to offer.


You don't have to go to everything. But in the first few months, make a point of going to as many events as you can before you get a sense of what you really like.

, Just knowing one person in each class will make you feel much less adrift. On the first or second day of school, say hi to a person sitting next to you and strike up a conversation. This person will remember you, and maybe even walk with you to your next class. And when it comes time to do a group project, you already have someone to work with.


And if you find at least one friend, that friend could help you get to know more people.
The friend in your class could also serve as academic support and can serve as a contact person if you missed class or have any questions.

, Your lunch table doesn't have to be set in stone on the first day of school -- not at most schools, anyway. Still, you should figure out this part of your social situation as early as you can. If you know some people who are in your lunch from comparing schedules before school or earlier in the day, then great. Make a plan to meet up and find a table together. And if not, then be friendly, get there early enough to find a seat, and try to find friendly, accepting people to sit with you.


You can also try asking people you meet earlier in the day where they're sitting.
Don't be too shy to ask someone who looks nice and cool if you can sit with him. It's better than getting stuck with people you don't like.

, This may sound like it's nearly impossible during your first year of high school, but you should remember that everyone is obsessing over what people think, over how popular they are, over how they look in their new pair of shoes, and so on. Remember that everyone is feeling just as insecure and uncertain as you are, and be one step of the pack by understanding that none of it matters.


Don't spend more time staring in the mirror than you spend reading a textbook.
Though looking nice will make you feel good about yourself, spending all of your time obsessing over new clothes will not.
Even if you're not feeling confident, you can look confident. Walk with your head high and look straight ahead, instead of crossing your arms and slouching.

"
Be respectful to your teachers.,
Have a solid tailor-made study plan.,
Do your homework.,
Participate in class.,
Start thinking about college -- but not too much.,
Avoid the ""everything folder"" at all costs.,
Get organized.,
Hang out with some smart people.,
Don't be too cool to be smart.",How to Survive Your Freshman Year in High School3," You may think that it's cool and funny to be mean to your chemistry teacher, but when your midterm grade rolls around and your C+ was not rounded to a B-, you'll have another thing coming. Though you won't love all of your teachers, it greatly benefits you to be polite to them, show up to their classes on time and at least act interested in course material. Sleeping in class is highly unadvised.


When you apply to college, you'll need several teacher recommendations, so it's better to start building your relationships early.

, If you want to succeed in your first year of high school, then you have to know which habits do and don't work well for you when it comes time to study for the big exam. Do you study best during your free periods, right after school, or at night, before you go to bed? Do you like listening to music or snacking while you study, or do you prefer nothing more than silence and a cup of tea? Find a routine that works for you early on and stick to it.


If you work better in groups, then find a study group made up of academically-minded young people so you can motivate each other. Do this only if you think you can really get work done this way.
Become a master note-taker. Taking notes in class will help you study when exam time comes.
And, obviously, avoid all nighters. You will feel panicked and horrible, and too exhausted to do well on the day of the big test. Block out time to study at least several days in advance before a big test.
Try to review a little each day. It's hard to get yourself to review for half an hour two or three weeks before a test...but imagine cramming that many hours the night before. Plus, you'll retain the information much better.

, This should be obvious, but it isn't. Don't do your homework on the bus on the morning of school, or in homeroom, either. Take the time to diligently do your homework right after school, in study hall, or when you get home after extra-curricular activities. Make sure that you really get it done instead of just doing the bare minimum and forgetting key information. Plus, this practice will help you to study for the test.


Also, if you're struggling with your homework, don't be embarrassed to get extra help after school.

, Participating in class will not only keep you from falling asleep in class and will make your teacher love you, but it will also make you more excited about the material you're learning, and more excited to come to class. You don't have to answer every question your teacher asks or offer insights every five seconds, but you should speak up from time to time so your teacher sees that you know your stuff.


Participating will also make you do better on tests. If you're more engaged with the material, then you'll understand it better.

, Though you shouldn't feel pressured to make a list of your top ten dream colleges during your freshman year, you should have an idea of what kind of college you'll be applying to, or at least a sense of how competitive it is. In general, to apply to a four-year university, you'll need to demonstrate a record of academic success, foreign language credits, 2-3 teacher recommendations, a personal essay, and participation in outside activities, from team sports to volunteer organizations.


If you start joining clubs and sports during your freshman year, you'll have time to develop your skills and find a leadership position by your junior or senior year.
If you haven't done anything outside of school until your junior year, and you're suddenly joining 5,000 clubs, colleges will be suspicious.
You can think about college, but don't obsess over it. One grade will not affect your admission to college, and you'll still have a lot of school left.
If there IS a college you know you want to go to, research for their course requirements to get a brief idea of what credits you need. Better to get those out of the way rather than cramming them all in one year.

, You know that folder from the eighth grade, where you just shoved all of your papers from every subject? You know, the one that tore in half by the end of the year, the one that you lost under your bed for a week that made you fail two tests? Yeah, that's amateur hour. It's time to step up your game.

, The everything folder won't fly in high school, so make sure you have binders for every subject (or divide a binder for two classes), multiple notebooks, and folders for every class. Label each folder carefully, and go through your things at the end of every day to make sure that you haven't misplaced any papers.


Part of being organized is having an organized locker. Make sure your books are neatly stacked in it, not sloppily thrown in.
Have a planner. This will help you know in advance when you'll have a busy week and to plan ahead for tests and other events. Some schools also provide you with a planner, so if your school gives you one, be sure to use it.
If a teacher has a specific request for a binder, folder or notebook, then make sure that you get whatever organizational method they request, and use it for at least the first few months of the school year. If you find that the method they're having you use isn't working, then talk to them and see if they will let you use a different method for their class.

, That's right. Don't just hang out with the people who think ""IQ"" is the second cousin of ET. Though your friends don't have to be Einsteins-in-training, it'll be nice to have some motivated, intelligent people in your social circle. They can help you study, give you homework tips, and help you handle the stress of a full work load.


And hey, being friends with smarter people will also make you a smarter person. And who doesn't want that?

, Seriously. This is something you will regret for the rest of your life. Sure, you might end up being cool in high school, but what about when it comes time to apply to college and you can't even spell your name correctly on the SAT? Though your social life is important, don't forget that your academic life is just as important -- and maybe even more so, since it can set the tone for the rest of your life.


Don't hide your intelligence just because you think people will like you more if you're clueless. That's just not true anymore. Plus, even if it were, the right people will like you regardless of if you're in honors and racking up good grades.

Join a club or two.,
Try a sport.,
Don't be a jerk to your parents.,
Don't have sex until you're ready.",How to Survive Your Freshman Year in High School4," Find something that you really care about and join a club that can help you explore your interests. There will be dozens of clubs to choose from, such as newspaper, yearbook, poetry, French and Spanish, ski club, and so on. Picking one or two clubs that you can really focus on and devote your time to is better than picking five or six just so you can put them on your résumé. Clubs will not only make you a more well-rounded person, but you can meet some great friends at them along the way.


It's okay to start off with five or six clubs -- you can see which ones you like the most and drop the rest.
Check out Key Club, the volunteering club at most high schools.
Remember that not all clubs are created equal. Yearbook, for example, can take up much more of your free time than other clubs that only meet once or twice a month, so make sure you don't get overwhelmed.
Make it something you're genuinely interested in, not just something that you think will make you ""look cool"". If you have no interest in anime yet join the Anime Society, that's an hour or so spent on something you could be enjoying!

, If you're completely not an athletic person, then don't worry about joining a sport. But if there are a few sports you already play or which you'd like to try, then join a sport. Not only will you make new friends, but you'll be staying healthy and developing a stable routine -- studies show that student athletes actually get higher grades than non-athletes.


Just remember that a sport is a big commitment, much bigger than the commitment required by many clubs. If you're doing a sport, or especially if you're doing three sports year-round (one for every season), then don't bite off more than you can chew by also joining five clubs.

, Though you may not exactly be best friends with Mom and Dad during your freshman year of high school, you should treat your parents like your friends, not your enemies. After all, they cook for you, they give you rides, and they probably give you some of the spending money you need to go to the mall with your buddies. So don't look back on your life and regret being mean to your parents just because you were moody or because your crush rejects you.


Having your parents on your side will make your high school experience much better than having them against you.

, Though many high school freshmen haven't even had their first kiss yet, it's true that a number of high school freshman have lost their virginity. You should really not have sex until you're ready and committed to a person you really love, not just a guy you met when you accidentally drank too much. That is to say, don't have sex until you're comfortable with yourself and the person, unless you're sober, or just to give in to outside pressure. If you do have sex make sure to use protection (condoms, etc).


If you're dating a guy who is trying to convince you to sleep with him, then he's not the right guy for you.
Do not have sex until you are of the legal age of consent, which varies depending on where you live.

See if your school has a packing list.,
Find out what will be provided.,
Make a list.,
Gather your items all in one convenient place.,
Pack!,
Coordinate with your roommate.",How to Pack for Boarding School in Another Country," It's okay if they don't, but check just in case.;
, Most boarding schools provide beds and desks, but it is good to check just in case you need to get furniture. If you do need to bring furniture, it is wise and cheaper if you're going by plane to just buy once you arrive. Carrying furniture via airplane can be expensive and hauling furniture in a crowded car can be a hassle, so check before panicking.

, Think about what you want to bring: your favorite stuffed animal, something from home, posters, clothes, etc.

, Check to make sure you have everything on the list. Don't forget anything, especially clothes!

, Try to keep your load somewhat small. Try to keep it below 5 large bags if possible.

, If you have a roommate, be sure to get along with them and share your ideas while decorating your room. You can sit down at a desk with a notebook and discuss each others ideas, and at the end you will find a design you both like for your room."

Write down anything that you have questions about regarding your school.,
Attend orientation.,
Talk to people during your orientation.,
Make sure you know where your classes and your locker are.,
Talk to someone who has already gone through high school.,
Talk to your friends about your worries about the first day.",How to Survive the First Day of High School Without Being Nervous (for Girls)1," Most high schools have orientation sessions the week before school starts that introduce new students to the school. Before you attend the orientation, you want to make sure that you know what you have questions about so you can ask them at your orientation if necessary.For instance, you could have questions about how long the break is between classes, or if you need to bring in your summer reading books on the first day.;
, Even if your high school is in the same building as your middle school was in, it’s still incredibly valuable to go to the orientation so you have a better idea of what to expect the first day.

Remember that school should always come first.",How to Survive Ninth Grade (for Girls)," Most schools will send you a list of supplies to buy, but some won't. Some schools want you to wait to get your supplies til after school starts because they want your teachers to tell you what to get for their class. If that is the case, get your basic necessities. Pens, pencils, notebooks, loose leaf, etc.;
, Clothes help define who you are. They are a way to express yourself. When you are getting back to school clothes, get what you feel comfortable in. High School can present the image of having to look cool and wearing expensive clothes. Dress how you want. Check the paper and the internet for deals at your favorite stores. Find out if there is any teen consignment shops in your area. You can bring in your old clothes for money and get new clothes! Don't be afraid of anyone making fun of how you express yourself, wear what makes you happy and comfortable.

, High Schools are big, no doubt about it. Gather up your friends and find all of your classes a few days before school starts. Chances are the school will be open since teachers are getting ready for the new year. Walk around the school and walk your daily route around the building. If your new teachers are in their classrooms, go say hi. You will feel more comfortable on the first day. If you know your locker and combo, go try it out. You don't want to stand in the hallway feeling silly because you cannot open your locker.

, Find a group of people who you are comfortable being yourself with. Organize study groups, mall sessions, and sleepovers. Don't forget about your friends from middle school, though!


Don't worry about being popular. In the end, it's not that great. Be social and go with the flow. Find the group that fits who you are. Be nice to people. A hello and smile can go a long way.

, They have been there longer than you have and know more than you do about the school. Don't act cocky or like a show off. Remember that upperclassmen can also be great friends. If your locker is stuck or you get lost, ask an upperclassmen who looks friendly for help.

, High School is wrongly depicted in movies. There aren't crazy parties every weekends, drama isn't around every corner, and you actually have homework, tests, and projects.

, If someone spread a rumor about you would be upset. Don't do it to others. Just don't be a bully. Nothing is worse than people thinking you're a jerk. A bully is just some big, beefy, guy who smells bad. They can be anyone. If you are being harassed, don't be afraid to tell a teacher. Some things you have to get over, but if it is consistent, get help. You aren't being a snitch or a tattletale.

, A small travel size makeup bag is great for personal stuff. Keep tampons, pads, deodorant, makeup, and few dollars in there. Make sure the bag isn't see through though. Unfortunately there will be the immature guys in high school who will think tampons and pads are funny.

, Dating is an exciting part of High School, but don't let it take over your schoolwork. The majority of freshman boys are going to be immature. Girls mature faster than guys. Don't ever dumb yourself down for a boy. If you have to be stupid for him to like you, he's not worth it. Be yourself. Don't change your style for a guy. If you want a guy just do this. Look nice and be nice. Shower daily, be hygienic, and be friendly. Some people think you have to wear makeup to be pretty. If you don't want to wear makeup you don't have to. Take your time with guys. Miracles don't happen overnight. Also, do not get involved with high school seniors, if a senior flirts with you or asks you out just reject them. While girls usually tend to be more mature than the boys in their grade, a whole three years difference in maturity is problematic. Remember if you do get involved in a relationship that you have every right to say no to something that makes you uncomfortable and you should not feel pressured into doing anything you don't want to.

, You are in High School to learn. Be nice to the teachers and staff. Don't slack off then expect extra help after class. Don't smart off to the teachers either. Teachers talk about students to other teachers. Word about annoying students gets around quick. Teachers have the right to call home to your parents if your acting up. Do your homework and study. Missing one assignment can hurt your grade drastically so you have to really care about your grades, just don't let them define you. Have a work space at home to do all of your school stuff, and make sure any distracting electronics are out of sight; stay focused. DO NOT wait for the last minute to do any projects or other homework.

",How to Survive Your First Week As a Freshman," Ask your parents, siblings, or friends who have already started high school how their first week was and if there is anything they would have re-done. Go to all orientation opportunities that your school offers and make sure you take a tour. Get a school map and study it. When you get your schedule, highlight the best routes on your map to all of your classes. Talk to friends who are also going into high school this year about how you are feeling so that you know you're not the only one.;
, About a week before school, make sure you have all the school supplies you need. Most schools won't tell you what you need until the actual first day but you'll probably need a backpack, a binder, pens and pencils, and a notebook for each of your classes.

, You'll want to stay under the radar as a freshman, and hope that nobody will know you are one. This is easy if you wear things that are in style, because there's nothing that screams freshman more than someone who dresses like a sixth grader. Of course, always dress in what makes you feel good!

, Make sure all of your school supplies are in your backpack, and lay out your outfit for the next day. Try to relax that night and try not to worry too much about the next day, because if you follow this guide everything will be okay for you. Go to bed about an hour or half an hour earlier than you usually would to allow some chill time in bed if you can't fall asleep.

, A good amount of time is usually two hours. Shower, do your hair and makeup, get dressed, make sure everything is packed. If you can, try to get a parent to drive you to school on the first day, it will relieve added stress that a bus might cause, especially if you have never ridden the bus to school before.

, Locate your locker and your first class. You don't have to go inside and sit down yet, try taking a quick walk around campus to see if any of your friends or people you know are there yet, or maybe try to make some new friends. It's easier to survive high school if you have friends!

, Walk with your head up and if you happen to make eye contact with anyone while walking down the hall, smile at them. When talking to new people make sure to make eye contact and speak up.

, Make sure to bring a lunch on the first day and don't buy one, it'll make your life easier. Make plans with friends ahead of time to sit at a certain lunch table if possible.

You should look at the types of teachers and their accessibility to students, the variety of classes and how they fit with your goals for the future, the social climate, the class sizes, etc.


For example, if you intend to apply to prestigious colleges, it might be a good idea to choose a school based on their academic reputation, the number of teachers who hold advanced degrees (Master's degrees and PhDs), the success rate of their college preparation courses, etc.;
, If you are a person who needs more one-on-one instruction to learn effectively, then you should look for a high school with smaller class sizes.

, Pick classes that fit your abilities and your goals. If you are aiming for college acceptance, take the college preparation classes that your school offers. If you are looking at getting a job right out of high school, you might look into some vocational programs available at your school to help you gain the skills you'll need when you graduate.

, Your academic responsibilities will be much greater in high school compared to what you've experienced before. It may be helpful to get a planner or journal of some sort to help you keep track of all of your homework and activities.

, You need to stay on top of your due dates and complete your assignments on time.


Try coming up with an organizational system that helps you keep track of when things are due so that you can accomplish one thing at a time instead of being overwhelmed by the quantity of work.

, Get all of the supplies you'll need for your first day of classes. This includes things like notebooks and pens, but you'll also need to make sure you have your locker number and your class schedule.

, If your school has an orientation or registration night, go to it! This will help you figure out where everything is located so you know where you're going on the first day.


Going to orientation will also give you an opportunity to check out other things, like how big your locker is, where the bathrooms are located, etc. You don't want to bring a backpack to school that won't fit inside your locker!

, Everyone will be nervous on the first day, so you're not alone in that. Try to be a little outgoing so that you can bond with your classmates. Remember, this is a new experience for everyone!


Pick out an outfit for the first day of class that makes you feel the most comfortable and confident.

, In high school, there are many different groups of people. Some of these groups are defined by how the members dress, some by religious belief, some by talent or skill. One of the easiest ways to make friends quickly in high school is to figure out what community you belong in and start participating with the other members.


If you're a smart kid, make friends in your advanced classes. If you're an athlete, make friends with your teammates. If you're very religious, find out if people from your church attend your school. Finding like-minded people means that they will have similar priorities to you, so you can engage in similar activities together (doing homework, practicing your sport, going to church, etc.).
Of course, this doesn't mean that you should exclude people outside of your immediate clique. This is just an easy way to quickly make friends when you first enter high school.

, Playing a sport or participating in other activities is a great way to make friends and feel like you're part of something special. Think about your personal strengths and choose an activity that fits with those.


You could try out for the football team or enroll in band or chorale. In these types of activities, you spend a lot of time with your teammates, bandmates, etc. This basically gives you an immediate group of friends to feel comfortable with. They often take trips together (to out of town games, to music competitions, etc.), so there is a lot of quick bonding between group members.

, Most schools have clubs that cater to various students' interests. There are acting clubs, woodworking clubs, student councils, environmental clubs, and many others. These activities look great on resumes and college applications and are a great way to build relationships with other students.


However, don't try to do too many extracurricular activities as it is still important to focus on your studies., Go to some Friday night football games or buy a dress and attend your school's prom. Being around other students and participating in the same activities will help build a sense of camaraderie between you and your classmates.

, High school is the time when many people have their first serious relationship, lose their virginity, or at least have their first real crush. Dealing with these situations can be very exciting, but sometimes feelings can get hurt as well.


Make sure you choose good people to share these experiences with. Don't waste your time on someone who doesn't care about your feelings because they will only hurt you. Picking someone to date who shares the same goals and values as you will lead to more overall happiness.
Having a good group of friends to lean on during these experiences is crucial. Talking through the details of interactions with your crush or sharing the differences of what your first kiss was like is an important part of becoming an adult.
Practice safe sex to avoid diseases and unwanted pregnancies., The easiest way to do this is to simply be kind to those around you.If one of your friends tries to start a fight with you or spreads a mean rumor about you around the school, they are probably just deflecting negative emotions about themselves onto others to make themselves feel better. Responding to this negative behavior only makes it worse. So, try to ignore the gossip, don't engage in arguments with them, and things will eventually get better. You can't control other people's behavior; you can only control how you respond to it.

, Bullies are people who make other people feel small in order to make themselves feel better. They often push other kids around, take their things, or call them names.The best thing to do when you see someone getting bullied is to report it to a teacher or principal and to avoid the bully personally.
If you are getting bullied, you should stick up for yourself in the moment, but don't take it too far. Avoid fighting or making a scene.

, High school can be a very difficult time for both teens and their families. High school students are entering puberty and are, as a result, filled with hormones that they have to get used to handling. Everything seems like a big deal and they are just learning how to deal with these new feelings.


If you find yourself fighting with your parents a lot, try to take a step back and ask yourself how much the thing you're fighting about really matters.
If it's not an emergency, try to cut your parents a little slack and they'll probably be more willing to help you if you're not yelling so much. Try talking to them about what's bothering you instead of pushing them away with arguments.

, Get a planner, organize your notebooks by subject, take detailed notes in class, don't miss a practice or rehearsal or club meeting. Keep track of your activities and your homework so that you don't get too far behind.

, Your teachers are a valuable resource to you that all too few students utilize. Spend some time after class asking your teacher questions about the assignment. They will remember this extra effort on your part and will keep that in mind when assigning grades.

, School counselors and administrators can help with a wide variety of problems, so it is good to familiarize yourself with them and to introduce yourself to them.

, Anyone in a position of authority at your school can help you if you are having problems. Ask the principal, teacher, another student, or any other adult you see. Everyone will be glad to help you, whether it's with an issue at home, about another student bullying you, or even if you are simply having trouble in one of your classes.

Think about how more in-depth your favourite lessons will now be, and think of all the better alternative friends you'll make besides your old friends. Think about how you no longer need to worry about seeing the teachers and pupils you hated in Primary.;
, You could end up with many new friends. Don't be too needy and talk to every group of people but also don't be picky and be full of yourself, don't judge your classmates, be friends with them and then you'll see the better side of them which you want to hang around with.

, If there are not many old friends at your new school, don't fret, just keep trying to make new friends and you'll do fine at secondary school, and you will survive it with friends beside you.

, Other students will just think you are a horrible person, and won't give you any respect. You might even get bullied yourself. Bullying is just wrong, it what causes you to have no friends, get along with everyone and don't sink to a bully's level, if a classmate is rude to you, walk away, and try to be friends with another more kind classmate who will most likely end up with friends, unlike bullies.

, Even if the answer is wrong, it is alright! You might even understand the topic better if you try. In fact, getting the answer wrong can sometimes be amusing, but still, don't do it on purpose as it will just make you look silly.

, Don't be dependent on people and hook to one person, as sometimes they will find it annoying, don't do annoying things that will put people off from being around you, alternate between formal and casual.

, It's a great way to make new friends and have something fun to do after school!

, That might sound like a total bore, but at least you'll have the whole evening to do whatever you want! This will help you survive, as you won't have all your teachers catching up and picking on you for not doing your homework.

, It will just make you feel even more sad and scared. If you do argue, apologize and let it blow over. If you are worried, speak to a teacher, a parent, etc. and they can help with your problems.

, It takes time to form a social group among your friends. It takes time to make friends, about a month in you should have a few friends, but you'll notice as you form into half-term and then into the next year group, you will gain more and more connections, with both younger and older students.

, Just do the best you can in all subjects and you'll get along just fine. A school night may make you feel like not going to school tomorrow but once you're in the building, you'll feel there's no need to be scared and no reason not to come in the mornings. Just do what the government asks, get a good amount of information in your brain, and before you know it you would have finished your GCSEs and rocket into College, which is a whole other, better, story.

Never discount the importance of the first day.,
Get those cute school supplies and the right ones.,
Watch your appearance.,
Keep breath mints or Listerine breath strips in your bag.,
Be aware of cliques and their place, but don't place too much value in them.,
Watch your grades.,
Boys, yes, boys.,
Avoid the drama.",How to Survive in an All Girls High School," First impressions are everything. First day of school is extremely important, especially in single-sex schools. You're going to be spending a lot of time with these girls, and everyone knows how catty some females can be. Unlike middle school or kindergarten, it won't be as easy to find friends. Before, you might have been used to people going up to you and asking you if you want to be friends. Not anymore. If you wait for people to come, the results are not a lot of people will feel gravitated to you. People want to know other people who aren't afraid to say ""Hi,"" or introduce themselves. While it's important not to be mean or antisocial, don't be fake. If you aren't the girl who wants to be everyones friend, or you aren't very excited, don't pretend you are because it will attract people who aren't like you and don't get you.;
, Cute school supplies always help (and having the right ones). Since you're most likely going to go to a private school if it's single sex, and since there's most likely going to be uniform, you probably won't have the opportunity to express yourself. School supplies say a lot about you. If yours are colorful and fun that sends a subtle message to other people that you are colorful and fun. They also make a good ice-breaker since odds are, people will ask you where you got them. Printed folders, colorful binders and erasers are easy to find. Specially-shaped pencils with different patterns can also be purchased anywhere. Make sure you are organized. There's no point in having a stapler shaped like a Scottie dog if you can't find it to staple your homework with.

, Uniform. Make sure you are always neat-looking. That is also important. Shower or bathe every day and keep a comb or brush in your bag at all times. If there is lint on your sweatshirt or sweater, and you don't have a lint-roller, use duct tape. Keep your uniform in a separate drawer so you always know where it is. If your uniform requires you to wear a skirt, I suggest you wear gym shorts underneath. It's no fun going up stairs and seeing someone else's undies. If your school dress code isn't as strict, subtly add an accessory to your everyday outfit. Retro bangles, mod watches, and printed scarves are good ones.

, This will also give you an opportunity to share and be the ""generous"" one (not too generous though, people will get used to free-loading off of you).

, Popularity. Yes. Everyone is familiar with the cliques and so on. Everyone probably has wanted to be in one, or already is in one. Don't let that distract you. Although this is extremely cliche-sounding, if you have a sense of humor and you're not the back-stabbing type, you'll do fine. People want to be with the trendy girl as much as they want to be with the funny reliable one.

, Grades. Although it might be your freshman year, You cannot slack off. Grades are just as important in your freshman year as they are in your senior year. If you get used to laying-back, once things start to get rough, you'll end up being left behind. Keep all of your homework for each subject in separate folders or dividers. Label them clearly with the subject, your name, and your homeroom. Study before each test. Some of you may learn better visually or orally, that's fine. However it never hurts to review. Keep index cards handy at all times (they also make good cheat sheets although cheating is not encouraged).

, You all have hormones and feelings. You will get to see boys. Most single sex schools have partner schools and monthly dances. Here, you have all the time you need to socialize. However, on the dance floor, don't ""freak"". That will simply cause teachers to ban you from dances and for people to brand you as very provocative. As for dating, if your parents do not approve, don't sneak behind their backs, it will give them more reason to doubt you. Meet up with him during dances (those should be pretty frequent) and co-ed clubs (if there are any).

, If you put a bunch of girls together, there will be drama. Yes, it may be fun sometimes to be the middleman but it's not fun for either opposing side, so stay out of it. If the two start to really get at each other, you will probably be held responsible along with them. Don't let it get bad bad either. If it goes too far, for example, if one person is cutting themselves, or if you hear rumors that one person is going to do something really bad to another, report them, or turn them in. Don't tell any of your classmates or your friends what the teacher or counselor says. Don't tell anyone you told either. It will get around that you snitched on someone else. The counselor or teacher should keep you anonymous and hopefully they can help.

Start getting used to the transition early.,
Join a school sanctioned group.,
Try not to be annoying.,
Think about who you want to spend time with.,
Strive to find one thing they are really good at and become the best.,
Take a trip to the high school.,
Dress appropriately for the first day of school.,
Take care with your friends.,
Be polite and respectful to the teachers and staff, including the lunch room ladies and the custodian.,
Do not take very much money to school on the first day.,
Be prepared for academics, too.",How to Survive Ninth Grade," The best time to think about  the 9th grade is when you are in 8th grade. You will be the youngest and the smallest of all high schoolers. The twelfth graders are big hulking brutes and are known for making life tough for ninth graders, so you need to come up with a plan so that your head is not stuck in the toilet.;
, The high school has many different learning opportunities. Some students have been in little league and enjoy baseball. They should go to try outs, before the end of the school year and earn a place on the team. Most teams seemed to practice over the summer, therefore you must find your spot at the end of your 8th grade year. Becoming a member of a sports team is one way to avoid being a 9th grader who is alone. Alone makes you a target.


If you are not sports minded, consider joining the band or ROTC. Band kids are usually nice and have nice parents. The choir is another group you might join. Then you will have instant friends and someone to hang out with, even if they are not your friend. The drama club is also a good bet. Lots of after-school activities in these areas. You will get to know different grade groups if you are part of these groups and they can offer some protection.
Dance Team, Year book, School Newspaper and Cheerleaders are some of the other group areas to consider. A student can become a part of any of these groups for just the first year of high school while they learn what high school is like. If you are in the Drama club and so is a twelfth grade football star, he might stand up for you when you are in a bind.

, Funny is okay. High schoolers do not like annoying 9th graders. Twelfth graders seem to enforce better behavior on most 9th graders.

, Deciding what kind of crowd you hang with can have a big impact on your life and happiness.


Ninth grade girls should be careful about who they date. Do not rush into boyfriend hood until you find out a boys reputation. Some boys are bad news and you do not want to get that kind of reputation.
Male students will be exposed to many girls that are drama queens and trouble makers.
Be careful who you friend on Facebook. They can send those post to anyone in school and say anything about you. Misinformation is what it is called. You can be suspended for Facebook post. Don't get sucked into a drama.

, You will earn most students respect and a better social position if your are the best at something. For example weight-lifting, running, cooking, writing, drawing, acting, dancing, singing, football, golf, swimming, comedy, craft making, marching, playing an instrument, speaking Spanish or French, math, chess.....just something. You have a year and a summer to find something.

, Get a feeling for the layout, and if possible try to meet some teachers ahead of time. See what the students are wearing and how they are wearing it.

, First impressions are important; they last until you graduate. The rest of the school is interested in the new crop of 9th graders. Don't be the girl in the tight pink spandex shorts and flip flops unless you want to be seen that way for all four years.

, High schoolers are shallow and self centered. Some of them will change friends everyday. Do not tell all your secrets to someone too soon. Get to know them first.

, Politeness and courtesy go along way in this world. You may need something from one of these people sooner or later and they can help you or not.


For example, you forget your lunch money, and you have been rude to the lunch lady. She chooses to insist you pay or do not eat. However, you took the time and trouble to learn her name and greet her with a nice hello and on that day you forgot your lunch money, she states it is no problem with a smile and tells you to bring it tomorrow and she will cover it for you today.  Courtesy throughout life will always get you further along than disrespectful behavior.

, You do not want people to think you carry a lot of money on your person. It will eventually cause trouble. Remember first impressions last along time and it is hard to change a person's view of you after they have formed it.

, Be sure to bring at least a notebook and a sharpened pencil. The teachers are checking over their students and forming their own impressions. Showing educators you are prepared to learn will help them form a good opinion of you.

Make friends.,
Do your homework!,
Consider whether or not you want to have a boyfriend or girlfriend.,
Try to avoid drama, but be able to deal with it.,
Don't do the party thing just because 'your friends do'.,
Avoid feeling pressured to engage in sexual activity when you're not ready.",How to Survive High School (Girls)," First things first, friends are probably the most important thing a girl can have in high school! But making the right friends is even more crucial. So, find people that share the same interests as you like liking the color pink for matching days or loving the same music to win the talent show. Whatever you do, just don't change yourself for anyone! There's plenty of people that will be good for you, be patient.;
, Believe it or not, every year counts in high school and you definitely don't want to get behind. Some good tips for staying ahead in high school is getting plenty of rest before school days so that you can be focused in class, doing ALL of your homework, asking your teacher for help when you need it (don't be shy), and making sure you check your averages in your classes weekly.

, They can be a blessing or a huge heart break. Unfortunately, there's no way to tell you how to have a good love life. The best advice when it comes to boys is age and personality. Don't dress or act a different way to get a boy's or girl's attention; be yourself and they should come without saying. Which is an even better point, DO NOT be clingy. Don't text/call someone several times a day if they barely know your name. People hate annoying girls just as much as you. Playing hard to get is not a reliable strategy- generally, friendliness is much more appealing.

, Drama, oh no. This is probably the hardest part of a teenage girl's life. When you're in high school, people get bored and say things that can be hurtful. The best way to avoid it is to not participate/create it. If the girl in your science class has ugly shoes, keep it to yourself instead of telling every person you know. The more you judge others, the more they judge you. And you might even find yourself in a fight. Be polite, and remind yourself that you can only be you and that's something that no one else has the pleasure of being.

, Parties, drugs, alcohol, are all-around trouble. Parties and going out on the weekends is teenage paradise, but you may find yourself in a nightmare if you're not careful. So remember this, getting drunk/high when you're too young is illegal and damages your life. Just because other people do things doesn't mean they're cool. It means they're taking a risk of doing stupid and self-harming things. Many upon many teenagers are killed in car crashes with drunk drivers or driving drunk. The best advice when it comes to being naughty in high school is, stay away from trouble and be sensible. Your future is in your hands, keep it safe.

, Sex can be very scary to a young person, but it can also be very pleasurable if done properly. Make sure the person you have sex with respects you, and always stay safe.

Take notes in class.,
Study those notes.,
While taking tests, try to visualize your notes or diagrams and recall the information.",How to Study As a Visual Learner,"


Copy down anything the teacher writes on the board or has on a PowerPoint. Also write down anything important that they say.
Draw any diagrams that the teacher presents. For example, in Biology there may be a diagram of a cell, or in History there could be maps.
Use thinking maps and charts to organize information in a visually organized and appealing way.;
,



Create flashcards. As a visual leaner, those flashcards will be especially effective if you add pictures to them.

Highlight important information and quiz yourself on that. The highlighter will draw your eyes into the key points from a lecture.
Look at diagrams in your textbook. Later when you are taking a test, try to picture those diagrams in your head. Often you will be able to see that picture and recall the information attached to it.

, Attaching knowledge to pictures will make it easier for the visual learner to recall.

,
If you live in California, take the California High School Proficiency Exam (CHSPE) and test out of high school in the 10th, 11th or 12th grade.,
In other US states, take classes at your local community college while still in high school or middle school.,
Pass the community college classes with a C or better and send your transcript to the college of your choice.

,
Take College Level Examination Program (CLEP) tests.,
Make sure you talk to your school counselor in high school about how to do this and with a college academic advisor when you are admitted to college to find our what classes counted towards their general education requirements.

You must pass AP tests with a 3 or better in order for it to count as college credits. Completion of an IB Diploma in HS is awarded up to a full year of college credit at some colleges and universities in the US and abroad;
,, Many students do this and go full time to community college or trade school or internship. Many find the community college schedule more flexible than high school and most classes to be no more difficult than high school courses. See for more information on the exam.

, Make sure you are taking college freshman classes that count toward your general education requirements. For California State Universities and University of California schools the general education requirements are as follows: Area A: Communication/Critical Thinking, Area B: Physical Universe and Its Life Forms, Area C: Arts, Literature, Philosophy, and Foreign Language, Area D: Social, Political, and Economic Institutions and Behavior, and Area E: Lifelong Understanding and Self Development.

Ignore people who insult you; the worst thing you can do is start a full fledged fight with them.,
Be yourself, and stay original.,
Make friends with emos, punks, and the other goths; oftentimes, they go through the same teasing you do, so they'll be able to relate to you better.,
Be nice to everyone.,
Focus on your academics.,
Find healthy ways to express yourself; try writing poetry, dancing, singing, or knitting.

,
Join a club that has a focus on your interest.",How to Survive High School As a Goth," You can either ignore them and leave the scene, or tell them off in a witty way. If someone says, ""You're not normal. You're a freak,"" respond with, ""Who defines normal? Everyone has their own idea of what normal is. So, in truth, aren't we all freaks?"" That should confuse them. If it gets out of hand, walk away.


If someone continues to bother you, tell a teacher, parent, or guidance counselor that you are having continual problems with them.;
, Don't suddenly turn into a rude human Barbie doll like everyone else. If you like who you are, stay that way, but if it's just for attention, stop. Be true to yourself and to others.

, Also, make friends that are outside your subculture, all your friends don't have to be goth. Just make sure they accept you for who you are. If you find people who like being around you, it will make you feel better about yourself. It may take some time to find true friends, but they're worth it.

, If you're lurking in a corner and glaring at people, it won't help your case much. Smile and be polite.



Don't spread gossip or get involved with drama. While gossip can be fun to listen to and spread, it is only hurting other people.

, Remember that colleges don't look at popularity, they look at your personality and your smarts. Set an academic goal and work hard to accomplish it. Don't be afraid to talk to your teachers for extra challenges, or if you don't understand material.

,, Joining a club is also a great way to meet people who enjoy the same things you do. Try new things, and find your niche.

, Is the school far too hot or cold for the season? Are they not able to keep up with repairs to the heating or cooling system? Are students forced to wear winter weather inside during classes to stay warm enough in the winter?


Climate control systems are expensive and extensive to repair.
Problems that continue well into the season (not just the first day or two of a cold snap or heat wave) could be a sign of a larger problem
Are students so uncomfortable the school is canceling classes you should definitely notice. Observe if the situation has been corrected when the students must return.

,


Some repairs are best done over the summer when students aren't on-site.

, If wet ceiling tiles have fallen and gone un-replaced, leaks go un-repaired or if water damage has been ignored for ages you should report the problem. Mold and mildew can create larger and more serious health problems for students and faculty.

, The condition of certain items may depend on how much access the students have to it and what students have been around it before. Lockers are a perfect example of this problem. Some lockers may be damaged while others are fine. If lockers are so damaged they cannot close, lock or protect the personal items in it the situation should be reported to school administration. Another locker should be reassigned immediately.

, Many minor items needing repairs can be a sign of a larger problem. If you notice many non-working clocks, cracked glass, broken railings, dirty walls, etc. the school may be shorthanded on maintenance staff or short on funds to make repairs. Regardless, many items will go unfixed until someone outside the school (parent, local government, etc.) says something.

, Schools often have profitable sports teams and should be able to provide adequate equipment for other sports and physical fitness classes. If the equipment seems very poor in quality, broken and otherwise forgotten you should report the disparity. Sadly, some schools pour all of their funds into fancy stadiums for football (the money maker) and ignore other facilities and equipment.

, If you suspect the bleachers are so damaged they are a safety hazard you should report it immediately.


Repairs to bleachers should be dealt with promptly and not doing so could be a sign of poor staffing or not enough funds to replace a potential hazard.
Students have been seriously injured when they collapse.
These should be inspected regularly so unsafe bleachers could be a sign of larger financial problems.
Bleachers can last a long time if properly maintained. Don't mistake age for poor quality.

, Overcrowding is an ongoing problem in public schools. Every student should have a place to sit and study and the required books necessary to study and pass the class.


Although some schools need a few days to move things around after the start of a school year they should have more than enough desks and books to go around.
If students go too long without proper seating and books someone higher than the teacher should be notified. Call the principal, headmaster or superintendent of the school district and give them your specific concerns.

Let them know the class, teacher, block or period and how long the problem has been going on.
Let them know you've contacted before them (the teacher, principal, etc.) and the problem is uncorrected.
Follow up in a reasonable amount of time. Calling twice a day can be excessive and you'll be avoided and possibly considered a troublemaker.



, You should report any rodent or insect infestation. Messes that go uncleaned for long periods of time could also be a sign of understaffed or non-working maintenance or janitorial staff.

, Report issues with food safety to your state health department or other agency responsible for inspections and licensing.


Food served at unhealthy temperatures can be a serious health problem.
Note if cafeteria staff is wearing gloves, hair nets, etc. If not, they could be understaffed and poorly supervised.
Food is notoriously bad in schools so don't let poor quality be confused with dangerous preparation.
Is food poisoning common? Is the food served at a correct temperature? Warm foods should be served warm and cold foods served chilled.
Does the food prep and serving area seem to be clean? Spills that go uncleaned for days are a sign of poor staffing or an untrained or unsupervised staff. Insects such as flies and roaches are a sign of poor cleaning and poor extermination.

Get accommodations.,
Notify your professors.,
Visit your school's Psychological or Counseling Services.",How to Take Classes While Battling Depression1," Schools are legally required to provide accommodations to students struggling with physical or mental conditions that impact their ability to learn due to the Americans With Disabilities Act.Depression, anxiety, and other mental health concerns qualify a student for academic accommodations. Getting accommodations in place helps you protect your academic career while you are working on your depression.


Visit your university's Student Services or Disability Services department to ask about the accommodations process.There is usually some paperwork involved, so if your energy level is not up to it, enlist a family member or friend to help. If you are currently seeing a counselor or have seen one in the past, then you can sign a release to give them permission to communicate with disability services.
If you are concerned about your professors knowing about your depression, look into the confidentiality rules within your school about accommodations. It is possible that due to confidentiality, the department may not be allowed to disclose what the accommodations are for, only that you qualify for them.;
, Even though it can be uncomfortable, it is important your instructors know about your situation.One of the challenges for providing care for students is that the teachers or university are often not aware of the students' struggles.If you successfully apply for accommodations, your professor will be notified of your status and you won't need to discuss it with them past asking if they were notified. Once your professors are aware of you accommodations they may be able to help by giving you more time on assignments or extra help along the way.


If you choose to talk to your professor about it, set up an appointment with them.
Start the conversation by stating why you are there. “I know I have been struggling in your class and I wanted to talk about it with you.”
Mention your accommodations status. ""I am in the process of applying for accommodations,"" or ""I've received accommodations. Have you been notified?""
Explain as much as you are comfortable with and detail what you are struggling with specifically (assignments, physically getting to class, focusing while you are there, etc.).

, Succeeding academically includes working with your schools resources and planning for success. Part of what you can do to help cope with your depression is to build or create your schedule in a way that accounts for symptoms you experience.If you have the ability to create your schedule of classes with your school, consider the following.


Avoid early morning classes if you struggle with getting up in the morning.
Avoid evening classes if you are usually fatigued at night.
If your school block schedules classes you may not be able to choose your class times. However, you might be able to substitute the class for an online class from another school. Try and make sure the rest of your schedule works with the symptoms you experience. Schedule studying time, social activities, and even sleeping, so that it will be easier for you to be successful.

, Adapting your study habits to your experience with depression can also help you succeed. Start by planning your study time and scheduling sleep time as well.If getting up in the morning is difficult, make sure you avoid studying late into the night or pulling all-nighters. If you find that you are getting tired or studying is causing more stress, schedule study sessions in short bursts.


Start studying far in advance of when you think you need to start. This will help to ensure that you have plenty of time to cover everything and allow room for unforeseen setbacks.
Find a good study spot.If concentration is difficult for you, find a study spot that is quiet with minimal distractions. If you feel better being around others or studying with some background noise, consider studying in common areas or student lounges.

, Symptoms of depression can include sadness, hopelessness, and a lack of motivation.Struggling with these symptoms can cause you to procrastinate or to avoid your studies and schoolwork. Work against those urges to make sure you can keep up with classes and succeed.


Find an accountability partner to study with you and to help get you back on track when you get distracted.

"
Practice self-care.,
Cope with specific symptoms.,
Participate in activities you enjoy.,
Find a support system.During this difficult time in your life, it is important to have a strong group of people supporting you.,
Talk to your support system about your depression.",How to Take Classes While Battling Depression3," Your health and your safety has to be your number one priority. Depression can be incredibly difficult and can lead to physical health issues as well as suicidal thoughts. Keep in mind that depression is a flaw in chemistry and not in character, and that there is help available. Make sure you are taking care of yourself and not pushing yourself too hard to succeed. Your health is more important.


Make sure you are getting the right amount of sleep, about 6 to 9 hours a day.Since excessive sleeping is a symptom of depression, make sure you get enough sleep and keep a log to ensure you are not getting too much.
Remind yourself to feed and nurture your body by eating well. Depression can often cause a loss of appetite so make sure you are eating regularly and taking vitamins and medicines as directed as well.You may also find that you are self-medicating with unhealthy foods, so aim for a balanced diet.
Exercising will improve your general mental health and self-esteem. Try to exercise 20 minutes a day, three days a week, even if the exercise is just a walk outside. , Symptoms of depression can include feelings of sadness, physical pain, and fatigue.If you attempt to force yourself to attend classes, it will likely not be helpful for you in the long run. Make sure you are giving yourself the time off you need and treating the symptoms as they come up.


If you are feeling overwhelmed, take a break from your schoolwork and do something else, like watching a TV episode, taking a walk, or cooking can be helpful. Likewise, if you are having a good day, then try to accomplish as much as you can. This will help you to feel better about yourself.
Visit your doctor to address any health or pain issues you are having. Reducing the stress of physical health issues by dealing with them will help you focus on working on your depression.
Keep a daily record of the symptoms you are experiencing and the severity of those symptoms. Your record can be brief and will be helpful in the management of your depression.Ask your current doctor about antidepressants. Many people who suffer from depression take pills that help adjust the chemicals in their brain.

, Having hobbies and activities that you like - whether they're sports, games, crafts, or whatever else - can really help you find balance in your life. School is important, as is making sure you don't get behind in your studies. Your sense of balance and enjoyment in life is also important. Make sure you are taking breaks from your stress and engaging in activities that make you feel good like helping others or volunteering., Your support systems can be made up of family, friends, teachers, peers, mental health professionals and medical professionals. Make sure those in your support group are aware of what you are going through and are truly concerned about your health and happiness.


Being social is a large part of the stereotypical college experience. Know that it's okay to be you or to be introverted. You don't have to go out and do all of the social activities, and you should not feel pressured to do so. However, keep in mind that challenging yourself to do something difficult now and then can help to make you feel better.

, Telling someone you have depression can be difficult. Identify people who you're comfortable talking to - your family members, trusted friends, teachers, counselors, or therapists - and talk to them about support.It is possible to balance your studies, school obligations, and your emotional well-being, but you may need a little help or encouragement from time to time. After identifying who you are comfortable with, ask them to meet with you to talk. Take time to explain to them what you have been going through. When talking to your support system provide information about depression, your experience with depression, as well as its occurrence in colleges.


”I wanted to talk to you about something I'm going through. It's difficult for me to talk about.”
”I'm struggling with my classes and with school in general. I feel sad all the time and I can't shake it.”
”I'm not sure what's going on. It's been really hard for me to get motivated or to enjoy anything lately.”
”I just feel like I need some help and I'm not sure what to do.”

Review your notes and old tests if you are re-taking a class.,
Talk to your friends and family about your goals for the summer.,
Plan something big to look forward to after school is over.",How to Survive Summer School1," Though your summer course won't be an exact replica of the class you just took, you'll be priming yourself for what's to come. It may adjust your way of thinking, studying, and note-taking to the kind of material you'll need to learn.Keep in mind that there will be plenty of overlap and similarities in your classes, but don't think your old test will give you all the answers for your summer school exams. Use your old tests instead as study guides and a tool to see where you struggled last time.;
, Your friends who aren't in summer school are probably going to miss you, and may ask you to abandon your studies for a night of fun or to skip a day here or there so you can all go to the beach. It's going to be hard enough to get through summer school already, and the last thing you need is someone trying to tempt you.


Tell your friends that it's very important you do well in this class and that you will spend time with them after you've finished your homework, or on weekends, and definitely when school is over.
Make sure you have your family's support as well. Let them know you may need their help to stay motivated. They may be able to help you make a study schedule.

, It's going to be hard to see other people going on vacation and relaxing while you're trying to cram a year or semester's worth of school into a few weeks. Knowing something special is waiting for you at the end of summer school--a vacation, a camping getaway with your friends, or a day at your favorite theme park--can help keep you motivated.Set up smaller rewards throughout the course. Do something special (like a Saturday at the beach) for the weekend after your mid-term exam. These little happiness ""checkpoints"" will help break up the course and make it seem manageable.Knowing you have something fun coming up will help lift your spirits when you feel like your summer is slipping away. You can remind yourself: ""I just have to work hard the next two weeks and then I get to spend the day at the waterpark with my friends."""

Put your phone away.,
Don't miss any classes.,
Make friends with the people sitting near you.,
Bring snacks that will increase your concentration and keep you alert.,
Force yourself to participate.",How to Survive Summer School2," Keep your phone out of sight. Even if it's just your mom texting what you want for dinner or your friend asking to meet up after class, once you see your screen light up, your concentration is broken.It’s too easy to get lost in Facebook updates and game notifications. Put your phone in your bag and only check it on your breaks.


Even if you just glance at your phone to see your friend’s message, “What are we doing tonight?”, you’re going to start thinking about your plans and miss what your teacher is saying.

, As you know, summer school is a condensed version of a class that is normally a semester or even a year long. Your teacher will be cramming a ton of information into each class—in some cases, missing one day can be equivalent to several days, a week, or even two weeks of school.Your school probably has a policy that if you miss a certain number of days, the course won’t count, and you’ll have wasted your time (and money—they probably won’t refund the cost of the class, either).
Make sure you arrive on time to your classes as well. Some schools will count excessive tardies as absences (so being late four times might count as an absence). Too many tardies or absences and you may lose credit for the course.

, If you already know people in your class, that’s great! Otherwise, try introducing yourself to the person sitting next to you and ask to exchange numbers. Now you have someone to contact when you’re confused about homework or due dates, a possible study buddy, and maybe even a friend you’ll keep after school is over.If you make friends in your class, it’s going to make it a little easier to get through the day. You’ll have someone to commiserate with during lunch and an automatic partner on any group work.

, When you’re trying to focus, the last thing you need to be worrying about is hunger pangs or a lack of energy. Bring some “brain food” to class so you can stay focused.


Bring some squares of dark chocolate, which provides energy in the form of caffeine and antioxidants that increase brain function.Walnuts or other foods with omega 3’s improve concentration and help your brain process information.Blueberries can improve your short term memory. Bring these for snack or to eat at lunch.Make sure you stay hydrated, too. Dehydration can affect your concentration and memory and can make you tired and moody, too., It may count toward your grade, for one thing, but participating in class can also make lectures more interesting. If you are participating in class, you must listen and think critically about the material. It will keep you alert and engaged.Studies show that by hearing, seeing, and participating, you are more likely to remember and understand the material than if you are passive.Don’t be afraid of answering incorrectly. It’s better to get something wrong when your teacher can help guide you toward the right answer than getting it wrong on a test.
Sit closer to the front and increase the likelihood you will participate and stay engaged. Students who sit in the front of the class tend to be more attentive and answer more questions."

Make a schedule for when you’ll study and finish assignments—and stick to it.,
Try studying outside.,
Get enough sleep.",How to Survive Summer School3," Because you’re covering so much material in such a short amount of time, you can’t afford to procrastinate and fall behind. Making a schedule that lays out when you work on homework, when you will write essays, and when you have to study for exams can make it much easier to stay on top of your work. Putting things off even for a day or two can leave you overwhelmed with work.Make sure you schedule in some down time as well. It’s important you keep up with your studies, but if you don’t take breaks to see friends, go out to dinner, and enjoy the sun a little bit, you’ll burn out quickly., If you’re stuck inside a classroom for hours and then have to go home and study, you may start to feel like you’re missing out on some of the benefits of summer—the sun, the green grass, the warm air. Find a spot outdoors that is quiet and comfortable and soak up some summer while you study.Make sure you’re not somewhere too public—if there are people screaming and laughing and throwing frisbees around you, it will be difficult to focus. Choose someplace without tons of distractions so you can focus.If studying outside is too distracting, then reward yourself by going outside during study breaks. Take a walk or go get some ice cream before you get back to the grind., It may be tempting to stay up late into the night with your friends, but sleep deprivation can have a major impact on your performance at school. Lack of sleep can make it difficult to learn and retain information.You should be getting at least nine hours of sleep every night.Sleep deprivation has been shown to be a factor in lower test scores, concentration, tardiness, and decreased attention span.If your class starts mid-summer and you’re already used to staying up late, make sure you give yourself a few days to adjust to your new schedule before school starts. It will be tempting to continue sleeping late as long as possible, but it will make it easier to get up that first morning if it’s already becoming a habit.

The first thing you need to do is stop.,
Put down that pencil and close your eyes for a minute.,
Once you have successfully cleared your mind, take deep breaths for a minute.,
If you feel calm enough to proceed, then do.,
Proceed with your work.,
Read the instructions carefully.,
Start by placing a piece of scratch paper over the problems that you do not need to finish at the moment.,
If you become confused, frustrated, or upset while working on your problems, stop again and clear your mind, practicing your deep breathing.

,
Work with anxiety issues.,
Feeling pressured or stressed by time limits.,
Working through anger and/or frustration issues.,
Approach schoolwork with a good attitude.",How to Survive Your School Work," Just set everything aside for a moment.


The first thing you need to understand is exactly why you are stopping when you need to be working. The answer is simple: you are giving your brain a break. If you are stressing out over what needs to be done, then chances are you are not able to comprehend exactly what the schoolbook is telling you to do, and why and/or where you need to be doing it. If you are getting overly frustrated with your schoolwork and desperately want to stop, yet feel pressured to keep going, you need to listen to what you really want to do, and stop.;
, Chances are there are things that are bothering you and keeping you from concentrating on your work, so try to clear your mind of everything you don't need to complete what you are doing in class/for homework.

, This will calm you down. All you should think about while doing this is your breathing. In... out... in... out... in... out...

, If you do not feel calm enough, keep clearing your mind and breathing deep. Do not do anything to distract yourself like doodling, letting your mind wander, or observing what is going on around you. Though it may seem a little strange not doing these things that most people assume will help you get back to doing your work, the truth is these things will distract you and make you not want to return to doing your work. They distract you a little too much.

, This may be the hardest part as it requires you to continue doing what got you confused, nervous, or frustrated in the first place. If even the thought of continuing throws you into a frenzy, you may want to speak to the school counselor, teacher, nurse, or parent depending on your situation. If what you are supposed to be doing in your lesson is confusing or frustrating you, it's probably time to look back over the instructions in your schoolbook.

, Try to identify just what is upsetting, confusing, or frustrating you.


Remember: It's hard for anyone to admit that they don't understand something almost everyone else does. Just try to remember that no one except yourself has to know that you aren't able to easily comprehend your lesson.
Decide on what is bothering you about the instructions. Is it something you feel you have not learned enough about to proceed with? Do you feel you need more information? Are there words you do not understand? Does it seem like there's too much work to be finished?
What to do if you feel there's too much work to be finished. This one is easy. It's kind of like tricking yourself into believing that there is not at all very much to be done. At this point, it is important to keep reminding yourself that looking ahead is a very bad habit for those who are easily stressed, angered or confused by their schoolwork. ""Take it as it comes"" is a very important saying to go by if you are suffering from any of these problems.

, Complete the first one, then uncover another, until you finish them.,, A lot of people have problems with school-related anxiety. If you are one of these people, it is extremely important that you take as many breaks as you need to and breath deep often. If you have school-related anxiety, little distractions that are not normally helpful and can distract you too much can help you monumentally. Things like:

Squeezing a stress ball
Thinking about something pleasant for a bit
Allowing your mind to wander temporarily
Gripping anything soft or squishy
Chewing a very small amount of gum if it is allowed
Doodling small things on scratch paper can help with the anxiety.






For those who deal with anxiety, covering up the problems you do not have to deal with yet is also a very ideal solution.

, This is a common problem that can be easily worked past/around. Deep breathing and clearing your minds are vital tools to overcoming pressure. Again, you have to just stop, and forget about that time limit. There is nothing more important right now that you. Think of it like that. You can't complete your work if you aren't given the tools and time to do it.


Yet again, covering the problems you do not yet need to work with will definitely help, as will the tips listed above for those dealing with anxiety.

, People who are angered or frustrated by their schoolwork are often thinking things like ""Who cares if I know this?"" or ""When this class is over, I am going to be so happy."" and generally have a negative or defensive demeanor. For this type of person, it will always be a good idea to have a stress ball on hand to relieve some tension.


If you suffer from anger issues/frustration issues during school, you may also have general anger management problems. Seeing your school counselor or a therapist may be a good idea in this case.
Trying to pin your problems on someone else is never a good idea, no matter how frustrated you are.
If you think it might help, try covering up your problems you do not have to deal with.
try to learn to accept the fact that school exists and that you are actually lucky to be receiving an education which will help you plan out your future and have a decent income to support your life after you are on your own and completely responsible for your own actions.
Getting into a fight, be it verbal or physical, is never a good idea. It will not help your attitude towards schoolwork improve.
Clearing your mind and trying to calm yourself down with deep breathing is a very good idea for someone who has these problems.

, This is something difficult to do for many people. It may be tempting to skip school or something like this, but it is never a good idea. Learning to approach school with a good attitude is something that will definitely help you with your emotions inside or outside of the classroom, whether you go to public school or private, even if you're homeschooled. Emotions are something you can't try to push aside. You have to welcome them with open arms and say ""Hello, there, emotions! Welcome, welcome!"" and just do what you have to, accepting the emotions rather than being upset by their presence.

Being prepared before entering any class is essential in order to get the most out of it.,
Be sure to have all the required materials before the first day of class.,
Right after getting to class, get out assignments due and the required materials for that day.",How to Pass High School Biology1," If there is an available syllabus for the Biology class, read it carefully to know the rules, materials needed, and any other important information before going to the first Biology class. It is a good idea to review it before going to class each day to make sure nothing is forgotten. One way of remembering the syllabus is to highlight, underline, and take notes on it.


Use different note-taking methods such as underlining, highlighting, drawing a symbol such as a star next to something important, drawing a box around important sentences/paragraphs, and taking notes either on a separate sheet of paper or the back of the syllabus. These tips will insure everything is remembered.
Make sure it is okay with the teacher before marking up the syllabus. If needed, make a copy with a scanner so there are multiple copies. It is a good idea to keep one unmarked and the other with notes so if anything changes, new notes can be made on the second copy.
Students without scanners at home have a few different options of scanning the syllabus. One is to go to the nearest library that has a scanner and bring the syllabus along. Usually is costs no more than $0.20 per page to scan. Another option is for students with smartphones or tablets with a camera built into the device. Install an app made for scanning documents. These type of apps allow users to take a picture of a document and it will convert it to PDF, DOC, and other various document formats. If these options are not available, do not hesitate to ask the school if they have a scanner of if the Biology teacher can scan the syllabus. They will be happy to help.;
, Most science classes including Biology will require students to pay a lab fee. This fee goes towards supplying the students with lab materials needed for experiments. Usually the teacher will give students at least the first week of class to pay this fee. Most of the time it is refundable, meaning when students have completed the course the money is refunded by to them. If anything has been damaged by a student, most likely this fee will not be refunded to them. Be careful of lab materials, both dangerous and safe ones.


Usually pencils/pens and paper to take notes are required in most classes. Even if it is not required by the teacher, it is an excellent idea to bring them and take notes anyways. This will help retain information and allow students to review what they learned in class.
Learn good note-taking skills to be even more successful. Refer to ""Part 2 of 3: Taking Notes"" for more information.

, This gets students ready for class faster and so they are not digging around in their school bag when it is actually time to use them. Only skip this if the teacher instructs the students not to take anything out until they say so. This is also a good time to quickly review yesterday's homework and notes to be sure nothing is missing.

Taking notes will be similar to process used to take notes on the class syllabus.,
Once the key is made, it is time to take notes.",How to Pass High School Biology2," Materials recommended for taking notes are college-ruled notebook paper, different colored pens (black, blue, red, and other fun colors such as green, purple, pink, etc.), pencils, erasers, highlighters, and stickers.


A recommended way for taking notes is to make a key. This is done by putting symbols, either by drawing them or using different stickers, on the left side of the notebook paper. There is a line about less than 1/4 wide on the left of the page, and the symbols should go before this line. An example of this is drawing a star for important facts, drawing a head for information about people, drawing a calendar for important dates, and so on. In the notes, put the symbol from the key next to those notes. For example, let's say a note is ""Biologists are people that study biology."" The symbol next to this note would be the head, because it is information about people. Another example is ""The first person to see a live cell with a microscope was Antoine van Leeuwenhoek."" Two symbols, a head and a calendar, would be put next to this note because it has information about both a person and a date. The purpose of this is to keep notes organized and to quickly refer to specific information.
Draw graphs, pictures, and charts on notes to remember what certain things look like, especially cells and cell parts, for example.

, On the top of the paper, write down the date of the class the notes are and the class name, which is Biology. An example is: Biology: August 14, 2015"".


Under the class name and date, write down the topic. For example, if the teacher is giving a lesson about the characteristics of living things, write ""Characteristics of Living Things"".
As the teacher is giving the lesson, write down what is only necessary. This means it is not necessary to write down every single thing the teacher says. Although, it is important to know what to write down and what not to write down. Examples of what should be written down are names of important people, such as scientists whom made a great impact on the advancement of science and biology, dates of when important events happened, such as the day something significant was invented or discovered, vocabulary words and definitions, and other facts that are going to be on a quiz or test. Sometimes not all students will know what will be on a test, but the information listed above will more than likely be on a test. Do not be afraid to ask questions or talk to the teacher for information regarding this.
Depending on how the teacher gives the lesson, it is best to wait to add the symbols from the key until class is over. A good reason for this is so students can review and read their notes, and add the symbols as they read them.

"
Always do the homework and always turn it in on time.,
Always ask for help if there is a need for it after receiving an assignment.,
There are days where students cannot make it to class due to appointments, being sick, or emergencies.",How to Pass High School Biology3," Homework usually takes up a good chunk of the students' grades. Handing it in late can result in points being taken off.

, Review the assignment after receiving it, and if it appears there is something not understood, ask for help from the teacher. It is okay to attempt the question first, but if it is too difficult, ask the teacher what is being done or understood wrong.

, If this happens, call or email the teacher as soon as possible. Ask for what was said during the lesson, if any homework was handed out, and what needs to be done to make up the missed class. This not only improves a student's grade, but it shows responsibility.

Understanding your current study habits can help you emphasize your strengths and work on improving your weaknesses, which will help you if you are struggling in a specific area.


Start asking yourself questions about your study habits. Are you a good note taker? Are you good at memorizing facts? Are you good at writing essays? Are you good at reading but not math? Are you horrible at multiple choice tests?;
, Every person learns differently. Some people learn by reading while others are more hands-on. Learning styles influence the way we learn and recall information. Understanding which learning styles you possess can help you be more effective in the classroom.There are seven learning styles:


Visual (spatial): You are a visual learner, respond well to pictures and images, and use spatial understanding.
Aural (auditory-musical): You learn well with sound and music.
Verbal (linguistic): You learn by using words, both spoken and written.
Physical (kinesthetic): You are a hands-on learner. You learn through your body, by using your hands and sense of touch.
Logical (mathematical): You respond to and learn through logic and reasoning.
Social (interpersonal): You learn best when you with other people.
Solitary (intrapersonal): You learn best when alone.To discover your own learning style profile, try an online questionnaire like the one here or here. Once you have determined your particular learning style, you can start tailoring your academic habits to enhance learning.

, Organization includes many different things. Come prepared to your classes: bring the textbook, a notebook or notebook paper, pens or pencils, highlighters, notecards. Having all the materials not only makes things easier for you, but it leaves a good impression on your teachers.


Keep a separate folder for each class. These folders should hold homework, tests, quizzes, notes, handouts, and any other course related material. Use dividers to keep your work separated by type so it's easy to find.

, Even if your teacher doesn't make you take notes, writing down the main ideas, formulas, key words, and definitions from your teachers' lessons can improve your learning of the material. Write down questions about things your teacher says so you don't forget to ask later.Make your notes clear and readable. Messy notes can lead to confusion and frustration later on. Also, make sure to be accurate.
Don't jot everything down word for word. Instead, write down key concepts and key words or phrases. Jot down the term and go look it up at home later that night to define if you are having trouble keeping up with your teacher's lecture. Develop your own short-hand that will help you take notes faster and more efficiently.
Organize your notes. Date them and keep them in a notebook. Have a separate notebook for each class, or use dividers to keep your notes for each class separate.Review your notes each night. Taking good notes and never looking at them doesn't help you. Set aside a few minutes each night to read over your notes. Make questions about things you are confused about so you can ask your teacher in your next class. Refer to your textbook about anything that may need expanding. Use this time to start internalizing the information - it's never too early to start studying for your test!
Students who are serious about taking good notes in class are more likely to come to class prepared, and they are less likely to get distracted in class.

, One key to succeeding in school or at a job is learning to meet deadlines. Make sure you turn in all your assignments on time. Some classes will have a semester schedule with all the major assignments listed. In other classes, teachers will give you a weekly schedule, or announce assignments as the semester progresses.


Buy a planner or calendar to keep track of all your homework assignments, essay due dates, and the dates of major tests. Many cell phones have calendar apps that you can plug your weekly and monthly schedule into. These apps have the option of adding comments to the scheduled task, and you can even set reminder alarms so you don't forget.
Don't just schedule your assignments. High school is a busy time, filled with jobs, extra-curricular activities, and social engagements. Put all those things into your calendar so you have an accurate view of your weekly commitments.

, Think about where and when you study best. Do you study better in a quiet library or a noisy coffee shop? Do you like sitting at a desk or can you effectively study on your bed without falling asleep? Do you like to study alone or in a group? Do you do better when listening to music? The answers to these questions can help you find the ideal study space for you.


Make sure your study space is comfortable. A rigid chair at an empty table in a quiet room doesn't have to be your study space.But your study space needs to be free of distractions, and separate from the places where you do most of your lounging and relaxation.

, Time management skills are a key part of any successful academic career. Set aside time each day for doing your homework and studying. At this stage in your life, school needs to come first in order for you to succeed.


Review your notes every day. Research has shown that reviewing material within 24 hours of learning it helps retention by 60%.Schedule study time each week. Look at your weekly schedule, and pencil in study times throughout the week. Try to schedule study blocks for the same time every day and every week. This forms it into a habit that you will be less likely to break.
Don't put off studying. The worst thing you can do is put off your academic work. Our lives are filled with distractions that are more fun than studying - from video games to sports to friends - but remember to keep on task. Remember to study on the weekends, too. A few minutes reviewing your notes will make a huge difference come test day.
Study hard. One key to passing high school is not just simply getting by, but learning. Studying is essential to your success.

, Setting goals for yourself can help you feel accomplished. Reward yourself when you meet milestones or small goals. Even if some goals are taking longer than you anticipated, always reward yourself when your efforts pay off.


Start with large goals. What do you want to achieve during high school? What do you want to accomplish before this year is out? After you have listed your goals, come up with a few ways you can accomplish these goals.
Make mini goals. After deciding on your large goals, start setting smaller goals for yourself. What do you want to accomplish this week? Tonight? Even sitting down with your homework and asking yourself, ""What do I hope to have done by the end of my study session?"" can help you stay on task and be successful.

, Before you begin to study for an exam, you need to have taken good notes in class. Listen to what your teacher says closely. Many times, teachers will drop clues to what will be covered on the test. These hints can range from going over the information multiple times, using words like ""important"" or ""key"" when covering an idea, to even saying, ""This will be on the exam.""


Write down everything you think is important. The more you write down during class, the better prepared you will be for the test.
Review your notes each day. Don't cram. Waiting until the night before an exam only hurts you. Cramming will sometimes give you a passing grade, but it is not an effective, reliable study method. Students who study consistently, but in shorter amounts of time, do better in school.To avoid cramming, read your notes daily so you learn the information as you go along.

, Even if the teacher gives you one, make your own outline for the information covered on the test. Include the main concepts and ideas that will be covered on the test. Include examples, definitions, formulas, and other pertinent information.


Make your own questions to test yourself. If you know there will be an essay on the test, then come up with essay questions and answers. Study with another student in the class and ask each other questions about the material.
Make flashcards. Place definitions, concepts, themes, dates, and formulas on flashcards to quiz yourself.
Reword concepts on your study guide. Many teachers ask information in different ways to see how well your synthesis of the material is. Think of other ways questions might be asked or another way a concept could be presented on the exam.

, You should never ignore the information until the date of the exam. You should review the information daily and weekly to begin committing it to memory and begin fully understanding the information.


As the exam date approaches, allot more time for studying that subject. You may need some additional time to brush up on certain ideas or do a more comprehensive look at the material.

, Don't wait until the last minute to study for a test. When you know a test is coming up, start studying for it a week before the exam date.


Don't wait on the teacher to give you a study guide to begin studying. Reread the chapter, review your notes, learn definitions and formulas.

, Don't stay up all night before an exam. If you are tired, you will not do well. Get a good night's sleep, eat a nutritious breakfast and lunch, and come to class early.Coming to class on time also ensures that you are not late to the exam. If the teacher gives any tips, flash reviews, or provides additional information, you will be in class to hear it.

, A common mistake students make is not reading the instructions or the questions carefully, and then making errors on the test. Take your time as you take the test. Read the directions for each section, then read each question. Ask your teacher if you are unclear about a question on the test.

, When you take a test, you neither want to rush or work too slow. Think about how long you have to finish, the number of questions, and the types of questions.


You may want to tackle difficult or long sections first. If an essay is worth 1/4 of your overall test grade, you might want to write that first. Another strategy is to answer easy questions, saving questions you are unsure about for last.

, Many times, our initial impressions are correct, but then we second-guess ourselves until we write down the wrong answer. If you have a gut reaction to a question, then trust that instinct.

, High school is the time when you start discovering things about yourself. During the first two years of high school, begin understanding what your interests are, what your aspirations are, and what your future career plans might be., Engaging in your classes helps you in a variety of ways. You get more out of your classes by participating, and you build better relationships with your teachers, which can help you in many ways in the long run.


Stay awake in class and pay attention. Don't sleep in class or text your friends if you are bored.
Sit in the middle of the room or towards the front. Sitting closer to the board and the teacher will help you focus and deter you from getting distracted by things like your cellphone, classmates, and letting your mind wander to other things.

, Don't worry about looking stupid in front of your class; raise your hand and ask the question. If you are struggling with something in class or from your homework, don't sit there confused.


Answer questions when your teacher asks them. Do not be afraid to give the wrong answer; no one is right all the time.
Participate in the class discussion. Use the main ideas, key words, and ideas you discovered in your readings or the class lessons. Offer insight or ideas when the teacher opens the class to student input.

, Each school has a list of required classes that students must complete to graduate. This includes a certain number of classes of language arts, math, foreign languages, and even humanities. During your freshman year, find out what classes are required. Ask your teacher or guidance counselor for help on figuring out graduation requirements.

, Attendance is important. Every day you miss school, you are falling behind in the work in your classes. Regular attendance is essential for staying engaged in your classes.


Most schools have an attendance policy. If you miss too many days, you may negatively impact your grade in classes or your graduation eligibility.
Do miss school if you are very sick, like running a fever, vomiting, or have other medical issues.If you are arriving late to school because of lack of sleep, adjust your sleep schedule. A consistent sleep schedule will not only help your attendance, but also help you be more alert and engaged in class, and make it easier to learn.

, Your guidance counselor might be the most important person you will meet during your high school career. Guidance counselors offer you valuable information that can ease your navigation through school and get you on the right track from day one.


Guidance counselors know all the classes you have to take to graduate. This is especially important as you plan each year's class load. Every school has certain classes each student must take, and if you are confused about how to fulfill your requirements, the guidance counselor can help you.
If you want to go to a certain kind of college for a specific major, your guidance counselor can help you figure out what classes and extra-curricular activity will look best on your college applications. They can also help you figure out which classes will challenge you as you prepare for a college education.
Guidance counselors are an essential resource for students with learning disabilities. They can work with you and your teachers to find the right accommodations for you. They can also help you with your college goals, including finding scholarships for students with disabilities.
Guidance counselors can also help you if you are struggling with your classes. But academic help is not the only thing they can help you with. If you're struggling with something in your personal life, if you're feeling depressed, or if you're being bullied, counselors can be a person you can talk to.
Meet with your counselor during your freshman year. Let them know your interests and your goals. If you're unsure about what you want to do, let them know that so they can help you. It's never too late to meet with your counselor, even if you're a senior., Getting to know your teachers can be beneficial in many ways. Talking to your teacher can help you be more comfortable in your class, which can in turn make you more successful in the class.


Go to your teacher if you are struggling academically. They don't want you to fail; they want you to succeed. They can offer extra tutoring or additional information about your subject that can clarify any confusion.
Teachers are also great resources if you are being bullied. Don't be afraid to tell someone if you are being bullied or having a hard time.
If you are planning to go to college, you will need teacher recommendations for some college and scholarship applications. If you have cultivated relationships with teachers through your high school career, you will have people who know you and believe in you to write positive, enthusiastic letters for you.

, Sometimes no matter how hard you study, things just don't make sense. If this happens to you, find a tutor. Many high schools offer peer tutoring in a variety of subjects, or a faculty-led afterschool tutoring program.


Most communities have learning labs and tutoring centers. These centers are designed to offer help in most subjects for a fee. Tutoring centers also offer SAT, ACT, and other standardized testing prep classes.

, Find a list of clubs and extracurricular activities offered at your school. Joining these school activities looks good on college applications, helps you make friends, and opens you to new experiences.


Sometimes only joining the club is not enough for a college. If you enjoy the club or extracurricular activity, consider going out for a leadership role, like a treasurer, secretary, or even president.
Find clubs and extracurricular activities that truly interest you. Don't just join a club because you feel you should. High school is a period in your life where you are juggling many time commitments; make sure you are enjoying the activities where you are spending your time.
Don't be a club hopper. Colleges prefer you to be involved in a few activities for a longer period of time instead of many clubs for only a short amount of time.Plus, being involved in less clubs for most of your high school career allows you to build relationships with fellow members and deepen your involvement in the club or activity.

, Getting a job in an area of interest can help you develop your interests and certain skills that can be helpful when applying to college. Volunteering is not only personally rewarding, but also helps you discover interests you may never have known you had before.If the time demands during the school year are too much for you, then try a summer program. Many organizations have short, summer internship programs for high school students. Summertime can also be the perfect period for a part-time job.Volunteering, working, and getting internships can give you valuable experiences outside of the classroom. Be careful not to overdo it. Effective time management can help you balance all of your different tasks., The keys to a successful education are good reading and writing skills. The more you practice outside of the classroom, the better student you will become.


Good students usually make reading a habit. They read everything from newspapers, to the internet, to books and comic books. The important element is that they read daily. Read whatever you want - what interests you. This isn't for class; this is your own personal reading time.
If you want to improve your reading skills, try reading challenging newspaper articles or novels. Look up words you don't know and try to commit them to memory.
Writing is the basic form of communication. You'll be writing not only in school, but in any job that you get. Make writing part of your daily life. Keep a journal, write letters or e-mails, or try writing stories. Think about the basics of grammar and word usage to improve yourself.Revision is one of the most important parts of the writing process. First drafts rarely are perfect and ready to be turned in. Leave your writing and return to it later for a fresh perspective.

, School can't be all work and no play. There are many enjoyable and beneficial experiences during high school that you should participate in. Go to dances and the prom, go to school sporting events, and cultivate friendships. Study hard, but also enjoy yourself.

You'll need confidence!,
Now that you're confident, so smile!,
You smiled at someone and they smiled back.,
Stop thinking others are judging you, and everything you do.,
Get out more.,
Compliment!,
Have courage!,
Remember that you do have a place in this world, because your birth certificate says so.",How to Overcome Shyness in High School," When people see that you're happy about life and about yourself, they admire and look up to you and want to be around you. So first off, forget about your looks. Never base your self-confidence on looks. What if one day you wake up with a big giant zit on your nose? You will feel ugly. Rather, think about your best bodily features: your arms, legs, feet, eyes, lips, ears, whatever, and learn to accentuate them (without showing too much). Anything you're insecure about? That's only because society thinks it's bad. You will embrace your faults as ""quirks"" and carry them off with confidence.


Think about your strengths. Do you have great grades, teachers love you, you play a sport well, or an instrument? Work on that and constantly remind yourself about your strengths. Try new things like an art class, driving a stick shift, or babysitting, and you'll find some more things you're good at!;
, When you smile at people, it shows that you're outgoing, friendly, happy, and a great person. And that's what you want to be known as, right? So show those pearly whites! Brush your teeth too; it improves the look of your smile and you are not as subconscious to show it.


If you don't smile because you're ashamed of your teeth, get whitening strips, braces, a retainer--anything that will make you feel better about yourself.

, What next? Introduce yourself! Don't forget that person's name! Lodge it in your memory as soon as they say it.


Next time you see them, in class, or lunch, or a football game, go over and say ""hi."" Sit next to them if they invite you to; one of their friends could be your new best friend!
Be interested. Ask the person questions about themselves, like what grade they're in, where they were born, hobbies, favorite TV shows, movies, etc. If you show people you are interested in them, they'll feel valued and important, and they'll definitely say hi to you in the hall. If you don't know what to say when starting a conversation, brush up on current events! MTV News, CNN, or whatever, just as long as it's interesting. Also read blogs, magazines, books, and watch TV to get conversation starters.

, For shy people, that's hard. You might think that people are judging you on how you look, how wrong you're doing something, and may feel like the whole world is Simon Cowell from American Idol. It's not true! People are dealing with their own insecurities and battles, and if you reach out to them and stop focusing on how you look, people will like you and treat you like a friend.

, Stop lounging in front of the TV or computer and get out of the house! Get involved in clubs, sports, and volunteer. You'll meet people with the same interests as you, and that's all you need to make a friend! Remember, a stranger is a friend you haven't met yet.

, Complimenting is an awesome way to start a conversation and make people like you. So if you see a girl or guy with great hair, shoes or a cool outfit, speak up! You'll be known as a nice person, and they'll eventually return the favor.

, Remember, there's someone wonderful inside of you that's crawling to come out. All you need is courage. If you want to raise your hand in class to ask a question, go for it! Remember: the only stupid question is the one not asked! If you want to sit with a group that you admire or a girl that seems interesting, go for it. People are just as friendly as you are. If they reject you, then there's something wrong with the person, not you.

, All men and women are created equal, and are entitled to equal rights. You cannot let these louder people crowd you out. You have to notice yourself, then people will notice you.

Sort your life as a teenager.,
Prioritize your weekly schedule as a student.,
List the exact due dates for events, assignments, tests and other homework.,
Set a time limit on how long you study for each class.,
Get at least 6-9 hours of sleep.,
Try to take showers before going to school.,
Go over your homework or assignments with your parents.,
Think of how non-educational activities are affecting your schedule.,
Don't neglect your health.,
Try to have a fixed timetable.

",How to Manage Your Time Wisely As a High School Student," Are friends important to be around at this time? Do you find yourself on the internet a lot? Are you someone who goes to the library to study in a quiet environment? Are your parents around to assist you or prefer to ask for teachers' help?;
, Any educational/academic studies must come first, then extra curriculum activities, and then social life. Friends will want to hang out with you on the weekends, but they will understand if you explain to them that you need to study or catch up on school work.

, This will greatly help you to remind you when things need to be done by. Next, sort extra curricular activities. Any activity dealing with school should be placed before the After School ones. Then, input non-educational events, such as babysitting, jobs around the house, etc, with team events, such as sports, coming first. Finally, treat yourself to a computer game or time with friends.

, Don't go overboard on one subject and forget that you have several others to catch up on before going to bed. Also, don't rush through studying; take your time and concentrate. You may want to set an alarm clock so when it rings, go to another subject, and reset the alarm.

, If you have more or less sleep than you should have, you may start lacking in your schoolwork and become lazy because of the urge or want to sleep.

, You'll be more refreshed, alert, and relaxed as you start the day. Night showers are sometimes ""missed"" if you have your face covered in books and realize that it's time to go to sleep.

, It's always a positive action to get your parents involved. When this is not possible, ask your teachers for advice.

, If you are babysitting or doing jobs around the house, compromise on set days and times that go around your school life. If you cannot commit to your studies because of football practice, then you must take action. When something gets in the way, you need to drop it, even if it's temporarily.

, Just because you're short of time doesn't mean you should live on junk food. Try to get your fruits and vegetables everyday. Remember to exercise at least 30 minutes a day. Doing these things will support mental, physical and emotional function.

Allow yourself big goodbyes.,
Tackle moving day.,
Go prepared.,
Dress casually but presentably.,
Change if you want to.,
Get ready for your new environment.,
Make your introductions.,
Make friends (what is this sorcery?).,
Try your best to settle in, even when it's hard.,
Stay active to get through the hard transition.",How to Move During Freshman Year in High School," Whether you've told your friends about your move a month before, or even a week before, the actual event, say your ""goodbye's"" properly. It doesn't matter if they were your friends, or just some people you see in the hallways, get their phone numbers, emails even, or Instagram.


Saying goodbye is hard, but don't worry, you'll be able to visit them during their football games (yes that's actually normal) or any other time. If you don't want to throw a goodbye party, then have a night of hanging out with your best friends. Remember to keep in touch with them, because it'll be worth it during your high school move.;
, It's the day of the move! Don't be afraid to cry, or sulk, or give your parents the silent treatment (it's all normal). Take one last look at your neighborhood, no matter how hard it is, because you're going to regret not being able to remember it if you don't.

, So your first day of High School -again- is coming up. What, you ask, should you bring to school?


Pen or pencil
Notebook (one or two)
One or two binders
Binder paper
Folder, you'll be getting a lot of syllabuses
Lunch money, or pack your own lunch
PE clothes money (around $30)

,


Don't wear your most fanciest, coolest, or prettiest outfit. Then people are going to expect a lot more from what you own in your closet.
Wear something casual and cute. Wear something that's you, but toned down. You wouldn't want to wear a gamer's shirt, and meet a bunch of theater people. Or wear a preppy outfit and hangout with a bunch of laid back people.
Know the weather of your new neighborhood, and dress accordingly. It might have been 50 degrees where you used to live, but 90 degrees here.

, Crazy right? But it's true, if you want to change anything about yourself, now's your chance.


Get a haircut, or don't get one.
Wear makeup, or stop wearing makeup.

, Obviously your new high school's not going to be the same as your old one. All high schools are different, but here's a gist of what to expect.


You'll either have to wait an hour or two to get your schedule done, or you'll get it right away. If they are making your schedule with you, remember, it's a new school so you can change your electives or sign up for a 0 period class.
They'll either chuck your schedule and a map at you or send someone to give you a tour.
Unless it's a small high school, no one is really going to notice you being the new kid in the hallways.

, Remember, stay cool not nervous. Some teachers will make you introduce yourself, and others will barely acknowledge you.


Whatever you do, do not lie about yourself. It's a bad idea, because there's always going to be that one obnoxious know-it-all who can see through it, and it's going to unravel later to bite you back ~because you know, it's high school.
Know that depending on how late you come in the year, you'll probably be getting most of the bad teachers. JUST because those are the classes with the most spaces available for incoming students (after everyone has tried to transfer out).

,


Try making a friend before your lunch period. Preferable in the class right before lunch, because then you can just walk with him/her after the class ends to Lunch.
Be friendly. It doesn't matter if you're antisocial. Say hi, smile, and pretend you're okay (even if you're not).

, You'd think things couldn't get worse. The new friends you've made, are nothing like your old friends. You hate your teachers, some classes just are terrible. And to top it off, you're still the new girl/guy even after a full month. But here's a list of things of things to expect once you've (not really) settled in and how to deal with them.


The friends you first make, will most likely not be the friends you'll have later on. But it's not like you can keep searching for new friends, or else you'd be that annoying person people try avoiding. Go with the flow. You're bound to meet some cool people throughout your year.
The popular people might either obsess over you, or ignore you. Here's a tip if they do obsess over you: Stay you. If they like the person you're not, then you'll just be bitter. And if they don't like who you are, then it's their lost.
At one point, you'll realize how bitter you are. Confusing right? But you'll get what that means sooner or later. The trick is, let go. If you keep holding on to it, it's just going to drag you down.
Keeping in touch with your old friends (especially your best friends) will come in handy during the first few months/year. You won't have any best friends right away at your new school, so it's always good to keep in touch with your old friends in order to avoid depression or insanity.

,


Join clubs, sports, or any other extracurricular activities to meet cool people, and to feel like you belong. Not exactly the ideal idea, but it only gets easier after you're rock bottom.
Find some cool people to hang out with. They might now be your best friends, but at least they'll help you get through the year.

"
"
Join a club.,
Take part in a sport.,
Make friends!,
Find the things you're good at and pursue them, without any kind of embarrassment.,
Don't backtalk or be disrespectful to the teachers.,
Don't be afraid to ask for help.,
Make a time capsule.,
Take lots of pictures.,
Enjoy high school!",How to Make Your High School Years Memorable," Test the waters, and don't be afraid to get involved with something you've never tried before. Now is the time to learn new skills and meet new people. Just because it sounds foreign, doesn't mean it's not worth trying.;
, Never underestimate how amazing it is to work hard for something. The sense of accomplishment that comes with knowing you did it cannot be sold for anything. Also, it's nice to be part in a team and possible make friends who will stick by you! And, it never hurts to be in shape when you look back at old pictures.

, Don't be afraid to be yourself. If your friends like you for someone you're not, not only are you hurting them, you're hurting yourself. Don't lie! Be who you are, because you are the only person who can fill that small piece of the universe accurately.

, Let's be honest, no matter how many pairs of sunglasses you wear or all the extra sleep you get in class by acting ""cool"", there is nothing ""cool"" about the feeling when you read the big letter F on your report card. There is nothing ""cool"" about slacking off when you could be making real effort and doing real things before time is really up!

, Imagine being told everyday that what you have devoted your time and effort to telling people, was of no meaning of all and would have absolutely no effect on anyone's life. How many times do you hear kids tell teachers that the things they teach are irrelevant? If you are kind to your teachers they will hopefully reply with the same courtesy. That doesn't mean they'll pass you because you didn't insult them, but they might give a little bit more effort in helping you understand.

, If you need help, by all means, ask! If you didn't know which bathroom was which in a public area, would you rather ask someone politely and discreetly, or accidentally walk into the wrong one and be caught red-handed by all the people there? Exactly! So, bottling up a question just makes it explode in your face later. Teachers are supposed to be informative; let them inform you for your benefit!

, It may sound silly now, but you'll get a kick out of it when you open it later. Get together with your friends and create a box or container full of items and images to reflect who you are. Pledge to open it together at one of your reunions, and you'll really relive the past.


Put some sort of photo or anything about your friends at the current time. Who came; who left? You never know what could change!
Add some kind of memorabilia about the current lifestyle. Example: a CD from a popular band, new movie, some form of advertising or newspaper, etc.
Have you and your friends each put something in without letting the other know what it is.
Make sure that the container is durable against the forces of nature. Bury it in a place that will most likely be accessible in the future. Set a date to open it and wait!
When the date comes throw a small party for your friends. At the end, open it up and slowly pull out everything. My, have things changed!

, Get pictures of social events, parties, important moments, and just humorous or extremely memorable moments. You can never have too many memories!


Get together every so often and have a ""photo shoot"". Get some pics of you doing your favorite things with cool poses, props, and maybe guests!
Make a photo collage or a photo album. Design it and slowly fill it up. Save the last slot for your graduation picture for an extra special twist!

, It's not there to kill you, regardless of what you might think now. Take your time and don't let things get you down. It won't be memorable if your only memories are of you sitting alone in your room watching tv or listening to music. The best memories are the ones you make with your friends on crazy adventures, where nothing happens twice. Those are the memories that you could one day tell your grandkids!

Have a physical tune up.,
Bring the right date.,
Show off your special skills.,
Engage your audience.",How to Make People Notice You at Your High School Reunion," Even if you are now the proud owner of a major league baseball team, you still want to look your best at the big party.


Visit the dermatologist. After the 10 year reunion you probably want to look like the youngest classmate in the room. Whether a simple face peel or a little Botox will do the job, schedule this appointment weeks or possibly months in advance so any “work” that needs to be done can heal and let the final result shine.
Make a hair, teeth and skin appointment. Have your look updated so you can be the belle of the ball. Women should have their makeup evaluated by a professional and men should consider whether hitting the reunion with the Tom Selleck mustache is really a good idea. Also, hair styles are very important to looking your best. Have your do updated and professionally colored if necessary. However, distinguished grey may help you punctuate that you are the picture of success. Don't neglect the dentist. A fresh, white smile will remove years from your face and give you the polished look you need.
Get in shape. You don’t have to be completely muscle bound or flash your six pack like “The Situation” but you will want to look like you’ve taken care of your body over the years. This endeavor, like the visit to the dermatologist, should begin months in advance, especially if you need to drastically lose weight. Going on a crash diet may not get you the results you desire so plan ahead by implementing a sensible food and exercise regime.
Find the right outfit. You want to be noticed but not called out as a fashion victim so finding the right outfit for the big night is key. Consider consulting with an in-store fashion expert to assist you with finding the exact wardrobe to help you accomplish your task or bring along your spouse or partner for assistance.;
, In the movies characters end up hiring that super attractive escort to be their date (if they are dateless), however escorts that look like William Baldwin or Julia Roberts are not for hire by the dozens. Instead take more of a strategic approach to find the right person to have on your arm when you make that big entrance.


Your spouse. If you plan to invite your spouse make sure he/she is looking as awesome as you. Without being a jerk give your spouse a secret evaluation and either show up with a new outfit as a special gift or ask your spouse to be “supportive” in your efforts to eat right and exercise by joining you.
Your partner or significant other. Maybe your new boyfriend or girlfriend could be the ideal date. Especially if this is a new love, having him/her by your side may not only be a great way to get noticed but provide you with that extra confidence to show everyone what a stud you really are.
A friend or work colleague (especially if it is a noteworthy or famous person). If you aren’t partnered up with someone, consider bringing the hottest friend or work colleague you know. You could earn extra points if you can find someone who has prominence in the community or society.
Who needs a date? Maybe you are a confident, single successful guy or gal, which means you can hit the reunion and get noticed all on your own. Be sure you are ready to face the room alone as you don’t want to show up alone, only to look like a sad sack instead.

, Without looking like a braggart, draw attention to any talents or skills that will make others stand up and take notice.


Kick out the karaoke jam. If the opportunity arises and you truly have a good voice, grab the mike and belt out your version of Dionne Warwick’s, “I Say a Little Prayer.”
Dance like there’s no tomorrow. Have you and your honey been taking ballroom dancing courses and could possibly land a spot on Dancing with the Stars at this point? Break out your best moves and you’ll have the group circled around you in no time.
Musical talent. Join the band and rock out on rhythm guitar or bust out in a piano solo if you’ve honed your musical skills.
Give sound/good advice. Maybe you are a fashion consultant to major designers or just invented a cool new app; without sounding judgmental or being a thumping bore, provide insight into your industry when asked. Don’t offer up unsolicited advice but be ready to answer questions if the moment presents itself.

, People are most attracted to those who are interested in them. Show your interest in how other people at the reunion are doing, which will make them notice how awesome you are in return.


Ask questions. People love to talk about themselves so give them the platform to expound upon what they’ve been doing since high school. Make sure your questions are sincere so they understand you truly would love to know how well they’ve been doing since graduation and that you wish them only the best.
Find common ground. If you are talking to someone who owns a ranch, tell him/her about your love for horses (if that’s the case). Ask specific insider type questions that will let your former classmate know you have knowledge and an interest in that area too.
Don’t linger too long. Remember, a reunion is a big cocktail party and everyone wants to get a chance to converse with a variety of people. After a 10 to 15 minute conversation, let your classmate know you were happy to have seen him/her and you are going to talk to another friend. Only hanging around for a few minutes also will allow you to make a good but strong impression and perhaps leaving your former classmate wanting for more.

Collect information about your exam dates.,
Recruit people.,
Create a schedule.,
Find an appropriate place to study.,
Decide which subjects to focus on.,
Set a target.",How to Organize a Final Exam Study Group1," Be aware of when your tests take place, as well as the time for each exam that applies to most people in your grade. Note down the dates on a calendar or a planner so that you won't forget. This will help you plan the meetings for your study group. Make sure that your information is correct by checking with teachers or classmates.;
, Ask your classmates if they want to join your study group. Do your best to only gather those who are in your grade. That way, you'll be able to cover most topics that everyone will understand. Those who are older and younger than you may have trouble participating in the study group and won't benefit as much from it. Avoid forcing classmates to join your group, as some may study better by themselves.


Collect people's phone numbers or emails. That way, you'll be able to contact them in case there is a change of plans. They can also let you know if they won't be able to come to a meeting.

, Once you have an appropriate number of people in your study group, discuss the dates and times for your meetings. Since everyone has different schedules, some people may not always be able to come. You should make sure that they'll be able to attend most of the meetings. You should also decide how often you will meet.

, Once you have determined the dates and times for your meetings, try to find a quiet place free of distractions, such as a classroom in your school. Libraries and a classmate's house are also good ideas, although you should check ahead to ensure that it won't be filled with distractions. Be sure that your study location is close to everyone's houses; otherwise, they may have trouble attending. Avoid going to a certain place and holding it without prior permission, as it may already be in use by someone else.

, Before making a choice, make sure that everyone agrees with it. Be sure that your decision is made ahead of time so that they know what supplies to bring. You should also take note of your members' weakest subjects and try to place your attention upon them during your meetings. At the end of every meeting, talk with your group and decide what subject to study during your next meeting.

, Decide how many subjects that your group should cover before you're completely prepared. You should also discuss how much information needs to be studied during your meetings so that you're ready for the final exam. It may not be possible to focus on every single detail, but do your best to cover most of the information during your meetings.

"
"
Prepare snacks and water.,
Take short breaks.,
Discuss the subject.,
Stay focused on studying.,
Maintain a good environment.",How to Organize a Final Exam Study Group2," You and your members can take turns bringing food to the meetings, but make sure that the place you're using allows it. The group can eat some during breaks, which will help keep them alert. Avoid snacks that are messy or difficult to eat. Discourage people from eating while studying, as it may become too distracting for others.

, If you cram too much information in your head, you'll be less likely to grasp it. Giving everyone time to breathe is important, as it'll reduce the risks of them becoming frustrated or exhausted. Set a timer so that you don't lose track of time, and allow everyone to take a moment to relax. A break lasting five to ten minutes should suffice. Make sure that everyone starts studying soon after.

, Remember to ask questions or opinions about the topic you're studying, as this is a study group. Have some educational talks and talk about different concepts together, as this may help people understand the subject even more. Don't be afraid to ask for help or solve problems together if necessary. You could also create study guides together and use them to test each other.

, It's easy to lose focus and begin talking with your members. However, remember to keep your attention on your goal, which is to understand the information for your final exam. Set a good example for others by not wasting time and focusing on studying. If you see others talking, you may want to warn them and gently guide them back to their studies.


If there are certain members that are distracting your entire group, give them a warning. If they continue wasting time, you may want to talk with your classmates and consider banning them from the group. Although you should be polite and kind, you should know when to stand up and be firm. Let them know that you mean business and that they aren't helping the group.

, Keeping a friendly, calming atmosphere around everyone will encourage people with their studies. Being warm and helpful to others will not only boost your reputation but also make them feel comfortable and welcome in the group. Avoid keeping a serious, rigid environment around you, as it will make your classmates feel wary and perhaps distract them from studying.

Practice good personal hygiene.,
Pick out a nice outfit.,
Come prepared.,
Arrive early.,
Keep your schedule with you.,
Listen to your teachers.,
Be on your best behavior.,
Participate in class.",How to Make a Good First Impression in High School," Being clean and having good personal hygiene is always important, but it's even more important when trying to make a good first impression. Some high schools even have picture day on the first day, which is an even greater excuse to look your best. The night before or the morning of school, take a shower or a bath, and make sure to wash your body and your hair. Don't forget to wash and moisturize your face, and brush your teeth and hair in the morning.


Don't forget to wear deodorant! Even if you think you don't smell, you could be wrong. And because you're usually nervous on the first day of school, you'll probably be sweating more than normal, which may cause some extra body odor or sweat stains.
Make sure you smell good. Taking a shower is enough to accomplish this, but a little bit of perfume or cologne might be nice as well. Make sure to only use a small amount, because overdoing it will make you smell just as bad. Also, keep in mind that some students are allergic to scents like perfume/cologne, so if you choose to wear some, keep it very minimal.;
, It's important to wear clothes that make you feel good about yourself. Pick something that you feel comfortable in and that makes you feel confident. However, avoid clothing that is against your school's dress code, such as short-shorts, low-cut tops, and anything with bad language or racist pictures on them - this will result in a trip to the principal's office, which makes a horrible impression.


When picking out your outfit, don't worry too much about what others are wearing - focus on choosing something that's comfortable for you. For example, just because your friends are wearing spaghetti-strap tops doesn't mean you have to if you don't like having your shoulders exposed.

, Although you probably won't be doing any intense note-taking on the first day of school, it's still a good idea to arrive with some basic school supplies so that you'll be prepared for any situation that might arise. Your teachers might want you to jot down a few basic notes about their class, so it's a good idea to bring some writing utensils like pens and pencils, as well as a notebook or some loose-leaf paper. It may also be a good idea to bring a combination lock with you (unless your school provides you with one), so that if lockers are assigned on the first day, you'll be able to put your lock on right away. You may also want to go to your school's website and print out a map of your school to bring with you, or take a picture of the school map on your phone so that you know your way around. Being prepared will help you make a good impression on your teachers and on your fellow students as well.

, Show up a good 10-15 minutes before you're supposed to arrive at school. This gives you enough time to find your friends and catch up with them, and will also ensure that you have enough time to find your classes. Teachers hate it when students are late, and even though they'll probably let it slide on the first day, you don't want to be remembered as ""the late kid"".

, On the first day of high school, many students shove their schedules into their lockers and try to memorize their classrooms on their own, which only causes them to be late, make their teachers angry, and embarrass themselves. Don't be the student that walks into the wrong class because you forgot that you had English after lunch. If you don't want to walk around with a paper schedule in your hand, take a picture of it on your phone so that you'll always have it with you.

, Even on the first day of school, teachers will still be sharing important information with you, such as their classroom expectations, what you'll be doing during the school year, and what materials to bring to class, so it's important to pay attention. This is especially crucial on the first day, because if teachers catch you daydreaming, chatting with your friend, or checking your phone while they're talking, they will have a bad first impression of you.

, It's important to impress your teachers, but it's equally (if not more) important to impress your classmates. After all, these are the people you'll be hanging out with and socializing with. To make sure you're putting your best foot forward, it's important to be friendly and approachable to your classmates. Sometimes teachers will make you sit beside someone you don't know, and if that happens, don't just sit there awkwardly. Instead, be confident - say hello, smile, and introduce yourself to the person beside you. Don't be afraid to make some small talk, like asking them what elementary or middle school they went to or what they did during the summer. You never know what potential friend, or girlfriend/boyfriend, could be sitting inches away from you!


Don't make fun of others. Even if you have a mean thought in your head about someone in your class, keep it to yourself, otherwise everyone will label you as a jerk. Making fun of others impresses nobody, and you could get reported to the principal.
Avoid swearing, as this makes a bad first impression on everyone and may make you seem unapproachable.

, If the teacher asks a question that you know the answer to, don't be afraid to put your hand up and answer it! Your teacher will be pleased that you participate, and your fellow classmates will secretly be thankful to you, because it means they didn't have to answer the question themselves. However, don't overdo it - if you answer every single question the teacher asks, you may be perceived as a bit of a show-off, which won't make a good impression on your classmates. It's fine to answer some questions, but make sure to let your classmates answer a few as well.

Hang out in groups.,
Minimize bullying.,
Take care of yourself physically.,
Sleep enough.,

Relax.,
Take an active interest in your classes.,
Study with friends.,
Use your time in school wisely.",How to Have Fun in High School," There are a broad range of clubs, sports, and other kinds of activities that you can try out. Extracurriculars are a great way to have fun, make new friends, learn about yourself, and even open the door to future career possibilities as you learn about your skills and interests.At the beginning of the year, if you’re unsure of what your interests are, try out a variety of different activities. You’ll quickly find out what you like and can drop the ones you don’t early on.
For example, schools tend to offer many different kinds of sports. In addition to the standard football, soccer, and running teams, more schools are beginning to offer dance and other forms of physical activity. If any of these appeal to you, join them at your school. If your school doesn't offer one that you want, you can always join a rec league in the community.
If you are already passionate about a few different things, pursue them! Join that cooking club or soccer team. You’ll be sure to meet new friends as you’ll already know that you have some common ground.
Don’t be shy. Life is too short to not try out new things. Regardless of the outcome, you’re far more likely to regret not having done something than having done it.;
, If you have a hobby and your school doesn’t offer any classes or clubs that focus on that, start your own club! Not only will it be great experience (and make you stand out in your college applications) but starting a new project/organization can be extremely satisfying and also make you broaden your social circle to find new people who share your interest.


For example, if you love poetry, reach out to your English or Creative Writing teacher to ask about creating a literary journal.

, Doing so will not only broaden your horizons by putting you in contact with people outside of your high school, but you may find something more suited to as your specific interest. Also, having a change of scenery can do wonders for your mental health.


Students can really shine outside of school in many different roles such as volunteers, interns, or community members.If you’re an animal lover, look into animal welfare organizations to volunteer or secure an internship with them. Or, if you care about preserving natural landscapes, you can go online or ask around about community efforts to preserve the wild areas around you.

, It takes time and effort to get close to people, but having even just one or two best friends can make all the difference in how much you enjoy high school. When meeting people, bear in mind that the other students are likely just as uncertain of themselves as you may feel.Just be patient and open to whoever comes along and eventually you’ll meet those people that you click with and grow a strong friendship with.


The key to making friends is to be an open, kind person and a good conversationalist. When meeting people, ask them about their lives and interests and show them that you are really listening. Try to maintain a natural flow of conversation and find traits or interests that you share.
Don’t try to think of friend groups as “cliques” and don’t try to force yourself into an already formed friend group unless they are all open and friendly to you. Since high school is a time when many people are still forming their identities, many react by forming exclusive groups. However, instead of falling into that hierarchical mindset, treat people like human beings and try to connect with them on a deeper level. This may take more time and effort than just falling into a specific stereotypical “clique” but the friendships you do form will be more honest and rewarding in the long run.

, Make sure to schedule time outside of school with your friends. There are a wide variety of activities you can do with your friends depending on your interests. What’s important is that you maintain regular contact with them as you guys will not only have fun with each other but you’ll also strengthen the bond of friendship.


Going swimming, playing video games, having sleepovers, or crafting are just a few ideas of fun activities you can do with friends.
Just make sure that your socializing doesn’t get in the way of your academic work.
Be sure to ask your parents for permission, particularly if they have to pick you up or if you are having friends over at your house. Being considerate of your parents beforehand will demonstrate your maturity to them and they will likely be more willing to support your efforts to have a healthy social life.

, Don’t turn down invitations to parties, dances, movie showings unless you have a good reason. High schoolers tend to do more group activities so saying “yes” to these activities will not only give you an opportunity to have a good time, but you’re also likely to meet and make new friends.


When hanging out at parties where other people are engaging in dangerous activities, like drinking or doing illegal drugs, stick to your values and don’t partake just because everyone around you is doing it. It can feel awkward to say no but you will have much more fun and feel better about yourself if you don’t cave to peer pressure. If people around you give you a hard time, come up with a simple excuse like “I have a bad reaction to substances” or “I could get randomly tested for my job/sport/internship.”Never let anyone pressure you into engaging in any sexual acts that you are not comfortable with. If someone starts to make fun of you or otherwise try to “convince” you to have sex with them, that is coercion and sexual assault. Remember, you always have the right to say no.

, Whether you are targeted by a bully or see others around you being targeted, do what you can to minimize the harmful effects of bullying. Bullying is unfortunately very common in high school but can be traumatizing for the individual and also contribute to a negative and unhealthy atmosphere within the school.


If you are being bullied, don’t blame yourself and stay resilient by remembering that bullies often hurt others because they themselves are hurting.Get help. Whether you are being bullied or witness to someone else being bullied, seek a trusted adult and let them know what’s happening especially if yours or someone else’s safety is at stake.
Don’t be a bully yourself. Always treat others with respect and kindness and you will find that most people will reciprocate. If people have a good perception of you, then they’ll be more likely to support and befriend you. This will also decrease the chances of other bullies picking on you., That means eating a nutritious breakfast, getting enough sleep, staying hydrated, and developing healthy habits. Basically, you should follow the advice of your parents and other adults in these areas as doing so really can make a difference in how you feel. Though these habits may not seem “fun” they will contribute to your overall feeling of happiness and wellbeing.


People function best when they feel good physically, are well rested, and have calm, focused energy. They learn and work better and have a better memory. Therefore, taking care of yourself will help make schoolwork easier, leading to you having more time for other fun activities, which will improve your mental wellbeing and make it easier to continue taking care of yourself. Doesn’t that sound like an enticing cycle?

, Aim to sleep about 8-10 hours a night if possible. Teenagers especially need a lot of sleep as they are undergoing many physiological changes.It can be tough to get enough sleep when school starts early in the morning.


If you think you are sleep deprived, try taking a short nap after school (but be sure to set an alarm!) and use the weekends to catch up on sleep.
Don't stay up late on school nights, even if it's to cram for an exam or catch up on homework. Many students don't realize just how much more difficult it is to function and perform well without adequate sleep., Though soda and other sugary drinks are popular in high school, they also are very dehydrating. If you do drink sugary drinks or caffeine, be sure that you are getting enough water to replace the lost liquid. Our bodies and brains depend a great deal on water to function properly and so when we deprive ourselves of it, we are more sluggish and irritable., For many, high school is a time to try new things and for some, this means dating and sometimes illicit activities, such as drugs or having sex. Take some time to reflect on your values and then stick to them.


Research has shown that most high schoolers overestimate the prevalence of sexual activity and drug use.That means that just because it may seem like everyone around you is doing drugs or drinking, that doesn’t mean it’s actually true. A lot of high schoolers like to exaggerate their rebellious behaviors to seem cool so keep that in mind when you are offered drugs or alcohol or asked about your own behaviors.
Don’t engage in sexual acts until you know you are ready. Many high schoolers may pretend that casual sex is not a big deal, but the fact is that sex can have long term consequences, especially if you don’t use protection. If you begin dating someone in high school, don’t let them pressure you into doing anything you aren’t comfortable with.

, High school doesn’t last forever so take the time to enjoy it! It goes by faster than you might think. This doesn't mean slack off, it just means don't overdo it. A healthy work ethic is important, but also take time to unwind. Find the balance between the things you have to do (such as homework and chores) and the things you enjoy doing (such as extracurriculars and seeing your friends). Whether it’s reading a book, writing a poem, shooting hoops, or even vegging out in front of the TV, do what you need to do to calm down. High school can be a very challenging time and is often a juggling act of schoolwork, extracurriculars, family obligations, and more so make sure to know when you just need a break from it all and take that time to yourself.

, You’re in school to learn so you may as well make the most of your time in class. Taking an active interest will not only keep up your grades, but you may find that you genuinely enjoy certain subjects. You’ll learn what your passions and strengths are and also get to appreciate the rewarding feeling of overcoming difficulties in the subjects you struggle in.


Stay engaged. Don’t be afraid to ask questions until you understand the material. If you daydream during class or don’t keep up with assignments, you will quickly be overwhelmed and stressed out which is no fun at all. Do your best to not only excel academically but appreciate the process.
If your school allows you to choose certain electives, pick ones that you think will genuinely enjoy. Have you always wanted to learn how to draw? Take an art class. Dream about living in Paris one day? It’s always better to start learning a new language sooner rather than later and once you’re out of school, you’ll have to pay for any classes. Try to see your coursework as opportunities to learn and grow rather than as a chore.
If you're still struggling to manage your workload or keep up in certain classes, talk to your teachers and meet with a counselor to get help with time management and ways to succeed in your classes.

, Not only are you getting some laughs in while doing work, but you can help each other out with different subjects. For example, if you are a math whiz while your best friend is more an arts/lit minded person, you can informally tutor each other., The school day can seem to drag on but if you are intentional about how you use your time, you’ll not only have more fun in school but you may have more time left over when school ends to socialize.


If you have any free periods or long lunches, try alternating between socializing and studying or doing homework on different days. If you establish such a routine, you can look forward to the days you spend with your friends and use the other days to get work done. That way, you’ll stay on top of your classes and you’ll free up more of your time outside of school to pursue your own hobbies.
Try to get a head start on the assignments in classes you struggle with. For example, if you find geometry to be difficult, working on the homework during a lunch break is a great idea as you’ll not only be more alert than in the evening but you can also seek out your teacher that same day if you get stuck on a problem. They’ll be impressed by your initiative and you’ll likely get the most challenging work done with first which will make your evenings more enjoyable.

Take some leisure time.",How to Have Fun Being an Outcast in High School," As cliché as it is, your social position in high school really won't matter ten years from now. Your social ranking in school does not prevent you from turning your life around and doing what you want to do, whether it's now or in the future. It's crucial to realize that this is only one part of your life, and while it may feel like a lot now, it's not going to mean a whole lot in the future.


If you used to be popular, and now you're an outcast, that's okay, too. People shed labels all the time, since many of them no longer fit or apply to their lives.;
, There may be a specific reason that you're an outcast, or there may not be. Regardless, it's important to recognize that your social standing doesn't affect your worth and that you're still an important person with many good qualities and some flaws. You're not perfect, but you don't need to be. You're fine just the way you are, outcast or not, and anything that may contribute to you being an outcast is fine, too.


Recognize that no matter what makes you different - whether it's your identity, your interests, a disability, a hobby, a rank in school or work, or anything else - you're still your own person, and your traits make you into who you are. There's nothing wrong with that.

, Feeling ostracized by your peers can take a toll on your self-esteem, which isn't good for anyone, and will make your high school experience a whole lot less enjoyable. It's important to remember the good things about yourself, and know that those things are necessary parts of your self-identity. Take some time and write a list of what you're good at.


For example, if you're a good cook, good at writing, and good at photography, write those things down. List your talents, achievements, and things you do that make you feel good.
Don't put down your strengths! If you catch yourself falling into the trap of ""I like science, but I'm not good at it"" or ""I'm good at socializing, except for that one time when..."", take a step back and remind yourself that you're looking for your strengths, not your flaws or one-time mistakes.

, Everyone has their weaknesses, and acknowledging them will help you grow. Take a neutral standpoint and write a list of things that you don't think you do very well, things that you wish you didn't do, and what you can do to improve those things (and therefore, improve yourself). Be honest - don't shy away from writing down things you're embarrassed about or ashamed of. If you can acknowledge that you did something you're not proud of, you can take another step towards not doing it again.


Nothing prevents you from changing as a person. Even if you have a history of treating others poorly, there's nothing stopping you from changing your thought processes and treating people better.
If you find yourself slipping into negative thought patterns while doing this, such as ""I can't do anything right"" or ""There's nothing good about me"", stop those thoughts. Take a break to do something you enjoy, and remember your good qualities.

, This doesn't mean to change yourself to fit in with others; this means to change any potentially harmful or destructive behaviors you may have. For example, constantly interrupting people is a habit that may discourage others from talking to you and is a habit that you may want to change. You don't need to change yourself into not being an outcast, but getting rid of bad habits can make your high school life a lot easier in many ways.


If you have self-destructive habits such as self-injuring, excessively drinking, suicidal ideation, or anything else that could have severe negative impacts on your life, find someone who can help you, whether it's a trusted adult, a professional, or even someone on the other end of a crisis hotline. You deserve to feel happy and loved, even if you don't think so.

, As you get older and go through high school, things will change over time. Some of these things might be your social ranking, or someone else's social ranking, or just life in general. People take different stances on life, and many of them grow up and mature (especially in high school). Your status as an outcast may change - but so may your view of being an outcast. You won't feel this way forever.


Your freshman year will be much different from your senior year, in combination with people maturing and life changes.

, If being an outcast is hard for you to cope with, you don't need to suffer in silence. Find someone who you can talk to, such as a family member, a close friend, or a professional. Don't stay silent - you don't need to go through this alone.

, If absolutely everything you do doesn't help you and you still end up miserable throughout high school, just remember that high school is only a few years long. Once you're done with it, you'll go on to live your life in the way that you want to - whether it involves traveling, working, building new relationships, or anything else that you choose to do. Those three or four years in high school aren't going to be especially significant in the long run.


If you really don't want to have to deal with all of that time, see if it's possible for you to graduate high school early. While it's not a path that everyone chooses to take, it lets you get out of school earlier. However, this may affect the graduation activities that you get to participate in.

Dropping out of school may seem like a viable solution, but it can have an extremely negative impact on things like job prospects. However, you can consider dropping out if you have more reasons for it than just being an outcast.

, Yes, you're an outcast. Does that need to affect everything you do or say? A negative attitude will only drive others away from you, isolating you and just making you more of an outcast! Even though it can be hard, do your best to be positive and kind. You may end up making friends that way - and even if you don't, you'll be more likable than someone who's rude and arrogant.


Keep in mind that the energy you put out affects who approaches you. Someone who scowls all day, is sarcastic and snarky, and is generally negative will attract more negative people than someone who does their best to have a smile on their face and be positive.
It's okay to have bad days, but do your best to not be a complete rage-filled monster on those days. There's a difference between glaring at someone who bumped into you in the halls, and screaming at them.

, Even if it doesn't get you anywhere in terms of your social ranking, being friendly is important. By smiling and waving at people, and showing receptiveness to others being friendly to you, you open yourself up to potentially making friends and showing others that you're comfortable in your own skin. And even if you're friendly to people treating you poorly, who knows? Maybe you'll even get them to stop being rude to you!


Be friendly towards your teachers, too! Even if you don't like them, it's best to be polite. Remember, they're your teachers, so if you get on their bad side and then get in trouble, they're not likely to back you up, even if they know you're in the right.

, Homework's not fun, but school will be a whole lot less fun if you fail all your classes and have to repeat them. Do your best to get good grades (or improve them, if they're low), and get extra help in class when you need it. If you have good grades, that's one less thing that can prevent you from having fun as an outcast.


If being an outcast is causing you problems with your grades - for example, nobody will pair up with you for group work and it's affecting your grade - talk to your teacher and find a solution to the problem. Many times, teachers are willing to make accommodations for students who are doing their best.

, Being an outcast isn't the end of the world, but at the same time, it's nice to have people to spend time with. If being an outcast is disappointing to you, then consider trying to find other outcasts to spend your time with. Even if you don't think you're like them, or you're disgusted at the thought of spending time with outcasts, consider that they might actually turn out to be great friends of yours and that you won't need to spend all your time at school alone.


Strike up conversations with your classmates. Search for those with similar interests and mindsets.
Try talking to the quieter kids or the kids that you wouldn't expect yourself to hang out with. Oftentimes, the people you don't expect to find yourself friends with turn out to be better people than you anticipated.
Be cautious with certain crowds. While you're free to spend time with whoever you want to, you should be feeling happy with your friends, not on-edge or lousy. If your ""friends"" put you down, leave them. It's better to be alone than to have people around who don't appreciate you for who you are. (And, obviously, your friends should never pressure you to do anything illegal or that you're not comfortable with.)
It's okay to prefer being alone. Many introverts prefer to be alone.

, Yes, you've been told it time and time again, but if you're getting bullied, the best thing to do is to ignore them. Bullies just want to get a reaction out of you and see that they're making you miserable, and remember, they don't truly understand you - even if you thought they did. (If they understood you, why would they be trying to upset you?) Tune them out, go somewhere else, and just prove to them - and to yourself, too - that they won't get a reaction out of you.


That being said, you don't have to suffer if someone is being cruel or abusive. If this person won't stop bothering you, talk to an adult and figure out a solution. If the adult doesn't listen or care, go to more adults until somebody actually helps you. Just because you're an outcast doesn't mean you have to put up with people treating you poorly.

, School doesn't have to be entirely boring, no matter whether it's during breaks or after classes - and extracurriculars can be a great place to find friends, too, if you want them. Check out your school's list of clubs or extracurricular options, or ask your school counselor if they know of anything you could have a look at. And if all else fails, try looking to see if you can start your own club at school - you may well bring people together with it!


Join a club that sounds interesting to you. It doesn't matter what that club is - just check it out, see if it's interesting, and if it is, join.
Sports teams are a common choice for high schoolers, but you can also check out things like robotics teams and community service teams.

, Your teenage years are hectic and ever-changing, so why spend them trying to be anything but a better person than you used to be? Trying to shove yourself into a narrow, confined ""personality box"" and act or look a certain way won't get you anywhere, nor will faking friendships or happiness. Why would you want to spend your high school years in a personality that doesn't fit you? Your personality and interests grow and shape on their own; trying to force them to grow in a certain direction won't do anything except make you miserable when it doesn't work the way you want it to.


Attempting to fit in with popular kids won't do much, especially if you used to be one of them but aren't popular now. This will most likely just subject you to ridicule.
Spend time doing things and hanging out with people that you actually like, not people you pretend to like. There's nothing worse than doing something you don't like just because you're worried about what your peers will think about you.

, Even if you're an outcast, it's important to keep your grades up. Your grades do have an influence on not only what you do in the future, but on your work ethic, as well. Developing a strong work ethic and learning how to manage your work and prioritize it will be important later on in life - or even now, if you end up getting a job as a teen.



Make studying fun, if you have trouble with it. There's no law dictating that studying needs to be boring.
Study in a way that suits you best. If you learn best by reading from the textbook, then do that. If you learn best by creating study guides, do that. As long as you can remember the information, it doesn't matter the method you used to remember it.

, Chances are, you already have some hobbies that you like to do, even if they're not your absolute favorite things or things that you're very talented at. You can try using these enjoyable activities as rewards for when you finish something or try something new, to develop a sense of self-discipline. It's important to make sure that you're not just boring yourself throughout your high school years!

, Whether it's driving, baking, biotechnology, music synthesizing, or anything else that you find an interest in, finding something to learn about can give you a new hobby or skill that you can choose to pursue. Who knows what you'll end up doing and/or enjoying in the future? If you use your high school years to experiment around with new things, you might even find your passion.

, Yeah, it's probably not what you want to do, but the vast majority of the time, your family would be happy to spend their time with you. Chat with your parents at the dinner table, spend some time with your older sister, hang out with your younger brother, and make sure they know that you love them. The bond with your family is one of the most important ones you have.


Not all teens live in the best family situations. If your family is abusive or dysfunctional, it may not be the best choice to try and be close with family members who do harmful things. In severe cases, know when to report child abuse.

, You don't need to spend your whole high school life alone, especially during times when you're not even in school. If you don't have friends, then try looking online for meetup groups or events that you can attend that would target people in your age group. There's no need to be alone if you don't want to be alone.


It's okay if the only friends you have are online. You can still spend time with them - whether it's by emailing, using social media, instant messaging, or talking with them over voice calls or video chats.

, Many people describe volunteering as a wonderful experience that changes you as a person. While it might not drastically change your life, volunteering can give you a new perspective on things - and failing that, it gives you community service hours and something to do that makes you feel better about helping others. Search online for volunteer opportunities, or ask your school if they know of any opportunities for you.


Volunteering doesn't have to happen outside of the home. There are many organizations that allow you to volunteer online.

, Not all teens can or choose to work, but some teens decide to gain work experience, and maybe earn some money. Try looking through your school for job openings or internships, or looking online and seeing what jobs are being offered to teens. Just be aware that working a job or internship is a big responsibility, so you'll need to be prepared for that if you choose to work.


It's completely okay to not want to get a job. Not all teens want to (or can) work, especially considering that they already have school and studying, as well as other things that take up time in their lives.
If your state requires it, make sure that you receive a work permit from your school before trying to get a job, or you may not be able to work.
Try to pick a job that you'd enjoy more than you dislike. If you're not a very social person, then it wouldn't be a good idea to take a job that involves constant interaction with people. As a teen, your options are limited, and nobody is going to enjoy all parts of their job, but unless you absolutely have to, don't take a job just because it's the only job you can find.

, Despite all the things you're doing, it's important not to overwork yourself and get overwhelmed. Even if you're doing things you enjoy, sometimes it's good to take some time to yourself and allow yourself to really engage in something that makes you happy - whether it's playing video games, drawing, synthesizing music, programming, or anything else. Find a day when you aren't busy and allow yourself to use that free time for yourself. It's always important to have time to recharge and enjoy something.

, Developing a relationship with your teachers is an important thing because when you're wrapping up your high school career you will need those connections. If you seem eager they are also more likely to give you some useful advice for homework projects and exam revision.

Make sure to introduce yourself after the first class; let them know you are excited for their course and for this school year.







, There is no better way to feel connected to your school than by being a part of it! By joining something in your school you meet new people with a common interest and without even realizing it, you will have made a bond that could last a lifetime.

, You do not want to be that student at the end of the semester who has to beg, borrow and steal for those extra few points. Chances are, if you're keeping up with homework and studying you'll do just fine.

, Your teachers became educators to make a positive difference in your life. They do not want to see you fail, let them know you are struggling and need help. It is better to ask for help now than retake a course later!

, Right now, it may not seem all the rage to be decked out all of spirit week, but trust those who no longer have done it, they end up being some of the greatest weeks of your four years in high school. You will develop more positive feelings towards your school by showing you are proud to be a (insert mascot here).

, Don't be the teenager who sits inside playing video games or watches TV all night on the weekends. Find your friends, go out and have fun. Your years in high school are not merely defined by what you do in the classroom; a lot of your memories should include the things you did with your friends. You know, those crazy things that you can only get away with when you're under 18.

, There will be points during your high school career where you want to cry, pull your hair out and possibly just drop out of school all together. But if you learn to laugh it off, everything will be okay. The truth is, high school can be emotionally draining. Between school work, drama and just growing up, you will be spread so thin at times; however, it's important to keep in mind that it won't last forever. Smile and learn to laugh.

, Pete Rose once said ""you owe it to yourself to be the best you possibly can be."" Sure, he was talking baseball, but it is so apparent in high school. If you do not constantly push yourself, you will never realise your true potential.

By senior year you will realise that you know practically nothing about life because you are only just getting started.
By challenging yourself, you can be the best version of yourself and that is an important lesson that can carry you throughout your lifetime. Because maybe you don't know much about life, but you may be a pro at chem, music, or English. The only way to know is to try to find out.







, Each year of high school gets a little tougher. Both in and out of the classroom. You're growing up! You get your braces off, then you get your permit, you take those dreaded SAT/ACT tests and all of a sudden you are applying to college. You may feel like you're drowning... but that is totally normal. But just recognize the fact that you're doing it. You're alive, you're here and you are still swinging.

, There is a need for an unbiased advice. Guidance Counselors are fit enough to give that.

, Don't be afraid to ask. It's their job to help you.

, Do something. Nothing is going to happen if you're just going to mope around like there's no tomorrow. Remember that school is a place for learning, to attain education. At times you fail, but as long as there's a new day welcoming you, you always have the choice to be the change you want to see.

, The internet is not just about the social networking sites. There are a lot of substantial sites out there waiting to expand what you learn from school.

, Explore different genres of books. Start with what attracts you then as you go on and on, try to be flexible by trying out books which are way out of your interests. The next time the teacher's going to give you handouts, you're going to accept it with a smile and not with a look as if it's the end of the world for you. Another good thing about enhancing your reading skills is how it's going to affect your writing too. You'll have a lot to say and that's a good feeling.

, Never be afraid to raise your hand and speak your mind. It adds up to the confidence level. Keep in mind that what you say controls the perception of others in you. So express yourself but at the same time be responsible.

, Discover more of what you are capable of by signing up for organizations you think you're going to learn a lot from. Are you a budding writer? Then hone your craft by writing for the school paper. Are you having trouble with math? Math club's open to teach you the tricks!

, It's your free period and you have nothing to do. Don't just sit there and daydream. Talk to your classmates. Socialize. Get to know them more. You might find the right person/ the right set of people who you could be yourself with. That's the best feeling.

, Set a schedule for each so you can never sacrifice time away from family and friends all because you were not able to accomplish something when you had time.

, It shows you respect your teacher and you respect yourself. Don't be a victim of cheating. You don't need to be a perfectionist to do this. When you do something, ask yourself ""How should I present myself?""

, You define your grades. Grades are just numbers. You, on the other hand, are someone who is so much more than getting an A or an F, a 100 or a 65, a 1.00 or a 5.00, only if you try to see it for yourself. Learning is NOT JUST about the memorization. At the end of the day, it also requires application to fully embrace itself. Application shows that you learned. You helped. You contributed. You saved. And that's the legacy you want to be known for, right?

, Concentrate on a part of the playground or some landscape (if you can see any). Try to work out what people are doing if you can see activity outside. Imagine yourself doing that too.

, There are lots of things you can do mentally, such as looking around the room and playing a game of snog, marry, avoid. Or, do a game of tic-tac-toe with an invisible opponent, all in your head.

, You could stare at a piece of paper on your desk or the hair of the person in front of you and try to move it with your 'powers'. Or, you could imagine what would happen if you had a magical wand that could whisk you and your friends away to a strange land.

, Turn all of the lessons on your timetable into magical lessons instead. For example, English could become charms and math could become defense against the dark arts. If you have house colors and can see these colors on people, sort each person into a Hogwarts house.


Stare at everyone you hate and 'cast a curse on them'.

, Make it as convoluted and crazy as you like, as it's all in your head. It could include people in the class, your friends or made-up people. In fact, it doesn't even need to include people. Be creative in your storytelling.

, Use it to draw interesting and intricate doodles. Perhaps do your name as a doodle, or something relevant to the class.

, There's no time like the present to get on with it.

, Develop your own secret code. If you have a friend in class, invent a secret language using winks, ear pulling and nose blowing.

, Be careful not to let out too loud a breath when you start to breathe again, or to let tears stream down your face after not blinking.

, Try to find the useful points and write them down slowly. Perhaps write down your own opinions about each of the points, to help spur you to think instead of switch off.

Talk to a professional.",How to Survive in School When You Forget Your Homework Regularly1," Your first priority should be figuring out why you forget your homework. Are you too busy or just short on motivation? Start by asking your yourself and then move to people who know you well.


Ask your parents. They know you well enough to diagnose the issue. They also might be able to help you organize your time and remind you of homework assignments. You should however, refrain from getting them involved in actually completing your homework.For more perspectives, ask friends who know you well or people close to you at school who have experience with your study habits. If you are involved in extracurricular activities, ask peers in the same groups if they have trouble with homework and how they manage it.;
, You should allot a specific time every day to homework. For some, this might be the first hour after return home. Others, who need a break, might want to plan to work for about an hour or hour and a half starting at 7:00 p.m. Tell your parents about your schedule, so that they can check up on you before you start working and leave you alone to focus on your work.If you set aside this time and you find yourself constantly distracted by your computer or a video game, your problem might be a bad habit. Focus your energy on trying to break the habit.
If you find it impossible to set aside this time, the problem might be your schedule. Take some time to make a schedule. You might find that you will need to drop some of your activities to make time for homework.
Try to get your parents involved in homework time. Encourage them to be quiet to minimize distractions. Ask them for help, but don’t get them to do your homework for you., Take some time to consider what you want to do with your life. Consider what bad grades might mean for your goals. Talk to counselors, teachers, and parents about what it takes to realize your life goals. Try to make learning a priority and remember that sometimes boring repetition is important to fully mastering an idea.If this does not work, try set up some sort of external motivation. Ask your parents to reward—or punish—you according to your performance in school., Remember your attitude counts! Try to maintain a good teacher-student relationship. Don’t cause trouble in class and stay focused. Your teacher might be more likely to forgive some of your mistakes if they believe you are doing your best.


If you are forgetting homework, try to participate in class and do well on quizzes to bring up your grade.

, If nothing seems to make it easier for you to concentrate, talk to a counselor or psychiatrist. ADHD can make it harder for you to remember homework assignments. They would be able to tell you whether or not you ought to consider medication to improve your focus."

Create a planner.,
Break up large assignments.,
Create a homework folder.",How to Survive in School When You Forget Your Homework Regularly2," Purchase a day planner that allows you to write down your assignments. Write down assignments as soon as they are mentioned in class. Write down all details, including the due date, page numbers, and requirements for the assignment. Review your planner every day before you sit down for your daily homework time., Don’t wait until the last second to finish big assignments. Set goals in your planner, like when you want to complete research, an outline, and a draft of your paper. Try to arrange your schedule so that you complete drafts for papers several days before they are due. That way, you can go back and edit them with fresh eyes. The stress of completing a paper at the last second can also be debilitating.


Sometimes we procrastinate because we are afraid of failure. You need to conquer these fears. Even great writers have terrible first drafts. The process of editing is how bad writing becomes good. If you are too afraid of failure to start early, failure is precisely what you will get.
If procrastination is a problem, consider creating a designated work space, free of distractions. Leave your books and other work material around. If your environment is telling you to work, your brain might just get the message., So that you don’t lose your assignments, keep a separate homework binder for all of your completed assignments. Keep notes and other course materials in their own binders for their respective subjects."

Choose the right pajamas.,
Don't skimp on hygiene.,
Make sure you have everything you need/want for the day.,
When you get to school, take off your coat and shoes and put on your slippers and robe if you packed them.,
Be confident!",How to Survive Having to Wear Footies on Pj Day," Unless you're on your last pair of pjs, pajama day doesn't mean that you have to wear what you slept in the night before! Consider the pros and cons of your pajamas as you decide what to wear. The pjs you slept in may zip up in the back, but wearing ones with a front zipper will make PE changes and bathroom breaks easier. Pay similar attention to pattern and fabric: if you feel self conscious, try to avoid wearing childish patterns; if it is a hot day, stay away from fleece. Just make sure to clear the pjs you intend to wear with your parents first.
, Just because you aren't changing out of your pajamas before you go to school doesn't mean you should skip the other parts of your morning routine. Make sure you brush your teeth and shower if you do that in the morning. Don't wear pajamas you've been wearing for multiple days either., Aside from normal school supplies and homework, many schools allow you to bring blankets and stuffed animals on pajama day. If you are wearing slippers to school make sure you have sneakers for PE. If you're self-conscious, bringing and wearing a robe over your pajamas can make them look like pajama pants from a distance., If you are wearing back zip pajamas, don't forget to ask the nurse for a note for when you need to use the bathroom before class starts., You can rock pretty much anything as long as you wear it with confidence. Pajama day is all about comfort, it is not a fashion show. If someone starts to poke fun, you can remind them of that.

, The most fool-proof method is to just not mention it. You'll be surprised how many kids have already forgotten. However, if it happened recently or it was in front of a lot of people, you could consider owning the event. When you meet up with friends you haven't seen say, ""You will not believe what happened to me!"" and share the event. If you feel up to it, make the story funny. Oftentimes, the act of doing this will help you personally come to terms with the event. If you feel very confident, you could try to make this a part of your reputation. Maybe this can be a fun thing, not a sad thing?


Owning the story is not for most people. Only attempt it if you have a very high self-esteem and you are no longer embarrassed about the event. You may think that so many people know that it isn't worth ignoring, but you are probably over-estimating the number of mean kids in your school. Go to the first day and see if anyone mentions it. If so, you can bunt to owning the story. If not, move on to the next step.

, If people see you all scared and red-faced they will remember that embarrassing moment. After all: you remember the moment better than anyone else does. And in your head, you might be inflating the number of people who know. It's likely that no one cares about this event as much as you do. Maybe no one will bring it up at all! Especially if it happened near the beginning of the summer, you might have nothing to worry about.

, Again, it's another chance for people to remember. Also, you will have to come out sometime! You might not get teased while eating lunch in the bathroom, but.... you're eating lunch in the bathroom! No matter how bad this problem is, if you face it, it will end eventually. If you refuse to show your face, this could go on forever. After all, is a life of hiding and fearing school every day really what you want? This may be the easiest choice, but it really will make your problem worse. You can handle this.

, Maybe try making friends with the new kid in your class. She/He won't know you that well so most likely won't listen to rumors and will be easier to talk to without the ""Wow did you really do this or do that?"" Not only that, but you could be helping someone who was just as nervous about the school year as you were! Having a friend who you are sure isn't judging you from rumors can really help if/when it comes time for you to stand up for yourself. There's power in numbers!

, People are going to take cues from you about whether this event was serious or not. If you act uncomfortable, people will see an opportunity to tease you. However, if you don't appear vulnerable, most kids will back off. After all, it happened in the summer! There's probably something more recent and interesting to gossip about.

, Get involved in lunch conversations, so you'll have something to talk about. Join a club. Improve your grades. Take up a hobby. If you can find something that makes you happy, you can always distract yourself from whatever problem you might face. If school is scary, you'll need a ""safe place"" where you can laugh. If this really does end up damaging your social status, recognize that there are other fun things in the world.

, Don't break any school rules- you don't want an even more negative reputation. Be the first kid to beat a popular video game. Star in the school musical. Play to your strengths- if you're not good at school clubs or popular activities, talk (don't brag) about something else you did outside of school. Or start being really nice and helpful- that's not a bad reputation either (as long as you don't let people step on you)!

, Laugh and say, ""Ha, yeah! I totally collapsed, didn't I?"" or whatever your incident was. However, it's okay if still don't have the confidence for that. Just say ""whatever"" and remove yourself from the conversation. You could also ignore it entirely. It helps if you have friends you can lean on in these situations. Try not to cry or look upset in front of these people- it will encourage them. If you are going to cry, get away as soon as possible. If you avoid showing them you're hurt, they will eventually grow bored. If things are really bad, talk to a parent or teacher. This is becoming bullying.

, No matter what happens, getting your confidence back is step 1. Your own opinion is the only one you'll carry with you forever. You can handle anything someone else throws at you, as long you as you love yourself.

Go to bed early enough on school nights.,
Each morning, get up about two- two and a half hours before you need to leave for school (depending on whether you have to walk or not) .,
Eat breakfast!",How to Survive Fifth Class in Ireland1,"


It's tempting to stay up later and your friends may do so (or say they do!) but getting to bed by 9:30pm means that you'll be happier, smarter, have way better skin and you'll be much more craic the next day!
Don't worry about what your friends might say. If you want, you can always tell them that you go to bed at half ten or eleven. Chances are they have to go to bed early too.;
, Most schools start from 8:45am to 9:30am (all schools do get the same amount of time each day though, the ones that start earlier finish earlier and the ones that start later finish later).

If your hair is really greasy use dry shampoo to freshen up between showers.

Deodorant will not stop you sweating but will mask any bad smells from the sweat. Anti-perspirant will stop you from sweating in the first place. Body sprays smell great and are fun to wear but they do not have any effect on sweat so remember to use a deodorant as well.
You may not need to wear deodorant or antiperspirant everyday yet but you should ask your parents if you can have some to wear during strenuous exercise, like training or a match.
If you aren't allowed used deodorant or antiperspirant sprinkle some talcum powder under your arms instead.

,


Wear the correct school uniform, even if your friends don't.
Remember to bring your kit if you have PE or training. Always wash your sports gear after you wear it.
Remember to wear a coat, scarf, gloves, sunscreen or a sunhat as needs be. Sunscreen may be gross but sunburn is ten times worse.

Dry your hair before school with a hair dryer if it is wet.
Brush or comb your hair everyday, even if it is short.

Style your hair. You might like to wax it or try a plait or ponytail. Don't use heated appliances like straighteners, curlers, hair dryers or crimpers more than once a week. It's not worth the damage you will do.
If you have long hair your school rules might say that it has to be tied up. It is a good idea to tie your hair up anyway in case headlice break out in your school.

, You might like to use mouthwash or dental floss occasionally.

,


A little secret: not only people in Sixth Class but nearly everyone in First Year and loads of people in Second Year haven't kissed a boy or girl, whatever they tell you.
Waiting to have your first kiss with someone you really like is worthwhile because it will be much more special.
Discos are place where most people get their first kiss.
If you have kissed someone, don't boast about it. People will find out themselves and you'll seem way more grown up and cooler if you don't need to make a fuss of it.
Don't talk about the other person behind their back or go around telling people that they're a bad kisser. Not only is it mean, nobody else will want to kiss you in case you slag them off too. Nobody is a good kisser the first time.
Find out the term for kissing with tongues in your area. Ask an older brother, sister or cousin or just listen to friends. French kissing is not a term commonly used in Ireland and you might look a bit odd if you used it out loud! Meeting is a term used in Dublin and in the south of Ireland and shifting is a term used in the northwest. One is always much cooler in an area than another.

,
Find someone who seems to like you, too. Even if they say they ""hate you"" to your face, it could mean they like you.
Ask their friends. Ask them do they say they ""hate you"" behind your back as well. If they do...well, chances are, they don't really like you.

, Most people aren't for a few more years and that's totally normal. It doesn't mean you're any less of a young man or woman and it definitely doesn't mean that you're not as grown up as your friends. You don't have to do anything you don't want to do.

, If there's anyone you suspect of having the virus, try to avoid them. The less contact you have with the virus, the less chance you have of catching it.

, Ask a teacher if there is definitely a bug going around. They may be able to offer some useful intelligence on it. Other students may not be as reliable, so don't take everything they have to say as absolute facts.

, It's time to really ensure you wash your hands before doing anything near your mouth. Don't pick your teeth or eat unless you've just washed your hands. Make sure you wash regularly.

, Your immune system stands a better chance if your body is strong. Eat fruits and vegetables, and come away from processed foods. If possible, bring a packed lunch to school and get your parents to pack healthy food.

, Large groups make it easier for the virus to spread from one infected person to everyone else. The more people there are, the more likely it is that one of them is infected. Keep your distance from them.

, If your school issues bulletins or advice, follow it. Any advice they give you is likely to be up-to-date and tailored to combat this particular virus.

, If the epidemic is becoming serious and people are going to hospital with the illness, this is a last resort. By this stage, however, most schools will close down until the virus passes.

You can practice outside or inside, as long as you are in a space where you can run a distance of twenty meters back and forth. Even if you don't like running, training will improve your score and you'll be able to tolerate the test more.;
, Water is great when you are running, and it will keep you hydrated throughout the duration of the test. You will obviously not be able to grab water in between laps, so right before the test, take a drink of water. Not so much where you need to use the bathroom, but enough where you feel hydrated. After you are done running the test, be sure to grab a drink of water immediately, to prevent dehydration.

, It will make you lose and/or not be able to set a good pace for yourself, and everyone will most likely all be at a different pace. Therefore, when you are running, try your best to block all of the other runners out, and go at your own pace. In the beginning, run a bit slower, but be sure to gradually go faster.

, Everyone is sweating and out of breath too, so don't feel bad if you slow down. Push yourself hard, but not too hard. You should always make a goal number of laps in the beginning that you should try to meet. It will make you work harder, and you may achieve the goal that you set.

, Even if you are getting tired, do not just sit out, as that's the worst thing you can do. Walking for what will be your last lap will most likely make you feel much better.

, Your muscles might be sore for a while, so be prepared for that by taking the time when you get home to relax if you can.

, Wear formal clothes. Generally a dress shirt and slacks or a nice skirt (depending on your gender presentation). Your clothes should be ironed.

, Make sure there are no stains on your clothes and that they are clean and free of odors. You should also avoid heavy cologne or perfume.

, You should look nice and have a nice appearance, but don't try to look too much like an adult. Girls should go very easy on the makeup and boys should be clean-shaven.

, Stand and sit up straight. Try not to look nervous. Appear to be at ease and happy to be there. This shows that you cope well with stress.

, Don't add to a nervous look by being fidgety. Go to the bathroom before your interview and don't drink any coffee that morning.

, Well in advance you should have begun to really focus on getting good grades and working hard in school. Hopefully if your grades are only mediocre, your other qualifications will work in your favor. If you have bad grades, be prepared with a reason.

, Volunteering in your community looks great on your application or resume. There are lots of local groups to work with, but you can also do online volunteering, like patrolling edits for wikiHow or Wikipedia.

, Your hobbies and interests are what make you appear to the school as a fully formed human being. Don't pretend you have interests you don't, just in order to impress them. Any hobby can appeal to your potential school, if presented in the right light.


For example, if you like video games, talk about how studies have show that video games make you a better problem solver and improve dexterity and fine motor control.

, Don't be the sort of person that always sits around on the couch. This will show when they ask you about your activities. Find some way to get out of your house and interact with your world, even if it isn't a sport or traditional physical activity.

, Recommendation letters are important. You can get these from current and past teachers. Just don't go too far back, and try to get them from academic, rather than elective teachers.

, Your resume, application, and all of the papers that you give them should be clean and unwrinkled. They should also look as nice and professional as possible, in terms of design.

, Not too firmly (you don't want to break the poor interviewer's hand), not too softly (remember, you're confident)., Don't act like you and the people interviewing you are buds. Act professional, serious, and respectful.

, Don't be rude or seem like you don't want to be there. Act like a friendly person who enjoys engaging with others.

, Bringing up your family's money or bragging about anything else is in bad form. If they compliment you on something, try to be gracious and acknowledge the people that helped you achieve your goal.

, Look them in the eye when you talk to them. This shows confidence and respect.

, Thank them for meeting with you, pay attention when they talk, show interest in what they're saying, and don't interrupt or try to talk over them. Thank them again when the interview is done.

, Avoid colloquial language (slang), bad grammar, and other bad language. Instead, speak as well as you can and try to say things that matter or show that you're thinking about the issue.

, When you walk into the room or meet them, make sure to introduce yourself. Give a firm (but not hurtful) handshake to show that you are invested in this meeting.

, Come prepared for your interview. Research the school and ask questions that show that you've done your homework. Ask questions in general because it shows that you are taking this seriously.

, You will likely be asked what your goals are for the future so think about this ahead of time. Decide on some goals and get a few ideas for how you think you're going to get there. A plan to reach your goals is almost as important as the goals themselves.

, Read up on other common questions, as well as the best way to respond to those questions. Common questions include:


What is your favorite subject? Why?
Why do you want to come to this school?
How do you think you would contribute to our team?

, It's an interview, so talk to them! Don't just give one or two word responses. They don't need you to dictate a whole book to them, but they should get to talk with you a bit.

, When the interview is done, write and send them a thank you note the next day.

, You want to not just receive from the school but give to the student community there. Also express interest in public service and serving others. They want you to be someone who will get involved there. You should buy a test prep book for the HSPT. The one from KAPLAN is recommended by some.

, Regis High School issues the HSPT, or the High School Placement Test. This test always occurs on the first Saturday of November. It is similar to the Specialized High School Admissions Test for schools like Bronx Science and Brooklyn Tech. There are usually around 1000 applicants taking the test for 230 interview spots. Only students who score in the upper quartile and higher are asked to return for an interview. The test is very tightly timed and requires quick and accurate decisions about your answers.

, The final step (assuming you get this far) is the interview. These are usually conducted on the first weekend of January. Each of the 230 interviewees has a 20 minute interview with a Regis faculty member and immediately after are interviewed for another 20 minutes by a Regis Alumnus or Board Member. Don't worry if you're nervous, everyone is. Know that the people who are interviewing you truly want to help you get in; they want to learn about who you are, so be honest. Don't worry about saying the wrong thing. Do, however, engage them. Ask questions, and be as front-footed as you can.

, The results are mailed out around the same time as those of other Catholic high schools. The freshmen class is usually about 135 students, but by senior year it's usually around 120.

Do your research.,
Pick your outfit.,
Make sure that your hair is clean and you have styled it nicely.,
Wear only modest makeup.,
Use your manners.",How to Dress for a Private School Interview," Firstly, it's important to find out whether the school is critically strict; you can find this out by going to the schools website and reading their school rules and statement.


If the school has a school uniform policy, it's likely that they would hold rigid standards about the way a student should dress. By finding out whether the school is super strict or just conservative, you'll be able to prepare your apparel accordingly.;
,


If the private school is fairly strict, go for something like a pair of slacks or a skirt. For boys, wear a collared shirt or at least a t-shirt with no signs, symbols or pictures on the front. For girls, go for a shirt and slacks or a modest skirt with a pair of flats.
If the private school is not so strict, you can probably get away with a more casual look and even some dark jeans (with no rips or holes). Wear something nice and avoid features that make huge statements. Clothing can tell a lot from a person, so try for limited make-up girls and no hats boys.

, For girls, a ponytail or bun is out of your face and will allow the interviewer to see you dazzling smile. For boys, if you have long or short hair, just ensure that it's not messy. Wash and comb your hair.

, Looking very ""glam"" is likely to backfire and may make you seem less focused on academics. Apply a light powdered foundation and nude lipstick, if any. You want to look put together, without coming off as overly focused on style or looks.

, Remember to give a good impression by shaking the interviewer's hand and smiling. When the interviewer addresses you with statements or questions, make sure that you are attentively listening and are following what he is talking about.


On the drive to the school, possible think up at least one question that you can ask the interviewer when prompted; this shows that you have an interest in your education and will be a valuable asset to the school.

Contact coaches/special interest teachers.,
Provide the school with a single envelope into which all the recommendations can be placed, if possible.,
Wait, wait, and wait!",How to Apply to a Prep School," Prep school is a serious commitment of your time, energy, and your family's finances; you and your family want to be certain this is an excellent investment. You also need to be fairly certain you will thrive in such an environment, which can be very different from your local high school. Some things to consider:

Prep schools are often very high-pressure institutions. There is often a lot of homework, competition, expectations, and challenge. The rewards can be very high, but it often comes with a lot of pressure.
Prep schools are often mono-cultural. Although there is at least an effort to include diversity, most prep school students are from upper-middle-class to wealthy families. Minority ethnicities, low socio-economic level individuals, and people from very urban or rural backgrounds are sparse. Students who do not come from the typical ""prep school set"" may feel like outsiders.
These institutions often have a very deep school culture. Especially if you live at a prep school, your daily life will be deeply rooted in the school. It becomes your life in a way that living at home and going to school does not.
Prep schools may not have any special education department. Many institutions can accomodate special needs, but are not mandated to (at least in the United States).
While a prep school is a great resource for getting into an elite university, it is not necessary to do so. If your goal is to get into Yale or Oxford, prep schools can certainly help. However, students from non-prep-school backgrounds get into these institutions every year.;
, Remember that there is a fee for each application. If you're really serious about going to a prep school, you should apply to at least 4. If you're really serious and need financial aid, you should apply to over 5. Begin looking at schools in the early to mid summer.

, You should try to schedule an interview during the summer, even if you have no intention of interviewing during the summer. If you can, you should try to interview at few schools during the summer, just to get it out of the way. You should schedule all of your interviews around the early fall. You can do this during other times of the year, but this is the most typical route.

, Begin working on it ASAP. You should have submitted the first part (Candidate Profile) by the middle of October at the latest.

, Try to register for the October or November test, because if you do poorly, you will have a chance to retake. Don't over-study for these tests; begin about 6 weeks in advance and study from 15-45 minutes a day, depending on how good you are at taking standardized tests.

, Make sure you are nice to all of your teachers. You don't want a bad letter of recommendation. You should give these to your teachers after Thanksgiving.

, If you haven't began writing them by Thanksgiving, you should really get on it.

, If you have a special interest in anything ranging from football, dance, or photography, you should definitely contact the appropriate faculty member and try to schedule an appointment, or talk through email. You can usually find a faculty list on prep school's websites. If you can, try to arrange a visit when you are touring campus. Also, if music or visual art is your talent, send in a CD/portfolio! You should aim to get these in around December.

, That envelope should be pre-addressed and pre-paid with delivery confirmation. At most, each envelope will cost $8.00 but it will all arrive at the school admission office together, and hopefully by the appointed deadline (you will also be able to trace the package). My experience with teachers mailing off their recommendations proved to be a very difficult one because some of the letters were not delivered using the regular stamp on envelope method. I learned the hard way and this approach will make everything much easier and more guaranteed to arrive.

, Once you send in your applications, make sure you keep up your grades, focus on your extra-curriculars, and otherwise keep doing what will help you stand out as a student.

Consider dropping the class, if you must.",How to Survive a Class You Hate," Even if you have to head off to your least favorite class of all time, it doesn't have to be a dungeon if you go in with the right attitude. Develop a little ritual for yourself when you know you have to go to class to give yourself the strength to get through it. You got this.


Listen to a psych-up song, something you really love that gets you moving and energetic. Let that energy carry you into class. It should help make at least the first part of a boring lecture less boring.;
, You can't sleep, even though you might want to doze off during this lesson. The higher your energy levels for class, the easier time you'll have paying attention, and the more engaged you'll be. More engaged, less bored. Less bored, better class.


Get at least 8 hours of sleep before school, especially on days that you have a class you're not super into. If you're about to drift off, everything will seem so much more boring.
Try getting a tiny amount of exercise will help to keep your energy levels up before class. Go hide in the bathroom and do fifteen jumping-jacks. Just don't let anyone see you.

, Algebra's better if there's a Snickers bar on the other side of it. Get a snack reward for a class you hate, to treat yourself before, during, or afterwards, depending on the rules at your school. Try to save it for afterward, to give yourself something to look forward to. Save your granola bar as a reward for getting through another one.


Processed snacks high in sugar might spike your energy in the short term, but you'll crash hard later in the day, making it more difficult for your last classes. Instead of slamming some Skittles, Try to have an apple, an orange, or a handful of peanuts.

, The way you look can affect how you feel. If you dress like you don't want to be there, you'll feel like it. Instead, wear a cool new outfit, or take some extra time getting ready for school on days that you have a class you don't like, so you'll be able to feel confident and fresh, instead of bored and tired.

, Go all out when you're figuring out your school supplies for this class you don't like, decorating your binder, your notebooks, and your notes. Get colored pens, pencils, stickers, and those really elaborate plastic divider things. Even if the class is terrible, it'll give you something to enjoy about the class, and a separate activity that will keep you engaged.

, No class is fun all the time. But sometimes, you can pick out one thing that you enjoy, to help keep yourself more focused and give yourself a reason to enjoy being there. Even if it's not something involved in the content of the class itself, but in the room, the student body, or your own brain.


Find a friend in the class, or a student that you're crushing on. Spend the class thinking up good stuff to talk about after class, as you're leaving.
Try to find something about the subject to enjoy as well. If it's history, sit through the boring stuff about legislation to get to the juicy stuff about battles.

, Every now and then, you can allow yourself an entertaining daydream without sacrificing your attention. A recent study even showed that letting your mind wander in controlled bursts can help you to re-focus and retain information.Make up a silly story about the people in your class. Who is most likely to be a secret alien from Planet Zebulon? Who secretly has a crush on the teacher? Who would survive if your class was thrust into the zombie apocalypse?
Start daydreaming about what you'll do when you get home from school. Video games and grilled cheese? Sounds great.
Assign different woodland creatures to the looks of different members of your class. Who looks most like a squirrel? A wolf? A great horned owl? This is surprisingly fun.

, What if this wasn't Algebra, but training for astronauts, so you can learn the proper formulas for charting your trajectory to the moon? What if this wasn't gym class, but a secret training facility for gifted athletes and geniuses. What if this wasn't history, but spy training? Whatever you're into, let yourself fantasize that it's about something else, and that you've got to do well to succeed.

, This is a win-win situation. Taking notes keeps you engaged and productive in class, doodle-drawing is fun and good, simple, and fun way to eat up some time, and it has the added effect of helping to keep you engaged.


A recent study found that doodlers are able to retain more information, because you're engaging in an active task–drawing and note taking–as opposed to the passive task of listening. , If you want to keep yourself busy in mind, try coming up with a little game for yourself to pass the time. As long as it's not loud or obvious enough to get you a reprimand from the teacher, you can play a little game by yourself every now and then to help survive a terrible class.


Take your pen apart as fast as you can and put it back together. Time yourself and try to best your own time. Get a friend involved.
Find a seat by a good window. Look out of it. Five points for every bird, ten for every piece of garbage. Challenge your friend.
Try to make things move with your mind. Get the girl sitting next to you to scratch her forehead just by thinking it. Hey, worth a shot.

, If you don't like class because you're getting in trouble, constantly getting in trouble, a class is going to be much more of a struggle. If survival is your goal, learn when to button up and cut it out, otherwise the rest of the class is just going to get worse. If you have to goof off, be subtle. Try to get through the whole class talking to your friend without getting caught.


Picking on the teacher isn't a good way to survive class. It's a good way to get suspended. Don't back-talk or cause trouble, unless you want to make it worse.
If you hate class because it's very difficult, or because you're unable to pay attention, talk to your parents, a guidance counselor, or your teacher to try to figure things out. It may be that you need to be in a different class.

, A class you don't like will be much better over the course of the semester if you can find a buddy. If you're going in there alone each day, it's always going to feel more tough. But if you've got a friendly face waiting for you, and a sympathetic ear to complain with afterward, things will go much more smoothly.


Just come up with a reason to talk to someone, if you don't know anybody. ""Nice shirt, what's your name?"" Perfect.

, If you show up to every class with no book, no pencil, and without having done the prep you needed to do for class, everything is going to be worse. You'll get picked on by the teacher, you'll be confused the whole time you're there, and you won't have anything to keep yourself busy. Even though homework is a bummer, you need to do it, if you want to survive the class. Even if you hate it.


Try doing the homework you don't like first. You'll get it over with sooner, which means the rest of your homework won't be so bad.
Do homework while you're in class, if you can. If you can get away with it, one of the best ways to keep the work as painless as possible is to finish it while you're still at school. Leave that terrible classwork at school, and you won't have to stress about it as much.

, If a class is a real bummer, you don't have to be the number one student at the front of the class. You don't need an A+ in every course. But that doesn't mean you can slack off so bad that you'll have to repeat. If you don't pass, you'll just end up back here again, hating the class all over again. No sense in that.


Make good friends with the term ""minimum requirements."" What is the absolute bare essential you need to do for the class to pass? As long as you're exceeding those, it's just a waiting game.

, If you're really struggling, and can't find a way to get yourself to enjoy class, or if you're really stressed and anxious about a particular class, talk to the teacher about your problem. Often, teachers will be very sympathetic, especially if you have a genuine desire to do better and to get through class without causing problems.


Wait until after class and talk to your teacher one-on-one. Say something like, ""I really want to be able to succeed in this class, but I'm struggling. I have a hard time paying attention and staying engaged. What can I do to do better?""
If you're a visual learner, try asking the teacher if it wouldn't be possible to incorporate more visual diagrams and chalkboard learning into the course, or incorporating more activities into the class, if you're a more active learner.

, While this is usually only an option in college, and sometimes in high school, if you really can't get through a class right now, sometimes it's a better idea to consider dropping and either taking another course with another teacher, or retaking this course when you feel more equipped to take it.


Try sitting in on other teachers who teach the same course and see if you might be able to transfer into it smoothly, without having to cause a big problem for everyone.

Look forward to phys ed.,
Participate.,
Focus on personal bests.,
Don’t grumble about it.",How to Survive Gym Class1," Don’t make gym class worse than it is by dreading it all day. This is probably the only class where teachers aren’t telling you to sit still and be quiet, so make the most of it. Even if exercise isn’t your thing, focus on the parts that you do enjoy about it. These could be:Seeing particular friends who share the same class or gym period.
The chance to go outside and get some fresh air.
The physical benefits of exercise.
Not having to sit behind a desk for the next 40 minutes.;
, Maybe you’re not athletic at all, or maybe you’re not particularly great at one sport or activity. Whatever it may be that turns you off about phys ed, don’t let this stop you from taking part. Instead, get in there and just go for it!Refusing to take part will set you apart and will get negative attention from your teacher. You also miss out on bonding with other students.
Remember that you’re being graded for this. Your teacher doesn’t expect everyone to be a star player, but they do expect you to put yourself out there. Pay attention and listen to your teacher, and show them that you're trying your best.

, Remember: gym class isn’t a tryout for the school team. Don’t beat yourself up just because you can’t run a mile in five minutes or throw a 50-yard pass. Regardless of what game or activity the teacher has you do, just concentrate on improving.Keep your goals realistic. For some people, this might be, say, shaving a minute off their mile time. For others, it might simply be running a mile without having to stop, regardless of how long it takes.
Having fun is its own goal. If nothing else, just look forward to the opportunity to move around and shake yourself out. As long as you do that, then you’ve met a goal!

, Maybe you hate basketball, or feel tired, or would just rather be some place else. Put it out of your mind or, failing that, just keep it to yourself. Unless you have a valid complaint (like a real injury or illness), don’t whine about having to take part.Complaining out loud or to yourself won't make you feel any better. Try to focus on the positive aspects of gym class.
Staying positive might even help other students who are in the same boat. Mood can be infectious, and if you're encouraging and positive, gym class may be more for you and anyone else who is struggling.
Complaining make your teacher think that you’re not giving it your all or that you are disrespecting them, which could affect your grade.

"
"
Find a friend.,
Act fearless.,
Keep your sense of humor on display.,
Refrain from showing off.",How to Survive Gym Class2," If nothing else, having a buddy in class can make it more enjoyable. Obviously, if friends of yours from other classes share the same gym class or period as you, hang with them. If not, reach out to others. You could try:Complimenting people when they score or pull off an impressive feat.
Telling someone they must be tough as nails when they recover from a spill.
Making a sarcastic joke about the joys and wonders of phys ed to others who look less than pleased to be there.

, Dive right in and play to the best of your ability. Don’t act afraid of the ball or other players. Impress them with your self-confidence, even when you’re not particularly good at whatever you’re playing.Of course, you don’t want to be seriously injured, but don’t be afraid of scrapes and bruises. Recovering from a spill and walking it off without a complaint can be just as impressive to other students as hitting a homerun.

, That spill you took might really hurt, or that ball you missed should have been an easy catch. Whatever the goof was, just laugh it off. After all, it’s only gym class, not the World Series, so don’t take things too seriously. Show anyone who might be tempted to make fun of you that you are perfectly cool with laughing at yourself.Sure, some students might get really competitive over a baseball game in phys ed. Just keep your cool and shrug it off if a teammate gets upset with you for ruining a play. Keep in mind that everyone else probably thinks that this kid looks way more foolish for getting all worked up over a pointless game in gym class.

, If you happen to be really, really good at sports in general or one in particular, save the superstar plays for the school team or league sports. Although this may seem like a great chance to impress people, keep in mind that others aren’t as skilled as you. Do your best, but remember good sportsmanship and don't rub it in your classmates' faces.


Remember: this isn’t a tryout, so you're not competing with your fellow students for a spot on the team. Have fun and give it your all, but don't get competitive or nasty.
Teamwork, cooperation, and good sportsmanship are all important parts of gym class (and your grade). Remember that your grade won't suffer if you're not the star athlete every day. Make sure you're passing to your classmates and giving them a chance to play instead of always dominating the game.

Wear the right clothes.,
Wash your clothes regularly.,
Bring soap, towels, and/or other hygienic products.,
Find out future lessons.",How to Survive Gym Class3," If your school makes you wear a uniform, then obviously wear that.If not, wear appropriate gym wear (t-shirt, athletic shorts, sweatsuits) that fits well. Avoid excessively tight clothing (which can restrict your movements or chafe your skin) as well really baggy clothes (which can get in the way of your hands and legs and, even worse, fall down).


Also make sure your sneakers’ laces are tied right. Loose sneakers can cause you to trip or even injure yourself.

, Gym class will make you work up a sweat, which can lead to body odor. Wearing the same outfit day-after-day can make you smell worse if you don’t wash them, since they’ve already absorbed your sweat. Bring a fresh change of gym clothes to school each day.


If the school makes you wear a uniform, see if you can get two. This way you’ll still have a clean change of clothes even if you didn’t have a chance to wash yesterday’s dirty outfit.Handwashing them in the sink with a drop of detergent is better than nothing at all if using a washing machine every day isn’t practical.

, Some schools may require you to shower after class, while others only recommend it. If you have a choice, it’s obviously up to you. Either way, bring a bar of soap to either wash in the shower or give your armpits a quick cleaning over the sink, as well as a towel to dry yourself.Alternately, you could use baby wipes to give yourself a quick wash down.
Applying deodorant or antiperspirant before and after gym is also a good idea.
If you are required to take a shower, just remember that everyone is just as embarrassed as you probably are.

, Ask your teacher what games or activities they have lined up ahead in the coming days and weeks. Lesson plans may change day-to-day due to the weather or other factors, but since teachers have to split space and equipment when more than one gym class is held each period, they can give you a general idea of what to expect. This way you can:Practice on your own, outside of school, if you’d like to improve your performance during class.
Bring appropriate clothing if needed, like an extra layer or waterproof clothing for outdoor activities.
Get extra pointers and advice during a private conversation instead of having them shouted at you during class.
Show that you take the class seriously, which proves that you are really trying.

Be friendly and social!",How to Adjust from a Private School to a Public School," To get some basic idea about how and what public schools are, you may read about it in the Internet, school magazines and students testimonials. This will acquaint you with many uncertainties or differences that you weren't prepared for already.;
, It doesn't matter if you are going to the same school. Even if you won't be attending the same school, ask them what it is like during the classes.


Ask them about how you should act in a certain situation and how to talk to the classmates, teachers etc. 
Ask them about what activities they offer.
You will have many opportunities and challenges to grow and learn in terms of academics and personal growth. Communication will give you a clear idea about what you are interested in and what to choose.

, You will find many new things to see and learn. Be patient and not in a hurry to react. Your reactions may be naive but it is natural and acceptable.

, Not all schools will provide this, but a planner is necessary for school life. Be sure to keep your class schedule on hand with you, and make copies in case you lose it.


You will want to keep track of your homework/classwork and any events you are a part of. If you use a multipurpose binder, be sure to have your contact information on it.
Try using dividers or hole-punched folders so that you can keep your important documents and your doodles separated and secure.

, Taking the routes with the most traffic is recommended because it's easier to stay out of isolated places and avoid being late.

, Allow your teachers to know that you were in private school. They will understand you better. It's important to get to know who your teachers are and how their curriculum is so you can get to know them better. At private schools there are less teachers.


You don't have to speak to each teacher. Just pay attention to how they act towards you and other students and ask your classmates about what they know about them. However, do not make a choice based on what you hear. Their views may work as a guide.
There is a big difference in curriculum between public and private schools, so be prepared to see some things you have no idea about. If you're confused, speak up! It might seem embarrassing, but not as embarrassing as the report card you'll have to show your parents every couple of months.

, Many public students don't like private students because of their persona. Be friendly in fact, you don't really need to mention that you're a new student if you don't feel like. There are likely to be 500-3,000 students in public schools so most of the students will either not care much or not know.


If you are asked by someone where you were before, say you were in private school, but don't be afraid to explain your situation or persona if you feel comfortable doing so.

, It may be a difficult thing to do if you're not very happy about your move, but try to be respectful to your new teachers and classmates. If you don't know anyone at your new school, try to socialize with the person you're sitting next to in class or someone you find out shares an interest with you. You need not trust someone blindly at first. Give it time and you will know better.


Don't dwell too much on upsetting someone. Be careful about what you say to new people. If someone doesn't care too much about talking to you, don't sweat it; find someone else to converse with.
Be sure to observe people if you're unsure about speaking to them, and watch who you talk to. You may know about who are the bullies and stay away from them. Do not be in a haste to make friends as you may find yourself in an uncomfortable scenarios or group. Enjoy your solitude and fulfill your works.
If you do get involved with a bad crowd, try not to sink too deeply into it. Keep a distance from them.
A good and fairly easy way to make friends towards your interests are joining clubs. Clubs may not start at the very beginning of the year, but they may start a couple of weeks prior.
Stay away if you notice that some trouble is happening. If you could find a solution and handle the crowd, you may try helping.

",How to Apply for a Private High School (USA)," Figure out what you want to get out of a private school experience. Do you want a small school or a large school? Do you want to attend a co-educational school or a school with only people of your gender? Where is your primarily strength? Art? Athletics? Are you a musician? Are you a distinguished scholar? Do you like to write? Do you like to act? Are you a good foreign language speaker? Have you always wanted to get far away from home and experience life in a different part of the country, or even in a different country? Finding out what your interests are will help you find out what school best fits you.;
, You will want to research more than one school. Find the best ones (the ones that best fit your interests). Some of these will be safety schools, just in case you don’t get into the ones you want to get into. Others will just be for experimenting with the application process (ie: the interview). Try to contact a few of the students from the school and ask why they chose the school that they chose, rather than another school. Find out what examinations you need to take to get into the school. Download application forms from the internet, or request them yourself. Obtain a copy of the school handbook and course guide, and then read through them. Find out what the schools’ policies are concerning financial aid. Look up when their Open House dates are, and then go to them. Meet the administrators and a few of the teachers if they are present. Introduce yourself, be polite, and be confident (confident, but not arrogant). Leave a lasting first impression of yourself in their minds.

, You can rank them from first through however many you apply to. The ones closer to last you may use as your trial schools so that you can experiment with the application process (just do not tell them that you are doing so). For example, when scheduling tours and interviews, schedule the first interviews with the schools that you really don’t think you want to go to, and use this as a means of practicing for the real thing: interviewing for those schools where you want to get in.

, Some of these forms must be filled out by your teachers (departmental recommendation forms from the Mathematics, Languages, History, Sciences, and Extracurricular departments). Other forms must be filled out by your parents (forms concerning how they see your strengths and weaknesses, where they believe you will excel, what they hope you will get out of a private school education, what kind of a learner they believe you are, what learning disabilities you do or do not have). The main purpose of those two forms is to give the school an idea of what accommodations they may have to make to fit your needs, and whether or not you can thrive at the school. There is also the student application form, which asks a mix of personal and academic questions. These questions deal with how you see yourself as a person, scholar, athlete, artist, musician, etc., what your hobbies are, and possibly some philosophical questions where you will be asked to elaborate on an opinion. Some of these questions will be short answers (only a sentence or two will suffice for them), while others will be longer (the essays, for example). The main purpose of the student application is for the school to have some sort of an idea of who you are as a person and how well you can articulate who you are in how you write. The school uses your responses to see if you are the type of person whom they would want to bring into their school.

, This shows the admissions office of the school that you are really serious about applying, and that you are not a procrastinator. Schedule your interviews and tour dates.

, You want to appear as genuine as possible. Be yourself. This is your chance to find out more about the school. Ask plenty of questions on the tour of the campus. As you will probably be toured by a student of the school, some questions you may want to ask of your guide are: what are classes like?, why did you choose the school?, what classes are you taking? what do you think of the music/theatre department? what is the arts curriculum like? what extracurriculars do you participate in? do you play sports? what sports do you play? what is the food like here? what is it like to live on campus (if you are touring at a boarding school)? how did the interview go for you when you were applying here (this is an excellent question to ask, especially if you haven’t interviewed yet).

, This is another chance for you to find out if the school fits you. The interview is also the schools way of finding out who you are and how you are in person. Just relax. Make sure you look nice for your interview. Wearing a suit usually works well, but a polo and khaki pants also work well. Ask the interviewer questions about the school. Try to find out as much as you can. By doing so, you further display your interest in the school. It is okay to make a joke or two during your interview, as you don’t want to appear as though you are only all business. The interview is a two-way process: the school learns more about whether or not you fit it, and you learn whether or not the school fits you.

, You may be surprised at what scholarships you may get. For example: if you apply to a school with a strong hockey program and have been playing hockey for the past ten years and are good at it, you may get a full ride through school off of playing hockey for them. Likewise, if you are an excellent student, you may want to apply for an academic or merit-based scholarship.

, These may include the SSAT (Secondary School Admissions Test), ISEE (Independent School Entrance Examination), TOEFL (Test of English as a Foreign Language), or similar tests. Some schools will hand out their own exams. Some of these will be placement exams so that they school can see what class they should put you in (these usually come following your acceptance and a confirmation that you will attend the institution).

, Wait, patiently. After you have finished with the application process, there will be a long time to wait (usually, you will know the results of your application by the end of March). If you have been placed on a school’s waiting list, and the list expires following the deadline for indicating whether or not you will attend another school, then you will have to choose between going with the school that has already admitted you, or waiting to hear from the school where you have been wait-listed, which may not accept you in the end.

, Or take a real good friend. Try to look nice and approachable at the start of your senior year and start looking around Thanksgiving or Christmas if you are not in a steady relationship. You can go single but it may not be as fun, unless you are the type to go single. The prom is not mandatory, if you could care less and think it will be less stress, don't go.

Know your position.,
Lose your childish ways.,
Having an older sibling in the same school is like having a master key.,
Stay open-minded to the school.",How to Get Through High School when It Comes to Upperclassmen," Now that you are in high school, you are no longer the top dog of your school as you were in eighth grade. You have gone back to square one, as the newbie of the school and there are three other grades of students that have gone through 'Freshmen Trauma' and will do anything to get back their revenge on the new fresh meat.;
, Back in middle school, things were pretty chill; no social groups, no cliques, and definitely no segregation of grade classes. But now, you have entered the boundaries of high school, and all those social groups and cliques most definitely exist. Since there is no way of avoiding the fact, try to lose the baby lingo and mature your self for the next three years of non-stop social grouping, grade segregation and of course, bumping-into-upperclassmen-in-the-halls and them giving you dirty, smirky looks.

, If you are lucky enough to catch up just in time for one of your older siblings to take a place in the upper classes, you are pretty much good to go. Your brother and/or sister have gone through the same humiliating trauma as you've had and can share tips and experiences they've had with you; sort of like having your own personal cheat sheet. Also, having older siblings in the same school as you can give you opportunities to become friendly with upperclassmen who happen to be the friends of the sibling. Although it sounds like you are pretty much using your siblings as a passage to the upper world, both you and your older brother or sister benefit from the interaction; you get to meet the uppers and your brother or sister will be able to make fun of you as much as they please when you confront their friends.

, Suppose you refuse to converse with anybody but your friends from middle school. The year will drag on and almost everybody will have made new friends, perhaps leaving you in the dust. You must stay open-minded to avoid that situation or you will most likely become shunned and avoided by not only your grade, but also the upper grades. If you are not friendly and open, how do you suppose you are to make connections with potential friends? Plus, the ability to keep open and friendly will allow you to become involved in social groups or networks the school has to offer you.

Calm way down.,
Be Social.,
Don't be afraid of what people think of you.,
Get involved in conversation!,
The bell schedule.,
What's up with the hall pass?,
Lunch is NOT a big deal, people.,
On the first day, don't worry about what to bring.,
Don't freak out about finding your classes.,
Have good personal hygiene.,
Be positive, happy, and confident.,
Again, this whole thing is easy.",How to Go from Home School to High School," It's not as different as you're expecting. High school isn't some foreign place where everything you do is judged by the whole school. For the most part, what you do won't even be noticed. Sure, if you trip and drop your lunch tray you'll be embarrassed, but just laugh at yourself and ignore the stupid people in situations like that, and your good.;
, Now. Don't sit and wait for opportunities to come to you- be the one to go talk to people. Others aren't really all that different from you. In fact, in the beginning of the year people will be looking for friendships just as much as you will. Later in the year, however, it could get a little tougher. Groups of friends will start form, so it will seem more intimidating to just walk up and talk to them and start talking.

, The number one struggle with being social is always being totally paranoid and worried about what people think of you and always thinking of the worst case scenarios. So just chill out. They're thinking the exact same thing.

, If you're in a class or at lunch and there's an interesting discussion going, join in! Throw in a good point or even better a little humor! It'll make you seem confident and like an interesting guy (or girl) to be around.

, Seems stupid, but many people freak out when they start because they don't understand it, but it's very simple. Bell 1: go to class. Bell 2: You're late for class. Bell 3: go to your next class. Bell 4: You're late for class. Bell 5: go to your next class, etc.

, It's different in different schools, but most the time you just ask the teacher to use the hall pass, and you get a little plank that says hall pass on it. Some teachers will dock grade points for using it, and others give you a certain number of hall pass uses every quarter. Your teacher will explain all this on the first day of school, so don't worry about it.

, Again, there isn't some law of what you HAVE to do at lunch. Most people buy it from the cafeteria, which costs somewhere from $1.50 - $2.00. A lot of people bring sack lunches. Some who have cars even go out to eat if the school allows it (but make sure to be quick if you do this.) Some people walk around with their friends, some sit at the tables, lots of people even sit on the floors just for fun. It's really not a big deal- at all.

, Usually the teachers will tell you what they want you to have, so just have a backpack to put textbooks and papers in, a pen and pencil, and a notebook just in case. Bring a planner to write down all your assignments. The most common thing you hear when a teacher says to pass something in is, ""Oh, crap.""

, You should have gotten a schedule when you registered that tells all your classes and their room number, and on the first day there will be staff everywhere to help you out. You should also have a map of some sort somewhere; just relax, you'll figure it out.

, This is completely and totally without exception. Many people will remember you from their first impressions, and smelling bad with yucky teeth is not the way you want to go with that. If you can, always have deodorant with you. Cologne's always a good thing too.

, This will help you make friends faster and make people feel more comfortable around you. The classic moaning of, 'I'm tired,"" ""I hate this class,"" ""This teacher is so stupid"" are no fun. It'll also make your teachers like you more which is always a plus. Don't take this too far though, or you'll just come off as a dork.

, After a day or two you'll have the whole thing down. Just remember to get out and talk to people NOW. It'll be awesome once you understand it all, so just take a deep breath, and relax.

Figure out if your teachers want to be challenged or agreed with.",How to Get Through High School with Minimal Work," Some students try to write down everything the teacher says, but that’s far too much work. In some cases, it might even makes it harder to figure out what’s actually important enough to be on a test because you just have too much written down. Furthermore, people get so busy trying to write quickly that you don’t focus on the lecture. You’ll end up with bloated, messy notes that you don’t understand because you weren’t paying the right kind of attention to the class discussion.


It’s easier and more effective to listen to a lecture than it is to transcribe it. Sit back, listen, and write down only the information you think will be on the test.
If the teacher writes something on the board, they’re trying to draw your attention to it for a reason. Write it down.;
, It doesn’t require any more effort than taking sloppy, disorganized notes, but writing down your class notes as an outline will show you the connection between ideas later, when you have to go back to your notes and study for a test.


Use a clear hierarchy of indentations so you can easily tell the difference between major points and minor/supporting details. You can disregard some of the supporting details when studying for a test.

, If your teacher took the time to create a handout to go along with a lesson, there’s a good chance that the information on it is what your teacher considers to be the most important material from the lecture. There’s a better chance of this information being on a test, so focus on the handouts instead of trying to take notes on an entire lecture.


Store handouts neatly in folders or three ring-binders
Use one folder per class; if you mix up your class materials, you’ll create more work later when you need to study.

, Every teacher will have their own little quirks. At the beginning of the year, spend some time asking students who’ve had your teachers before what you should expect from them. Observe your teachers closely for the first couple of weeks to figure out how what makes them tick. The better you know your teachers, the more easily you can give them exactly what they want without having to run yourself ragged.


Do any of your teachers go off on long, unrelated tangents on material that won’t be on the test? Feel free to zone out on unimportant information.
Get to know their speaking styles. Some people use vocal emphasis to draw attention to important information that will be on tests, whereas others might use exaggerated hand gestures to highlight information.
How do your teachers grade homework and classwork? Some might assign point or letter grades to small daily assignments, but if everyone just receives a check mark for completion, then you don’t have to work hard to earn your daily credit.

, Especially if your teacher gives equal credit for everyone who completed the homework assignment, don’t put more effort than you need to into completing your homework. Often, teachers will go over the answers to the homework in class the next day, and you will get answers to questions that might end up on tests without having to comb through a whole textbook to find them.


Use your discretion about whether or not this step will work for your individual teachers. Some teachers don’t go over homework and readings the next day; in those classes, it might be worth it to spend time on your homework.

, There are many websites that will help you get by in school by giving you the most important information that most often shows up on tests. Sparknotes, for example, is a well-known study aid that summarizes books for students who either haven’t read the book at all, or who need help understanding major themes and concepts. They also provide study aids for non-literary subjects, from chemistry to computer science.


Read the summaries of assigned books so your teacher won’t be able to tell if you didn’t finish the whole reading.
Use the aids to help you formulate the points of your papers.
Make sure to read the aids carefully. If you haven’t been paying attention in class, you might misunderstand a point and make a very obvious mistake on your paper or test.
Do not plagiarize from these study aids.

, At the beginning of the year, take an hour to put together the organizational system that you’ll follow for the whole year. A tiny amount of work at the beginning will save you a lot of unnecessary headaches and work later.


Purchase a hole-puncher, a three-holed folder for each class, three-holed tab separators, and a large three-ring binder to hold all of your notes and documents for all your classes for the year. Make sure the binder is thick enough to house all the materials you’ll gather over the year.
Use the tab separators to create a section for each class. Your binder should move chronologically through your schedule: your first class comes first, and your last class comes last.
Put a labeled folder for each class in the corresponding section of the binder.
Put clean paper in the very front of the binder to take notes. At the end of every class, before you pack up, move your notes to the appropriate section, making sure to keep them in chronological order.
Use your three-hole punch on handouts, and place them in their correct chronological order as well, so all the information on a given subject is in the same place within each section.
Use your folder for documents that can’t be hole-punched — for example, if there’s important information in the margins that you don’t want to ruin with a hole.

, If you know that one history teacher is a harsher grader than the other history teacher, talk to your guidance counselor about getting into the easy grader’s class. Of course, don’t say that you want the easier grade; instead, say that you learn better from that teacher’s instruction style. Explain that you think you’ll get more out of the class if you’re with the right teacher. The school might not let you switch classes, but if it does, you'll have saved yourself a whole year of hard work and bad grades.

, Although it’s not the only thing colleges look at, your GPA is very important if you want to get into a good university. Keep in mind, though, that college admissions offices take into consideration the difficulty of your class schedule when looking at your application. Because of that, you can’t just load your schedule with easy classes; you have to be smart about which easy classes to take.


If you’re naturally gifted in a subject, go ahead and try to take an honors class in that subject.
If you need a subject specifically for your aspirations — biology because you want to be a doctor, for example, and you plan on writing about it in your college entrance essays — don’t take an easy section.
However, if you’re terrible at something, and it’s not part of your dream career, then don’t be ashamed to take an easier class in that area.
You’ll be able to tell college admissions officers about the rigor of your other classes, and you won’t bring your GPA down by taking a class you can’t handle.

, This way, you have time to finish homework during the hours when you have to be in school anyway. By scheduling it at the end of the day, you know that you’ve received all of your assignments from that day, so you can push yourself to finish all of your work before leaving school. When school gets out, you can just enjoy the rest of your day and not have to think about work anymore!

, If you can develop a good relationship with someone who puts in the work and takes solid, readable notes during class, then you don’t need to do that work yourself. Before a big test, ask your friend if you can photocopy their notes, and study from those.


To keep your friend from feeling like you’re taking advantage of them, you can alternate days on which you take notes. You take notes one day while your friend relaxes, and switch the next day.

, While that doesn’t sound like a way to get by without working too hard, it actually is. If your teacher gives you a study guide for a test, and you decide to split up the work with three of your classmates, then you only have to do ¼ of the research you otherwise would have had to do in order to study for the test. In fact, ¾ of the answers to the test just magically appear without you having to do any work. All you have to do is read the work your study group has done for you!

, Most likely, your teachers haven’t made multiple versions of their tests, so on test day, talk to students who took the test before you. Without asking specifics, ask them what areas the test focused on. You can spend the rest of your free time before the test looking over the textbook, handouts, and notes on those subjects.


Never ask for specific questions from the exam. If you get caught doing that, you’ll be in trouble for cheating.

, Think about how much you hate giving presentations in class, even if they’re just five minutes long. Imagine doing that all day every day — that’s what teaching is! When students ask questions, it makes teachers feel great because they don’t feel like they’re doing all that work for nothing.


Make sure to ask at least one question in every class, every day.
It doesn’t have to even be a smart question — just show the teacher that you’re paying some kind of attention.
Your teachers will remember you as a student who wants to learn and understand, even if you’re just going through the motion of asking questions. They might be more forgiving when it comes time to enter grades at the end of the year.

, Which book did your English teacher say changed her life when he was your age? Which president does your US History teacher keep bringing up over and over again, no matter what she’s supposed to be covering? Use this information to your benefit.


If a teacher enjoys reading your paper because it’s on their favorite subject, it might influence them to give you a higher grade.
Some teachers might be more likely to put questions about their favorite subject on tests.

, Avoid writing papers that will bore your teachers. Even if you don’t want to put more work into the researching and crafting of your paper, the simple step of choosing your topic wisely can make a difference in your grade. Don’t write a paper on the same subject as half of your classmates. Teachers don’t actually enjoy reading hundreds of papers on the exact same thing — so break up the monotony of grading for them.


Put them in a better mood while reading your paper simply by choosing an unexpected topic.
You might get a better grade than you would for a paper you put the same amount of effort into, but which bored the teacher.

, Learn how to play into what your teachers want from you, and you’ll get far in their class without having to put in extra work.


Does your teacher want students to question assumptions? Use your one question for the day to play devil’s advocate with something the teacher said, so they think you’re using your critical thinking skills. Think of something your teacher has argued, and then argue the opposite stance in your paper.
Does your teacher love the sound of their own voice? Do they always have to be right? Then parrot their ideas back to them in your papers.

The night before your first day, pack an emergency kit that includes pads/tampons, an extra pair of underwear and some extra money change (in case you forget lunch at home);
,
Wake up early!,
Splash super cold tap water on your face to get yourself awake.,
Take a warm shower.,
If you are going to shave, this would be the time to do it.,
When you get out of the shower, dry off with a towel and apply moisturizing cream all over your body.

,
Put on your underwear (top and bottom) then spray your favorite perfume on your pulse spots.,
Now put on your outfit picked out for the day but leave out accessories, socks and shoes, and just put on the basics like top and bottoms.

,
Now go do your hair.,
The last thing you do is your makeup and put on accessories.,
After you are completely ready, make sure your books and belongings are ready to go.

",How to Get Ready the Morning of Your First Day of High School (Girls),", You definitely won't want to sleep in on this important day. So, make sure you have your alarm clock set and if you have trouble getting up, set multiple alarm clocks. Also, go to sleep early and get in extra sleep the night before. Get up to 9 hours of sleep and no less than 7 hours. That way you can get up early.

, Trust me! This gets your blood flowing. If you can't stand it that cold, use a towel instead.

, Use a beautiful smelling body gel that moisturizes. You can pick some up at Bath and Body Works where they have all kinds of fragrances or you can get it cheaper at Walmart. Be sure to exfoliate really well for smooth skin. Wash your hair only if you'll have time to style it. If not, wash and style at night.

, Don't forget to use a moisturizing shaving cream.

,, This is where perfume lasts the longest. (Inner wrists & neck)

,, There are lots of ways to style your hair without just tossing it up in a messy bun. Visit this link at seventeen magazine for over 30 different hairstyles. http://www.seventeen.com/beauty/hair-ideas/30-days-of-bts-hair-ideas?click=pp

, Don't go all out just because its the first day of school. You could end up looking a hot mess. Instead, be subtle and remember less is more. No caking on foundation and try not to be heavy handed with eyeliner. Since this is your freshman year, here is a no-no. NO LIPSTICK. You aren't going to prom and you aren't in a beauty pageant so no lipstick. Teachers don't take you seriously and neither do your peers. If you don't know how to apply makeup and your parents allow you to wear it then go to a makeup counter at the mall and ask them to apply a look you can wear to school. If you can't do that then just look up makeup tutorials on YouTube. Put on a few key pieces of jewelry. You should only have 3 out of 4 pieces on. So one big knuckle ring, a simple pendant and pearl earrings could do. Or take one out and add a cute cuff or a couple of layered bracelets.

, High school is a time when you're young and not held down by the reality of day-to-day responsibilities. Prevent drudgery by inviting a friend to hang at a school game or maybe go wild at the movies or the swimming hole.

, Do not cater to the will of others unless it aligns with your inner spirit. Chances are you won't meet these people again after high school. Therefore, be yourself and do what you want to. Stop caring so much about what other students think and just do that which brings you pleasure and deepens your experience in things that you, personally, care about.

, Clubs are a great way to befriend people with similar interests and elevate your college resume.

, Usually, people are too scared rejection or succumb to feelings of inferiority. Rise up and go for it. Chances are, the person you're asking out probably is so immersed in feelings about themselves that they won't notice your personal flaws. Certainly, they will not target the areas of your present concern exactly. Be prepared to address issues as they arise and slide a bit for the sake of your togetherness. If you give it your all, the worst you can say is that you enjoyed the experience or that you gained experience in personal relationships. Both are of benefit to you and you will not regret your going for the gold.


If it is your last year, realize that you and your crush may depart upon divergent paths, never to arrive at an opportunity to come together again. Really, it's ""now or never."" Just make sure to take something positive away from putting it all out there. You will find that everything is in how you choose to look at it. So, if you look at rejection as a tool to improve future encounters, you will be well on the way to eliminating regret.

, Also known as ""senioritis"". This is the absolute worse thing you can do. Colleges pay special attention to senior grades when the time comes for choosing among applicants, and good grades can help with scholarships.

, Stay away from developing bad habits like smoking, drinking, drugs, or sex. A lot of addictions are formed and cemented during the high school years. Addictions are costly— financially and emotionally. Most wreak havoc on your physical and mental well-being. Live cleanly and fully and you will look back and say, ""Hey, I did it right!""

, Again, socializing is one of the most fun parts of high school. You now have, perhaps, the most freedom and opportunity to form close, lasting friendships. Do not squander this opportunity and you will have nothing to regret on the social front. If you see a theme emerging, it is go forward with confidence in yourself and you will grow, broaden, and enrich your inner self. You will be forever grateful that you rose out of self-doubt enough to reach into the wonderful world of new relationships and knowings.

, Don't let not getting onto the varsity squad stop you from playing the sports you enjoy. Play at the level you are most comfortable with. In developing your skills, measure along two rulers— personal improvement and enjoyment. Play for fun, join a gym, or play on local teams and be the best you can be. Don't beat yourself up. Instead, fully recognize the growth and improvement you have experienced through the years of pursuing your sports and activities.

, This is tough battle, so approach with caution. Be confident in knowing that you are building yourself and your life as strong and as well as you are able.

, If it's your senior year, meaning last year of high school, then your prom photo will be a good memoir.

, It's a great way to remember your classmates in the future when high school ends and a great opportunity to socialize with others from different cliques.

, Your score can be a gateway to scholarships, getting into college, and certain programs. Try to get at least the benchmark ACT or SAT score in each category to avoid having to take extra remedial courses in college.

, Especially during fun events, field trips, and days you accomplish something. In the future, these photos make memories that just might make you smile.

, This could be a friend that betrayed you or maybe forgiving an ex-boyfriend or ex-girlfriend that broke your heart. Grudges is a waste of time you could be using making the most of high school.

, Honors, AP, and dual-credit are some that will positively impact your GPA if you do well, in addition to improving your knowledge and college application.

, Taking a career-related elective that interests you is a great way to do so. Though you don't necessarily have to know exactly what you want to be when you grow up, having a general idea of what career area (ex: business, nursing, engineering, teaching, etc) before senior year makes the college application process way easier and faster.

Ask your parents if they can schedule a tour earlier than the regular orientation day so you can check everything out at your own pace.If possible, have the schedule of your classes with you so you can find your classes in relation to everything like the cafeteria, your locker, bathrooms, etc. See how long it takes to get everywhere.
Most schools will provide an orientation day so don’t worry if you aren’t able to visit your school earlier than the first day. Make sure to pay attention and ask any questions during orientation to make your transition easier.;
, If you have a chance to meet your school counselors and teachers before the start of class you will be more likely to stand out. See if they are running any office hours or extra programs. You may also see if you can contact them via email so that the first day of school you will already have established some type of rapport.When you meet your school counselors and teachers in the first week, make sure to communicate any anxieties or simply ask questions about classes and how you should approach the upcoming school year. Remember that they have dealt with this many times before and will be happy to help an enthusiast student.

, You may be able to take electives for the first year so speak to your teachers to get a sense of the subjects and whether or not you will enjoy taking one class over another. The more informed you are, the happier you’ll be in the long run.Ask your teachers or principal if there is a suggested reading list or any topics to research to give you a head start in the summer.

, Ask if there is a list of clubs and sports teams that you are able to join. You may be able to reach out to coaches or the head of a club to get a sense of what’s involved so you know whether you can handle an extracurricular activity in addition to your school work.Talk to coaches for any advice on how to train over the summer so that you will be prepared for any tryouts. You may need to practice your shooting or dribbling if you want to join the basketball team for example. Sports teams may have summer workouts or practices so you may contact a coach or principal to see if you can check it out. Or you may need to practice your trombone if you want to get into band.
Like musicals and plays, there won’t be a lot of sports played in the summer so you may have to check these out earlier in the year. See how much school spirit there is and don’t be afraid to cheer on your high school. Have fun and see whether this is something you’d like to be a part of., Get a sense of what’s involved in a production and how involved the audience is. There probably won’t be any plays or musicals in the summer so you may have to check these out earlier in the year., Whether you meet people during orientation or during summer activities, be sure to always be friendly and say hi. You never know who will be your classmate or friends from other clubs and sports teams.Take every opportunity you can to chat to people because they may know some information about classes, schools, or teams from their siblings or friends and can give you their perspective. Is good to to also relate to others who are going through the same thing you are to relieve some of your stress and anxiety.

, Whether you have an orientation day or not, come up with a list of questions that will help you ease into high school. Whether it be related to classes, dress code, or how to make friends, write everything down and ask the appropriate people.You may ask your parents or siblings to help you come up with your list to make sure you don’t miss anything.

, Your high school may put out a newspaper, yearbook, newsletter or literary magazine. See if you can get a hold of last year’s publications so you can get a sense of a typical school year. You may ask to contact the editor if you’d like to be involved next year in the publication., Your high school website is sure to provide valuable information about student life, teachers, locations, and anything else you may have questions about. There is also often a helpful directory so that you may contact people directly if you have specific questions.Check if your school has a social media profile or if certain clubs or sports teams do. This may be an easier way to get a sense of school life because other students will most likely post on these profile pages.

, You may have someone in your life who has gone through the exact same thing you are about to so don’t be afraid to ask about his perspective. Get insider information about teachers, homework, or activities from people who still have it fresh in their mind.Ask questions like “who was your toughest teacher”, “what’s the funnest elective”, “what’s the quickest way to get to the gym to the cafeteria”, and “what’s the best thing to order for lunch?”

, Your school will already have a system in place to help you adjust. Find out which counselors, teachers, and administrators are trained specifically to help you. You will most likely meet them during orientation so introduce yourself.Make sure to take note of what each person specializes in, there may be an administrator who helps with electives and a counselor that helps with stress and dealing with your workload.

, Your school may offer mentoring programs where older students offer support and advice. Sign up if necessary or ask teachers, counselors, or administrators to help you find someone on your own if there isn’t a program currently set up.Make sure your mentor is someone you get along with or find someone new if you feel like your personalities clash.

, Speak to teachers outside of class to get personal advice tailored to you. Let teachers know ahead of time where you think you might need improvement. If you don’t know how you can improve yourself, ask about the class requirements and ask additional questions as you begin to get a sense of the workload.Introduce your parents to your teachers and counselors. While there may already be scheduled parent-teacher meetings, take any opportunity you can to introduce your parents to teachers and counselors so they know they can reach out to each other when you are having problems or have any questions.For example, you may ask the music teacher to help set up a practice schedule and a meeting with the school band leader.

, This may be the first time that you are able to choose electives. Getting your parents involved will give you support and help establish a team atmosphere.

Remove all distractions as best as you can. Study in a quiet and comfortable room or go to the library or a friend's house to study.;
, After reading a lot or solving a lot of problems, your brain needs to relax for a bit, but don't let the breaks consist more than 5 to 10 minutes long. A bathroom break or a walk around your home are the best options.

, This includes homework, unfinished classwork, and projects. Finish your assignments that are due sooner as quickly as you can but still have them neat and presentable. In other words, prioritize your work into two different piles, ""Due Sooner"" and ""Due Later"". Always work on the ""Due Sooner"" pile first. .

, Teachers normally have better impressions of students with better looking papers even if it is not as good as a messy one. However this will not get you better grades unless the assignment is subjective or part of the mark is for neatness and organization. A good impression will make the teacher and yourself more comfortable to talk to each other and let the teacher help you, which, in the long run, will give you a much higher chance with a better grade.

, Did you know that the average person spends up to 4 years of their life waiting? Use any spare waiting time to study. You don't have to be a hardcore nerd, reading out of a textbook in the doctor's office; bring a piece of paper with notes written on them or bring your math workbook and do your homework. Not only will this help you prepare for your test(s), it will also less likely make you bored.

, This is cheating, and you can't get into good universities by cheating. But enjoying a class will actually make the class be and seem class easier

, It takes about 5 minutes for an unorganized person to find their things. Now imagine if you have a lot of homework! A good 20-30 minutes will be wasted if you are not organized. In 20 minutes you could learn a few new words in a new language!

, Nothing beats a better school day when your brain is on full blast and your stomach not growling.

, If not, review them at study hall and/or at home. Reviewing them once a day for 5 minutes will highly increase your chances for remembering them. If you didn't take notes, create or write on index cards at home getting your information from your textbook, and follow the same process.

, It doesn't hurt to ""learn"" something twice. It will also be explained to you more clearly while already knowing what you are going to learn.

, Your learning is not limited to a certified teacher. Your friend might understand the subject more than you, or your parents may have majored in math or literature so ask for help!

, It seems pretty obvious, but some students are too shy to get help or just don't care enough to do so. It will ensure that you understand all the material so you will be fully prepared to get an ""A"". You study all you want, but if you don't get help and understand what you're learning, you won't get the grades you are striving for."

Be patient.,
Form a group of friends, not a clique.",How to Fit In at High School," Most high schools have an orientation period where you can visit the school. While you're at orientation, try talking to other people to see if you have any common interests.For example, you could say, ""Hi! I'm John. So are you starting here, too? I'm going to be in the band. What about you?"";
, Most high schools have a wide variety of clubs and activities for you to join, based on your interest. The best thing about joining clubs is you'll meet other teens with the same interest, which gives you something to talk about.For instance, maybe you want to join the speech club or the art club, or maybe you want to be a part of the marching band or the choir. You'll find other teens who love art or music, just like you.If you don't see a club you like, ask your administrators about starting a club around that interest. Just make sure it's school-appropriate before asking. You'll probably need a teacher to sponsor you, as well.

, That is, the more often you see the same group of people, the more familiar you become to those people. Over time, you'll start to become closer and closer to people in that group. Try to sit with the same group of people at lunch, for instance. Alternatively, the group can be people you sit with in class or people you see in one of your clubs or activities., Some teens probably came up to high school from middle school with you. Try to meet up with old friends, even ones you weren't that close to. You may find you have more in common now that you are in high school.When you see an old friend in the hallway, be sure to say hello. Ask about a time to hang out, or see if you can do homework together to catch up on old times.

, People can't get to know you if you never say anything. Don't be afraid to introduce yourself or speak up in class or meetings.Start by saying hello to the people near you in class before the bell rings. You could say, ""Hi, I'm Jess. I'm excited about it being the first day of school, but I'm a little nervous, too. What about you?""

, When you find people you like, ask if you can join them. For instance, say you see someone at lunch that you have a class with. Ask if you can sit with them.For instance, you could say, ""Hey, we have math together, right? Do you mind if I sit here?""

, People like hearing nice things about themselves. When you give someone a compliment, it opens the door for conversation. It makes them feel good, and it will make you feel good, too.The best compliments are specific. For example, rather than saying, ""I think you're smart,"" you could say, ""It's amazing how quickly you pick up what Mr. Roberts is saying in math. It's like you're a math wizard!""

, One way to start turning people into friends is to learn about the person. That is, get him or her to talk about themselves. People like to talk about themselves, so asking them questions can get them talking. For instance, ask about their favorite school subjects or what they like to do outside of school.As an example, you could ask, ""So what do you like to do for fun?"" or ""Do you have a favorite video game?""

, One tried-and-true way to make friends is to be nice to people. You like it when people are nice to you, right? Well, so does everyone else. Try bringing a treat to share with a new friend or helping someone pick up their books in the hallway when they drop them. These little acts of kindness go a long way to helping you to make friends and belong., Just like you want to fit in, so do other people. It can be tempting to exclude people who aren't like you, but then you're doing the thing you're trying to avoid from other people. In other words, you're making the problem worse. No one's perfect. You have to accept people as they are.That doesn't mean you need to be friends with people who are mean to you or who bully you. Rather, it means that you shouldn't try to exclude someone from being your friend just because you think he or she is a little weird.

, ""Fit in"" implies that you want to be like everyone else to make friends. In high school (and adult life), that can be very tempting. It feels easier to hide parts of yourself than to be true to yourself and risk the chance of being pushed out of a group. However, living in a way that's not true to yourself will make you feel worse over time. In addition, letting your personality shine will help you find other people who are like you, creating a group of solid friends.""Fitting in"" often means you have to change yourself to basically go unnoticed in a group. ""Belonging"" implies the group actively wants you to be there., That is, every person is unique with a unique set of thoughts, ideas, and feelings. Yes, you are different from everyone else, but ever other person is, too. What does that mean for fitting in? It may mean embracing those differences and finding other people who are willing to embrace those differences, too., Sometimes, it may take you a little while to find your group of people. You may feel lonely for a bit. If you keep working at, though, hopefully you will find a group of people who cares about who you are as a person.Meanwhile, keep doing what you love and joining groups that interest you. Keep saying hello to people in your classes.

, Maybe you've formed a group of friends in your band because you have a shared interest. That's typical of a group of friends. Other times, groups of friends may form because of shared values, such as you all believe in the same religion, and you are welcoming to others who want to join in. Cliques, on the other hand, push for conformity, and they are often focused on being the most popular or the most in. The problem with cliques is they intentionally exclude others making people feel left out.Another defining aspect of cliques is that it's the only group members can belong to. In other words, if you were in a clique, you probably wouldn't be able to have friends in band or art class, for example. That hurts you, since you may be excluding yourself from some great people who could be awesome friends."

, Mostly this is a choice that must be made by the student, but there are ways you as a parent can help. Gently remind them to do their homework and ask about what they are doing in school. Make sure they are doing well academically as many schools don't allow children with low grades to participate in sports. Sometimes, children try to tell their parents about school. When those parents act bored and uninterested in their student's work, the student gets discouraged. He may drop classes or get bad grades, just as a result of the parent not acting interested.

, Occasionally ask if they want to play catch, throw around the football, kick a soccer ball, or go for a run. If you run, make sure you go their pace! Tell them what they need to brush up on & when they do well.

, Be supportive and always cheer for your child and their team. Be careful not to embarrass them, but also don't skulk silently on the sidelines.

, Ask about upcoming tests and if they need help studying. Ask about upcoming games and if they want to practice. If they decline your offer, don't worry about it. Many times, even if you don't see it, your child has a lot more things under control than you might think.

, You can't support them if you are never there! Tell them they did well. Don't talk about mistakes or slip ups. Keep the praise on your child,try to stay away from telling them that ""number 12 was really good."" Tell them they did well win or lose!

, Make sure they get their vitamins and minerals, and have a balanced diet. That means protein, good carbs, good calories, not so much sugar, not as much fat and oils, and have them drink lots of water and green tea. For breakfast, maybe make pancakes with blueberry syrup (heat blueberries and add maple syrup) and eggs with protein meat and a little bit of cheese. For lunch, they could have a HEALTHY Whole Wheat (not the molasses-colored crud they call whole wheat) bread with some ham or chicken, cheese, and lettuce or spinach. You might also add a tomato.

Bring comfortable underwear.,
Wear clean clothes.,
Take it easy with the accessories.,

Be confident.,
Relax and have fun.",How to Look Your Best During Gym Class," If you wear your hair long, it’s going to turn into a bit of a sweaty mess during gym class. Try tying it up in a ponytail, and wearing accessories that match your gym outfit. You can also try tying it back in a braid or a bun for a different look.


If you have shorter hair, you have a few more options available to you. You can either pin your hair to the side or wear a headband. You might even get away with just leaving it down.
Avoid using gel or other product in your hair. They’ll lose their effectiveness when mixed with sweat and might even run.;
, You shouldn’t wear makeup in gym class for several reasons. First, excess sweat will make it run, possibly ruining your look. Second, makeup can clog your pores. Combine clogged pores with sweat and dirt and you’ve got a perfect recipe for breakouts. Use a cleansing wipe to get your makeup off before gym class.


If you want to wear makeup for your next class, make sure to keep your makeup in your locker., You’re going to have a lot of things to carry to and from gym class: your outfit, your shoes, a towel, maybe even makeup. Not only should your bag be efficient and able to hold all these, but it should look good too. Get something that fits your style and shows off your personality., You can usually get away with a well fitted t-shirt, but you can go sleeveless if you want to show off your arms. You can be creative with prints and colors; have fun with it. If you’re a bit more self-conscious about your upper body, try wearing a shirt or tank top that reaches your hips. It’ll hide your love handles or your tummy if you want it to.Fit is important when choosing a top. If it's too loose, it’ll be in the way. If it's too tight, it’ll be less than flattering. Opt for the happy middle.

, If you’re confident that you have nice looking legs, rock a good pair of shorts. They’ll keep you cool and show off what you’ve got. If you think you might get cold, or you’re a bit more self-conscious about your legs, wear a basic pair of black leggings or track pants.

It’s important to keep a healthy balance between looking good and feeling confident. If you try to wear things that look good but don’t make you feel confident, you might feel embarrassed during gym class and won’t have a good time., Your first priority with shoes should be the fit. Depending on the arch of your feet and their size, some models won’t make for a good fit. Even if you have the coolest shoes, gym class is going to be a nightmare if they make for a painful fit. Always try a shoe before buying it, and get it in the right size.


If you want to kick your style up a notch, pair your shoes with some colorful socks., Looking good starts with feeling good. Wear a pair that makes you feel confident, and it’ll translate into your attitude. Even though no one will see them (hopefully), just knowing that you’re wearing them will boost your confidence.

If you need one, make sure your sports bra fits well.
If you’re wearing leggings, thongs and boy shorts are best for avoiding panty lines., Your gym clothes shouldn’t be left in your bag overnight. Anything you’re going to sweat in should be washed after every use. Build up this good habit, and you’ll never have to wear stained or smell clothes to gym class., If you want to wear something on your head, you should keep it simple. Hats with brims tend to get in the way, so only wear them if you’re outside and need to block the sun. Stick to a simple beanie in a flat color that fits the rest of your outfit.

Wristbands should really only be worn if you’re worried about excess sweat. They’re great for wiping a sweaty brow, but aren’t the most stylish thing around., If you are worried about playing sports in class, practice at home. You won’t become an all-star player overnight, but you’ll feel more comfortable (and look better) playing basketball in gym class if you’ve dribbled a few times beforehand. The same goes for any other athletic activity. Even jumping jacks can be difficult if you’ve never done one., When you’re thinking of what to wear to look good in gym class, the goal should be to bolster your confidence. Thinking positively and dressing well create a self-confidence loop of sorts that will help you get through gym class more easily. You’ll feel confident because you look good, and you’ll look better because you carry yourself confidently.


Staying focused on what you’re doing will help you stop worrying about distractions. Your performance will improve, and you’ll feel more confident as a result.
Talk and bond with your classmates. Gym class is one of the few times you can interact with them outside of a classroom. Take the chance to set a relaxed atmosphere, and you’ll realize people care less about your performance than you think., People are spending a lot less time looking at you than you think they are. Remember that except for the jocks, most of your classmates are nervous about gym class on some level too. Most of them aren’t looking to judge you. Remember that gym class is one of the only chances you get to exercise in the day. Try to have fun with it."

, You'll be a lot happier and more at ease following your own interests, so be sure to make time for extra-curricular activities that you enjoy.If you apply to college, include your activities on your application. This helps give admissions committees a better idea about who you are as an actual person.

, High school is a great place to find people and clubs that share your interests. Once you've learned a bit about your own likes and dislikes and what you are passionate about, you can further develop these interests or skills with a larger community.


If your high school does not have a club that caters to your interests or passions, start one of your own!

, It isn't about winning, but instead, about having a good time and getting some exercise. So, even if you have never considered yourself the athletic type, you should consider giving sports a chance.


If your school has a pool, you might want to try the swim, water polo, or dive teams.
Track and field has many different types of events, each designed to showcase a different talent or skill set.
Sports like tennis and badminton allow you to play in pairs/partners. This is a great way to meet new people and socialize.
There are alternatives to mainstream sports... skateboarding, snowboarding, roller derby.
You might find out that you're good at sports!

Keep an open mind, you might find another interest or passion.
Depending on your area, there may be extra-curricular clubs and organizations that cater to an interest in the arts.

, This is an excellent way of getting to know yourself better and will help you reflect on your own feelings. Sometimes you aren't ""sure"" how you feel about something until some time has passed.

Nearly the entire time no one is watching you. Most locker rooms have a no cameras/phone policy. If yours doesn't, ask your teacher about instituting one.;
, Theft is a big issue in many locker rooms. Lock your locker at all times, even if you think no one will be in the locker room. There's nothing worse to coming back from class to find your shirt/shoes/wallet/phone/etc. missing.

, Realize you have a limited amount of time to dress, so be quick.

, ""Dress cuts"" effect your grade enormously. Unless you made a mistake and left your clothes at home, don't purposely decide not to dress. Even if you hate running, it's better to run slowly and get credit for the day than to get no points for the run.

, Don't cut PE because you ""don't feel like it"". Go to class, but just take it easy and slowly.

,, Don't sprint ahead and then lose steam after the first 1/2 lap. Run at a steady rhythm and pace. Try not to stop and walk more than twice during a run. Don't worry about what place you come in--it's gym class, not the Olympics.

Although someone may have a shared interest, it does not mean that this person is exactly like you in every way.
Don’t worry about being popular. Instead, spend time with people who share your interests and values.
Be proactive. Lots of people are shy and too scared to initiate conversation, and therefore, never reach out to you.

, If your parents will allow you to date, spend time with people that you enjoy and are interested in, and who treat you with respect and kindness.


Again, keep an open mind.
Try not to take it too seriously. Teen romances are full of ups and downs, so take a relaxed approach.
Break-ups and broken hearts are inevitable. But do your best to handle the rejection and do not let it make you feel bad about yourself.
When it comes to physical intimacy, go at your own pace. There is no need to rush into sex, but if you do, be safe. , Don’t let anyone pressure you into activities you are not comfortable with; including sex, drugs, or alcohol. And definitely do not pressure others into doing anything they do not want to do. Respect boundaries.


You will not feel good about yourself if you do something that you didn’t really want to do.
If someone is pressuring you, say no firmly and repeatedly if necessary. Leave the situation if they do not respect your feelings.
Talk to an adult who can provide support.
Be with a trusted friend. It will be easier to resist peer pressure if you have back up., Harassment can make your time in high school a living hell. Letting bullies know that you will not put up with such treatment will often take care of the problem.


Try to avoid the bully.
Be aware of other students who are being bullied by the same person. They can be important allies.
Talk to a parent, teacher, or counselor if someone is threatening bodily harm or if you feel you are in danger, or if the harassment is getting out of control or taking an emotional toll."

Know what your responsibilities are for each day and week.,
Set your priorities.,
Allocate enough time to perform your daily academic duties.,
Do the work.,
Assess your strengths and weaknesses.,
Study.,
Seek help.,
Keep your grades up.",How to Enjoy High School3," You won't be able to do your homework if you forgot about it, so keep track of your class schedule, important due dates, and other bits of important information (reading schedules, group contact information, etc.).


Try using a calendar.
Establish connections with a friend or fellow student. If either of you are absent, you can help fill each other in on what was missed in class.
Do not be afraid to contact your teacher if you need any class information. He or She is there to help.

, You won't always have time to dedicate yourself entirely to each of the tasks or projects in your life, but be sure to always put your own personal academic success high on your priority list.


This may mean staying in on the weekend or saying no to a friend, but in order to succeed in school you must have enough time to do your work. This means prioritizing things that you might hate doing.

, Managing your time wisely is the single, most effective thing you can learn to do to help yourself succeed in school.


Plan ahead and know important due dates. Mark these on your calendar.
Know that each the schedule of each week will vary drastically. Some weeks you may have an exam, a paper due, and perhaps a game or band performance that same week. Allocate time according to priority.

, When it comes time to do your homework, commit yourself entirely to the task at hand. In time, you will soon be able to gauge your own work rate and homework patterns, and will be able to more accurately plan your time.


Everyone has their own work habits. While waiting until the last minute is never an ideal situation, some students do perform better with the added pressure.
If you are one of these people, try scheduling less time for your homework (but earlier on), instead of waiting until the last minute. This will help simulate pressure, but still ensure that you can complete the assignment.

, When you get an assignment back from a teacher, do your best to read the comments and understand why you received the grade that you did (good or bad).


Do not be afraid to ask a teacher to clarify or elaborate on a comment. Be patient, however, as many educators are overworked and are trying to find happiness in their own lives as well.
Be honest with yourself. If you received a bad grade, own it... Do not make excuses.

, Believe it or not, but studying and doing homework are not the same thing. ""Studying"" refers to the very act of learning, which can occur in the classroom or at home. Homework, on the other hand, is designed to reinforce a lesson through repetition and practice. Set aside time to ""study"" the subjects that are difficult for you (e.g., math, chemistry, history).


Studying can help you get caught-up and even ahead of the classroom.
Like homework, each student develops his or her own study habits.
Be sure to allocate time for homework and for studying.

, Ask a friend for help in the subjects that are difficult for you; or see a tutor, or speak with your teacher. There are many ways of getting academic help while in high school, but you need to be proactive.


Be honest with your own weaknesses.
Do not be afraid or ashamed. Many people need help. In fact, Albert Einstein struggled with learning how to read.

, There can be a lot of distractions in high school, so do your best to remain focused. Don't forget, high school is about learning.Many teams and clubs have GPA requirements.
You'll need a good academic record when you apply for college or jobs.
Be proud of your handwork and good grades.

Wait until you have done it enough in public and in front of friends, as to not get unexpected erections in front of the whole PE class.,
Do not take any underwear with you to school, thus forcing yourself to freeball.

,
When that class period comes around to change in the locker room, don't make it obvious you are freeballing.,
When changing, just take off your shoes first, then take off your shirt and/or sweatshirts, then quickly take off your pants or shorts and put on your PE shorts or Pants, so that no one who is watching or gets a glimpse of your freeballing is entirely sure that you are indeed freeballing.,
Do not make it obvious that you are freeballing.,
Before you know it you will hopefully be able to freeball in PE class every single day, and maybe eventually stop wearing underwear all together.

",How to Freeball in Gym Class,";
,, Just change like you have freeballed for a long time and that freeballing is as normal to you as is underwear to another guy.

, (of course you can stop this soon after you have freeballed enough in PE)

, Also if wearing shorts such as Basketball shorts, be careful at first to not spread or open your legs too much, especially if they are very short shorts, as you may accidentally show your classmates something they were never meant to see. Lastly, wear shorts/pants that fit you or that you can tie tight around your waist, so that they will not sag or fall down, which of course will easily show others that you are without underwear.

Change in a private area.,
Wear clothes that can double as gym clothes.,
Wear your gym clothes under your regular (“street”) clothes.",How to Change Your Clothes for Gym Without Being Embarrassed1," While there are alternate methods to help you change in front of others, you may be most comfortable if you can avoid it altogether. Most locker rooms have private bathroom stalls or some may even have curtained-off shower stalls where you can change.


You may find that if you do this, others will follow suit. You're surely not the only one who would rather have a bit of privacy.
It's also possible, though, that if everyone else changes out in the open, and if you're the only one who changes in private, you may draw unwanted attention to yourself, which could expose you to additional teasing.
While you should keep this in mind, the most important thing is that you feel comfortable, so choose the method that works best for you.;
, If your school does not have a specific uniform that can only be worn in gym class, then you may be able to dress for gym at home on the days that you'll have P.E. class.


For example, thick leggings are very popular right now for girls, paired with long T-shirts. You can wear your leggings to school with tall boots, and layer a couple of cute T-shirts over it. Once you go to gym, you'll only need to change into your athletic shoes and remove your top t-shirt.
Guys and girls alike can usually get away with wearing long athletic shorts or pants to regular classes, paired with a T-shirt or sweatshirt.

, If your school does have a specific uniform, or if you have to wear shorts and a T-shirt even in the winter, for example, you may be able to wear your gym clothes under your street clothes.


For example, if your school's gym outfit is a white T-shirt with black shorts, you can wear tighter-fitting black shorts under your skirt or pants, and a plain white t-shirt with a sweater, cardigan, button-down, etc. over it.
You can wear a tank top under your shirt so when you take off your shirt your tank top is still on. When you change back into your clothes, you still have the tank top on - no exposure!

"
"
Change your shirt.,
Change into your gym pants or shorts.,
Change your underwear.,
Change your bra.",How to Change Your Clothes for Gym Without Being Embarrassed2," It's fairly easy to change your shirt quickly without exposing yourself for too long. To begin, sit down on a bench with your gym shirt on your lap (with the front of your shirt facing down and the neck of the shirt towards your knees).


You can also perform this move while standing up in front of your locker, if you have one. Your open locker door can shield part of your body: Instead of placing your shirt on your lap, have it placed in the bottom of your locker ready to go for the following steps.
Pull your arms out of your shirt. If your shirt is a pull-over style, remove your arms, but don't take the shirt all the way off. Keep your head in the neck opening of the shirt, with the shirt draped over your body. (If you are wearing a button-down style shirt, unbutton your shirt completely and take your arms out, but leave the shirt draped over your shoulders.)
Place your hands up through bottom opening of your gym shirt and into the arms. Then raise your arms and lift your old shirt off as you slip the new one over your head. Your shirt should fall behind you as you raise your arms.

, If you want to draw as little attention to yourself as possible when changing out of your street pants, try this quick change hack. Begin by having your gym pants ready beside you on a bench (right-side out, with drawstrings loosened, etc.). Make sure that your shoes are off as well, before you get started.


Loosen your regular clothes (unbutton, unzip, or unfasten your jeans, pants, or skirt) and begin to slide them down.
Sit down once you've lowered them past your hips. This will minimize the amount of time you are standing up with your underwear exposed.
Once you are sitting, slide your bottoms past your knees and down off your feet. While you are still bent over, reach over and grab your gym pants/shorts, and step into them.
Pull your gym pants up to your knees while you remain sitting down, and then stand up to quickly slide them over your hips.
You can also try pulling your gym pants up while sitting down instead of standing: push down with your legs while sitting so that your hips are raised off the bench, and pull up your gym pants.

, It's a good idea to change into fresh underwear after gym class. If you choose to do so, the procedure is basically the same as changing your pants (explained above.)


Begin by having your underwear ready next to you. You don't want to be searching through your gym bag for your clean pair after you've removed your dirty pair.
Loosen your gym pants, and then slide them down along with your underwear. Sit down once they are past your hips.
Step out of your dirty clothes, grab your fresh underwear and step into them. Once your feet are both through the opening, slide them up quickly. You should be able to slide your underwear up and over your hips while sitting down without having to stand all the way up.
It's probably best if you leave your shirt on while you do this—you'll feel less exposed.
You can also drape a towel over your lap while you are changing your underwear.

, If you need to wear a sports bra for gym class, you could just wear one to school and not change. However, this may not be comfortable all day, or it may not look right in your streets clothes. If that's the case, it's fairly easy to change in the locker room without drawing too much attention to yourself. Begin by removing your shirt and putting your sports bra on over your regular bra.


Then reach under the sports bra to unhook your regular bra.
Slide the right bra strap out over your shoulder and pull your arm out.
Repeat on the left side, and then remove your regular bra by pulling it out from the front (reach under your sports bra and pull your regular bra out).
Have your shirt ready to slip on quickly once you're done with this. It's probably a bit too hard to do this with a shirt on, though you could practice at home to see if it's possible.

Be prepared for menstruation issues.,
Know that erections happen.,
Know your rights as trans person.,
Try not to compare your body to others.",How to Change Your Clothes for Gym Without Being Embarrassed3," If you have begun your period (or will start soon), you may have special worries about changing in the locker room. Your best strategy is to be prepared: make sure that you have pads, liners, and/or tampons on hand all the time in your gym bag or locker.


If you are on your period, consider wearing dark underwear and/or pants and bottoms.
If you're worried about wearing pads, especially in gym class where you are more active, you may want to become comfortable using tampons, which are much more discreet.
Ask to see the school nurse if you feel cramps coming on or if you feel queasy. You can tell your teacher that you aren't feeling well (keep it somewhat vague). Then tell the nurse, of course, about your situation.Remember that you're not the only one going through this, and most girls are more than willing to help each other out when one of them runs out of supplies or begins her period unexpectedly. In fact, it's sometimes a way to bond!

, The male locker room has its own issues. Many guys are worried about how their equipment stacks up, and are concerned that others will be comparing them. If you're a guy, you may also be worried about having an unexpected erection at an inopportune time.


You can try to prevent this from happening from keeping your thoughts as non-sexual as possible while changing. For example, think about the upcoming basketball game instead of the date you have planned for later this evening.
It may also help to wear tighter-fitting underwear, such as briefs or boxer-briefs, instead of loose boxers. If you do have an erection, this can make it less noticeable.It never hurts to drape your lap with a towel when you are changing out of or into your pants, as well.

, If you are transgender, then you are most likely facing unique concerns. It's important that you know your rights and find advocates to support you. Among your most important rights is the right to feel safe, comfortable and non-threatened at school.


In many states and school districts, this includes the right to change in the locker room where you are most comfortable changing (whether that is the room that matches the gender with which you identify or the one that correlates with the sex you were assigned at birth).
Even if your state does not have specific legislation outlining rights for transgender people, you are protected by Title IX against gender discrimination.If you're unsure about where you can change, or if you are being bullied or harassed, it's very important that you seek help from a trusted adult: a parent, teacher, counselor, principal, etc. You shouldn't have to deal with bullies alone.

, It's really hard not to look around the locker room and notice the differences between your classmates and you. If you have body insecurities, it's especially difficult.


Try to keep in mind that everyone else (or nearly everyone) also has their own body issues. While this won't automatically make you feel better about your own body, understanding this can help keep things in perspective.
If you are struggling to come to terms with your own body or your anxiety about changing in front of others, do not hesitate to talk to someone, whether that is a parent, teacher or counselor. See also our helpful wiki on how to accept your body.

Get a GED (or Certificate of High School Proficiency).",How to Drop Out of High School," Knowing why you want to drop out can help you decide whether it is really the best path and can help you decide what to do. Some common reasons for dropping out are:A lack of intellectual stimulation. If you find high school to be too easy and you are bored, you may be tempted to drop out and start college or vocational training early.
Feeling unprepared and behind. If you feel as though high school is too difficult, you have missed too much content to ever catch up, or no one will support you, you may be tempted to leave high school and give up on your education.
Having other responsibilities. If you are unexpectedly becoming a parent, have an ailing family member, or have to work to support your family, you may feel that dropping out of high school is your only option so that you have time to work.;
, See your guidance counselor or a teacher that you trust and tell them your situation. There may be a solution to your complaint that does not involve dropping out:


If you are experiencing a lack of intellectual stimulation, you may be able to take more challenging classes.Some schools that do not offer advanced-level courses on-site may have relationships with colleges or with online-based institutions. You may even be able to dual-enroll and complete an Associate’s Degree and your high school diploma at the same time.
If you are feeling unprepared and behind, you might have to work really hard to catch up if you are behind. The good news is that there are likely educators at your school that will work with you and help you, particularly if they know that you are considering dropping out. Ask about credit recovery, offer classroom labor (like cleaning or organizing) in exchange for tutoring, and find out what work can be made up.
If you have other responsibilities, talk to your guidance counselor about them. You may be able to do a work program that earns both money and school credit. Your counselor may also know of financial resources that could help you financially while keeping you in school. Remember that a high school graduate’s lifetime income is 50%-100% higher than someone who drops out,so dropping out may not be the best long-term solution for your family.

, If someone else—a parent, a friend, or a significant other—is pressuring you to drop out, tell them to stop. This is a decision that only you can make. This decision could have a long-ranging impact on your life, so you need to feel confident in your convictions.

, You will have to explain your decision many times, to many different people. Before you have those conversations, be sure that you can make a reasoned, clear argument for taking the path that you are taking.


For example, “I am not being served by this educational system. I am not challenged, interested, or inspired by the curriculum or the educators. I am choosing to drop out of high school so that I can pursue higher education on my own and find an educational institution that fits my academic goals.”
For example, “I am choosing to drop out because I feel like I have no other choice. To make up the work and education I missed by being absent for so many days, I would have to attend school for another year. My grades are so low that I may not be eligible for a diploma even if I do all of the work I am supposed to do. I will be much better off if I can just leave, get my GED, and start working.”
For example, “I am choosing to leave school so that I can work full-time. While this decision may not make sense to you, I know the needs of myself and my family, and having the money to feed my family and myself is more important than learning about academic things that may never affect my life.”

, Many school districts offer an alternative or independent high school. This is often a school with more flexible times and a different mindset. The students who attend alternative high schools can be more mature and often work.


If much of your complaint about high school is the environment and the students, an alternative high school may be a better fit for you.
Alternative high schools will sometimes allow you to accelerate your courses and finish early.

, Before you set the dropping out plan in motion, you should know what you are going to do instead of high school. You most likely will try to get a GED or high school equivalency. It is important to do this as soon as possible, while you are still in “school mode.”


If you plan to leave high school to start college or a vocational program, be sure you can enter the program you wish to enter with a high school equivalency.
If you are planning to go to work full time, be sure you have a job lined up first. Find out how many hours you will be able to work and ask about benefits like health and dental insurance.

, The best way to be ready to answer the questions and handle the “are you sure?” responses that you will likely get from the adults in your life is to anticipate their questions before they ask them. Try to preview the conversations before they happen and come up with responses to arguments and questions that will likely be asked.

, Even if you are 18 and can legally make your own decision, it is considerate to tell the people who have been responsible for you up to this point what decision you are making (preferably before you make it official). Tell them your reasons, but don’t expect them to necessarily agree right away. It may take some time for the idea to sink in, and they may never think it is a good idea. But if you are clear and firm, they will likely respect your decision.


Have a back-up plan in place. The worst-case scenario is that your guardians may kick you out of the house if you drop out. If you think this may happen, have somewhere to go (at least temporarily).

, Visit your guidance counselor and tell him/her your plans. Be sure to present him/her with your reasoning, your plans for the future, and your guardians’ response to your decision (even if it wasn’t favorable).

, Every state is a little different, so make sure you know at what age you're legally allowed to quit school. Some states allow students to drop out at 16, while others will not allow you to make that decision until you're 18. Though you can drop out with a legal guardian's consent if you're younger than the established age in some states, other states will not allow you to drop out before the age of 18, even with your guardian's consent. Make sure you know this information before dropping out.You can find your state's legal age requirements here.

, Even though you're considered a drop-out if you just stop going to school altogether, the action of doing so without consulting the proper legal channels can have legal ramifications for you and your legal guardians.


Simply no longer attending school is referred to as truancy in legal terms. It can lead to fines and community service for you and/or your legal guardians.
Becoming truant may stand in your way of receiving a high school equivalency.

, In some states, you might be allowed to legally leave school early if your legal guardians agree and if you pass a High School equivalency test or get a GED. Make sure to research if your state adopts this policy., Each state and school district has different forms that you and your parents need to fill out. Make sure to consult with the appropriate person at your school to find out which documents need to be filed and when they have to be returned.


Be aware that your guidance counselor may try to talk you out of your decision. Be prepared to offer your reasons for making your decision and be confident in your decision.

, These options, if pursued with a measure of dedication, will earn you a diploma while allowing you to do it at your own pace and without the social encumbrances associated with high school.

, This could be a great option that you can work on with your school's staff. If there's a particular field of work you're interested in, you might consider a work-study program. Not only would you be able to finish school, but you might end up graduating with job options.

, You might also look into early admission into Junior/Community College through a Gateway Program at your school. If you have enough credits, certain High Schools will allow you to transfer to a Community/Junior College.

, If you're allowed to choose where your locker is, that is. It's a lot easier to change in front of someone you know and trust than to change in front of a complete stranger. Try to also keep your locker away from untrustworthy people.

, Struggling too hard to get some really tight pants on or off will only draw attention to yourself. Wear shoes that are easy to slip on and off, like flats. Skinny jeans on a gym day is a bad idea. If your pants or skirt is very loose, you can wear your gym shoes during the day and just put on your pants and tee shirt for gym.

, Usually, people will come in later so they can have longer breaks in between periods and at snack and lunch, which means there will be virtually no one in the locker room early on. Plus, if there actually is anyone there, they'll probably be more spread out across the room.

, This reduces the off-chance that someone will accidentally glance over at you when you're in a particularly revealing spot.


Change one item of clothing at a time. For example, change your shirt and then change your pants, or vice versa. That way, you'll never be completely naked.

Don’t worry too much.",How to Deal With Upper Classmen in High School," Keep a low profile for the first few weeks and don’t do anything that might single you out. Older students sometimes give freshmen a hard time for the simple fact that they’re new and are usually too timid to stand up for themselves. When you’re getting started in high school, keep your head down, get a feel for the place and gain some confidence navigating your new surroundings before you start to explore social relationships.Though it can be hard at first, your best bet for blending is to act like you already know how things around your school work. Try not to walk around staring in wide-eyed wonder; this will make it obvious to upperclassmen that you’re new and overwhelmed.
Stick closely with your friends that are carrying over from middle school. They can be a great comfort while you’re all trying to get used to a new school and grade together. Get a sense of your classmates’ character before you attempt to make a new friend.;
, Everybody likes nice people. If you're friendly toward every fresh face you see, they'll feel comfortable being around you and will have no reason to try to belittle you. Smile and introduce yourself to your new classmates, even the older ones. This is a good way to break the ice and get off on the right foot, since being the new kid at school can be a little awkward at first.Make an effort to be nice even when people aren't being nice to you. Returning negative feelings doesn't help anything. If someone is mean to you for no reason, don't bother with them. It's their loss!

, Pay close attention to where things are and how things are done so you can learn your way around your new school. Chances are, you won’t have to spend a lot of time dodging taunting juniors and seniors if you always know exactly where you’re going and move around with your group of friends. Finding your way around will make you feel more at home in your new school, which will give your confidence a boost.Take the time to map out the quickest routes between all your classes, your locker, the cafeteria, gym and anywhere else you have to be on a daily basis, and don’t deviate from these routes until you feel comfortable getting around.

, Some unfriendly upperclassmen will take any opening they can to make fun of you, from the clothes you wear to the people you hang out with. Don't pay any attention to their insults. If you just ignore them, they'll have no reason to continue. Bullying is usually based on insecurity, so if someone is making fun of you, it probably just means they don't think much of themselves.When ignoring a bully doesn't work, don't be afraid to speak up. You have the right not to be harassed at school. Bullies most often target kids that are younger or too timid to stand up for themselves, so if you stand firm, they will back off.
If you stand up to a bully and the situation escalates to aggression, calmly find a faculty member and have them break it up. The bully will be dealt with and will think twice about bothering you in the future. You have more important things to do than deal with spiteful people who are always trying to start a problem with someone else.

, Some upperclassmen are more mean-spirited and will take any opportunity they can to bully and put down new students. Don’t give them the chance. Whenever you feel that ridicule or confrontation is imminent, quietly but quickly excuse yourself or move to another part of the room. Keep away from these students as much as you can—they’ll only try to make you feel bad about yourself.If at all possible, choose a desk on the other side of the room from a trouble-making student. If you come across them in the hallway, just keep going. Don’t hang around and give them an invitation to start slinging insults.
Arguing with a troublesome student will get you nowhere. Stand up for yourself by all means when you have to, but don’t engage in a back-and-forth verbal debate. This will get you nowhere. Most of the time, a bully’s motivation is simply to provoke and irritate their victims. If you deny them this satisfaction, they’ll have no reason to continue bothering you., Another way that older students might try to have fun at your expense is encourage you to do things you shouldn't be doing that could embarrass you or get you in trouble. If this scenario arises, just smile, say a simple ""no thanks"" and move on. Giving in to peer pressure might temporarily make you feel more involved, but it's hardly ever done for your own benefit. Know the right way and the wrong way to act, and have the self respect not to let others influence your decisions.When you have to say ""no,"" do it like you mean it! A classmate attempting to pressure you into doing something likely won't be discouraged if you sound unsure of yourself, so make sure that they get the idea the first time.Try to avoid situations where you think negative peer pressure might come into play, like house parties where no parents are around.

, If an instance of bullying or peer pressure ever gets so bad that it becomes detrimental to your studies or your ability to enjoy the social side of high school, let an authority figure know. Your first course of action should always be to ignore taunts and aggressive behavior, or respond with a good-natured dismissal, but if it gets out of hand, you may need a little backup. There’s no shame in getting a teacher, principal or coach to step in on your behalf; sometimes it’s the only way to get an antagonizing student to lay off.Ask a teacher or other faculty member for assistance discreetly so that it doesn’t look like you’re telling on another student. Being too obvious about making a complaint might just get you made fun of more.

, The more anxious or uncertain you seem, the more likely you are to attract negative attention. Be positive! Freshmen are more likely to worry about how they’re perceived, so if you hold yourself like you don’t have a care in the world it will become much harder and less rewarding to try to pick on you. Don’t let unkind remarks phase you. After all, they’re just words.Wake up every day with the goal of making a new friend, learning something useful or finding a way to succeed. Going to school shouldn’t have to be something you dread. Take this opportunity to make the most of your new circumstances.
Remember: no one has the final say on the way you feel but you. Feeling out of place as a new student in high school can be discouraging, but it doesn’t have to be. You’re the only one in charge of your attitude.

, Despite the age gap that exists between you and students of other grades, you all actually have a lot in common: you go to the same school, you’re forced to take the same kinds of classes and you all have your own individual interests. Be mindful of this kinship when trying to form friendships with new people. It shouldn’t matter what grade you’re in if you find joy in the same things.Take note of the things the other students around you like and play up on these similarities. If you notice that another student has a certain band sticker on his or her notebook, for example, strike up a conversation about music and your favorite bands.
Everyone feels more or less on their own in high school. Highlighting the things you have in common with your classmates will help break down the walls that keep people from becoming friends.

, While it’s true that you have a lot to learn when you first start high school, being a freshman shouldn’t be an ingrained part of your identity. You’re an individual first. Be comfortable being yourself and you’ll attract other comfortable people who want to get to know you. They may not even realize you’re a freshman if you don’t feel obligated to play the meek “new kid on the block” role.


Figure out solutions to novel problems yourself rather than always asking for help. Becoming more capable will give you a confidence boost, as well as keep you from looking like a helpless freshman.

, Why not? Become friends with anyone who you like that interests you, no matter what grade they might be in. If you make friends with older students as an underclassman, they might introduce you to their own friends, which will help you develop a reputation as a “cool” freshman. After that, being a couple grades younger won’t seem like such an issue anymore.If you have an older sibling that attends the same school, see if they’d be willing to introduce you to some of the upperclassmen friends. That way, you’ll have someone to help you find your way around, show you the ropes and shield you from ridicule from the older kids.
Students of different grade levels often wind up taking the same classes together in high school. Get to know some these older students so that you don’t feel confined to only being friends with other freshmen.

, It’s easy to leave people with a good impression of you when you feel like you’re at your best. Think of the things you most like about yourself and let those be the traits you show to people. Put a little effort into your appearance, grooming and clothing choices so that you can show up to school looking as good as you feel. Confidence is often the sole difference between standing out and fading into the background.Practice confident thinking. Focus on the good parts of your appearance and personality, not what you lack. Don’t be afraid to make mistakes and laugh off failures. Nobody’s perfect, and as long as you remember this and have a good attitude, you’ll never have a reason to fear judgment or criticism.Wake up early enough to start the day with a solid breakfast, wear clothes you like that you can be comfortable in and get a little exercise periodically to keep yourself looking and feeling good. These are all habits of self-assured people., If you have a particular skill, passion or set of interests, make it known. People like people who are good at things. Having a special ability is a great way to distinguish yourself not just from other freshman but among students of all grade levels. Sharing these skills and interests can also introduce you to new friends who like the same things you do.Look for productive outlets to exercise your passions, like trying out for a sports team, band or social club. Most schools offer these types of extracurricular activities, and they can be a great way to connect with talented, like-minded classmates., Being cool is not defined by your grade or the kind of people you hang out with. Someone who is truly cool knows how to talk to everybody, is confident being themselves and likes to have a good time with others. Put your best side forward and be the kind of person that people like to be around.A lot of people make the mistake of thinking that they have to put others down in order to be cool. This couldn’t be further from the truth. Cool people are always approachable, friendly and take an interest in others.To be cool, you have to be able to stay composed under pressure. Don’t let little things get to you, and, when in doubt, just smile., You’ll never be able to impress everyone, so why try? Instead, concentrate on doing well in school and enjoying the time you spend with the old friends you’ve kept and the new ones you make. Ignore the older students and anyone else who tries to belittle you for being new—they obviously have nothing better to do. High school should be an exciting time of learning about yourself and growing as a person. Spending too much time fretting over what other people think about you will just hold you back.

Whatever you do, don't ever do your homework in front of the TV, it will distract you. Do it at your desk which should be kept neat with equipment and books.

, You need to have a tidy desk. I suggest keeping all your books at home because it means you always have anything you need for homework.

Try experimenting with creative ways of studying so that even if you have an exam on a subject you find boring you will succeed where regular cramming would fail. Some ways to make studying more interesting and engaging include:Make an idea map about the topic. Start by drawing a circle in the middle with the main topic written inside. Then draw circles that connect to this topic with the major factors of this topic. Continue branching off from the circles with new circles that go into greater detail.
Discuss and debate the information with another person. Talking to someone else about what you're learning can be a great way to solidify the ideas in your head.
Watch an interesting and visual film that deals with the information. Search online for an educational video about the topic you're learning about.
Write a song about the topic. If you're into songwriting, this can be an effective way to greatly increase your engagement with the material. Songs stick in the mind a lot easier than book chapters.;
, It's counter productive to stay up until the wee hours of the morning to tweak an essay due the next day, or to study ""a bit more"" information before an exam, because when the day arrives, you'll be exhausted an unable to perform at your best. At the same time, you also want to avoid procrastinating, and taking too many breaks, which will leave you with inadequate studying. Set yourself concrete amounts of studying and break time. This will prevent you from accidentally burning yourself out with too much non-stop focus, and keep you from falling into the temptation of procrastination. Experiment with different combinations of study and break time to find out what works best for you. For example, with some subjects you might study best in 30 minute increments with 10 minutes of break time, and others might work better with hour long increments and 15 minutes of break time.
Sitting down and straining your eyes for long periods of time actually takes a toll on your body. Do yourself a favor and take a quick break to gently stretch your body, then go out and kick a soccer ball around, take the dog for a walk, or vacuum your room. You need to relax your mind and get your blood flowing.

, It's important to make a habit out of studying if you want to keep up with it. Start by studying for 10-15 mins at a time, and then work your way up to longer stretches of time. Find a quiet place to study with no distractions, preferably in a room other then one in which you watch TV, sleep, or do other distracting activities. Try to study around the same time each day. These kinds of habits will make studying easier to accomplish., Certain ways of studying are just better than others. Rote memorization has been proven to be fairly ineffective for learning information.Instead, you should focus on trying to really understand the material, and one way to do that is to choose active ways of studying, rather than passive. All of the following study methods are better than just trying to memorize formulas or reread the same pages over and over:Test yourself with practice tests.
Make and use flash cards.
Summarize a chapter by writing the main points down in your own words.
Try to identify links between different topics and concepts, and how they relate to each other.

, You may have one of several motives for wanting to do well. Perhaps your parents are pressuring you to do better than you are, or maybe you plan to pursue a specific career that requires better grades than those you are currently receiving. How you proceed will depend very much on these motives. For example, if you are being pressured by your parents to do better, is it because you can do better but are simply distracted, or is it that your present best just isn't good enough for them? After all, the most you can do is your best, so attempting to suddenly be a champion in a field you aren't interested in is both futile and a foolish waste of your present talents.If your motivation is to pursue a specific career path, then that should affect what courses you choose and possibly what extracurricular activities you participate in. For example, if you want to be an engineer, you'll want to try to take the most advanced math classes available. If you want to get into politics, you might consider running for the student council.

, One of the biggest factors in academic performance is how good your time management is. Start by organizing what you need to do to succeed. Some people work best by making to do lists for each class. Some prefer filling out a calendar with due dates and priorities. Then start budgeting your time. Set yourself specific times to work, and stick to them. Experiment with working at different times of the day to find out when you're most productive.Don't wait until the day before a test or when a paper's due to get started. Give yourself your own mini deadlines so that you spread out your work into manageable chunks. For example, give yourself the goal of writing one or two pages of a paper a day. Plan in advance a day to revise the paper before it's due. Give yourself a day to study each section of material that will be on the test. It's important to think ahead about how much time you need to do your best.

, Teachers and guidance councilors are there for your benefit, so use them to your advantage. Develop a relationship with your teachers. If you're struggling with an essay, go to your teacher after class and ask if you can talk about it. If you're not sure what to study for an upcoming history class, find a time when your teacher isn't busy to ask for help. Go to your guidance councilor any time you think you could use help deciding what classes to take, getting on track to pursue a certain career, or choosing a career path in the first place., Don't take the easy classes because you can do better in them. This won't help you in the long run. This is the time to challenge yourself, if for no other reason, then to see what you can accomplish. Take AP classes if your school offers them. Don't let rumors about how tough a teacher is sway you from choosing a class that interests you and you think you could excel at., One of the best predictors of success in college is success in high school. That's why taking your academics seriously in high school is such a big deal. The best motivation for putting more effort into your schooling is to never let yourself forget how much it will impact your future. Practically, this means thinking carefully about the courses you take and why you're taking them, being diligent about setting aside time to study regularly, and starting to look into colleges early, even before it's time to start applying.Also, when it is time to start applying for colleges, don't wait for the last minute. Get in on that early registration.

, Although having a social life is an important part of a well balanced life, you need to think carefully about whether maybe your friends, or boyfriend or girlfriend, are keeping you from performing the best you can in school. If you have the opposite problem, not enough of a social life, that's something to be taken care of as well, because spending time with friends is a valuable way to destress from the pressure of school.If your social life is taking up too much of your time and your grades are suffering as a result, then set yourself limits. Don't be afraid to tell your friends that you can't go out this weekend, because you've got a test Monday. There's always another night or weekend.
If your social life is lacking and it's causing you stress or sadness, make a conscious effort to reach out more to the people you do know and like. Making friends isn't always easy, but with a little confidence and effort, it can be done.

, Extracurricular activities are an often overlooked aspect of doing well in high school. If one defines ""doing well in high school"" as preparing oneself for a successful time in college and beyond, then extracurricular activities are an important factor in that respect. Things like sports participation, volunteering, student council, and club membership look good on college and job resumes, as they show initiative, drive, and the ability to work with others toward a common goal., Your family is your number one support group, and they most likely will be there to help and support you for the majority of your life. So, it's very much worth it to try to keep a good relationship with them. Of course, not everyone's relationship with their family is the same, but making an effort to help and spend time with your parents and siblings will pay off in the long run, in a multitude of ways.Parents can help you with homework, give you advice on how to deal with a difficult teacher or peer, give you emotional support when you need it, and help you choose the right classes and career path.
Siblings can help bolster your social life, give you studying advice, and, if they're older and went to the same school as you, they can even let you know what to expect from certain teachers.

, Although good grades are a part of doing well in school, it's important to remember not to get too caught up in your grades. A ""B"" in a difficult class in which you learned a lot is so much better than an ""A+"" in an easy class that won't benefit you much in the long run., School is a fairly high pressure environment, and that can cause stress and anxiety which will hinder your chances of success, and reduce your quality of life overall. Sources of anxiety can include both academic pressures like big papers and tests, and your peers, in the form of social anxiety. The most important step when it comes to managing anxiety is to ask for help, from your parents, teachers, and councilor. Reach out when the stresses of school get too heavy, and don't try to battle them alone.Cultivate positive mindsets to help manage anxiety. For example, don't think that paper you're working on as incomplete, but rather a work in progress. Instead of always focusing on how much left you have to learn, take some time to reflect on how far you've come. And don't forget to think about how the studying you're doing is helping you in the big picture of learning and growing.
If you experience test anxiety that hurts your performance when it comes to test day, take some time to prepare yourself properly, to minimize that anxiety. Get a good night's sleep the night before. Don't go into a test on an empty stomach. Take slow, deep breaths to help yourself relax. And try to flip the anxiety on its head by thinking of it as energy and excitement that can be utilized, rather than a stressful burden."

, If he or she gives you two weeks, you could finish it in one week or less if you work on it 20-25 minutes a day.

,, Many teachers do not like this and will take points off! An easier way of doing this is writing what you are going to talk about. Put the basic topic on the note card, and then you can put some bullet points below it in case you get stuck and don't know what to talk about. For example, if one of the things you need to talk about is the setting of the story put the word setting on the note card and maybe below it put bullet points that say Tundra, Antarctica, and then start talking about them more in depth.

, If you use it, take it. But don't take your whole collection. Take the makeup that you're wearing that day. Like if you are wearing light blue eyeshadow, black eyeliner and mascara only take that, in a makeup case that is small and not too big.

, If you don't your feet may get a fungus known as athlete's foot, and then you're in trouble.

, The coach probably doesn't want to deal with someone passing out. If the Coach doesn't allow you to take water bottles, hide it in your locker if you have one in the gym.

, Stick with packaged food to avoid a mess.

Find out how many hours are mandatory if any.,
Figure out your interests.,
Join a club at school based on your interests.,
When you have decided what you are going to do, invite your friends to volunteer with you.,
Get your community service form signed.",How to Complete Mandatory Community Service Hours," It would be a giant letdown, if the hours were done, only to be found out later that the adequate number weren't completed. This would also be a problem if the opposite happened, if too many hours were done, then the student would feel as if their time was wasted.;
, If the student is going to do community service, they might as well do it in the field of something they like to do. Not only does doing community service on something the student likes make the service more fun, but the student will be more efficient and do a better job as well.

, Clubs are fun things, but what students usually don't realize, is that they are a goldmine for hours. By joining a club, not only are you doing something you like, but you are going to be doing it with your fellow classmates.

, Having people to share the experience with, not only makes it more fun and makes the work easier, but it creates a lasting memory that will live on forever.

, Many schools have specific forms for documenting community service hours. Obtaining one of these forms is a necessity. There is nothing worse than not graduating because you didn't get your form signed even though you did the service.

Pretend the fart was your shoe or chair.,
Pretend someone else did it.,
Walk behind.,
Go outside.",How to Cover up a Fart in High School Settings1," The second you fart, move your feet on the floor so your shoes squeak.


Create a diversion by dropping a book or or talking right at the moment that you fart.Move in your chair to create noise from your chair moving across the floor or from the cushions in the chair. You could also cough at the same time that you fart. This won’t hide the smell, but it will help camouflage the sound, which helps identify you as the culprit.;
, There’s always the good old blame someone else tactic. This works best if you are the first person to point out the fart.


Rather than waiting for someone else to notice it, notice it first. Point it out, and look at the person next to you and point out that they just farted. Or, better yet, blame someone who doesn't know you're blaming them. The kid in the chair ahead of you who hasn't smelled the fart or heard it or the teacher who just walked past.
It’s less suspicious if you bring it up than if you ignore it. Who should you blame? If you're struggling for a suspect, just pick the person closest to you., If you’re about to fart in the hall in a group of people, just lag behind a little bit. If you’re walking behind them, they won’t very easily smell the smell.


Or make an excuse and go to the restroom or your locker when you sense that a fart is coming on. Just don’t stand around a group of people. Try to go to the bathroom right before class.
You will need to be in a group of at least three people for people to not be sure where to put the blame. So, if you’re in a large group, you might get away with it. If you’re with one or two people, lag behind or walk away.

, If you can sense a fart coming on, and you’re able to do so, go outside before you let it rip! Obviously, the outside air will more closely dissipate the smell.


The worst place to fart is in a small and enclosed space, such as an elevator. You might not be able to hold it for long, but it’s a good idea to hold it at least long enough for the elevator doors to open.
If you’re stuck in a classroom, you could ask to go to the bathroom, but that will give away that you did it if you’ve already farted, so better to try a diversionary tactic in that case.

Buy a flatulence deodorizer.,
Use perfume.,
Light a match.",How to Cover up a Fart in High School Settings2," Yes, believe it or not, there is a medical supply website that has created an ultimate scented pad.


The goal of the Flatulence Deodorizer is to camouflage the bad smells that might come out of your body.You wear the deodorizer like you would a sanitary napkin, but it’s scented. The same company produces scented pillows.

, You could just douse the smell the old-fashioned away with perfume, cologne, deodorant, or room freshener – if you’re able.


Even if you’re in a school classroom, you might be able to subtly rub some perfume on your wrists. Buy a small roll-on perfume stick you can keep in your purse.
Too much perfume doesn’t smell very good, either, but it’s a lot better than people smelling your farts., Obviously, don’t light a match if this will get you in trouble at school. Playing with fire is serious business, and you shouldn’t do it.


However, if you’re able, lighting a match will cover up a fart smell. The reason is that the smell from a fart comes from hydrogen sulfur.When you light a match, you’re igniting phosphorus. This will ignite the sulfur in the air, and mask it.

Avoid carbonated drinks and chewing gum.,
Try not to eat foods that are hard to digest.,
Use over-the-counter medication.,
Hold it in.",How to Cover up a Fart in High School Settings3," Some activities cause more gas in your body, and this can lead to stomach aches and unexpected farts. The reason is that you are taking too much air in.


Carbonated drinks, including soda and water, are known to cause more stomach gas. Chewing gum also builds up the amount of gas you might have to pass.
Holding in gas is not a good idea, either, as it can cause stomach aches. It’s hard to hold farts in for a very long time anyway, so just avoid ingesting things that will cause gas.

, Foods that have a lot of cellulose in them are very hard to fully digest. Partially digested food leads to flatulence. Instead drink herbal teas.


Beans, lentils, and root vegetables like onions, scallions, and garlic, will cause more farting. Avoid them.Dairy products and green vegetables, such as sprouts, cabbage, and broccoli, are also going to create more gas inside of you. Dairy products will especially cause flatulence in people who are lactose intolerant.

, If you’re in high school, you need permission of your parents to take medication. But there are some over-the-counter medications that will lower the gas.


Bean-O is an enzyme supplement that breaks down carbohydrates. It’s going to help reduce your gas if it’s caused by certain foods like beans or broccoli.Mylanta Gas, Maalox Anti-Gas and other similar products reduce intestinal discomfort by breaking up gas bubbles. Lactase supplements will help you with gas that is caused by intolerance to dairy.

, Ignore it, and hold it in as best as you can. You can do this by not squeezing and ""holding it in."" You may feel weird, but this is the most non attention grabbing way to do it. If this is not possible and you have a big one, try one of the other measures.


If it is a big one, ask to go to the bathroom because there is no way to hide it. To do this raise your hand, tell the teacher it is an emergency, and go to the hallway. Once in the hallway let it rip (unless people are in the hallway), then go to the bathroom.
If you know it will not be as noticeable, then you are in the clear. Just cough while executing the dirty deed, and you will be fine. But if you feel people will still notice, stand up and sharpen your pencil because it makes a lot of noise. Thus, make the fart inaudible.

Find out the true nature of any so-called scandal.,
Never let people know that the situation has brought you down.,
Do not let others' moral outrage turn you into an outcast.,
Realize that creation of a scandal is often a means by which some people get positive attention by throwing negative attention the way of another person.,
Never let those hurling the dirt win.,
Keep being you.,
Seek support.",How to Deal With a Scandal in High School," It is important to try to present the facts as they really are so that people see your side of the story as much as the one being told by those ratting on you or making up tales. Always be sincere, honest and forthright in your self-defense.;
, This is vital because the more you let it get to you, the more likely it is that others will feel they have succeeded in undermining you and making you feel worthless.

, Often those who cast the stones are the least squeaky clean themselves but it does serve their purpose to have a scapegoat diverting the attention from their behavior. Remember that all is not what it seems during any scandal.

, This is not a time for being quiet and helpless; defend yourself with words, authority figures and even with analogies that demonstrate how others are not perfect either.

, Tell them you forgive them their miserly attitudes and lack of a sense of fairness and kindness in the world. Let them know that being the way they are will not stand them in good stead in the future should they try to create a scandal out of somebody else. However, let them know that you are prepared to move on and beyond the matter at hand and that they are not a source of angst for you.

, Talk to people as always. If they cease answering you, simply smile, hold your head up high and walk on by.

, Wherever you can get support, take it. Be it family, friends, teachers, mentors or others, use such support to bolster your belief that this is but a short blip that will pass in time. Learn from it and know who your real friends and supporters truly are.

You should wait until open house or the first week of school for any less commonplace supplies, but there are some basic supplies you are likely to need regardless of your particular classes:


Pencils
Eraser
Sharpener
Pens
Ruler
Scissors
Glue Sticks (Liquid Glue is not very efficient in class)
Colored pencils;
, Ensure that it sits comfortably and is not harming your posture. Your backpack should not weigh more than you!

, When you change classes, be organized by ensuring that everything you need is in your backpack or locker.

, So if your first lesson starts at 8:30, the best time to wake up would be an hour to two hours before, in this case between 6:30 and 7:30.

, Have a shower every morning. Uncounted people have failed to survive school because they didn't shower. If you don't have the opportunity to shower in the morning, shower the night before. Even if you don't sweat a lot, it is more hygienic to shower every day/night.

, Breakfast is the most important meal of the day. If you don't have breakfast, you can't concentrate throughout the school day! Some schools also offer breakfasts in the cafeteria.

, If your school is free wear (no uniform) it is best that girls go to school in shorts and pants. Many of difficult situation can be more easily survived in shorts rather than a skirt. However, if you want to wear skirts or dresses, wear leggings or tights underneath. Even if you do have a uniform you can still look yourself. Add some jewelry or change up your shoes and you will look like yourself and still follow the school's rules., Just dress appropriately. You don't want to remember wearing short shorts and spaghetti straps in middle school when you are older.
Look your best on picture day. That means that if you school is free wear, don't come in something too sparkly and don't wear a lot of makeup; the light will make you look like the Mad Hatter!

, Even though your teacher may give a lot of homework, just make sure to think positive. School isn't about making you stressed out, it's about teaching you to become a successful adult. Talk to your parents if you feel like you've been stretched to your wits end because of all the work you're getting though. That's not good!

, Pay attention in class. The next thing you know after not paying attention is that your teacher asks you what she or he just said and you have no idea. If you need to, take notes so that you can look back on them for reference.


If you have trouble understanding the homework material then don't be afraid to ask your teacher.
Study hard for the exams. The exams in the fifth grade are nothing compared to the exams in the sixth grade.
Remember that school comes before fun! Colleges are mostly focused on high school grades, though, but that doesn't mean that you don't have to try now, too. If you do a good job in middle school, it will give you more opportunities in high school, which will help your chance into getting into a good college.

, Nobody in your future will look at your elementary/middle school grades. You're a kid, so relax!

, Be mature when you have to. For example, if you have to care for a parent with a disability or help out with your younger siblings, you need to be responsible.

, Don't take note of what other people are saying about you, unless it's positive. Focus on you, yet have empathy (consider other people's feelings).

, Be nice to people, and don't be mean. Being mean can lead to having no friends, which is not fun. Be friendly and be yourself. Then, you'll make plenty of friends.


Trying out for band is a good idea for you because you learn something new and make new friends.

, Don't take on bullies. You are perfect in every way, so don't fight back!


Understand that you will meet unpleasant people. That's a part of life.

, Having an intimate relationship just leads to heartbreak early. It's ok to have romantic feelings for someone, but don't let it distract you.'

, If they're good friends, they'll last for the rest of your middle school life, so make sure not to lose them! However, make sure that once you've established your friend group, you don't stop looking outwards.

Find a group of friends that you like and like you.,
Talk to whomever you want.,
Dress the way you want to.,
Buy school supplies that you like.,
Don't try to dress a certain way to fit a mold, because chances are, you'll eventually dislike it, or worse, be called a poser.,
Try out for something you love (sports, plays, choir, band, etc.).,
Do your homework!,
Put on a front.,
Say what you really think.",How to Be Yourself in High School," These are the kinds of people that won't try to make you be different. try to hang out with these people as much as possible to develop a good relationship with them. These will most likely be your lifelong friends, so be good to them!;
, Don't listen to what people say.

, If your school has a uniform/tight dress code, still obey these rules, but remain true to yourself. A few weeks before you start school, go to the mall and browse stores and find the clothes you like. It doesn't matter if it isn't ""in fashion"" if you like it, wear it, it's important to feel comfortable and not like you're wearing a costume. If you have a uniform/dress code, look at the rules. In the first weeks, make sure you're definitely in uniform, and just watch and see what everyone else is wearing, then become a little more bold in what you wear.

, It doesn't matter if it's meant for 3rd graders, if you like it, go for it! With backpacks, buy something functional. A lot of girls at my school are carrying around Juicy purses. I don't know why, if everyone else is, it doesn't mean you have to. Whatever you want. I have a giant purple backpack. Go with what you want. Heck, even carry your books around in your hands. (not recommended though, you may have to carry a lot of stuff)

, So don't risk it, be yourself, if people don't like you for who you are, too bad for them. Don't talk trash about people because others are, that's just uncool, and may come back to haunt you. Just don't do it.

, It doesn't matter if it's ""uncool"" it's a great way to make new friends with similar interests as you. And, does it really matter if you were cool in high school? How many really successful people were one of the more popular people in high school. (Bill Gates? Steve Jobs?)

, How are you going to find yourself in a career if you flunk out?! And if you are rich and your parents will pay then you better take that free ride. If you don't, you will live in your hometown your whole life and always talk about highschool with the other losers who never found out who they were, or who they wanted to be.

, When you feel unworthy, make yourself seem confident. When people talk behind your back, laugh at it and make up jokes about what they said.If you are in a trend that people make fun of, then make fun at your trend in front of them. Play cocky-confident guy. After a while, you will feel better. Just don't be mean to others! You are no better than anyone.

, Be who you are or think you are. Who cares what they think. Teenagers need to feel a part of a group because they are vulnerable and don't feel they know themselves. Plus, high school is not like real life. You won't see a huge selection of groupings of people all at once. And adults can relate more to people after growing up and soul searching.

Think about what you want in your high school.,
Consider where your friends are going, but don't let it dictate your whole decision.,
Discuss your choices with your parents.,
Don't leave a tour wishing you asked something.,
Don't rule out a school for one thing.,
When you go on a tour, ASK QUESTIONS!,
Try to imagine yourself going to school here every day.,
Talk to your parents (or your children) and let them know how you feel about the school.,
If there is little in the way of schools in your area that offer the subject you want, consider learning by distance or look at other ways to do the things you like, such as after school programs and clubs.

,
Make new friends, but remember your old ones.",How to Choose the Right High School," If you love art and doing hands on things, look for a high school that has lots of opportunities in art. If you're big into sports, look for a school with a good athletic program. You get the idea, right?;
, You can see your friends no matter what high school you go to, and even make new friends to introduce to the old! This is your decision not theirs.

, Ensure the fees are affordable for your family without having to make sacrifices. Fees usually only apply for private school; most public schools will charge minimal or no fees. If the fees are too high, try for a scholarship or financial aid. Scholarships are given to certain students but if you fill out a form for financial aid it's guaranteed!

, Remember - you have to spend the next four years of your life at this school. Be sure you want to go to this school, and that you have enough information to make that decision.

, If that school doesn't have as many clubs as another school don't rule it out. Or if one school has free laptops don't choose that school because of it. Or don't rule them out just because they do not have a certain class you want to take. Try to look at a school overall and not for one thing.

, What electives are there? How are the teachers? Do they have clubs? Good athletic programs? That's what tours are for. Remember step four- don't leave a tour wishing you asked something.

, Imagine how you would feel walking down the halls or in the cafeteria. If your comfortable and happy with many things about the school, then definitely make it an option. You want a school that's just right for four years.

, Make sure the whole family has agreed on the decision and everyone feels comfortable with the new enrollment.

,, You can keep in touch with them, like texting, emailing, or calling each other once in a while. You can even hang out with them if you've got time.

Keep your future in mind.",How to Choose What High School Courses to Take," High schools have a list of required credits that you must take in order to graduate. Most high schools require four years of English and Math, three years each of Social and Science; two years of a foreign language or artistic class (these vary); and various other credits. In high school, you most likely are required to take some form of Biology, Physics, Chemistry for science, and American and World History for history, along with some sociology, economics, American government/civics, and psychology, along with a health credits and PE credits. You may be required to take some type of Algebra, most likely Algebra I and II, Geometry, Statistics, and some Trigonometry. Pre-calc and Calc are generally for honor students.;
, Schools will give out a ""course list"", a list of classes that are offered to the school. Skim through this list and mark all classes that interest you.

, Look carefully at who is allowed to take the classes. Some classes are for upperclassmen only, or only for a specific grade.

, All the classes that you want to take (that are provided for your grade level) should go on this list.

, Required courses for each year can vary from school to school, but usually English, Math, Science, and some form of History are required. Sometimes high schools ask for Physical Education or a foreign language as well.

, Though it may be tempting to cram your schedule full of difficult classes, whether you are an overachiever or just would like to get them out of the way, resist. High school is a difficult time, and although you should take challenging courses, balance yourself out with courses with subjects that you enjoy.

, Goals, dreams, aspirations... the eternal 'what do you want to be when you grow up?' question comes into play in high school. Here you start laying the foundation for your career. You should have a basic idea in your head of what you'd like to do in the future. If you absolutely have no idea, try reading this article. Remember, all plans are subject to change.

Be the one that always does their homework and gets good grades. Soon, others will be following your path.

, If the teacher has math tutoring, that can also help you.

, For example, if you have a timer, set it for 15-20 minutes. If you got every answer within 15-20 minutes, reward yourself. This will encourage you to do your homework as soon as you get home. Take a quick break from homework every 30 minutes.

, Don't let anyone push you around. You should be happy, have a positive spirit, and not judge others. Here's a good idea: every time you get mad, count to 10 in your head and breathe slowly.

, If you wear a strapless shirt (even one with straps), the staff will still tell you to put a jacket on. So, if you know that you shouldn't wear it, don't.

, Pick the right friends that actually care about you and don't do anything mean toward you. The right friends should trust you, treat you nicely, and be by your side.

, Don't be upset because they seem to be mean in comparison to your old teacher.

, Whenever you're absent, make sure that you ask your friend about which work pages should be solved at home. By doing this, you can avoid being inside school all day when other people are happily at recess.

If you're trying to make friends, give everyone (even the people you don't like) a compliment every day. Try to keep in mind that your classmates are probably just as nervous as you are.;
, Be polite, friendly and helpful.

Don't be a teacher's pet. Don't be a suck-up or others will talk about you behind your back. This does not mean that you should take advantage of your teacher. You can still be nice, offer help, and participate in class. Do this often enough and you might become the teacher's pet without being viewed as a ""goody-two-shoes"". Doing the right thing is always good as long as you aren't acting like a show-off.






You'll most likely end up with a teacher that you won't like. Try to do your best to give her/him a chance. Maybe, if you get to know them better, you'll see that they're a lot cooler than you originally thought. If, for some reason, you still aren't their biggest fan, don't make a big scene about it. In most cases, you'll only have to deal with them for a year, so just make the best of the situation. Whatever you do, don't spread rumors about your teacher. They will most likely get back to her/him, and she/he won't be any more likely to treat you kindly. At the end of the day, they're your teacher and you need to respect them.







, It also helps you gain a good reputation.


Remember that not everybody can be your friend.






If a bully is being mean to you, ask them to stop and tell the nearest teacher or adult.







, Find someone who does something you like, whether it's soccer, violin, or dance. They won't get bored of you and abandon you for a new friend. Try playing together once you get to know them. See a movie if you two like the same one, or have a sleepover/hangout at your house.

, They can tell you what to expect.

, If you do not pay attention, you're going to have a very hard time. Lots of times the teacher will call on people who are zoned out. If you don't understand something, raise your hand and ask a question, or simply ask the teacher to repeat what they said.


If you are embarrassed to ask a question in front of everyone, try asking your teacher after class. You'll still get the answer, and nobody else will have to hear your question.

, Homework is necessary to practice what you've learned in class. While nobody much likes doing too much homework, it does have this useful purpose. You could tell the teacher that you'll do better in class if (s)he gives out homework passes, but don't push your luck too much and don't be rude about it.

,

If you have a mean teacher, do not give up. Try your hardest and show some respect for the teacher. She/he might lighten up with you. When they yell, listen to what they are saying, and maybe you'll know what to do better.






If you are getting yelled at, don't be embarrassed. Try to tune the teacher out. It will end soon, and nobody will remember. Besides, nobody can be perfect, and now you'll know to learn from your mistakes.






If a kid tries to unfairly get you in trouble, ask a friend to get them in trouble.The teacher won't believe you after she believes someone else.







, Before you know it, the school year will be over, and you can go back to summer awesomeness!

Develop skills.,
Work out.,
Have a phone.,

Focus on girls.,
Be fun.,
Refine your taste in music.,
Participate in social networking.",How to Be Cool in High School (Boys)," It is all in the hair. How can you be the coolest guy if you don't have cool hair? If you naturally have bad hair, learn how to care for it. If you have curly hair, rock it. If you have straight hair, gel it up, but never use too much gel, it's disgusting.Also take care of your face. Take cues from people you look up to, older brothers, cousins, celebrities, male models. Youtube is also a good source.;
, A sense of style says that you're cool, but remember to have a unique edge to things. You do not have to wear brand names all the time, but you do need to fine tune your sense in what goes and what doesn't. Low slung jeans, nice fitting t shirts, Snapback hats, athletic clothes, shoes including but not limited to the style of Air Jordan's, Van's, and Nike's. Not having any money is not an excuse. Slim cut pants and jeans, sweatpants, flat sneakers, hoodies. Surf and skate shops will sell along these lines, but department stores will too.

, You're not going to be very cool if you have nothing to do or talk about. Join a sport, play a band instrument- guitar, bass, drums- but don't do things that you don't like to impress, do it because you want to have a passion- dancing is another one, go to a hip hop class, or teach yourself how to jerk, dougie, shuffle, cat daddy, etc. Learn how to skateboard, snowboard, surf, have a car, or be saving for one. One thing that makes girls want you more than anything else is wheels.

, To be really cool you need to exercise. Get a gym membership, or go running. It is easier with a gym, but you can do most strength building exercises at home. Eat healthier, but don't be prissy about it, or people will dislike you.

, You need a phone to meet people. Text, and learn how to make conversation and plans out of small talk. Don't use too much text-speak, it's not cool, but 'lol,' 'wtf,' and 'tbh' etc are fine.

, You need it to be cool, a certain amount will come from your looks, but not all. Charisma will make people want to do things for you... and that's cool, isn't it? Being a little bit arrogant, or cocky, works too, but have reason to be. Confidence is always key.

, Flirt with them, charm them, talking to them will come easy with time. Don't be rude, and don't swear too much in front of them. Take them places, date someone you like. Playboy or more mysterious, do whatever you like. Girls will fall for both types, but most of all, yourself.

, Joke around, do pranks and silly things, make people laugh, make yourself laugh. Do things on edge if you want to. A bad boy is always a cool boy.

, A cool music taste is the ticket to cool. Indie, rock, metalcore, techno, dubstep, hip hop, rap, and alternative are good places to start, top 40 not so much.

, Don't take pictures shirtless, you tool. Put on group photos, photos of you with your girlfriend/friends/family, photos of you skateboarding/playing guitar/reading books, be active on it.

Be happy.",How to Survive Fifth Grade (Girls)," When you're in fifth grade, your friends can change sometimes. They can have a different attitude, or just act differently, but there's no need to get stuck on that. Just move on and make new friends; that'll help a lot.

Try to socialize with more people and make more friends. In 5th grade, you'll be expected to work/do projects with people you aren't friends with. You have to be open to this if you want to make it through group projects.;
, In the fifth grade, the drama starts, people are kissing, they supposedly have boyfriends, there are bullies, etc. Don't stoop down to that level. Stay with drama free people, and don't get caught up in it. Don't ask for the latest gossip, don't encourage a fight, don't start a fight, and don't start rumors. Stay drama free.

If your friends try to get you included in the drama, say no. Your real friends would care about your opinions.

,

You will not be treated like a little kid. Your teachers and other faculty will most likely be harder on you. You are held responsible frequently, and there are no excuses allowed.
You are more likely to get in trouble. If you get in trouble many times, or even excessively, people will assume you are a troublemaker. That's all there is to it, just do your best to act well, and try to become responsible enough to handle what is coming your way.







, If you aren't, you will most likely fail or do poorly in school. Have a folder for each subject.

On the front of each folder, write the time of each class, and days you go to it.
If you'd like, you could have a binder, but it's not necessary unless it's required on the school supply list.
You should have another folder for homework, have a notebook for each subject, notes, and an accordion folder. An accordion folder helps a lot, and often keeps you organized better than a binder.
You should buy a planner too, unless your school hands out planners to the students.







, Speak up, make eye contact and be friendly. You will be the likeable person that people want to be friends with.

Always remember to smile. Smiling can make you seem more approachable to other people. Chances are, they're just as nervous to be in fifth grade as you.







, Be sure to do your best on your homework, and your time.

Write your homework down in your planner, have a homework folder to put it in, and have necessary notes and books to study or help you with homework.







, Have extra notebooks, folders, pens and pencils or whatever you think you'll need.


Decorate your locker. Have a magnetic mirror, a pencil holder, and/or pictures. If you want, place your pictures in magnetic frames.







, It's not necessary to be a goody-goody, but stay out of trouble, and don't be a class clown.

, This is your last year in elementary school. Next year, everything will get harder.

This might also be your last year with your friends. Don't let small things keep you from being your best. Anything embarrassing that might happen will be forgotten.

Hang in there.",How to Have the Best Year in Sixth Grade," You might think you are too cool to go to this while you are still in fifth grade, or having summer break, but this is your chance to learn about your school.


Some teachers will give presentations. If your teachers do go to open house, listen to the presentations. You might want to take notes, too; that sounds crazy, but it helps!;
, You might want to walk with a friend if you can.

, Visiting your teachers is a great way to see how well you will get along with them. If your teachers are kind to you, that is great! If they are not kind, however, try to deal with them in the best way you can, and get your parents to talk to them (or your principal) if your problems with them are bad enough.

, Teachers might give you some extra time on the first week or two (in some schools). However, do your best to get to class on time; be quick enough when using your locker (unless the line is too long) and try to refrain from talking to anyone on your way to class. Talking to others can slow you down.

, Carrying all your stuff around is not comfortable, and might cause you to drop things. Thus, it is better to place essentials in your locker, and these include your phone (if you have one), your notebook, and your folder (if you have one). Don't whine if you don't get a top locker. Remember they are just lockers. If you get a top locker, then don't show off and brag, because no one really cares. You can trade or share lockers, but you shouldn't. If someone steals your stuff you'll lose friendship with whoever you traded with.

, Making friends will make your year better, as you will have people to hang out with throughout the year.


Compare schedules with your friends once you get your schedules. This is a good way to see if you have any classes together. If you do, that's great! If you don't, however, don't worry - you can always see each other during ""free periods"" (if your school has free periods), lunch/recess, after school or outside of school.

, Before school starts, get a new look and transform yourself from a little child into a teenager. (You may not be a teen yet, but you've got to get prepared.)

, Some girls curl it, straighten it, or braid it. Do whatever you want, and even use headbands and clips if you like. Boys should just keep it clean and style it as wished.

, Hoodies are really a big girls trade. A common practice is that boyfriends wear their girlfriends jackets and the same way around with the girlfriends. Girls wear jeans, t-shirts, tank tops, cardigans, casual skirts, dresses, leggings, long sleeved tee-shirts etc. and can still look put together. Boys normally wear jeans and cartoon/logo shirts.

, Go against gender roles,or not, it's up to you. (wearing shoes meant for another gender, for example) Remember that you have PE, and you should put athletic shoes in your locker, at the very least.

, If you do this, you will show up and everyone will laugh at you. At first no one really dances, but then when that favorite song comes on they all go crazy and it's the perfect time for couples to get together.

, Try to be friends with as many people as you can. That way everyone will know you.

, (Or not, it's up to you. If you don't feel attracted, don't do it.) Most people start dating in middle school, so if you do, be careful not to date guys/girls you don't like. They may take you as a player (if you do this) and you will even get your heart broken a couple times. Also, you probably will cry and get mad so be ready for that experience.

, You have to get around, and the best way to do that is to socialize. So sit at a different table every time you can switch!

, You will start it (usually) in your first year in middle school so you'll have a time of acne, odors and periods (for most girls). Be prepared and wash your face everyday. Also, use deodorant, take pads to school, and wear perfume (If you want, some perfumes are expensive, and/or somewhat stinky).

, Just laugh it off! We all get embarrassed, but that's life. So don't take it as a big deal if you rip one in a class, or you trip in front of someone or you even throw up in class.

, This is what a lot of kids do when they're are bored and have nothing else to do. So watch out for the people you hang out with. And don't believe all that you hear.

, Be your own group.

, Bullies, rumors, cliques, embarrassment, odors and heartbreaks are the worst of it all, but you'll get through it and soon go on to the next year!

Before going, accept that you will need to work harder than most made for fun.,
People your age.,
Ignore any rumors you hear about the magnet program.,
Once you enter the magnet program, follow all rules.,
Make the right group of friends.,
Do all your homework.,
Volunteer in class.,
Work on projects each day you can, starting on the day that you receive them.,
Go above and beyond in anything you do.",How to Survive in an Elementary Magnet Program," Also remember your goal. If you feel sorrowful about leaving your friends, don't be, because you can always meet after school, and will most likely meet in middle/junior high school.;
, Accept that you will get more homework and be subject to more rules. While this may make you upset, understand that it is for your own good. At this point, you are only in elementary school. If you choose to apply them correctly, the skills from magnet will make you a superb student, allowing you to excel for the rest of your life.

, Unfortunately, some people do spread rumors, with several different intentions. It is important to keep your goal in your mind and never forget it. Most of what you hear from others could be false. You may hear things such as, ""You get a ton of homework there. All the teachers are mean!"" These are most likely rumors or on developing good study skills. This is essential in surviving the magnet program. Learn how to work without distractions. This includes switching off the TV, cell phone, Game Boy, etc while doing homework. If you do not understand something, clarify it as soon as possible and study the concepts at home. Start studying for a test the moment you find out about it. Don't procrastinate, leaving off your work until the last minute. While you may be compelled to blow off Friday and Saturday and save off homework to Sunday, imagine how nice it would be to finish it all on Saturday, to have Sunday free and worry free?

, Many magnet programs implement extra rules to yield obedient students. Unfortunately, many students still fail to act obediently. However, if you follow the rules, it is better for you. If the teachers request that students be quiet, it is best that you do so. If the teachers ask, ""All students report to the door"", or something such, then make sure you do so. Even if other students persist and talk, don't talk, just hold up a hand to signal silence.

, Imagine going to magnet and working extra hard, if in the end, it has no effect on you, making you no smarter? It |Laziness]] is not an answer. You can have fun, but do your best. Knowing that you did your best really helps.

, In magnet, there is often a lot of homework given, with harsh consequences for undone homework. While an occasion forgotten assignment is not the end of the world, a constant report of undone homework can have its effect on depends on how you apply yourself. This has a direct correlation to the group you hang out with. At lunch, sit with people who tend to get good grades, listen in class, and are used as examples by teachers, and who generally don't get in trouble. Most likely, they are good kids and their influence will rub off on you, making you smart in turn, giving you the ability to apply your skills. How you use your skills in magnet decides how the skills help you throughout school.

, Help people if asked to, and answer questions. Do your best. While you do not need to be perfect, do the best that you can do. [[Overcome Laziness you. You came to magnet to become smarter. By not working hard, you are ruining the effect. If you need help on homework, e-mail your teachers, call up friends, or ask your parents. Your parents must understand that you going to magnet is a commitment on their part too.

, There will be several group projects. Try to be the leader. Make sure that each group member really understands what is expected and assign work to each person. Be reasonable, but firm. Simply asking a person what they want to do does not come out as firm and people will take advantage. Say something like, ""Here is the work assigned. If anyone has problems, list them now."" Deal with them, and if you need help, the teachers are available. You do not need to be the leader, but if the leader is being irresponsible, take charge, or ask a teacher to intervene.

, If you have a social studies research project, research more than what was asked. If you must make a poster in science on electricity, conduct a small, live electrical experiment during performance. Write extra paragraphs in language arts. In your article log for current events, make a creative cover with home-made dividers. Magnet can be all about creativity. Always be neat with your work. Poor handwriting, crumpled papers, and bad punctuation are not tolerated. Make it a practice to proof-read your work and have a parent help you. If you have bad hand writing, work on making this better. Work on keeping your papers better organized.

, Try your best to do your homework and any other assignments. Who knows? You may get the teacher to like you and gives you awards for being a good student. Also, don't just rush to finish: Fast isn't best, correct is best. This will also help you to get good grades.


To make it fun, you can do the fun parts first. For example, if you're doing a report on Japan, try looking at some of the fun things the Japanese like to do. You can also take notes while doing it.

, Look after your health, fitness and well-being. Eat healthily, play a sport or do regular exercise and enroll in a fun activity club.

, When you have a lot of friends it will make school a lot more fun.

, It makes a big difference and will help you in the long run.

, If you are, all your friends will leave you.

, Do anything that makes you happy. Like wearing your favorite outfit or doing something fun after school. This will make you want to get up in the morning, but be sure not to wear anything that violates your school's dress code.

, Eat what the school serves, if you like it. If didn't like it, or want something better, bring your favorite food at lunch. Packing lunches also has the benefit of (usually) being cheaper than buying lunch at school.

, New games will make any day fun. Find a fun theme for the game. Just don't be bossy!

, Don't leave out your fun side. Let it shine and be creative. By being creative, you can make more friends!

Never give up.",How to Be a Successful High School Student," They give it to you for a reason. Don't only write homework, but make sure to write down other stuff you'll need to remember (like games, practices, study sessions, etc). In order to be a successful high school student, you need to have the ability to stay on top of all your activities. Use your agenda to stay organized and follow through with your plans. Also, use your agenda to set time limits. If you're spending more than an hour on that math assignment, you're clearly not getting it, and are only hurting yourself. Stop, put it aside, move on to other homework. Come back to it later and if you still don't get it, explain what happened to your teacher. Chances are, they'll be happy to help and not dock your grade. Just make sure you've made an attempt to do the work.;
, Make sure you have all the supplies you need. It may help to have one 3-ring binder with pockets for each class (maybe only a folder for an elective class) with loose-leaf paper and dividers if they help. If your teacher likes to lecture, have a spiral or composition notebook for notes and jot down pictures and thoughts to help you remember- the pages are less likely to rip out than loose-leaf. Keep papers in chronological order- they'll be easier to find later when studying. If your binder starts to get full, transfer old papers into another binder to keep at home. This way you won't have to lug them around, but they will be there when studying for midterms and finals.

, You don't have to be the nerd who holes himself/herself up in his/her bedroom Friday night or reads gigantic books in the corner of the room to be considered someone who takes school seriously. The truth is, school is important. You need it to have a good resume, and you need it to get into a good college and later get a good career that will support you for the rest of your life, but even though you decide not to go to college, school does help a lot. Social wise and intellectually. It's important to have fun and have lots of extra-curricular activities, but school should always be your number one priority. That being said, never take homework, tests, and quizzes lightly! Note that extra-curricular activities are also good with college resumes as well.

, Balance is the key. You can be someone who makes straight A's in all advanced classes, but if you have zero extra-curricular activities in your application for college, you will have a much more difficult time getting accepted. It's just not attractive either way. Keep on top of your schoolwork but make sure you let your hair down a little sometimes to join a few clubs consistently throughout your high school years. You won't regret it.

, You don't have to wear spirit colors everyday or be a cheerleader to do this. All you need to do is to stay on top of things- current events, who won the basketball game last Friday, attending school functions like dances and variety shows, keeping up with plans your student council has for the school, etc. Just like keeping up with current events and politics is important, so is being active at your campus. Not only will it bond you with other people, but it's always good to have a collective unity over a student body. It shows that you care about the learning environment that you're in that you support all the organizations at your school.

, It's easy to forget to stay in shape when the workload starts piling up, so joining a team at your school makes it one less worry in your schedule; it's already incorporated in your daily routine. If you're going for all three seasons, that's great, but make sure you're being reasonable. If you're taking all honors classes, for example, and you know you're going to have a heck of a lot of homework, you may want to consider taking a season off. Try your hardest at both your sport and your schoolwork and you should be more than great- you're healthy and on top of your schoolwork.

, Not being an athlete is no excuse for not having something to do after school. If you're into art, join the art club. Music, and join the orchestra or a band. Join something and be sure to stick with it for a long time; it looks good on college applications. If you're not into any of your school's clubs, ask your principal to start a new one. Most likely he/she will say yes and it's just one quick and easy process into a initiating a new activity at your school.

, As soon as sophomore year, start visiting universities. You don't need to decide anything yet, but it will help you decide if you want a large school or small (urban, rural, or suburban, if a state school is an acceptable choice, and so on). Visit your guidance counselor a lot- they're going to have to write a letter of recommendation so the better they know you, the better a letter you'll get. They'll also be able to help recommend universities and find scholarships.

, Your GPA is as important to you as your parents credit score is to them. A low credit score prevents your parent from being able to get a loan, rent an apartment, get a credit card, get a cell phone and on and on. Your parents credit score is their lifeline. It opens doors and closes doors. Your GPA is your lifeline! With a high GPA many options are available after graduation. You will have many choices regarding which colleges you can attend. A low GPA limits your options. There is a program out there for everyone but having a choice makes the walk across the stage a sweet victory!

, There's too much going on to worry about cliques, who's friends with whom, who the popular people are, etc. The best thing to do is to just be friends with everyone. Be confident and be yourself. Get into the habit of saying hi to people and not being afraid to talk to new classmates. The more comfortable you become with a more diverse group of people, the more people will like you and the more you will accustom yourself to the art of versatility later in life.

, It cannot be stressed enough that there's already too much on your plate to worry about trivial stuff like this. High school is only a competition with yourself. Everyday you should only be trying to get better, not worrying about how the girl sitting in front of you has nicer clothes, is getting better grades, has a hotter boyfriend, etc. Ten years from now, this won't matter. Focus on yourself. Focus on what you can do to make yourself better. Then, most importantly, go for it!

, This is probably the #1 curse of all high school students. It's hard and it's okay if you do it every once in a while. But when big tests, exams, and essays come, don't make it a habit. You'll only be sorry in the end, especially in college with jumbo papers and insane amounts of reading will become the norm. It's best to accustom yourself to getting things done early and out of the way rather than waiting until the very last minute.Make a plan and a list of homework. Keep it somewhere you can see it and won't forget it. Don't forget due dates!

, It sounds stupid, but you'd be surprised how many people skip breakfast or lunch. Not only is this dumb, but it's uncool and unhealthy. First of all, waffles are yummy. If you don't have time to eat breakfast at home, take some to the bus stop or buy some at your cafeteria before the first period. It's important to jumpstart your metabolism the right way so it's running smoothly throughout the whole day. Lunch is important to prevent your stomach from grumbling during your last periods. A full stomach keeps you focused. Skipping meals actually only slows down your metabolism and makes you gain more weight, not less.

, Don't fall for the vending machine trap. Most of the food in there is just unhealthy and disgusting. Go for the soy chips or anything whole grain if the vending machine is all you have the moment. Don't fall for the Vitamin Water trap either- it's loaded with sugar. Only if you're a competitive athlete and will be burning off those 400+ calories pretty soon should you pay for that jumbo pack of gummy bears or something.


At home, take an after-school snack to keep your belly full until dinner time--invest in fruits, nuts, and healthy chips. Loading on junk food during the day is not only unhealthy but will only give you a temporary ""energy"" for homework or that 10-page paper you have to write tonight.

, This is easier said than done, but sleep has so many benefits. If every high school kid got around 8-9 hours like they should, everyone would be a much happier camper. Try to get things done and out of the way so that you get your much needed shuteye. Not only will you be more alert during the day, but it helps improve your complexion and your figure, and you'll be much more likely to pay attention in your boring classes and, as a result, ace them. Of course, this is not always possible, especially in the dreaded junior year. If you're taking 3+ AP's and are in all those clubs and sports, there are chances you will be up until 1 AM doing homework - if that happens, skip clubs/sports the next day and nap! You are no good to anyone when you are severely sleep deprived. Naps are wonderful things. Also, caffeine can help you keep focused - but there are potential side effects, and addiction can hurt you in the short and long term . Try to use the stimulant in moderate amounts and only when absolutely necessary e.g. an important test.

, This doesn't mean you should then go to school the next day wearing pantyhose on your head, or whatever. You should have your own style and your own identity, so that you make your mark in high school the right way and not as a nondescript UGG-wearing replica of every other girl (or guy) out there. Be original, and don't be afraid to be yourself. It's a cliché, but it's essential. People are more likely to remember you and want to be friends with you if you are intriguing and different.

, You endured 5 agonizing days of school, and the time has come to cut yourself some slack. During the weekend, if you have friends to go with, go somewhere fun and have a blast. Even if you don't have many friends, spend the weekend relaxing and doing what you like to do. Let yourself loose and energize yourself so when Monday comes, you're all partied out and ready to focus again. But remember that school is the top priority, so don't do this if you have a ton of homework this weekend.

, Again, cliché, but important. High school is all about making a fool of yourself but picking yourself back up, trying again, and making friends along the way. Learn to laugh at yourself when you make a mistake. Don't beat yourself up over the occasional C or D (heaven forbid an F) on a test or quiz. Tell yourself to study harder and strive for an A the next time. If your team lost a game, tell yourself to push yourself a little harder at the next practice. Learning this will soon apply outside of school and into other parts of your fantastic life. Learn from your mistakes and you will go a long way. Just remember, no one is perfect.

, Learn how to study properly and listen to what the teacher says during lessons. Try to get on the teacher's good side by asking questions and looking interested.


Do not ask the teacher silly questions that don't relate to the lesson. It may get a laugh out of your classmates, but this tends to annoy teachers since it takes away valuable time that you could be learning.

, Getting in trouble may interfere with your learning if you have to miss class. You do not want bad things going on your record since it can affect you later on, and even if it doesn't get on your record, you may be labelled as a ""problem student"" by the teacher.


Things that will be on your record will be things like detentions, suspensions, and getting expelled from a school. If you simply yell something out during a lesson, it most likely won't go on your record, but it won't make the teacher like you very much.

, Your teacher will not be too happy, and your attendance record will be affected.


If you have to be late for whatever reason, make an effort to ask the teacher what you missed. For example, if you had a doctor's appointment that caused you to miss the first hour or two of class, make sure you talk to the teacher so that you know what you need to get done.

, Do your homework the day you get it and make sure you have everything you need the night before. Try to keep everything organised - having loose papers in your bag won't be beneficial when the teacher is waiting for you to hand in an assignment and you can't find it.


Keeping things organised can be by using small folders or binders in which you can keep assignments. It's also a good idea to have a pencil case so you know where your writing supplies are.

, Don't let other people push you into being someone you are not, even if they are your friend.

, If it was raining yesterday, don't jump in mud, or you'll have to go to the office and go home.


Depending on the school, if you get dirty, you may end up getting ""loaner"" clothes, which are clothes that the school lets you borrow until the next day. These clothes are usually disliked by most of the students, so try not to have a reason to need them!

, Make sure that you write your name on all of it before you start school. Every pen, pencil, crayon, etc. needs to have your name on it. This will aid in its recovery if it is ever stolen and prevents your classmates from pulling the ""Hey, that's mine!"" thing when you drop something on the floor.;
, You should shower daily and start wearing deodorant. Try to be ready for the school bus five minutes before you leave your house so that you can remember anything that you might forget.

, Whereas in the primary grades, homework was simply to read for fifteen minutes and get your parents or legal guardians to sign some notices, you will now be getting real homework. Most of that work will be independent study instead of group work, so you will probably need to start a daily routine for your homework. For example: come home, have a snack, then start your homework. If your homework is more than 30 minutes, it's is a good idea to take a break every 10 minutes.

, You will most likely get a lot of long-term projects in the 4th grade to start preparing you for fifth grade and middle school. When doing projects, always add some part of your project to your homework. That way you reduce to chance of having to pull a dreaded ""all nighter"".

, Fourth grade is really the time when you decide what clothes you wear. When you go back-to-school shopping, speak up and say to whoever you are going shopping with if you don't like whatever they picked out. You are a young adult now!


Depending on your parents, they may not allow you to wear certain types of clothing. If they do, don't protest or make a fuss - they have their reasons for it.

, You should have a lot of friends to make it through.

, People in the 5th grade change drastically. Your friends could abandon you, teasing could be awful, and people may even start to show their feelings for you!

, Try to be the 'teacher's pet' even if people make fun of you for it! It will make your life even better during class.

, Then you can kiss your mean teachers goodbye!


It's one of your last years of elementary school, so make the most of it!

, School prepares you for the future and you need to take advantage of every bit of education that you can get!


If there is a teacher you are scared of or don't feel comfortable with, don't let this teacher scare you or get the best out of you. If they dislike you for whatever reason and tries to call on you when you aren't paying attention, show them that you know the answer. Don't look like you don't know the answer, as this will make them call on you more often. Straighten up and speak the answer and show them you were paying attention.

, Even though socialization is very important, classwork is even more important. Pay attention in class and get your homework done. If you forget your assignments have a post-it or index card ready so you can write down assignments and be prepared. Even though this is not a very heavy homework year, and you will probably get the majority of it done in Study hall, don't goof off and don't forget to do any homework that you may get. Your teacher will get upset.

, Listen to what the teacher is saying and take notes, if that's what you're supposed to do. Raise your hand up if you know the question this can even raise your B to an acing A.

, In the beginning of the year, make sure you bought or have gotten all your needed school supplies. This comes in handy in the middle of the school year. Your school probably gives you agendas, or planners. Write your homework in there everyday.


Keep an agenda to organize your classes, tests, assignments, clubs, homework and extracurricular activities. This will keep you organized, help you remember assignments, and keep a fixed schedule.

, Homework sounds hard and annoying, and sometimes it is. But if you do it, you'll not only get better grades, but you can have all your time to play. Finish all your homework every day. If you don't know the answers, you can leave it blank and ask your teacher the next day.


Do not procrastinate. Once you get home, immediately start your homework and restrict yourself from any type of entertainment until then.

, Study for big tests and try your best. Keep in mind that if you read too much or look over your answers too much, you usually get the question wrong. Just proofread the test once or twice, and hand it in.

, Although work is important, grade 5 is a fun and great year. Play and talk to others. This even helps your grades by making you feel refreshed.


Relax once in a while to avoid stress. Plan out 30 minutes a day to lie down, breath easily, eat a snack, and relax so you are not overwhelmed. Catch your breath; take a break from all stressful thoughts.

, It will make studying more difficult. If you get it wrong, work hard to improve your skills until you know the correct answer!

, Be clean and brush your teeth and shower everyday. Wear pretty clothes and experiment with accessories. Style your hair in a braid or ponytail. Buns and natural hair is cool too.

, This is self explanatory.

, You are the only person in the world that is you, so if you are the only person like you in the entire world, why follow the crowd? Do your own thing don't let the popular girls/boys tell you what to do. Just try to be yourself if people try to change you they're not very good friends. If you see everyone in your class has a special hair cut or hair do don't ask for one because everyone has one. Only do something if you want to because when you have originality it creates more friends.

, Always stay in fashion. Try wearing jeans matched with a graphic tee or a tunic. However, if you don't want to dress like this, don't! Remember step 3, don't follow the crowd? Well that step still applies here! A whole stash of Hollister clothes and Osiris high-tops doesn't make you cool, right? And if your school has a uniform, wear colorful leggings under your skirts or a cute undershirt! Uniforms are not that dead!

, This is not a very big problem in grade five, although some people have tons of friends. To make lots of friends, talk to people! Be likeable and not that quiet and boring girl in the class that has no friends. Nice people are liked too. Try to befriend as many people in your grade or class as possible. Have a kind manner and treat others with respect. Be open to anyone who wants to be friends with you.

, This year you will spend a lot of time with the kids in your class, if your friend is in another class you'll probably make new friends. Make an effort to make friends. Don't be unfriendly to people and then complain that nobody likes you and that you don't have any friends. Be independent, not clingy.

, Besides the advantages of having many friends (which can make school more enjoyable), there are other benefits:


You will do a lot of partner projects and you need to be comfortable with who you are assigned to do it with no matter who it is.
While making friends is a great way to get through fifth grade, make sure your friendships are not lowering your grades. Know your priorities, and remember school before friends.

, Don't leave your friends behind because they're being mean. Give them a few more chances, but don't be a pushover either!

, Don't be all cheesy and mean like those annoying, dumb girls in your class, but know what's going on. For example, if a girl in your class kissed a boy or something, know it, if it's something big.

, This makes you look happy. In grade 5, everybody likes a bubbly, pretty, popular girl.

Understand that they admire you.,
Determine what you don't like about the younger pupil bothering you.,
Think about why they want your attention.,

Ask them if they have any ""besties"" or close friends.,
Introduce them to a variety of children the same age as them with similar interests.,
Be honest with the child.,
Kindly tell them you are growing up.,
Help them when they are in need of help.,
Organise when you will meet up with them.,
Speak to the child's parents or caregivers.",How to Stop Younger Students Bothering You in Primary School," Even though they may seem annoying, they just want to get your attention and become your friend.;
, Consider asking yourself:


Do they come to your classroom to look for you during break times?
Do they ask you to help them go to places?
Do they want you to watch them play on the playground or run around?

, Younger children tend to look out for someone who feels friendly and trustworthy. They may be needing someone to talk to and get attention from.


Are any of your interests the same as the child?
Do you have a feature similar to the child?
Have you achieved anything in the past which made you known to everyone at the school?
Do they want to be just like you?

, Ask them what their favourite things are or let them talk to you about what they want. Ensure that you remember what they say to you as it will help in the future. Avoid asking the same questions over again.

, Keep the things they like to do in mind, listen to what they have to say. Constantly avoiding them will make them more determined to get your attention. It will not help, and it can even make things worse. Think about the following:


Are they interested in a particular sport, piece of equipment or playground?
Do they prefer to get their hands dirty or do they like to stay somewhere cool like the library?

, Questioning them with ""How so?"" and ""Why is that?"" can make them confused and may upset them. Upsetting a child can get you into trouble with the teachers. Being an older pupil, you are supposed to be a role model to others. Getting into trouble will destroy your reputation and teachers may dislike you in the future. This can also affect your future life in high school as behaviour reputations are passed on.

, Before asking, ensure that you have definitely seen them interact friendly with other children their age. Don't ask them if you know they have been lonely and are unable to make friends. They may be trying to get your attention because they have no one else.

, Make sure the other children are confident saying hello and introducing themselves. Organise everyone to play a game for a while at break time so they can have fun and get to know each other.

, Do not make excuses and attempt to hide or run from the child. If you must do work, tell them kindly and reassuringly. Try to make it up to the child if you have been away from them for some time.

, Explain to them that you'll be leaving to a bigger school and you won't be able to see them anymore. Avoid the temptation to walk away if they look upset. Tell them that they have to be able to make friends easily around their age group. Be firm but gentle so they know exactly what you mean.

, If you see them hurt themselves, don't leave them there. Get a teacher to come and help them. If they get into an argument or physical fight, break it up and tell everyone in the fight to stop. Be firm and tell them that if they continue, a teacher will need to be involved to stop it.

, Gradually reduce the amount of days in a week you see them. Make sure you promise them and they promise they won't come and bother you when they are not supposed to. During the days they don't see you, tell them to find some new children to play with.

, Tell them the reasons why you don't want their child bothering you and what had been happening. Let them know that you are willing to help their child make some friends. The child would see you as a role model, and teaching them to make new friends could help them later on life.

, Remember not everyone in High School is going to like you and agree with you all the time, don't waste your time with people that bring you down!

, Make friends with people that have the same interests, ideas, and morals as you.

, Don't try to change yourself for other people stand up for who you are and what you believe in, and people will respect you.

, By doing well in school you will feel more successful and confident!

Read books about power dynamics.,
Learn how to balance intelligence and charm.,
Start networking.,
Allow your fame to spread.,
Make your bid for power.,
Build on your fame.,
Ride the wave of power.,
By being bold to speak up for the good of the group, especially in the face of unjust authority, you will have won the ""heart of the people"".

",How to Lead and Be Powerful in High School," Reading is critical as the first step. Books that can be helpful include Machiavelli's The Prince; The 48 Laws of Power, by Robert Greene; The Art of War, by Sun Tsu; and other books that are readily available on philosophy and the human psyche. These will help broaden your understanding of certain methods of control and influence, as well as raise your apparent level of education.;
, Although a bookworm might have an I.Q. of 150, if he lacks personal charisma, he will likely be ignored. Likewise, although the stereotypical jock might seem charming, if they lack the intelligence to form creative thoughts, they will seem shallow. Find a balance and middle ground in between these two traits that works for you. Get to know people, display yourself as witty and charming, with a bit of hidden intellect. It will help give you an air of mystery, enticing others to want to learn more.

, Once you have your persona in place, begin meeting people. Ensure that you leave a positive impression. Show interest in them. Get them to talk about themselves. People love talking about themselves and by listening patiently, you will earn their trust and respect. During this you may be able to find people who can help you achieve objectives later. Remember though, that these relationships must be maintained. Stop through every so often to see how they are doing.

, If your persona and networking tactics are effective, a minority of the population will recognize you and begin to talk about you with others. This is all you need right now. Be patient and continue maintaining your networks.

, Once you feel your networks are in place and the time is right, make yourself out as the candidate for a leadership role. Now, this will only be effective if the position is decided by popular vote, or at least influenced by the majority's opinion of you. If you are shooting for student body president for example, this would be the time to enter your nomination for yourself.

, Now that it is clear you are running for a position, Begin bringing the undecideds into your camp. The best way to do this is by getting your name out in the public eye. Studies have shown that in smaller elections, people are more inclined to vote for a name they recognize than someone who matches their political beliefs. Your goal is to use this statistic to your advantage. Remember, there is no such thing as bad publicity. However, keep in mind that doing juvenile or childish things can tarnish your reputation.

, By now, if you have executed things correctly, you should find yourself in the position you were going for. Your name will be known to a good majority of the student body, and your networks will look up to you even more than before. Continue to maintain those networks, make them into your strongest supporters. With their assistance and your new-found political power, you should be in a position to bring into effect the changes you originally sought power to achieve. Follow through on your goals, but do not turn your back on those who brought you into power. Continue building their trust in everything you do. Do not throw anyone under the bus.

Do not sacrifice your grades, but do not forget to have fun, both in school and out of it. It is hard, if not impossible, to get through high school happily without at least a few friends.


Never think that someone is a less valued potential friend because they're not seen as 'popular'. These people can be very kind and tend to be easier to talk to. You may discover a diamond in the rough by talking to the less popular kids.
Find people who can teach you new things. Be friends with a star athlete, a cello player, and the class president. Finding people who do different things can also help you find your niche. Also try talking to people who understand.
The more active you are, the easier it will be for you to make friends. If you join new and exciting clubs and sports, or just engage in class, you will open yourself up a wider variety of friends.
Try to avoid making friends with troublemakers, or you may be wrongly accused of things when around them.
Avoid people who want to put you down and make you feel bad about yourself. Though these people may keep hanging out with you, they are not your friends.;
, Like said earlier, diverse friends is a very positive thing, so try both boys and girls when making new friends. You might just learn more about the other gender!


You will look cool if you have a few friends of the opposite sex or other genders. People will respect you more.
Being friends with a member of the opposite sex/other genders can also help you get love or dating advice.
If you are ready, try dating. You can take it slow and enjoy getting to know another person on a more intimate level. Even if your relationships do not last long, they can help you hone your dating skills so you are a stellar boyfriend or girlfriend when the time is right.
Only have sex when you're ready. Though many high school students spend their time obsessing over sex, many of them do not have it. Only do it if you have protection and you are ready to accept the possible consequences such as becoming a teen parent or getting a STD. Don't do it because you feel like everyone else is doing it. Your sex life and school life should not intertwine.

, You do not have to be the teacher's pet, but you should still be friendly and engaged with your teachers. After all, you never know when you may later need one of them to give you a letter of recommendation! Remember that your teachers are the ones who give you the grades, so you should make them inclined to like you.


Don't be afraid to ask them for help. Asking for help is a sign of strength and maturity.
Don't contradict your teachers. Even if you think your teacher is wrong, it is just not worth it to throw a scene or embarrass your teacher in front of the class. If you feel strongly about something, you can mention it after class without looking like you are challenging your teacher's authority.
Be friendly to teachers, but don't suck up to them. Not only will it make you unpopular, but also most teachers find it awkward and annoying when a student is obviously being a brown-noser.

, If someone starts to give you a hard time, stand up to them as soon as possible. Don't just run away or put up with it, but lay down your boundaries and set limits. If you don't, then it will be a long four years because it only gets worse. Bullies love to get you going off track.


If the bullying gets physical, avoid fighting back. Though it may seem hard not to look tough, you should avoid getting hurt or thrown out of school.
If you feel truly threatened, talk to your parents, teachers, or guidance counselor immediately. There's no shame in wanting to be safe.

, Keep a set amount of time to do your homework. If you do not do your homework, you are likely to go to summer school, or even fail out of school. Doing your homework will not only get you a better grade in the class, but it will help you understand the material on your tests and exams.


Identify the important work you have to do, such as essays or projects, as well as the work that will require less time and effort. Do not procrastinate; it will get you nowhere.
Use dead time like bus rides or while you are eating breakfast to catch up on assigned reading.
If you ever happen to be sick, ask a friend to see if he can pick up your homework for you. In high school, being sick is not an excuse for not doing homework unless you are physically sick.

, Tests and quizzes will make up a large part of your grade, so remember to study as often as you can. Set out a time to study at least a week in advance when you know you have a big test coming up, so you have lots of time to understand the material. This will also help you see if you have any trouble with the material so you can ask your teachers any questions well in advance.


Be attentive during class. The more you understand the material, the easier it will be to study.
It helps to review the material from each class for at least ten minutes a day so you don't fall behind. This will help you study when the time comes.
Take detailed notes during class. Make sure you write them in your own words so you are really absorbing the material. They will be a great point of reference before your exams. However, try not to take overly detailed notes. Writing every little thing down will only make it harder to study and remember the material.
Create an outline to help organize your thoughts while you study.
Join a study group with friends in the same class if it helps you get your work done. Focus on the material; avoid straying towards something else.

, Teachers adore students who are on time and always keep them on their good sides. Making an effort to be on time shows you are enthusiastic and teachers notice this behavior. You might even consider showing up early for class.


If you get to choose seats, do not be afraid to sit up front; students in the front rows can focus better. The best place to sit is in the second row next to the side if you can, because you can pay attention to the teacher and still be sociable with friends. Teachers also tend to look into the center of the room and they recognize attentive students.
Show up especially early on exam dates so you can get ""in the zone"" before a big exam.

, To succeed in high school, you have to have the right mind frame. Even if you are not feeling motivated on a particular day, tell yourself to work hard and know that you will reap the benefits later. Do not let friends lead you off the path that leads to success. Avoid giggling with your friends or texting during class, and work on listening to everything your teacher says.


While your teacher is teaching, keep quiet, unless he or she is asking for answers. If your friends want to talk to you in class, ask them to wait until later. Do not be rude to your teachers or your grade will go down.

, Though you should always make time for fun, you should focus on keeping up your grades. Work hard on your homework, your test grades, your projects, and your participation grades, and your final grades will skyrocket. Set goals at the beginning of every marking period and try to surpass them.


Remember to maintain your own standards. Though getting straight A's may be easy for your best friend, if it's very tough for you to maintain B's, just focus on improving and doing the best you can.

, Have a plan of what you are going to study. Do not forget to insert your breaks, fun outings, and after-school plans into your planner. Do not forget to bring it to every class so you can always keep it up-to-date.


Carefully mark all of your exams in your planner. Carve out time to study for each exam.
Mark times when you will be busy with friends or social events, so you know what to expect in advance.

, You don't want to be late to class because you couldn't find your textbook! You should have a separate binder for each class, and it should be clearly marked so you know which one to bring to each of your classes.


Do not have an ""everything"" binder or folder where you keep all of your miscellaneous assignments, notes, and tests from your various classes. This will make you incredibly disorganized, and if you lose that folder or binder, you will lose ""everything.""

, Make sure to know exactly where your books, binders, and notebooks are. Keep any other items you may need in your locker, such as gym clothes, gum, sneakers, sanitary napkins, or sports schedules. Having a more organized locker can help you feel more together throughout your school day.


Remember to lock up valuable stuff like iPods and cell phones because people will steal if they see them lying around.
Create an 'emergency kit' with anything that you might need in it, such as band-aids, or aspirin.
Bring a spare set of clothes to school just in case you spill something on your clothes.

, High school, no matter what parents and teachers are telling you, comes with a greater margin of error than does college or the working world. Acknowledge that, but do not abuse it. Colleges may admit you because you have a perfect 4.0, play an instrument, sing, sport, or if you are the star of your theatre program, but do not obsess over excelling at one thing too much.


Take out time to relax or you may burn out early.
Try to plug ""fun time"" into your schedule. Though planning to have fun may sound counterintuitive, it will help you let loose.

, Though planning your path to college before your freshman year may sound a bit extreme, the earlier you start thinking about college, the more likely you will be to attend the school of your dreams. Here are some things to keep in mind as you plan your high school career:


Maintain high academic standards from the beginning. Do not slack off during your freshman year just because you think you have a long way to go. The end of high school will be there before you know it.
Involve yourself in a club, sport, or band from the beginning. Work on having a serious commitment to multiple activities as early as you can so you can reach a leadership role.
Plan to study for the SATs or ACTs. Remember that your junior year will be busy because of your studies for standardized tests, so prepare for them as early as you can.
Plan to have your college applications be ready early. Don't miss the opportunity to go to a great school because you were disorganized and couldn't get all of your applications done on time.

, Attend pep rallies, home games, school plays, dances, and talent shows. You will feel better about your life and like to spend time in school.


Having school spirit will help you gain a sense of community and to not feel so alone.
The more events you attend, the more likely you will be to make friends.
Wear your school colors on the right day. Do not be afraid of looking uncool. Nothing is more uncool than being apathetic.

, You may have to work to have some extra spending money for school supplies, clothes, or movie tickets. Juggling a job and school is tricky, but if you are able to do it you will be gaining responsibilities as well as time-management skills.


Look for a job that will look good on a resume, even if it is not so substantial. Most people know ""intern"" is code for all the work that no one else wants to do, but pay your dues anyway.
Remember that when you apply to college, you'll be able to write down your work experience. No matter where you work, having a part-time job will show maturity and commitment.

, You will meet new people, and will have fun pursuing a new interest. An art club, language club, school government, or even a peer counselling program could all help you find what your true mission in life is!


High school is your time to figure out what you want to pursue in college, and potentially for the rest of your life, so be receptive to anything that comes your way.
Club involvement will also help you look like a stronger candidate when it is time to apply to college.
Join your school's Key Club or another volunteering club. Volunteering is a great way to help your community while having fun.

, It is important to make being healthy part of your every day routine. Though you may feel that your schedule is too-jam packed to pay attention to your body, remember that if you feel healthy and are being active, you will improve your appearance and performance in school.


Join a sport. Not only will you feel more involved, but also you will be getting a great workout in the process.






Take out time for exercise. If you are not taking gym or involved in a sport, make time to exercise for 30 minutes at least a few times a week.
Get plenty of rest. Make sure to get at least 7-8 hours of sleep a night and to go to bed and wake up at the same time every day. If you are more alert during the day, you will feel more active and more excited to be involved in clubs or other activities.

, You will feel much more confident in a new environment if you learn your way around your school. If your school is big, there is a chance of getting lost, so try getting a map of your school and highlighting your main classes and the fastest routes to get to them. Figure out which bathrooms, lunch tables, and desks are the best and strive to get to them before anyone else.


During student orientation, feel free to walk around the building as much as you need until you have a good feeling of where your classes are.

, Shower every day and wear deodorant. Wear clean clothes and make an impression. Find your own style, something comfortable and efficient. You don't have to wear what all the popular kids are wearing — be original! However, don't get too crazy with clothes; you're at school to learn, not to model.


No matter what you wear, make sure your clothes are clean and free of wrinkles. Just showing that you put time into your appearance will make a big difference.
Don't wear revealing or inappropriate clothes that violate your school's dress code.

, Having a good attitude will help you keep your spirits up when life starts to fall apart around you. Stay calm and relaxed even if you feel like nothing in your life is going right. You can lose yourself and mess up in all the craziness.



Smile. Smiling will make you look more confident and can bring changes in other peoples' attitudes right and left. It will also make you resemble a friendly, happy, fun, and warm person.
You will have some new friends soon enough if you keep a good attitude.

If you want to start off your freshman year with Honors classes, you have to make As (or high Bs) in your 8th grade year; otherwise you likely won't get accepted into these competitive, impressive, and highly sought after Honors classes.


Every school is a bit different. Some schools require tests to be admitted to Honors classes, some take students based on teacher recommendation, while others will put you in whatever classes you feel like taking. To make sure you can start out high school ahead of the curve, it's best to impressive during your years in junior high, too.;
, If you want to excel in extracurriculars in high school – which is a great way to get scholarships, attract attention to colleges in general, and show you're well-rounded – you need to start now. There will be some really good athletes and performers in your high school, so keep up with them by starting early.


Experiment with a few activities while you're still young enough to drop them if you don't like them and pick another. And don't just stick to one area – if you're big into sports, branch out to dancing or a musical instrument. If you're more artistic, find something athletic to give a try. You could be great at it!

, Read the class descriptions and talk to other students who have taken the classes you're interested in. Taking a class just because a friend is taking it too won't help you and, what's more, your friend will probably just be a distraction. Instead, look for classes with students and material that is slightly above your level as the best motivator is competition.


If you're looking to be valedictorian, one of the ways to cinch that is to take loads of Honors classes (provided you can still get As). Straight As in Honors classes are even more impressive than straight As in regular classes, so take as many difficult classes as you can handle – without compromising your GPA, of course. A great GPA in normal classes is better than a poor GPA in Honors.
Keep in mind the subjects necessary to pursue your intended career. If you're considering becoming a psychologist, for example, take psychology and sociology over Metal Shop and Ceramics.
If you can, look at the textbooks for the various classes. Oftentimes the rigor of the textbook will reflect that of the class.

, Ask your teacher or office staff if you can get the textbooks during the summer – most schools have last year's textbooks in a closet somewhere just waiting to be read. Unless the books are new and they're being shipped, there's no reason you shouldn't be able to get yours to read for the summer.


Ask your teachers, older students or consult the Internet to find the best sources for supplemental readings. Use several reference books that will augment your understanding of the material. This way you'll be able to truly wrap your brain around any concept your teacher presents you.
Don't be afraid of seemingly difficult material. Think of it as a challenge and face it head on. It may be confusing now, but when your class is covering it, it will all click into place and you'll be that much further ahead.

, This is the number one tenet of getting good grades: always, always, always pay attention in class. Here's a whole bunch of reasons why:


You might miss some important information. Plenty of teachers talk about tests and quizzes in class. If you're not paying attention, you could miss the answers.
You could get bonus points. Most teachers reward students who are active and participating with extra participation points. This could be a sizable chunk of your grade.
Paying attention in class makes the homework a million times easier. You'll have much more free time breezing through your homework at night if you've already spent the time in class thinking about it.
It makes tests easier, too. If you've already spent an hour that day in class engaged, you have to study that much less.
Sometimes your grade will lie on a cliff between a regular whole letter and a plus or a minus, like a A- and an A, or a B+ and an A-. In many cases, the teacher will take into account if you're a ""good kid"" and if he or she likes you. The more you pay attention, the more likely it is your teacher will give you the benefit of the doubt.

, If you do the homework, the readings, and pay attention in class, there's almost no way you can get bad grades. Make sure you don't slack off because a certain assignment is ""just graded for completion."" There is no point in doing homework if you aren't going to do it right. The information will be useful later on for the tests or final exams.


Make homework time fun. Turn up the music and have some snacks handy. If that doesn't work, reason with yourself. Remember that teachers have to do the same amount of work you do but for all of their students. They only assign homework that is necessary for you to learn the material.

, Take all of those loose papers and notes of yours and organize them. When you're more organized, it's easy to find exactly what you're looking for, streamlining the studying process and avoiding frustration. Here are a few ideas:


Invest in a few small binders (multiple small binders are better than one large binder). Be sure to hole punch your papers instead of cramming them into pockets in your binders.
Keep your syllabus in the front pocket of your binders. You'll be referring to it often, so make it easily accessible.
File away any homework that is more than a grading period old (if you have rolling grades, you should keep all of your papers with you until the end of the year just in case).
Use topic-wise indexes for easier access when you need them. Label each paper clearly with a colored pen: CW for classwork, HW for homework, N for notes.
Clear out your backpack. Dump it on the floor, sort everything into piles, then place all necessary papers into the correct binders and throw out what you don't need.

, If you don't have a set study place, make one now. Is your study place organized and clean? Is it well-lit? Is it quiet and well-ventilated? Do you have necessary materials at your fingertips? If so, good! If not, work on it. When you have a set study place, it's easier to buckle down and get it done. And the TV won't be distracting you!


Store all textbooks, notes, etc. within reach as well as a computer (desktop/laptop) with Internet access if possible. If your house is always crowded or noisy, try the library.

, A syllabus is an outline of everything you're going to do in the class and when. Your teacher should provide this to you, and if they haven't, be sure to ask for one. That way you know which areas are concentrated on (these will likely be of focus on tests) and when the tests will be.


Knowing the syllabus – or at least having it handy to refer to often – will leave very few questions up in the air. You'll know what topics your teacher spends the most time on, you'll know all your deadlines, and you'll know the test dates months in advance. With your syllabus by your side, it's hard to go wrong.

, Make a promise to yourself, and others, that you'll get acceptable grades on tests and complete all your homework. Take action if your marks start falling before someone else has to point it out to you. Find ways to motivate yourself, and convince yourself that you want to get into college more than anything. Motivation is the key to success!


If this is really important to you, talk to your parents about helping you stay motivated. They want you to get good grades, too, so they may be open to helping out. Maybe at the end of the semester, if you have all As, they can get you that present you've wanted or extend your curfew. You never know if you don't ask!

, The night before every class, read through the material in the book that you predict or have been told will be covered that day. Use review questions at the end of the chapter to make sure you have a basic understanding of it. Write down any questions you have and ask your teacher. You'll be so far ahead of the curve during class the next day that even the most difficult questions will be easy.


When it comes to little facts like dates, names, and equations, our memories are very good at quickly forgetting, especially when these facts just get replaced with new ones. Studying a little bit every day keeps the information fresh in your memory, making it easier to remember.

, A good rule of thumb is to copy down all diagrams as completely as possible and write down anything you think you might not remember. Write them down where you can read them and put them in order by date for easy reference later.


Come up with a shorthand system so you don't have to write down every word. Use abbreviations where possible so you can keep up.
Try to go home and retype the notes, adding any extra information. Some teachers bounce back and forth between topics. You may remember something they mentioned that you didn't have time to copy down or it may be written down in a different place. Then study your notes and any extra information you've added.

, A good tutor will be able to help you understand concepts, make the class fun and set problems which are neither too easy nor too difficult for you. A tutor is not just for the ""dumb"" or mentally challenged – even the smartest kids can benefit from after-school tutoring. Sometimes there is a student tutor in your school who can offer help and advice between classes or after school.


Talk to your counselor or teacher about a possible tutor you could work with. They likely know an older student who needs a tutoring gig for their college resume or a student who's enrolled in an after-school tutoring program who is looking for someone to teach.

, Three days before a test is usually sufficient for adequate study time. If you procrastinate until the night before, you probably won't be able to get through all the necessary material and you definitely won't be able to remember the material after the test for the final exam.


If you have leftover time at the end of your study session, review some old material so you keep it fresh in your mind for the final exam. A few minutes here and there will greatly reduce the amount of time you have to spend studying at the end of the year when you really want to coast along until summer.
If you have several tests scheduled close together, think about the difficulty of the material and proportionate your time accordingly. If you spend the same amount of time studying material you already know as more challenging material, your grade in the difficult class will suffer. If you know the material already, studying more isn't going to do much good.

, Tons of research about this topic has been done and the result is all the same – cramming for a test does not improve your grades.It makes sense that any studying is better than no studying, but when you're so tired, your memory can't function, making that studying pointless.


It's sometimes necessary to stay up late to write essays or complete projects since it's better to be exhausted and get credit for the assignment than to sleep and lose the points that could make a difference between an A and a B, or a B and a C. In these cases where a deadline needs to be met, coffee and energy drinks are your best friend. But be warned: once the caffeine wears off, you will probably be even more exhausted than before.

, After you finish your homework, do some difficult problems from your supplemental resources. Do past exams or learn new techniques to help you get the most out of your class. Why? Because many teachers take extra credit and tack it onto tests scores or project scores. Oh, and you'll be smarter, too.


Doing extra work now means better grades in college, so milk it for all it's worth. The more you have a grip on things now means the less you'll be left stranded and without a clue later.

, Though it may seem counterintuitive, it is better to work hard for short amounts of time and take regular breaks than to work too long and fry your brain.You may feel like you're wasting time, but what you're really doing is making sure your brain stays in tip-top condition.


Most people can work for 50 minutes at their optimal efficiency and then need a ten minute break before being able to function at their best again. Figure out what works best for you and don't be afraid to stray from your schedule to reward yourself for a job well done on something difficult. Trust that you will be able to come back to your work later.

, The longer you have, the bigger they are. Here's a quick formula to estimate the time you should spend a project:


Say you have a 200 point essay due in a month and a half, or 45 days:
200/45 = 4.4 points a day
1 point is about 6 minutes of work. You want to do 4.4 points a day:
4.4 x 6 = 26
That's a little under half an hour a day. If you do it this way, you'll generally finish light years ahead of time, and have the all-important ""crunch time"" before the essay is due to kick back and relax because you finished early!

, In general, studying in groups is more effective than studying alone.And it's more fun! If it's convenient, meet bi-weekly. Just make sure everyone involved is clear that you are meeting to study, not chat about other things.


Study groups are more effective when they're done right. It's not time to fool around! Designate someone as the group leader and decide which topics you're going to cover that day. Have everyone bring a snack and some drinks and come with a few questions prepared to bounce off the group. However, if you have a friend that will bring you down or distract you while in the study group, tell them you need to focus, and rather than fooling around, hang out with them during your own time.

, Carry around some flashcards to run through for when you have a spare moment. On the bus? It's flashcard time. Waiting in line for lunch? Flashcard time. Waiting for mom? Flashcard time. All of that time begins to add up and gives you more free time at night for fun.


These are great to do with a friend, too. When you have 5 or 10 minutes before class, turn to the person next to you and ask them if you can quickly quiz each other. This way you can study using your eyes and ears, which is easier to remember.

, This should not be your everyday routine, but if you just have to keep that grade up and you've fallen behind on a busy work assignment because you didn't deal with your time accordingly, don't just give up. Five minutes before class can be very rewarding. Learn the art of cramming. It can help in that stressful moment on essays, homework, busy work, and many other note assignments.


However, it does not help you learn in the long-term. Cramming makes you tired, wears you out, and falls out of memory very quickly. It's necessary to study a topic many times before it sticks in your head – not just the night before a test or in the moments before class.

, Good grades are an excellent way to impress that certain college but something extra will show that you can do more while maintaining excellent grades.


If you are athletic, consider joining a sports team that you are particularly talented in. Try out every year for the team to establish a reputation within your high school.
Art, music, and drama are impressive, too. Colleges are also looking for great artists, singers, musicians, actors, and dancers as well.
Join a club. Join any club you are interested in or are good at. If you are great in Spanish, for example, then join the Spanish Club. Love chess? Join the Chess Club. You'll likely meet friends, too.

, It's great to be an all-star athlete. Colleges love that. What do colleges love more? An all-start athlete who also is 1st chair violin and is on the debate team. To be truly impressive and well-rounded, do a little bit of everything.


It really doesn't matter how good you are at it – all that matters is that you try. No college is going to write you back and say, ""Yes, but how good were you at playing Little Orphan Annie?"" or ""Sure, but how many balls even went to right field?"" All they care about is that you were a valuable member to your high school and gave it your all.

, You know what's more impressive than an all-start athlete? An all-star athlete who also is 1st chair violin and is on the debate team. You know what's more impressive than an all-star athlete who also is 1st chair violin and is on the debate team? An all-star athlete who does all that and volunteers. Nothing screams ""I love my community"" and ""I'm a great student for your college"" more than volunteering.


There are dozens of opportunities you probably don't even realize are right at your fingertips. You could volunteer at your local hospital, animal shelter, old folk's home, soup kitchen or even at your local community theatre. You could help out at a local church, women's shelter, or tutor underprivileged kids. Most of the time, all you have to do is ask.

, Even more impressive than being in extra-curriculars is starting them yourself. Does your school not have an environment club? Start one. A thespian club? Start one. Even if it's just you and four friends at 4:30 on Wednesdays doing the school's recycling, prospective colleges will be nothing but impressed.


Just be sure to ask your teachers or principal if you can have the go-ahead to be a verified club. You'll get into the yearbook and have official status. This way the club can get bigger and you can talk to colleges about it.

, Continue doing the extra-curricular activities that you love and are truly committed to, but allow yourself enough time to study. Your activities are important to becoming a well-rounded student, and often very important on college applications. But generally speaking, grades come first.


Figure out how much time you need to perform at your best and add thirty minutes to be safe. Then add on at least 8 hours for sleep and the number of hours you spend commuting to or attending school. Subtract this number from 24 and you have the amount of ""free time"" during your day.
Find a calendar for the year and write down all of the activities you would like to do and the amount of time each will take. If you have more scheduled on one day than you have free time, prioritize and cut back on your activities. Also keep in mind that you need some ""down time"" where you can do nothing but think, chill, and relax.

, Your brain needs sleep so it can refresh itself, process all that information it took in that day, and gear up for the next day. If you don't sleep, your grades will suffer, you'll be in bad moods, and your body starts shutting down. Aim for a solid 8 or 9 hours a night.Sleep not only affects performance, but it also affects general understanding. The less sleep you have, the less your brain can even grasp the simplest of things.

, Aim for your first meal to be full of protein. Breakfast provides the energy and nutrition for you to begin your day, be successful in the classroom and maintain proper development. Protein and fiber-rich foods will provide you with the most energy.


Stay away from empty breakfasts, like donuts and sugary cereals. Sure, you'll have an initial sugar rush, but that'll go away soon enough and you'll crash by 3rd period. And you'll be starving well before lunchtime!

, This may seem like a no-brainer, but many students are too afraid or don't care enough. You're not dumb if you're asking for help – you are actually being smart.


Ask for help when it comes to homework, quizzes, and tests. If your teachers, parents, and tutors know you're trying your best, they'll want to help you through whatever it is you're facing.
Ask for help when it comes to your general morale. High school is tough and it's easy to get stressed out. If your class load is hard to bear, talk to your teachers and counselor about it. They may have ideas to make it easier on you.

, You're only young once. College only gets more intense, so make sure you always leave time for a bit of fun. Set every Saturday night aside for friends, family, or just time to relax, kick back, and do whatever it is you feel like doing. If you don't, you'll burn out!


Fun is a necessary part of good grades. If you're miserable, not sleeping, and have no social life, there's no way you'll enjoy high school! Make time for fun so you can stay happy, focused, and do your best.

Keep your thoughts about your social life positive.Not having a best friend does not mean you are somehow inadequate or less than anyone else.,
Limit your social media time.Too much social media can cause you to compare yourself unfavorably to others and this may lead to you feeling worse about your own life.,
Write down a list of goals to help you focus on yourself.High school is not just about your friends and social life.,
Work hard in class to keep busy and succeed.,
Find other social outlets.",How to Survive High School Without a Best Friend1," High school is a stage in your life--and really a brief one at that--and does not last forever.


When a negative thought pops into your head, counter it with a more positive thought. For example, if you find yourself thinking, “I can’t believe that I don’t have a best friend,” counter that with “I’m glad I’ll get the opportunity to make new good friends in the future.”
Keep a positivity journal.When you’re feeling low, write down all the things you are thankful for.
Tack up positive quotes in places where you can see them. For example, you could use a dry erase marker to write an uplifting quote on your bathroom mirror so that you see it every day.;
,


Remember that many people only post on social media when they are feeling their best and the highlights of their life. The reality of even the most popular kids might be different than what they show online. Indeed, sometimes the reality is very different than what they portray in real life.
Give yourself daily time limits for looking at sites like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Tumblr. You can even download an app like Self Control to make sure that you do not linger on those sites after your time limit.Post positive things about yourself. You do not have to be surrounded by friends to post things about yourself you are proud of, things that inspire you, funny cat videos, or whatever makes you feel good.

, It’s also about becoming the person you want to be and achieving new things. Writing down your goals will make them more tangible and give you the motivation to work towards something you really want to do.


For example, if you want to learn Japanese, set goals for how much you will study it every day.
Or, if you want to learn photography, set goals about the types of pictures you want to take.
Remember that in high school you have the time to explore and figure out what you want to do.

, Even though creating friendships can be an important part of school, a lot of people never really build lifelong friendships with high school friends anyway. For many people, success in high school comes from learning and getting good grades so that you’ll be able to do what you want in life. Take elective classes that challenge you.


High school doesn’t have to be just about getting by academically. It is also about learning and growing.
If you work hard in school, you’ll have the edge when it comes to applying to college or for jobs.
Plus, your teachers will be more likely to give you a good recommendation if you visibly work hard.

, You don’t have to have a single best friend to have a fulfilling social life in high school. Sometimes having lots of different friends can be even better.


Focus on talking to all of your acquaintances, even if they are people you don’t think would ever be a best friend.
Spend time with your family. It’s easy to overlook family as a source of friendship in high school, but they are the people who will be with you throughout life. Spend time getting to know your siblings, grandparents, or parents even better.

Spend time volunteering and focus on the needs of others.This will help you find a sense of purpose and meet like-minded, passionate individuals in your community.,
Get a job to save money and meet people outside of school.If you are old enough, getting a job can be a great way to meet people outside of school, stay busy, and save some money for the future.",How to Survive High School Without a Best Friend2," You don’t have to be an all-star athlete in high school to enjoy sports.


Whether it’s dance, volleyball, hockey, football, soccer, cheerleading, basketball, or track, choose a sport that you enjoy.
Being on a team will let you meet and connect with your peers and maintain your physical fitness, which will keep your endorphins high. Endorphins are chemicals in your brain, and higher levels of endorphins equate to a higher level of happiness. They can act almost like an antidepressant.
If you can’t play for a school team, look into playing in community leagues.

,


You can take classes at school, join an after-school club, or look for local classes. Community newspapers often have a list of free or inexpensive art classes.
There are many types of creative expression to choose from. You can draw, paint, write poetry, act in a play, sing, play an instrument, or even learn to build things.

, Volunteering lets you get outside yourself and do something for someone else.


Volunteer based on your strengths. For example, if you are a great artist, volunteer at a local nonprofit arts museum. Or, if you’re good around children, volunteer somewhere like the Ronald McDonald house or the children’s hospital.

,


Create a resume and go around to local business and fill out applications. Even if they aren’t hiring, they’ll often put your resume on file.
Look to online job boards for posted openings. Qualifications will often be included in these, so you’ll know if you can apply.
Ask your parents or other adults if they have any contacts that might help you find a job.
Consider a nontraditional job with flexible hours like babysitting or taking care of a pet.

Stay open to all types of friendships.Remember that not everyone has to be your best friend, and it can sometimes be good to have casual acquaintances that you can hang out with.,
Send a casual invite to hang out with people.,
Be brave, and reach out to possible friends.Sometimes, finding new friends can feel almost like dating, and be just as scary.",How to Survive High School Without a Best Friend3,"


Notice what people talk to you. Make an effort to return their attention, even if you’re not sure you’d like to be their friend. It might surprise you who you can connect with.

, Having a reason to hang out with new people can take the pressure off of you. Try to center these invites around common goals or interests.


For example, if you have a big test coming up in your English class, ask a few people who you like in your class to come over and study with you. This gives you a reason to ask for their phone number and something to talk about.
If you want to ask people to hang out outside of school, try making it about an event. For example, if your soccer team just won a game, as some people to go out for food afterwards with you to celebrate.
Offer to carpool. Driving people to a game or event can be a good way to get on more friendly terms with acquaintances.

, Remember, the worst that can happen is that someone doesn’t want to hang out.


Send people you’d like to hang out with messages through social media. Start with something simple like getting coffee at a cool coffee shop or going to a music show together.
Before you hang out with someone new, think about things you can talk about. This will help you avoid awkward silences.
Be clear about your intentions. You don’t want the person to misunderstand your invite and think you want to go on a date.

It is OK to not have a Best Friend.",How to Survive High School Without a Best Friend4," Not everyone has a BFF. Sometimes there is a sense that everyone has a best friend, but that is not true. This message can give the sense that if you don't have a best friend, there is something wrong with you. The reality is that there may be many reasons you do not have a ""best friend"", but that is OK.


Some people have a variety of friends, none of which are extremely close, but are nonetheless supportive, fun, and meaningful.
Friendship takes time. If you have just moved to a new town, you will not suddenly be surrounded with friends. Friendship--whether BFF status or not--takes time. Again, that is not a reflection on you.

If you are not in school, you’ll miss important information, won’t be able to turn in your homework, and will fall behind. Trying to catch up can be stressful, and you probably won’t do as well as you want to when trying to do lots of work very quickly.If you miss the bus, or are late for some other reason, make sure you get to school as soon as you can. Being late is better than not showing up at all.
If you are sick, though, it is better not to go to school. Not only will it make it harder for you to concentrate and learn, but you might also pass it on to your classmates, making them sick too. This means being actually sick, not just “not feeling well.” If you are able to get up and move around at home without too much difficulty, you are probably well enough to go to school. If you are throwing up, have diarrhea, or a disease like a pinkeye or strep throat, your parents should make you stay at home.;
, This can be tough in some parts of elementary school because you have assigned seating. However, if you have the chance, try to get a seat close to the front. You’ll be closer to the teacher, more engaged in what she is talking about, and you’ll remember more information.If your class is doing some activity out of your chair, that would be a great chance to make sure you get up in the front.

, When your teacher is giving information, it is important to write it down. This will help you to remember what he is saying, and make sure you have it when you need to study.You shouldn’t write down everything your teacher says, as you’ll never be able to keep up. Instead, listen to the teacher when they tell you something is important. Write down information that gets put on the board. These pieces of information are definitely worth remembering, and knowing them will help you do well on graded assignments.

, If your teacher asks a question, try to give an answer. You won’t get in trouble for giving a wrong answer as long as you are trying to be serious. Even if you are wrong, it will give the teacher an opportunity to give you the right information. That way, when the question comes up on the test, you’ll be ready., This means following your teacher’s instructions, treating your classmates with respect, and not distracting yourself with cell phones or other books. When you misbehave, you will get in trouble and need to serve some punishment. It is much harder to learn and keep up with work if you are in a time-out, having to visit the principal, or just not paying attention.


Getting in trouble for misbehaving at school can also hurt your grades. Even if you get all the answers right on your homework and tests, your grade will still not be an A if your teacher lowers your grade because you didn’t pay attention or follow the rules.
Your parents will probably know the school’s policies for appropriate behavior, including the dress code and appropriate language for reference. If you are unsure about something, talk to them to make sure you are following the rules., To help make sure you have time to do all of your work outside of school, make sure you have time set aside every day to do homework. It needs to be long enough so that you can get all of your work done, and maybe even have your parents check it for mistakes.During your homework time, make sure you don’t have any distractions. Turn off the TV, video game, cell phone, anything that will take your attention away from your homework. This can also mean your parents, siblings, or pets, really anything that might distract you from working. If you aren’t paying attention, that makes it more likely you’ll do something wrong.
One thing that will really help is to make sure this homework time happens at the same time every day. This will help you get into a rhythm of doing your work at the same time, so you’ll always know when you should be doing homework.
Don’t forget to think about other activities when you plan your homework time. It’s okay to do other things like soccer practice, dance lessons, or even playdates. Just remember that you need to make sure you have time to do school work in addition to those things.

, Your teacher will probably give you homework, assignments you need to do after school. The goal of these assignments is to help you learn the material, so making sure it gets done before school will help you learn and get better grades.You’ll probably get lots of different assignments covering different subjects. When you get home, it is a good idea to list all of your assignments, and think about how much time you need to spend on them and the order you should do them.
Along with doing worksheets and reading books, this can mean other things, such as making time to practice an instrument if you are in the band. Just because you don’t have something to turn in doesn’t mean it isn’t important to get done.

, When your teacher tells you that you will have a test or quiz, make sure you prepare. Read your notes, any books you have been given. The goal of tests and quizzes is to see how well you understand the material, so it should just be information you already have, or have seen.You should start studying as soon as you can when you know a test is coming. Waiting until the last minute means you’ll be cramming. You won’t be able to review as much information, and you’ll remember less of it.

, When you finish your homework and are ready for bed, pack up your bag and put it somewhere you can get it quickly. That way, you’ll be ready to go in the morning, and not scrambling to get all your stuff ready. When you do that, there’s a good chance you’ll forget something important, which will hurt your grade.When your school stuff is ready to go, that also means you’ll be able to spend time getting a good breakfast. You can also spend a little more time doing fun stuff like choosing your clothes for the day.

, Breakfast is an important meal that will fuel you up each morning, making you ready for school before it starts. Make sure you get a healthy breakfast with whole grains, fiber, and protein. Talk to your parents about the best kinds of foods, and ask them to make sure those foods are in your house for breakfast.Good foods include fresh fruit, whole grain, low-sugar cereal, yogurt, or trail mix. The nice things about some of these foods are that they are also easy to eat and make. Also, they benefit if you and your parents are in a rush early in the morning (which will probably happen a lot!).
If you don’t feel hungry when you wake up, make sure to take some breakfast food with you so you can have something a little later in the morning when you are.

, You want to make sure you get plenty of sleep every night, as many as 10 to 12 hours, so you are awake and alert at school the next day. If you don’t get sleep, you’ll be tired or irritable during the day, meaning you won’t pay enough attention during school. If your parents set a bedtime for you, follow it.Getting a lot of sleep can be tough with so many electronic distractions available. It might be a good idea to shut off phones, TVs, and computers an hour before your bedtime, and make sure there aren’t any such devices in your bedroom.

, Make sure your parents know what is going on at school every day. Talk about the books you are reading, stuff you find interesting, and even stuff that’s boring. The more they know about what you are working on, the more they can help you keep your work organized, and provide extra help when you need it.Make sure your parents aren’t busy doing their own work when you try to talk to them. Family meals are a good time to talk, as is riding together in the car (maybe on the way home from school), or while walking the dog. You want to make sure they can pay attention.

, Once you have finished with your assigned work, find other stuff to read. Reading more can help you become a better reader and writer, which will help keep your grades high. You can also learn more about subjects in school that you think are interesting. You never know what kind of fun information you can learn and share with the class and your teacher.This doesn’t just mean finding things online or reading comics. Talk to your teacher about books that are good for your reading level and interests so you can find good things to read.

Use your lunch to relax.",How to Do Well in the Sixth Grade (for Girls)," When you're in the sixth grade, some people judge you really fast. Even the teachers will not want to be near you. Remember to keep your nails filed and at a reasonable height. Brush your teeth, tongue, and even the inside of your cheeks (The tongue and cheeks hold on to most bacteria). Brush your hair and wash it. You could even put on a little bit of lip gloss if you want, but don't overdo the makeup. It can make you look kooky, which isn't a good thing. Put on fresh, ironed clothes and clean shoes. Don't wear clothes that are too revealing or tight. Wear clothes that represent you and fit your personality. Wash your face and body with nice smelling soap or body wash. Don't forget to use deodorant. If your on your period, wear cotton underwear and wear tampons or pads. If your flow is a bit heavier and you're not comfortable with bigger tampons, try a tampon and a panty liner. Also, if you feel you are about to start your period, keep pads in your locker and wear a liner everyday. In the sixth grade, people will also make fun of your weight. If you're overweight, try to cut down on the fat and get some exercise. Also, try to sleep early so you don't wake up with those unattractive dark circles under your eyes and so you can get more concentration at school.;
, Add a magnetic mirror and a couple of pictures if you want. Keep your books in order of classes. (If English is first, keep your English book on top) You need to keep organized because there is absolutely no time to goof around. Also put sticky note reminders inside of your lockers and on your books so you won't forget upcoming projects, homework, or assignments.


Keep pads in the back of your locker for emergencies, and make sure boys don't see it.
Don't start pack ratting, because when you start throwing your garbage and food in your locker, it will all add up to a big mess. Before you throw your banana peel and apple core inside your locker, think of the consequences. Your locker will start stinking, attracting bugs, and molding. Everything will fall out when you open it, and everyone will think you're a hoarder and not well organized. As said before, people judge you very quickly. Every week, spray some air freshener inside your locker if it's allowed. Some people are allergic to the smells. Every month, wipe your locker with Kleenex or just plain wet tissue. It will keep your locker clean and dust free.
Make sure you have a locker with a lock that has a combination you can remember, so no one can steal your stuff.
If you have a locker with a hook, you can hang your backpack or jacket on it. If you don't, then just buy the ones you can stick on with adhesive.

, Note-Taking is very important in the sixth grade. It keeps you ahead of class and refreshes your brain every time your look at it. Try to pay attention and take notes of only the important things, so you have all the information you need and not take up a lot of space. However, if you have a test, record every single detail, and anything the teacher says twice, make sure to underline, highlight, or bold. Make a Venn Diagram to show differences and make a chart to separate things. Here's how: ]

, You need to keep it clean. Keep neat from food and garbage. Keep your supplies in your pencil case and remember not to sharpen, put cut-up paper, or put eraser bits in your desk. Now, wipe your desk like how you wipe your locker. Don't write on your desk, it's thought of as vandalism and no one will trust you with their things after you do that.

, Don't just shove your homework in there. Get a binder and keep all important papers in it. Freshen your bag and maybe add some cute key chains or some stickers to make it match your personality. Remember to always bring your pencil case, lunch bag and binder home in your bag. Treat your backpack with care and respect. Wash your backpack to keep it clean and fresh every once in a while.

, Don't try to get involved in a group of popular girls unless you're keen to do so; there is no need to force yourself to be with people you don't feel comfortable with.


Try to be friends with someone nice and you can trust.
Don't lie because one day it will catch up with you and no one likes a lying phony.
Don't show off because people will think you're trying to be the best and they'll not want to hang out with you.
Don't let anyone intimidate you or get under your skin. Tell a teacher or someone you trust if you're being bullied.
Don't try the dating thing because you have your whole life to live and you don't want someone to break your heart when you're 11 or 12.
Try not to flirt or act like someone you're not. Everyone has crushes, so don't think having one is wrong. You don't need to have an intimate relationship. Being friends is good enough, isn't it?

, Say ""hey"" casually when you see him/her anywhere other then the classroom and ""Hey, Good Morning"" when you enter the classroom. Don't say things loudly and vibrant or too cheesy, it will creep him/her out and embarrass you. Teachers are human beings, defend your teacher and try to stay away from the class clown and goofballs of the class because they might influence you or get you in trouble. Don't talk when the teacher is talking and try to ask questions if you don't understand, people won't laugh at you if you have one.

, People will feel offended if you use them. Try to stay on the topic if you have a partner job and don't go off topic. Stay friendly and nice and try your best to be the best.

, Projects and Tests are very important.


When you have a project you need to have a partner with, choose someone you know you can work well with. Don't choose the same person over and over because you want to make friends and the teacher will see you can't work with anyone else.
Review your notes when you have an upcoming test and ask your teacher after class for some extra help. Start studying one or two weeks before a test, don't cram 'till 1:30 in the morning. Instead, have a good night's rest and a healthy breakfast so you're ready to handle the test.

, Try getting up at 5 or 6 a.m. so you can have a little time to prepare. Also, timing will help you in your adult hood too, so get practicing. It's also really nice outside when you get up. Get to school about 10 to 15 minutes early. When you go from class to class, don't stop in the hallway and chat. Get to class, people find this extremely irresponsible. Some people have a high amount of jealousy, so if the mean girls bump into you, don't worry about them, ignore any insults and get to class because usually, the mean girls main goal is to get you in trouble. Remember, anytime they act nice to you, think about it.

, The last thing you need is to be mentally corrupted. Determine how much time it takes you to get ready in the morning, for most girls, it takes about 1hr and 30mins-2hrs. So If school starts at 8am, get up at 6am or 6:30am, or if at 9am, 7am or 6:30am, as it's really helpful. Also, when you get home from school, if you have extra-curriculars (dance, karate, skating etc.) you should plan when you'll do homework or when you'll finish your projects, just figure it out.

, Lunch is a time to socialize and relax. Pack a healthy lunch with an apple or banana on the side. Eat with manners, otherwise people will think you're a slob/pig. Remember, you still need to have energy to get through the rest of the day. Try not to buy lunch, people can try to steal your money. Make sure that the mean girls don't sit near you. They'll try to embarrass you, and the whole school will be there to watch. Once the bell rings, get to class.

, Important tools include pen, binoculars, a notebook, and a digital camera. Include clothing for disguises, a hat, a scarf, some sunglasses that cover much of your face. Possibly you could put a snack and some water in there.

, You can do larger missions if you have more people, about two to six kids. Make sure your spy team is composed of your closest friends, only kids who you can trust. You don't want a tell-tale! Appoint a leader (the Head Agent), and listen to her and to your team members.

It is highly recommended you do this, since you'll get your schedule and locker.;
, In order to succeed, the following skills are very useful.


Know how to open a combination lock to your locker. There should be plenty of faculty or fellow students who you can ask if you're having trouble remembering how to work the locks.
Know how to be nice. Common decency and politeness is the best way to go.
Know how to make friends. To survive middle school you need allies, and people you can trust. Find a group you fit in with quickly, and work at making friends with them. These should be people who connect with and enjoy spending time around.
Know how to be mature. You're turning from a child into a young adult, and you should learn how to act like it.

, Getting ready for middle school is a huge challenge. But in reality, It's just school. You have to convince yourself, middle school will be great.

, In middle school, people can sense when you're acting fake. Once they figure it out, they stop hanging out with you.

, It really annoys people if you take the easy route. Teachers will be disappointed. They will probably write notes to challenge yourself on your agenda or report card. This can be really embarrassing.

, If you're not healthy (as in overweight), you need to become more active. This is because the middle school will probably have locker rooms and showers. Also, you might be forced to weigh yourself in front of everyone in gym.

, People won't like it if you are never calm and you try to show off. They also don't like it when you get in their personal space.

, In sixth grade, rolling backpacks are so hard to use! It's really weird (in middle school) to walk from class to class with a rolling backpack.

, If you're messy have crumbled papers and trash all around your desk, you will be showing the teachers and students how unorganized you are. Also, if you come to school with stains, holes in your clothes, unbrushed hair, bad breath, and dirty skin, no one will want to be around you.

, It's really annoying to see an 11 year old with a revealing shirt and other inappropriate clothes.

, You can't expect people to always say, hey I wanna be your friend and all. You got to approach them and get them to be your friend. Everyone hates people who are lazy and don't do anything

, What a boring world it would be if everyone was exactly the same. Make friends with people you can respect and who seem friendly towards others.

, Dating isn't necessary. You don't need it. Dating can cause stress. Also, if you show that you're angered about your dating life, people will just make fun of you. Start dating in seventh or eighth grade. Sixth grade and lower is really uncool because you can't even do anything!

, Everyone hates a badmouth. Even if it's in a joke it won't be funny. It shows how much you can't protect yourself.

, It's a fad in most schools. It is just uncool. Most people do it because they don't have anything to do. It's just mean and everyone will think you are a prissy loser.

Make sure you do not have any bits of food in your desk, and take your lunch out at the end of the day. This will prevent any unwanted critters in your desk/locker.





;
,

Buy a backpack with several sections and generous room. Make sure it is nice quality and sturdy enough to last the whole year.






Keep all notebooks in one pocket, all textbooks in another, workbooks in their own pocket, etc.






Have a folder for each subject, plus one for homework. They are available at grocery stores, office supply stores, etc.
Buy a pencil pouch for all pens, pencils, and other writing utensils to be kept in. They can be found in grocery stores or office supply stores.







,


Make a bulletin board or magnetic dry-erase board to post notices, test dates, due dates, and other important things to remember.
Use sticky notes to remind yourself of upcoming due-dates or tests.
Make sure you have adequate lighting at the workspace, or a desk-lamp.
Use small storage bins/baskets or drawer dividers to keep supplies in, as well as plenty of folders for graded papers and signed forms.

,






When you receive a worksheet or assignment on paper, place it neatly in your homework folder or subject folder. Write the due date at the top and highlight it.
When you finish a project or homework assignment, place it in a folder neatly. Be sure you remember which folder.
Turn in all homework on time and completely. Handing in assignments late can result in losing points.






Do your homework in a quiet and calm place, like your room. Avoid spaces with distractions, like devices and other technologies.

Don't fall behind with your schoolwork.,
Study every day, even when you don't have homework.,
Give your full attention to your teachers.,
If you don't understand something, ask questions!,
Use your resources!,
Read!,
You may want to consider limiting your TV time.,
Don't be shy.,
Lastly, volunteer to help other kids who are struggling.",How to Be a Smart Fourth Grader," Do your homework first before watching TV or playing on the computer. When you start your homework early you have time to ask for help from your parents or siblings. Waiting until it's late before starting homework can cause you stress, especially if you discover that there's a lot of work to do or if there is no one awake to help you out if you get stuck. Also, keep in mind that most teachers have heard all the excuses and usually won't believe your dog ate your homework.;
, It's a good idea to get into the habit of reviewing what you learned each day and what you still are not completely sure about. Practicing spelling words or math problems on your own will help to make you a classroom expert.

, When you let things distract your attention - like passing notes or talking at the same time as the teacher - you will miss out on important information. What if you missed the teacher telling the class about a quiz tomorrow?

, Sometimes people think that asking questions makes them look silly or dumb, when actually it's NOT asking questions that really makes you dumb. If you still don't understand, make time to meet with your teacher later for some one-on-one help. Teachers are glad to take extra time for students who want to learn.

, Fourth graders usually have classroom teaching assistants, school libraries (and librarians), homeroom parents and even older elementary classroom volunteers who can all give you some help when you need it. If you have access to the internet, you can learn about almost any topic imaginable. Tutors are available for helping you learn and master a subject, or even to help you learn more about a topic that interests you.

, Reading skills will help you, not only in 4th grade, but for your entire school career and your life beyond that. Strong reading skills are important, even if you plan to be a professional athlete when you grow up. Athletes have to read and understand contracts so that they know what is required of them in order to be paid or to earn a performance bonus. Just think, improving your reading skills could help you make money, even if your job appears to only involve keeping the other team away from the ball.

, TV is a passive activity which means that your brain doesn't have to work very much. Too much TV time and your brain might become lazy. Brain ""exercises"" require you to be actively involved and that can be hard to do while watching TV. Most really smart people don't spend much time in front of the television.

, Ask questions. Look for other sources of information. Think about what you know, what you want or need to know and how and where you can find that information. You might be surprised at the things other people can help you with if you are willing to ask them for help.

, You get to share your knowledge, feel good about helping someone else, and maybe even learn something you didn't already know. That's what keeps teachers coming back every year!

Get school supplies before school starts and come to class prepared and on time. Be sure to include basic things such as notebooks, plenty of sharpened pencils, independent reading book, new pens, pencil bag or box,etc.;
, Being late can make you miss important lessons, and you can get points off your grade.

, Don't make more work for yourself by mucking about, then having to ask what the lesson was all about and have to read up on it just to catch up. Save time and effort by listening the first time around.

, If you don't have good notes you'll have nothing to study and you'll do poorly on your tests. It can also give you time later on to make study guides for your group.

, A few missed assignments can really lower your grade in that subject, so try to have all of it all on time. It keeps you on top of your work and organized and gives your teacher a good image of your responsibility.

, Lots of teachers don't give full credit for late assignments. Plus you'll have even more stuff to worry about the next night.


Do not overuse exclamation marks in your work. It reveals a lack of maturity.

, This means quick reviewing, which would be about 5 to 10 minutes in fifth grade. Just read the textbook and the worksheets and you'll be fine.

, One bad test can give you a bad grade and you don't want that.


Make sure you understand what the quizzes and tests are about. Here's some questions to ask your teacher. How many points is this test? How many questions on the test? What will this test cover? And so on.

, Being with your friends can make studying much more fun. It also makes your friends have better grades. Although you should not do that if you think you will not do a good job getting any studying done.

, Sometimes being a good student means dropping some after school activities for other things, such as studying, or getting books at the library for things such as school reports.

, It doesn't matter what the other class members say. If they don't like your outfit or your hair, you shouldn't care as long as you know it looks good on you.


Don't be a follower. Be yourself and be nice to others. Being nice will help you make friends, and maybe you can form your own group. But remember, that when it comes to the end of the day, it's the true friends that count, so don't loose sight of what really matters.

, What happened the year before shouldn't matter anymore. If there were any bullies you had to deal with avoid them as much as possible, ignore them, or if they're still harassing you, tell the teacher.

, It might be a good idea to set out the next day's clothes each evening, to save you time and stress in the morning.


If your school has a uniform, you might like to try accessorizing with bracelets or earrings, or even a headband. Just make sure you're not breaking any rules. And, you don't have to make any change if you don't want to. Not everyone cares about the ""fashion"" statement they're making during school hours.
Try changing your hairstyle now and then. Curl it or straighten it, explore different looks and choose the right one for you. Once again, this is entirely up to you. If you're happy with short hair or a daily ponytail, then rock it. You're saving time for more exciting things, like reading, learning and sports.

, Befriend people, stand up for your friends and refuse to spread gossip. This is a good year to begin healthy relating habits and to aim to rise above the rumors, mean-spirited actions and clique selfishness.

Finally, enjoy yourself and don't worry about rules and regulations because they aren't as bad they sound, instead it is only for your own welfare.",How to Act in an Indian Elementary School," Most elementary schools in India wear uniforms and it is compulsory to wear them. Huge earrings, sparkly necklaces, bracelets and anklets are prohibited. You might find it a little strange that Indian Elementary Schools are so strict in dress codes, but in India it is quite common. It may take time to adapt. Sometimes, during special occasions and festivals, you are free to wear colored clothing but again, some (not all) schools don't allow revealing clothes.;
, This is a strictly enforced rule: no makeup allowed. This means you are not supposed to wear lipstick, blush powders (normal powders are allowed) and eye shadows etc. Kajal is allowed in most schools, but some schools don't even allow them. However, don't feel shy to wear these during special occasions.

, Most students are very friendly and they will help you to get adjusted. In return, help them and be understanding. Don't be mean to them. In Elementary schools, there aren't anything called 'Cool Kids' or the 'It fashion'. Some kids gossip, but it is usually about some other student and not about popular culture.

, This is very important. Students in all Indian elementary schools greet their teachers like ' Good morning Ma'am ' or ' Thank you Sir '. They don't greet teachers like ' Hey Miss. Ria' or like 'Bye, Mr.John'. You are not allowed to practice commenting teachers, but you can politely express your opinion of them.

, on time, every time.

, Most teachers are very nice and understanding, so they don't yell at you unless and until you make them to do that! Whatever it is, remember this: No matter how disrespectful you are, unruly you are, disobedient you are, teachers are not allowed to practise corporal punishment. Some teeny weeny slaps are OK, but when it becomes too much, report that again to the school's office. However, this does not mean you push the limits of the teacher.

, In Indian Elementary Schools, you needn't move from class to class for every period, instead teachers will come to your own class. You are strictly not allowed to go outside the class without the teacher's permission. You can also find that it is nearly impossible for Elementary and Middle school students to bunk classes here.

,, Be confident, because, one fine day, you might be saying all this to a student new to an Indian Elementary school!

If you're in elementary school and never have passing period, you'll need to do a bit more planning, since you'll probably need a parent to come get you and won't be able to just skip. Go on to the next step for other tips.;
, Tried and true, but probably the most reliable way of getting out of class is with an illness. A good actor can pull off a convincing sickness that no teacher or administrator will try to question. It's usually in their best interest to just go with it and let you leave, as long as you do it right.


When you walk into class, really start laying it on thick. Have a deeply frowning face, and move slowly, your head down as if you had a headache. Hold your head in your hands and wait a few minutes to approach the teacher.
Ask to go to the nurse. You can either actually go to the nurse and just nap for the rest of the hour, try to get sent home, or just skip going to the nurse and wander until class is over.
It's important to be a good actor. If you come into class grinning and joking with your buddies, the teacher won't believe you if thirty seconds later you're suffering from the black plague.

, While this might be more common or effective in something like gym class, if you can fake a sprain or another type of non-serious injury, you could potentially even get a friend out of class to help walk you down to the nurse's station. It's a pretty decent way to get out of class, again, if you're a good actor.


Usually the best way of doing this is to not try to fake an injury by falling or doing something else ridiculous in class, but come in selling the injury already. Walk with a limp, or hold your head in your hands to fake a head injury.
Tell the teacher you hurt yourself at recess, or during gym class, or that you fell outside in the hallway and you want to go see the nurse. Again, you can usually get out of class for long enough at the nurse's station by ""resting"" or you could just wander and go to class later.

, Another way to get in trouble that has quite a bit of potential for getting in trouble, but requires little planning on your part is to go to the bathroom, then disappear, or leave school completely.


This can only work if you're not a consistent trouble-maker, and if you've been behaving relatively well during the rest of class. If you've been getting in trouble all day, or giving the teacher a hard time, then want to go to the bathroom, you're likely to get shut-down.
Pull the ""emergency"" card and make a concerned look with your face. No teacher wants to have a mess on their hands in class, and they'll be likely to just let you go.
Get a friend in class to collect your things for you, so you won't have to return to the scene of the crime later.

, If you elect to wander the halls for the rest of the class period, it's important to avoid getting caught, or asked for a hall pass by someone who expects you to be in class. Whatever you choose to do with your freedom, you've got to lay low and stay out of sight.


Hide in the bathroom. Maybe the easiest way to lay low is to hide out in the bathroom. It may also be smelliest way of hanging out, so you might as well get back to class, but it's also usually safe. If you can, try to finish the assignment you're skipping out on while you hide.
Wander the quietest wings of the school. Avoid the gym area, the band and choir wings, and other high traffic areas. Maybe go somewhere the teachers don't know you at all, like another grade's floor.
If you're older and have transportation, you could always just leave and go do something more fun with your time.

, If you skip class completely, you'll be marked absent, for sure. But if you leave class and never come back, it's half-likely that your teacher, who is busy and probably overworked, will forget to go back and mark you absent after the fact. It's easy for stuff like that to slip the mind, and you might be able to get away with it, even if your teacher does notice, so it's good to wait a few minutes before you try to escape.

, If you miss one or more classes in a day, most schools will make calls home, usually at the end of the day. The best way around this is to be a hawk by the telephone when you get home, or to come clean to your parents ahead of time and come up with a good excuse to get away with it.


""Mr. Jones messed up attendance today, he told us to tell you that everyone would be getting those automated calls, but that I was in class.""
At some schools, they may actually email or contact your parent in other ways, so try to find out the procedure before you do this.

"
"
Schedule an appointment for that class.,
Get a pass from another teacher.,
Ask to go to the library.,
Ask to see the guidance counsellor.,
Have your parent call you in.",How to Get out of Class2," The best ways of getting out of class are always the most legitimate ways. Next time you have to go to the doctor, the dentist, or make some other kind of appointment, make sure you schedule it for the day and the time of the class you hate the most, so you'll be able to miss. You won't have to sneak around if it's for real.


If your parent usually schedules appointments for you, go ahead and do it yourself before they give you the chance to go back out to the waiting room. Then make like everything's already taken care of.

, In middle and high school, some teachers will write up passes for students to work on group projects in their classroom, especially during study hall, or other break periods, if the project is especially important. In some cases, you might be able to convince one teacher that your break period is actually during another time than it actually is, and get them to write a pass for you to leave the class you don't like. Then just leave.


This can be dangerous, if you have teachers who talk a lot. Try to get teachers from different departments, like a shop teacher and a math teacher, who may not be likely to communicate with one another.

, Depending on the class you're trying to get out of, you may have a more legitimate reason to leave than you originally thought. If you're annoying about being in a particular class, tell your teacher that you do better work in the library, and ask if you can go study there instead some day. Teachers are likely to be surprised by this, and you might win a free hour in the library, without having to beat around the bush about it.

, If you're upset about something, or if you feel like you need to be missing class for a more serious reason, ask to go talk to the guidance counsellor. It doesn't have to be anything big: maybe you're just feeling stressed about school and about your ability to handle the pressure. That's what guidance counsellors are there for.


Tell your teacher that you're really upset, but be vague. Talk quietly and seriously, right before class, and ask if they'll allow you to go talk to the guidance counsellor instead of coming to class today.
If you have to come up with an excuse, try to think of something they'll be unable to verify. No dead grandmothers. Try something like, ""I think I might be having a panic attack,"" instead.

, Maybe you've got strict parents, but you never know until you ask. If you've got a real bummer of a class period coming up, ask one of your more lenient parents if they'll call you out for a class period sometime. You might get lucky once or twice.


Sometime, try doing a little research by asking one or both of your parents if they ever cut class when they were younger. Dig up some good stories, then use this for leverage later.
If you find out your dad used to cut all the time because his math teacher was totally boring, start playing up how dull your math teacher is, and how you wish you could just come home and spend time cleaning up instead of going to class. Boom. Easy call-out.

Call yourself a pass out.,
Use a phony pass or slip.,
Fake a seizure.,
Never break serious rules or laws to get out of class.",How to Get out of Class3," The morning before you go to school, put on a good fake voice, call the office, and call yourself a pass to leave school that day for an appointment of some kind. Pose as your mother or father, and use the specific date and time that you need to be absent from school. In the morning, pick up the hall pass and leave at the time. Scot-free.


Better yet, get someone else to make the call for you. Older siblings, cousins, or friends are all good bets.
Make sure the office workers don't know your parents very well, or they're likely to recognize your voice and figure out that it's not them.

, The next time you get a hall pass for real, take it home and make a Photocopy. Use white out to change the info date, and then re-photocopy the blank one to have a cache of fakes that you can use, and give to other kids.


Be sure to use the same color and style of pen or pencil in the original color that the note was written.
If you have a friend who does not know your teacher then have them use the ""bathroom"" and deliver it from the ""office"" at some point to make it extra convincing.

, If you've got to get into serious anti-class warfare, then you can still keep a few serious tricks up your sleeve. Faking a seizure should only be used in the case of serious moments, like if you've totally forgotten to study for a test, or have forgotten a project that's worth a life-time of points, or something. To fake a seizure, try the following, at your own risk:


Subtly complain about feeling ""faint"" or ""weird"" just before class. Breathe heavily and go to the bathroom before class starts to wet your head slightly, giving yourself a very sweaty look.
Wait for awhile then give a spaced out look if you're going to pass out. Go gradually limp if you are going to pass out then fall down to the floor, as realistically as possible.
If you are doing a seizure, fall to the ground and start convulsing and doing random uncontrolled movements. Drool on yourself.
Most seizures won't last long, just a minute or two, but it's still important to not over-sell it so you'll start laughing or otherwise give yourself away.
When you're done, grunt and make your eyes go wide as if you're in pain. When everyone looks at you, all freaked out, say, ""What happened?"" You may end up headed to the doctor, but they'll likely call your parents first and you might be able to end up head home.

, It's commonly thought that pulling fire alarms or making anonymous threats to the office are good ways to get out of school. These methods are not only dangerous at school, likely resulting in expulsion or suspension, they're typically illegal. You might be facing fines, or serious penalties for your actions. Never, under any circumstances, should you take more drastic measures.Talk to a counselor if you're really struggling at school and feel like you need to be absent for a serious reason. Talk about it and get help.

Tell a few friends that your neck is feeling very stiff.,
Rub your temples.,
Tone it down.,
Tell your teacher your head hurts, and ask to go to the nurse.,
Explain your symptoms to the nurse.",How to Leave School Early1," This is a common sign that a headache is coming on. Particularly if you don’t want your friends to know that you’re faking sick in order to leave early, you’ll want to start early to make it believable., Let your teachers and friends see that your head is starting to bother you. You might want to include an accompanying squint. Sensitivity to light is a very common symptom of an oncoming migraine or headache., Even if you feel excited about something, keep your voice and actions subdued. You don’t want to make it clear that you’re faking a headache by acting like you feel fine., Be sure to look pathetic while you tell them this. If you don’t look pitiful enough, they may be inclined to tell you to stay. Continue rubbing your temples, and speak quietly and respectfully. You could say “I have this weird pain on only one side of my head, and I feel dizzy when I see bright light” or “My head hurts all over, and I have this weird ringing in my ears.”

, Tell her that you have a headache that has been getting worse throughout the day. You can tell her that it involves sensitivity to light and sound. You can tell her that you feel nauseous as well, as this is often a side effect of a migraine."

Tell your friends you aren’t feeling well.,
Ask your teacher to go to the restroom.,
Come back to class, and tell your teacher that you still don’t feel well.,
Tell the nurse your stomach hurts.,
Throw in a few other symptoms as well.",How to Leave School Early2," Suggest the possible cause of your illness casually. You could say, “I think I’ve got this stomach bug that’s going around” or “I don’t think my breakfast agreed with me today.” , Make it clear that it’s urgent, but be very respectful. It’s a good idea to go in the middle of class instead of during a bell change. That way there will be fewer people in the bathroom, and there won’t be any need to fake throwing up for.

, Tell them you think it would be a good idea to go to the nurse. Make it clear that it’s in their best interest to send you to the nurse, because you might throw up in class if you don’t go.There’s no need to be especially graphic. Don’t say, “I’m going to hurl all over my books if I don’t leave now.” Say, “I was sick in the bathroom just now, and I’m afraid that I’ll be sick again soon.”

, Be sure to tell her that you’ve already been sick in the bathroom once. Try to look as pathetic as possible. You may want to to suggest to her that you have a stomach virus or mention some food that didn’t agree with you. Be sure to stick to a consistent story. If you told your friends you think you have a virus, don’t change to food poison when you see the nurse.

, If you have a stomach virus, odds are you also have some other aches and pains. Be careful not to describe any symptoms that the nurse could easily disprove. You might say you have pain in your muscles and joints.
You could claim that you’ve been very tired and lethargic all day.
You might also say you have a headache.

Write a note.,
Turn in the note as early as possible.,
Keep your story straight.,
Leave.",How to Leave School Early3," If you are under 18, this method will require that you fake a note from your parents or guardians saying you have to go to the doctor. If you’re not comfortable forging a note and a signature, consider a different method. Be sure that the note

includes the date
begins with the phrase “Please excuse ___(your name)___...”
says exactly when you need to leave
explains specifically where you are going (to the orthodontist, the optometrist, etc.)
says you’re not coming back that day
has your parent or guardian’s signature at the bottom
is free of spelling and grammatical errors (so that it’s clear an adult wrote it)
is a tiny bit crumpled as if it’s been in your backpack


Note that this method doesn’t really work unless you can drive yourself home. If you have to have someone come pick you up, the jig will be up!
Depending on your school, the consequences for turning in a forged note may be pretty severe. Some schools will give you detention, suspend you, or in extreme cases, even expel you. Think hard about whether it’s worth the risk! Depending on why you need to leave school early, it’s possible that your parents or guardians might write the note for you, so consider asking them before you go to the trouble of faking the note.

, It will seem more believable if you hand in the note right away. Follow your school’s policies for doing so. You may need to give the note to your homeroom teacher or turn it in in the principal's office.

, If your note said that you were leaving early to go to the orthodontist, be careful not to slip up and say you have an eye appointment this afternoon! Stick with minimal details, and you are less likely to get caught., When it reaches the time your note said you had to leave, raise your hand and remind your teacher that you have to go. Pack your bags and leave without causing a ruckus. The more you can fly under the radar, the better! Act as casual as possible. People will suspect that you’re lying if you make a big fuss out of leaving.

Decide who you’re going to ask for help.,
Think through the reason you need to leave early.,
Ask the person for help.",How to Leave School Early4," A parent or guardian is a good option if they’re not too strict about missing school or if they are already sympathetic to your problem. Otherwise, you may need to enlist the help of an older sibling or friend. , Be sure that you have a very convincing case that anyone would feel sympathetic towards. Think carefully about who you have chosen to help you, and be sure that you can convince them that your problem is severe enough that you need to leave school. , Explain why you need to leave early. Once they agree that it’s a good idea for you to skip school, tell them how you need them to help. If it’s a parent or guardian, all they’ll need to do is write a note and be prepared to answer the phone if anyone calls. If it’s an older sibling or friend, they may have to be prepared to lie for you. Anyone helping you with the plan can also make your story more believable by arriving at school to pick you up at the scheduled time.
If possible, tell them what they have to gain by helping you. If it’s your older sister, and you’re skipping school to help her pick out a wedding dress, remind her how excited she’ll be to have you there. If it’s your dad, and you’re skipping school because of a bad breakup, remind him that he never liked your girlfriend anyway, and tell him how much happier and healthier you’ll feel after a “personal day.”

State your case assertively.,
Stop them in their tracks.,
Be prepared to expand the lie.,
Accept the consequences gracefully.",How to Leave School Early5," If you’re wishy-washy or don’t make a clear case for why you don’t feel well, your teacher, the nurse, or a school administrator might not believe you. Particularly if you’re faking sick, the key is to tell them exactly what you need -- to go home as soon as possible. Don’t confuse assertiveness with aggression. Be clear about what you need, but don’t be hostile or angry.
When talking to your teacher, you might want to say something like, “I’m feeling really bad and think I may need to leave. Can I please go to the nurse to talk to her about that?”
When you see the nurse, remember to make your case with specific symptoms. For example, “I’m feeling nauseous and have vomited once already. I’ve also had a headache and chills all day. Could I please go home?”

, If there’s an obvious reason why you might want to skip school that day, and your teacher, the nurse, or an administrator knows that, you’ll want to get ahead of the game by mentioning that yourself. If you’re talking to your teacher, try saying something like, “I feel awful about missing my group presentation this afternoon. As soon as I’m feeling better and back in school, could we please talk about the best way to make that up?”
If you’re trying to convince the nurse to let you go home, try saying, “I know what my teacher’s make up test policy is, so I’m planning to come in and take it during study hall on Friday, assuming I’m feeling better by then.”

, Particularly if you’ve turned in a fake note, there’s a chance that an administrator will want to call home to verify that you really do need to leave early. If your parent or guardian really did write the note, just be sure they’re prepared to keep the lie going for you when they answer the phone. If you faked the note yourself, some possible solutions include


Give a number you know no one will answer. If your parents are at work, you could give them your home number. Be prepared to delete the message before they can hear it.
Have an accomplice ready to answer the phone at whatever number you give them. An older sibling or friend who isn’t in school are good options.

, If you get caught, the best thing you can do is stop lying immediately and accept the blame. Adults are more likely to be lenient on you if you fess up right away, and admit that you were wrong. Explain politely why you did what you did, and say that you know it was wrong. "

Turn in ALL of your homework.,
Manage your time well.,
When in class, don't be a talker, but don't just ignore people that talk to you.,
When in gym, do the activities and talk if allowed.,
When on your way back and forth to classes, get what you need and go.",How to Be a Good Kid in Sixth Grade," If you are a slacker, you will probably have detention, and get in trouble with teachers. You won't be able to go to the slumber party your friends have been talking about for weeks if your work isn't finished. This will also affect your classes in High school and your future.;
, If your rushing or going to slow, you will feel overwhelmed by the time Friday comes. If you have to do a science project that requires an experiment, make a list of supplies you will need, such as poster board and markers.

, Just say, ""Sorry, I can't talk now."" and be done with it. Then if they don't stop, then you just ignore them. If that doesn't work tell the teacher that they are distracting.

, Don't talk too much, of course, but don't be that quiet kid. Be friendly, but not too friendly, that looks creepy.

, If you are caught talking in the hall instead of going to class, you could get into big trouble, depending on how many warnings you've had.

Enlist the help of an adult.,
Hide in safe place.,
Act normal.,
Catch up on your schoolwork.,
Be respectful.,
Accept the consequences.",How to Skip a Class in Middle School," Make sure the benefits will outweigh the consequences of skipping class. Know the rules at your middle school. Each school has a different absentee policy, but you will want to know what is going to happen if you skip a class before you decide to leave. Beyond the penalty dealt by your middle school, there are effects on your likelihood of success as a student if you are a habitual skipper.It’s possible you will get detention and have to spend more time at school.
Will you be allowed to take a test later if you skip a class to miss a test?
What are the consequences of turning homework in late?
What will happen if your parents find out? Will this just lead to longer stints of boredom and less opportunity to hang out with friends because you’re grounded?
Students who skip more than 10 days of school in a year are 20% less likely to get a high school diploma and 25% less likely to go to college. Those who do skip often feel like they are behind in their learning.;
, Understand the truancy laws. Public schools require attendance. If you are absent and do not have a reason which falls under excused absences, you will be marked as truant. This applies even if you get a note from your parents excusing you if the excuse does not qualify to avoid truancy.Excused absences are usually related to illnesses, a death in the family, or religious observances.
Some excuses that could work are telling them you got a migraine headache and needed some quiet, you suddenly feel nauseated, you needed to call your parents.
Extended absences for health reasons will often require a doctor's note.

, Rather than just wandering in the halls and getting caught, think of different ways you can get out of class without getting into trouble. Make sure you know what you want to do and how you want to do it before the class period you want to skip. Come up with a list of options which may work, then choose the one you think is best.Consider going to class and asking to be released by the teacher to see the counselor, go to the bathroom, spend some time in the library, or call home.
Check with the counselor and set an appointment for later in the day during the class you would like to skip.
If you don’t think the teacher will let you out of class, choose a place you can hide between classes, maybe even go by these places between other class periods to see if they look like good hiding places.

, There are several ways to get out of class without getting in trouble. Get help from an adult who can vouch for you, like your parents or school administrators.If you just need a break, call your parents and ask them to send you an early dismissal.
If you are not feeling well, go visit the nurse’s office and see if you can get sent home. At the very least, you will have gotten a break from class for a little while.
Visit the counseling office. Speak to your counselor about what is bothering you, or why you need a break, and ask if they will excuse you from your class.

, There are several rooms available at school which may be empty or acceptable for you to spend some time in. Try the bathroom, library or cafeteria. You may be able to use an empty classroom if it is the teacher's off-period or lunch break, but be aware, they may return and you could get caught.


Get a pass to go to the bathroom and just hang out there until you feel ready to return to class. This will likely only work once or twice per class since the teacher will notice if you continue to stay away for long periods of time.
Get a pass to the library or just go there between classes and stay after the bell rings. You will have plenty of reading material to keep you entertained during your break.
Sneak into an empty classroom and hide in a corner where you can't be seen from the hall.
You can hide in the cafeteria by going during a lunch break other than your own, or hiding out in the corner when it is empty. Note that there may still be cafeteria personnel working even when no one is eating lunch.

, If you are going to skip class, don’t make a big show of it. People who are nervous tend to react with either fight or flight mode. If you feel like you are about to get caught, avoid running or being combative with someone who approaches you.If you are feeling nervous, take several deep breaths to calm yourself down.
Don’t act super sneaky or brag about it, just do what you need to do to take a break. This will make it less likely for you to get caught in the process and easier to explain yourself afterward.

, If you skipped a class because you didn’t study for a test, or you hadn’t finished your homework, be sure to make up for that on your time off. This will make skipping that class worthwhile if it improves your grades.Not catching up will put you further behind and tempt you to skip more classes.

, If your parents or a school administrator approach you about your missed classes, be respectful. Explain calmly why you were not in class that day and accept the consequences without arguing.If they do not give you the opportunity, politely ask them to let you explain what happened.
While you may choose to disobey the rules, it doesn’t mean you need to have a negative attitude toward the person whose job it is to enforce the rules.Tell the truth.
Listen when they are talking. Nod and respond with an occasional, ""yes"" or ""I understand.""If you do get upset during the conversation, try to end it as quickly as possible by accepting what the other person is saying. Write down your thoughts and ask to speak to them again once you feel like you are calmer and in more control.

, If you weighed your consequences in advance, you should be prepared to accept them. There is no going back now, so the best choice is to accept the consequences and move on. You will gain more respect from the people involved in punishing you and be better able to assess your future choices when you take responsibility for what you have done.Take responsibility for your actions and avoid blaming others for what you have done.If the consequences don’t seem worth it, find ways to engage with your classes when you feel bored. Consider how the things you are learning will help you in the future, and connect it to your life outside of school.

Select an illness to fake carefully.,
Fake a headache.,
Fake the flu.,
Fake a fever.",How to Avoid Going to School1," When you want to avoid school, faking an illness is an effective way to stay out of the classroom. The success of your scheme depends largely on the illness you decide to fake. Choose an illness that has to “run its course” and has relatively easy symptoms to feign, like the flu or a headache. Don’t fake an illness that will require a doctor’s visit, like strep throat or mono—the doctor could blow your cover!, A headache is an exceptionally easy and safe illness to fake because the symptoms are not visible. Choose a specific part of your head that hurts, such as your forehead or at the base of your skull. Pretend that you are sensitive to sounds and light. Lay on a couch or in your bed—avoid excessive activity.Place a cool washcloth over your eyes.
Rub your temples to alleviate the pain.

, Pretending to have the flu requires commitment and skill. To successfully fake the flu, you must pretend to have a variety of symptoms.


Pretend to have the chills. Bundle up in blankets and sweaters; take hot baths or constantly drink warm beverages.
Complain to your parents of aches and weakness. In order to sell these symptoms, avoid excess activity.
Fake a variety of common cold symptoms, such as a sore throat, dry cough, and runny nose.

Blow your nose constantly., Pretending to have a fever requires careful planning and constant vigilance. To fake proof of a high temperature, you will need to expose a thermometer to something warm. Instead of relying on an obscure method, like holding it over a light bulb, simply place it against a warm beverage. As the thermometer rises, monitor it to ensure it does read over 103℉.Tell your parents that you felt feverish throughout the night and often woke up in a cold sweat.

Be prepared with an excuse when you return to class.",How to Skip a Class in High School," Decide a few days ahead which class and which period you're going to skip. For example, you might decide that you're going to skip French next Wednesday, 3rd Period. When choosing the class you're going to skip, take a few things into consideration. Think about your teacher and whether or not they take roll. It is best to know which teachers do and don't take roll in their classes. It is easier to skip classes where the teacher does not take roll because you are far less likely to get caught. If they do, you could try to sneak out of class after being counted present for attendance.


Also consider what your teacher is like. It is easier to skip classes that are taught by more relaxed teachers. Never skip a class taught by a teacher who is likely to look for you or ask after you.;
, It is important to think about where your class is located before you decide to skip it. If your class is located near an exit that is not locked, this is an ideal class to skip. However, if you have to walk past the principal's office to get to an exit from a certain class, you should probably reconsider your plan to skip.

, It is best not to skip the same subject too many times. Choosing to skip a class that you have not skipped before gives you a better chance of not getting caught.

, Skipping class is not always the best option. If you get caught, there can be serious consequences - both at school and at home. If you miss class, you'll have extra work to make up. Think about why you want to skip and decide if there is a better way to accomplish what you want to do. For example, if you want to skip class because you forgot to do your homework that is due today, maybe you could talk to your teacher instead and convince them to give you an extension. That way, there is less risk involved for you.

, Don't just skip class and aimlessly wander around somewhere you might get caught because you haven't thought about where to go. Think about it ahead of time and know where you are going to go while skipping class.

, Go to a secluded area of your school where you are not likely to be found. This could be under a weeping willow tree, in the janitor's closet, under the stairs, etc.

, If you are skipping class by yourself, this is a great option because it is unlikely that anyone will find you in the bathroom, so you are the least likely to get caught.

, If you can, hide out at a park, store, or mall near your school where you know nobody else from your school will be. It is very important to make sure that you go to a place you won't be seen by people who will know you are skipping class.For example, if your mom's best friend owns a store in the mall, avoid that store at all costs. The last thing you need is for the store owner to tell your mom she saw you at noon on a Tuesday.

, Tell your teacher you need to use the restroom so that you can leave class a few minutes before the bell rings.This will give you time to go to your secluded area on campus to skip or to leave the school grounds before everyone is in the halls between classes. That way, there will be fewer people to see you skipping and it is less likely that you will get caught.


To excuse yourself from class a few minutes before the bell, tell the teacher that you have a music lesson/sports practice, that you need to go and take medication, or that you desperately need to use the bathroom.

, The best thing about saying that you need to go to the counselor is that nobody will ask you why because that is private information and they'll just let you go.

, Tell one of your closest friends that is in the class you're skipping that you're not going to be in class because of some believable reason. Then if the teacher asks, your friend can chime in and let the teacher know why you're absent and the teacher won't become suspicious or keep thinking about it. Have your friend say that you are home sick or that you are at a doctor's appointment with your mom. Remember that you can get in big trouble if you get caught, so you need to have a plan. Or maybe reconsider skipping in the first place or be awesome and keep to your plan!!

, If you drive to school, try to remember to park off campus on the day that you are planning to skip. Most schools have closed parking lots, meaning that you can't take your car out of the school parking lot without a note until school is over.


Note: If you think it's possible that your parents might drive by the school parking lot during the day to make sure your car is there, it might be a better idea to park at school and just walk somewhere when you skip class. That way, your car will still be at school when your parents check up on you.

, This one is easy to find an excuse for. Just say ""I'm trying to use the bathroom here,"" or ""I'm on my period"" (for girls).

, This one is very tricky to get out of. Your best bet is to fake a fall or sit on the ground and look as sick as you can. If you're good at fake crying, this is also a good idea in this situation.

, This is almost impossible to excuse yourself from. You could say your mom just took you to the dentist/doctor/counselor. Or you could just make a break for it and hope no one recognized you.

, Give the person who caught you one of these excuses:


You were just running an errand for a teacher.
You were on your way to the bathroom.
You left your schoolbag in your locker.
You're on your way to/back from the nurse.
You're new to the school and can't figure out the way to your class.

If you get caught wandering around, pretend to go back to class and go to the nearest bathroom for the rest of the period.



, When you have successfully skipped that class, return to school and attend your next class as normal. Have in mind a few of the excuses mentioned above in case your teacher found out you weren't at your previous class. You could also forge a note from a teacher/parent to make sure all of your bases are covered in case anyone asks you about it.

Call yourself out for the entire day or a certain period.,
Make or fake an appointment.,
Be as general as possible.",How to Skip Class1," If you only want to skip a few periods, say that you have a dentist or doctor's appointment, or that you need to miss school for a family commitment. Usually, you won't want to try to fake a parent's voice — the office isn't stupid — so it's usually best to come up with someone else to cover for you.


Older siblings and cousins might be up for calling you out of school, likewise friendly neighbors or a sibling of one of your friends. Make sure they keep the conversation brief and non-specific.;
, It's best if you can actually have a real appointment or reason to miss school. You might consider telling your parent the orthodontist scheduled you an appointment when you really haven't got one, or that they need to call you out for an appointment with your coach to go over plays for the weekend's game. A call from your parents will seem more real, even if the appointment isn't.

, When you're making a fake appointment, it's best if you can keep it as vague and non-specific as you can to avoid causing suspicion. If you get your brother to call you in and say, ""He's got a doctor's appointment this morning and he's not going to be able to make it in today,"" the office will be unlikely to question it.

Consider homeschooling.,
Enroll in an online education program.,
Dual enroll at your local college.,
Register for a semester long service project or placement.,
Attend a vocational school.",How to Avoid Going to School2," For students who struggle to learn or socialize in a traditional school environment, homeschooling is an excellent alternative. As a homeschooler, you will have the luxury of studying within the safe and comfortable confines of your home. You will receive one-on-one instruction and a personalized curriculum. This alternative learning program is benefits both the student that requires additional attention and the student that requires more challenging coursework., Virtual learning is increasing in popularity. It is providing students across the world with access to excellent educators, customizable curriculum, and exposure to a diverse student body. This is an excellent option for students that excel in non-traditional academic settings., Taking a course at your local college in place of a high school class is an excellent way to challenge yourself—and it allows you to leave campus! Meet with a high school counselor to discuss the possibility of dual enrolling at your local college. Express that you wish to challenge yourself and that you want to prepare yourself for a successful collegiate career.Very few college courses meet 5 days a week, which means less time in the classroom.

, Ask your teachers or school counselors if your school offers semester long internships, service projects, and or placements. Work with the counselor to register for the program. Finding opportunities for hands on learning will allow you to develop personal and professional skills. Your participation in one of these programs not only looks great on college applications, but it also gets you out of the classroom!, Enrolling in a vocational school is an excellent option for students who wish to start their careers immediately after high school or teens who simply prefer hands on learning. Instead of taking traditional courses, take classes that teach you a set of practical and transferable professional skills. Work with your school counselors to register for courses or transfer to your local vocational school."

Address your bullies.,
Seek help for focus problems.,
Reduce your risk of feeling overwhelmed by schoolwork.",How to Avoid Going to School3," Dealing with bullies at school is scary, overwhelming, and exhausting! When a bully belittles you, remain strong and confident—remind yourself that you are a valuable and wonderful person. Report the incident to a trusted adult, like your parents, a teacher, or a school administrator. Meet with the principal, school counselors, and teachers and develop a plan to address the bullying., Sitting in a desk for 6 to 8 hours a day is quite the task! If you are struggling to remain focused, actively seek positive solutions to your problem. Meet with your teacher and parents to devise a personalized learning plan. Schedule an appointment with your doctor to explore possible medical explanations for your inability to focus., Throughout the course of a semester, you may feel overwhelmed by the endless cycle of reading assignments, homework, projects, and exams. As your stress increases and feelings of inadequacy creep in, actively seek to regain control of your life.Make time for self care.
Think positive thoughts. Never tell yourself you can’t achieve a goal or complete an assignment on time.
Tackle your homework one step at a time. Focus on completing one problem or reading one section at a time,
Set small, achievable goals for yourself."
"
Get your acting face on.,
Ask to visit the nurse and get a hall pass.,
Describe your ""symptoms"" to the nurse.",How to Skip Class2," If you're acting fine and chatting with your friends in the back of the classroom one minute, then trying to tell your teacher you're about to puke the next minute, no one's going to believe you. To pull off the illness ruse, you've got to lay the groundwork:


Stay quiet during the day, with a concerned look on your face. Cradle your head in your hands and sigh deeply. Squint your eyes.
Don't rush it. It's best if someone else brings up the subject of you not feeling good. If you lay it on thick enough, keeping your head down and looking ill, your teacher may say, ""Is everything okay?"" at which point you'll be able to play it off, and say, ""I don't know, I just don't feel right. I think I'm okay."" It's better to downplay it.

, After a long enough time has passed during which you can establish that you don't feel good, go up to your teacher: ""Actually, I really don't feel well. I've got a bad headache and stomachache. Could I visit the nurse?"" Get a hall pass and you're free of the classroom, your first obstacle.


For another option, get up in a rush and ask to go to the bathroom. Leave hurriedly, as if something were very wrong, then take your time and head to the restroom slowly. Kill some time in the bathroom, wash your hands, and head back to the classroom after a long enough period of time to vomit has passed. Tell your teacher quietly you just threw up and you'd like to visit the nurse.

, You've got lots of options available to you, depending on whether or not you want to be sent home, kill the rest of the class period in the nurse's office laying on a cot, or if you just want to cut out after you get your hall pass:



If you want to be sent home no questions asked, say you vomited. No one's going to make a kid stick around school who just puked in the bathroom, risking getting everyone else sick. The nurse will call your parents and ask if you can be picked up, or let you leave if you drive to school.

If you want to kill the rest of the hour go with a headache. If you just can't stand the thought of another boring lecture on nothing, why not nap it off in the nurse's office? When the period's over, the nurse will probably check on you, at which point you can tell them you feel better and you want to go back to class, or you can say you want to be sent home.

If you want to cut the rest of the day without calling home then just leave instead of heading to the nurse's office. Sign out and head wherever you wish.

Know your school's attendance policy.,
Choose which class to skip.,
Use an excuse when possible.,
Don't look like a truant student.,
Leave your previous class a few minutes early.,
Fake a hall pass.,
Slip out or find a hiding spot.,
Avoid obvious hang-outs.,
Prepare to face your parents.",How to Skip Class3," Each school sets its own rules on absences. Find out how many absences you have already, and what the consequences are for the next one. Even if you plan to sneak out without getting marked absence, there's always a chance you get caught. Figure out whether your worst case scenario is a minor mark on your record, or a serious consequence like suspension.

, If you can, choose a teacher that doesn't take roll every day. In general, you're more likely to get away with skipping a class if the teacher is relaxed and if you haven't been absent from it more than once or twice before.

, This is a limited resource; each teacher will only believe your excuses once or twice. But when it works, you have a consequence-free pass from the rest of class. Here are some ideas you can use:


Look antsy and say you have ""bathroom problems.""
If you're female, say you are having a bad period or ""female problems.""
Look upset and ask if you can talk to the school counselor.
Deliberately leave a bag or other item in another room. Say you've lost it or left it in your gym locker, and claim there's something important inside (keys, wallet, etc — but don't actually abandon these).

, Leave your backpack in your locker so you look like someone walking to the bathroom, not someone trying to sneak out.


If you are reasonably tall and go to a large school, you can try dressing in smart clothes and pretending to be an adult. This may save you from a staff member's passing glance, but don't expect it to save you if someone stops you.

, Tell your teacher you need to use the bathroom five or ten minutes before class ends. Even if the teacher doesn't let you leave, you have an excuse to rush out the door as soon as the bell rings. Your goal is to get as far as possible before passing period is over, while the halls are still full of people.

, Forging a hall pass could get you in serious trouble, depending on your school's policy. Holding an old hall pass or scribbled-on piece of paper the same color and size can be almost as good, depending on how strict the staff members are about checking.

, If staff members watch the exits during passing period, slip into a nearby bathroom or empty room and wait for the next class to start. Sneak out as soon as the exit is clear.


If your school has very tight security, or if there's nowhere to hang out near your school, you could spend the whole class in a bathroom stall. You'd better have the best game ever on your phone for this to be worth it.

, In some places, truancy is a crime. Getting caught could mean serious punishment, so you've got to be relatively sneaky if you want to hang out with friends. Don't head straight to the pizza place all the kids go to after school, the mall, or the park across the street from school. Get away from the school, stay in quiet neighborhoods, and definitely stay away from places where your parents or their friends might see you.


Walk directly away from the school when you leave the school grounds. Don't pass by any windows or chain link fences where a teacher can see you on the other side.

, Many schools phone your parents if you're marked absent from a class. It's up to you whether to own up and face the music, or whether to lie your way out of it. You know how your parents will react better than anyone, so use your judgement.


Use your knowledge of school policy to your advantage. If the school marks you absent after five minutes, claim you were just late coming from the bathroom or from the previous class.
If one parent is much less strict than the other, bring up the subject when only the lenient parent is around.

Drink caffeine.,

Get your heart-rate up.,
Don't lie down.,
Consider taking a power nap.,
Don't let it get too dark.,
Eat snacks to keep your body brimming with energy.",How to Stay Up All Night on a School Night1," Bring a coffeemaker into your room, if you have one. The coffee will help you stay awake and bringing it in your room will decrease noise level. You may also drink tea, soda, energy drinks, or any other caffeinated beverage.


Bear in mind that coffee won't keep you awake forever.
Don't overload on coffee, or you will become shaky and frazzled. Drink as much as you need to stay awake.;
, The shock of the cold water may help wake you up. Also consider using a cold, wet washcloth, or taking a cold shower.

, Anything you can do to elevate your heart-rate can keep you energized for a little while. Do jumping jacks, jump on your bed, or even jog in place for a few minutes. Small bursts of physical activity when you get tired can help you stay awake.

, Your mind associates your bed with sleep. If you lay in your bed, you will trigger the process of falling asleep, and you may find it more difficult to keep your eyes open.

, Shut your eyes and set your alarm for about twenty minutes. When you wake up, you'll likely feel rested and re-energized. Be careful not to sleep much longer than 20 minutes, however, or you may wake up groggy!


When you awake from your power nap, get up immediately. Don't lie in bed, and don't hit the snooze button. The longer you stretch the nap, the more likely you are to slip into sleep.

, Keep the lights on and don't keep staring at only one spot. Look at bright colors, or stare at your computer screen.

, Try to eat protein-rich foods such as sandwiches, nuts, and dairy products. Sugary foods may make you feel awake for a little while, but they can eventually make you feel drowsy as you crash off the sugar high.

Start immediately.,
Separate your mind from what is happening around you.,
Take breaks!,
Chat with people to stay awake.",How to Stay Up All Night on a School Night2," Though you do have all night, you'll get more done if you start as soon as possible. Start right away, and don't cheat by telling yourself you're going to begin at a certain time. Procrastination is procrastination.

, If you have a lot of work to get done, try to separate your mind from your life so that you can deal with the lack of sleep and work you need to do. All you should think about is the work you need to complete. Do not get upset, and don't let your emotions take over. Focus, be determined, and do not give up on yourself.

, It's hard to concentrate for a long time without short mental breaks, so don't feel bad for taking them. Take longer breaks as well: read something that hasn't anything to do with what you're studying, eat something, paint your nails, or watch one (just one!) episode of your favorite show.


When you have trouble with a task, don't keep torturing yourself! Do something else, drink something, eat something, do something different for a while and come back to the task later.
Don't stay in the same position all the time! It isn't healthy to sit still for too long, and you may find that you tire out over time. Stand up, walk a bit, stretch – and you may be able to return to studying with renewed energy and enthusiasm.

, The social engagement will keep your mind active and give you a reason to stay up. You can talk to another night owl on the phone, in person, or over instant messaging. If you're staying up to finish a project or assignment, try not to slip into a deep conversation, or you may become distracted.

Be discreet.,
Wait until your parents fall asleep before moving around the house.,
Have a good excuse in case you get caught.",How to Stay Up All Night on a School Night3," If you aren't supposed to be awake—say, if your parents won't let you stay up all night—you'll need to keep your activities quiet, keep the lights low, and be prepared to pretend like you're sleeping. Always have a plan for what to do if an adult comes to check on you.


If you hear a sound, turn the lights off. Stop moving, and don't make a sound.
Be careful not to rustle your packets of sweets/candy. It will sound suspicious and your parents (or your friend's parents) may come in to check on you.

, If your parents/guardians are home, it's best to wait till they're asleep. Until then, stay away from whichever room they're sleeping in. When they're finally asleep, you may move about more freely, but still be wary of making noise near your parents' room.

, If you do happen to be caught sneaking about past your bedtime, you need to have a good excuse on hand. Try to keep it simple. Consider these excuses:


""I was just going to the bathroom. I'm on my way back to my room right now.""
""I couldn't sleep, so I was getting a snack to help me sleep.""
""I thought I heard something moving around outside my window.""

"
"
Plan it out beforehand.,
Don't rush to bed early or your parents will get suspicious.,
Once you go to bed, wait until your parents go to sleep before doing anything.,
Get out something small like a tablet or phone to occupy yourself until your parents are completely asleep (or if they are light sleepers.),
No matter what, don't fall into a daze!,
Sneak around the house!,
Once it's 3 AM, you will begin to feel very tired.,
Once you've stayed up all night successfully, be sure to get plenty of rest the next night!

",How to Stay Up All Night Secretly (for Kids)," You don't want to do this unprepared, unless you're a total night owl. To stay up all night, you need to have some things. If you're planning on sneaking around the house, make a map of your house. Test the floors, chairs, couch, and beds and mark out where things creak, shake, or make any noise when you move around. If you're afraid of the dark, plan out which areas you will avoid. You're almost ready to start. Get all your things and entertainment ready to go. Stuff it somewhere inconspicuous (like under your bed). Also, you will want to place a bucket of cold water or a wet cloth there too.;
, Go at your normal time, acting completely ordinary. You can't have them suspecting anything. If you have a computer, PlayStation, DS, Xbox, etc. in your room, it is a good idea to leave them on with the monitor off, because if you have to turn it on totally in the middle of the night your parents (even sleeping ones) will be woken by the sudden change in volume.

, This may take a long time, even more than an hour, but be determined to stay awake. Now, once your parents are asleep, it's time for you to have lots of fun!

, Don't leave your room. It'll pass time for a while. Get on the computer or something that will keep your brain active.

, When you find yourself closing your eyes, go as quietly as possible and put a cold rag on your face or splash water on your face. It feels awful but it will keep you awake.

, Use the map to quietly navigate your house to get food or electronics.

, Put another cold rag or splash water on your face and watch some TV or do extra homework.

",How to Throw a Teenage Ballet Sleepover Party," If not, select the ones who are your friends.


Be aware that some classmates may feel left out.;
, Pre-teenage and teenage girl's schedules tend to fill up at a rapid pace and if you don't set a definite time and date they might start making other plans!

, Choose ballet themes for making one, such as a ballet shoe shape or a tutu on a card. Send these out in plenty of time for giving notice of the party and getting RSVPs in return.

, This will be where you play games, perform dances and do active parts of the party. Ensure that there is plenty of space and that there is nothing to bump into or break.

, This might be your bedroom or perhaps the same room as the activities. Just be sure there is plenty of space for everyone's sleeping bags.

, Play fun ballerina-style games. Some include:


Dream It!: You pick tour favorite ballet that everyone is familiar with (Swan Lake, the Nutcracker, etc;) Someone has a notepad and pen. You go around to everyone confessing what roles you dream of having in that ballet openly. You write down the role, but not the confessor's name. Example.....Hannah says ""I would really love to be the Sugarplum Fairy!"" Adrianna says ""If I could be any role I would choose the Arabian Princess.""Grace says ""Hands down I would be the Snow Queen."" You would write down... Sugarplum Fairy, Arabian Princess, Snow Queen. Then you put all the roles in a hat/pillowcase. Each girl picks one out and reads it aloud. They all preform their best impression of the dance (or a portion of it).
Slipper-Swap: Every girl puts her ballet slippers on a pile and you scramble them up. Each girl picks the first pair they see and tries to guess who they belong to. *Also works with pointe/shoes*

, For example: Would You Rather, Manhunt, or Truth or Dare. You are still teenage girls and close friends so the more secrets the better!

, Using a ballet theme is fun, if possible. For example, pipe images of ballet items and dancers onto cakes, cupcakes, cookies, etc., make cookies in the shape of ballet shoes, and so forth.


Also choose drinks, such as flavored water and homemade lemonade.

, Include ballet-related items, such as erasers and pencils with ballet dancers on them, books about ballet, and so on.

, Make them feel welcome, especially if they are coming to your house for the first time ever. In a new home no one likes it better than to feel welcomed.

, Try to avoid boredom at all costs. As the last resort try board or video games.

, Do dances. Watch ballet DVDs. Spend some time outdoors in the yard. Talk lots.

, Try to get some sleep, otherwise you'll all feel irritable in the morning.

, In the morning, have a Pancake Making Contest. See who can make their pancake look closest to a toe shoe!

, Don't be too sad. There is nothing a mother dislikes more than a whiny child.

, At next class, laugh and giggle about the time you had. Maybe relive a funny moment?

Understand how the body will respond to losing sleep.,
Ensure your safety while tired.,
Take a short nap during the night or right before it starts.,
Make sure the lights are on and bright.,
Stay busy, and move.,
Cool down the room.,
Drink some caffeine during the night.,
Eat high-energy foods to give your body a boost.,
Avoid things that will make you more tired or are dangerous fixes.,
Develop better habits so you don’t have to stay up all night.",How to Stay up All Night (for Teens)," At about 24 hours after your normal wake up time, the body is likely to hit a wall, and you will feel most tired.


Experts say this is because of the body’s normal internal clock. That’s called your circadian rhythm. It means that you might feel more tired at the 24-hour mark of no sleep than you will at, say, the 30-hour mark. Your body clock will give you periodic second winds. The body basically triggers a wake up signal in your brain that will give you a boost despite sleep deprivation. There are things you can do to trick the body into waking up.;
, If it’s absolutely necessary for you to pull an all-nighter, make sure you do it in a safe way. Realize, though, that depriving the body of sleep is not good for the body. It releases cortisol into the body, which is the stress hormone.Don’t drive if you’ve stayed up all night. It can be exceptionally dangerous to yourself and other drivers. Studying all night also has been associated with lower grade-point average. So develop strategies so you don’t have to do it in the future.Be aware that staying up all night will affect your body in several other ways that could be dangerous. It might make you forget things and slow your reaction times. People who are deprived of sleep are more likely to perform worse at multi-tasking, indicating there is a decline in memory ability.
Longer term sleep deprivation has been associated with a slew of negative affects on the body, such as weight gain, mood instability, and muscle fatigue.So if you end up going without sleep, make sure you give your body a chance to catch up. It's not a good idea to do this as a habit.

, Okay, this isn’t exactly staying up all night, but taking a nap for even a few minutes can improve performance and minimize signs of sleepiness. Even a little shut eye can help you stay up for the rest of the night.


One study found that people did better with just a 26-minute nap. So shut your eyes for just a little bit, and you should find it easier to make it through the entire night and next day. The key here is to take a short nap because otherwise you could end up in a deep sleep, which is very hard to wake out of. You could also sleep a little bit longer the night before you know you will be up all night. The body will “bank” the sleep, and it will be easier to get through the stretch of sleeplessness without it. , Your body clock is actually aware of changes in light and darkness, and you will feel more awake in the light. The body clock is linked physically to the eyes.


If you’re super tired the next day, go outside. The sunlight will also function to wake your body up more. The darkness causes the body to produce melatonin, which is the sleep hormone.
People’s instinct is often to turn down the lights at night, but that’s probably going to make you more sleepy as the body perceives it’s time to call it a night. Turning the lights higher than normal will trick the body.

, The brain is going to be more alert after you move a bit. If you don’t have time to exercise, you could just engage in a conversation, wash the dishes – do something to focus your body on a new action for a time.


Changing an activity also might wake the body up more. The body will become more alert to compensate for the new activity. The body feels less tired when you’re busy because it will focus on the task instead of the lack of sleep.
Mental activities also may help you stay awake by keeping your focus on something other than the fact you're tired. So try playing a game. Some mental activities, like reading a book, may make you more sleepy, though, especially if you do them while lying down. You could listen to a talking radio show though.

, The body temperature naturally lowers during sleep, so people sleep better when it’s colder. However, a hot room is probably going to make you feel drowsy.


Other ways to trick the body into feeling more wakeful include taking a cold shower and getting dressed up for your day.
In addition to turning down the room temperature, you could also open a window. The breeze should help you stay awake, in addition to the lower temperature (if it's cool outside).

, Coffee or an energy drink will give you the boost you will need to make it through the night. However, don’t guzzle it down all at once. It can help you stay more alert if you space it out throughout the night. Some studies show caffeine can increase your focus.


Most people need about a 5-ounce cup of coffee or caffeinated beverage to get the necessary boost. That’s about 100 milligrams of caffeine. Caffeine will wear off in a couple hours, and it takes about a half hour for you to feel its effects.
You can also find caffeine pills in 100 or 200 mg doses that you can buy across the counter. Be aware that drinking a lot of caffeine can also make you jittery and have some side effects. When you stop drinking the caffeinated beverage, your body might crash, making you feel extra tired.
If you don't drink coffee, eat apples. They have enough sugar to keep you awake.

, Some foods will give you more of an energy boost than others. If you’re pulling an all-nighter, you need to give your body some fuel. So don’t skip meals.


Eat something that has protein, fiber, or complex carbs in it. For example, a sandwich with a glass of milk or granola with fruit are good choices. You should also drink a lot of water. Staying hydrated is a natural energy boost.Whole grains, tuna fish, mushrooms, nuts, eggs, chicken and beef are also high-energy feeds. Empty calorie junk food filled with sugar could set you up for a sugar crash, so the energizing effects are too temporary.

, Choose natural ways to stay up all night, not ways that could put you at risk. Be very careful what you put into your body.


Although teenagers probably shouldn’t be drinking it anyway, (unless they’re of legal drinking age for their area), drinking alcohol causes drowsiness.
Don’t use drugs that are regularly prescribed as stimulants to pull an all-nighter. It’s not worth damaging your body or taking the risk. Such behaviors can be exceptionally dangerous and even illegal.

, Sometimes it’s unavoidable (a one-time thing). However, organizing your life differently may ensure you don’t have to do it regularly.


Work on study habits. People get overwhelmed when they think of everything they have to do at once. Create a checklist. Set aside a certain amount of time to study at the same time each day, so you get into a routine.
Research shows that teenagers’ sleep habits are different than those of adults. Young people's bodies might tell them to go to stay awake later. This is a natural occurrence. Clearing your mind by getting off the computer, smartphone or video games will help.

"
First, create a list of tasks or riddles you want the party guests to solve.,
After time is up, the points will be added.,
Then you and your daughter will have to make some decisions.,
After you have made a decision, ask your daughter who she wants to invite.,
You will need to provide the guests with a few things.,
Next, decide if you are comfortable or not with the girls wandering the mall by themselves.,
Finally, send out the invitations to the guests.,
If the party guests will be going to your home at any point during the party, make sure your home is clean and comfortable.,
Before the scavenger hunt starts, go over the rules of the scavenger hunt and how the scavenger hunt works.,
Have fun!!!",How to Throw a Mall Scavenger Sleepover (Teen or Pre Teen)," The internet has plenty of ideas! Don’t let the birthday girl see the list before the party. It will be unfair if the birthday girl knows all of the riddles and tasks. Here are some ideas:


A take-out menu from the food court- 50 points
A fortune cookie- 50 points (30 extra points if the word ""love"" appears in the the fortune cookie note
A perfume sample- 70 points
Go to a toy store and someone on your team yells ""OH MY GOSH IT'S A BARBIE!!"" really loud- 300 points
Hoo hoo hoo am I? I can fly so high with my big scary eyes. Can you take a picture of me on a necklace?- 400 points
Go to the fruitiest in the mall. Like they say, an apple a day keeps the doctor away. I hope you can find it and take a picture- 400 points. The party guests will be split up into two (or more) groups.;
, The team with the most points wins.

, Are you and your guests going to meet at the mall, or at your home? Is the party going to be a sleepover? Will food/cake be served? Make sure to include this information in the invite.

, Make sure there is an even amount of girls (including the birthday girl) so that the teams will be split up evenly and it will all be fair. It is a good time to create teams BEFORE the party instead of letting the girls do it themselves. That way they won’t argue over who is on whose team and no feelings will get hurt. But, when the party starts you can let the girls decide what they want their team name to be, for example, Team Pink.

, When they arrive at the party, give each team a tote bag that contains a notepad, a pen or pencil, a plastic bag, a map of the mall the party is at, the list of tasks/riddles, and a digital camera. If you do not have enough digital cameras for each of the teams to have one camera, you could ask the girls to bring their own (If they have one). Or, the guests could just use their cell phones to take pictures and video.

, Depending on the ages of the girls invited, you may want at least one girl in every group to have a cell phone with your number on it in case of emergencies. Also, make sure the guest’s parents are okay with this as well. If you or the guest’s parents are not comfortable with this, you can assign an adult chaperone to every group. This all depends on how old the guests are.

, You may want to send out Evites through Email instead of your daughter passing them out at school. That way no one will be upset if they didn’t get invited. Also, you could mail the invites to the guest’s houses or go to their houses and drop them off at the front door. There are also plenty of websites where you can print out invitations especially made for mall scavenger hunts. They are super cute and they are made to look just like credit cards!

, Remove any breakable/ valuable things from the rooms and designate any rooms that are off-limits, if the children are younger.

, Let the guests ask any questions they might have. Since your local mall is probably pretty big, before the scavenger hunt starts; tell the groups what time the scavenger hunt ends and where to meet up with the other groups. That way, the kids can come find YOU instead of searching the mall for all the groups. For Example, “The Scavenger hunt ends at 6:00 pm. At 6:00 pm, meet the other groups at the food court for dinner.” If the group gets there late, subtract 30 points from their total score. Also tell the kids who to call if they have a problem. Make sure the rules are all clear. If the groups do not have adult chaperones, you might want to wander around the mall and try to check in with the groups throughout the party to make sure everything is going smoothly.

, This should be a fun party. Not a fierce competition. Make sure your guests know that. If the party is a sleepover, take the girls to your home afterward. Make sure to provide snacks, movies and other activities for the girls to do!! This might be a good time to have cake, too.

Before you do anything, make sure you acknowledge the fact that you do some things well.,
Now, think about what you find the most difficult about school.,
Decide how you're going to tackle it.,
Try to follow your plan as well as possible.,
Have special ""coping strategies"" to help you cope with tough situations.,
Finally, remember, all the time, that you are special in your own, amazing way.",How to Succeed in School if You're Autistic," Just because you find school hard doesn't mean that everything else is hard, too. Everybody, from the most everyday of neurotypicals to people such severe autism that they can't talk, has something they are good at, academically or not. If you would like, you could try out different activities, like martial arts or drawing. If your strength just so happens to be in an academic subject, well, you are gifted.;
, Maybe it's the crowds and noise, or perhaps the worry about bullying, or the academics, or teachers stereotyping you as ""thick"". Whatever you choose to put down on there, everybody has something that causes them hassle. It is completely natural to not enjoy something as a whole.

, (See Things You'll need for supplies!) For example, if you were being bullied in lessons (the majority of autism spectrum kids are), you could plan to avoid the bully as much as possible, and find out what behaviour makes them do it more and avoid doing it, or tell the class teacher. Or if you're falling behind in class, you could find out your individual ""learning style"" (type ""VAK model"" into Google for details of this) and use this as a basis for your learning approach. In fact, you could even use your skill from step 1 to fix this dilemma. All problems have a solution!

, If you do not succeed at some points, it doesn't matter - so long as you learn from it and try to limit mistakes. Everybody has off days. Alternatively, this could mean your plan needs some changes to make it right for you.

, But don't try anything self-destructive. That will just make your situation worse. Try researching something you are interested in, or doing something you find relaxing once you get home.

, Just keep thinking positively, and one day, it will be easy for you.

Don't put on your pajamas.,
Don't lie in bed.,

Drink a lot of water.,
Splash your face with cold water.,
Move around a lot.,
Do things that you really enjoy.,

Try singing.",How to Stay Awake All Night at a Sleepover," Pajamas are comfortable, and therefore easy to fall asleep in. Stay in your clothes and wear jeans or something that is not comfortable enough to sleep in. The idea isn't to make yourself uncomfortable, just to avoid anything that your mind associates with sleep.;
, The comfort will make you want to shut your eyes, a surefire way to give in to drowsiness. So sit on a hard chair, the floor, or something similar. You should focus on keeping active, so try to change your location often.

, Dim lights can be a source of fatigue, especially for the eyes. If you can, turn at least two lights on, as well as the TV. This will keep your eyes open and your mind alert. , If you do this, you will be ready for the long night. Have an afternoon nap, or a long sleep the day before. If you can, sleep for at least 12 hours the night before, or sleep before your friends come over., If you don't like coffee, drink soda. Some good examples are Red Bull, Dr. Pepper, Monster, Mountain Dew, and Coke. Also, try mixing hot chocolate with instant coffee and milk., Eating something spicy is just like pinching yourself, but with more burning. Try spicy Cheetos, spicy noodles, spicy chips, and anything else that's spicy. Just try not to eat too much, as a full stomach can cause drowsiness.

, Sugar can make you more active and moving around more. Eat candy, chocolate, ice cream, cookies, cake, and any other sugary treats. You could also eat sour gummy worms and ice breakers so that you'll be energized by the constant sour, and the candy will give you some sugar too., When you're mouth is busy chewing and biting, you won't be as likely to fall asleep. Your chewing mouth sends signals to your brain that food is on its way, which helps you stay awake. And chewing without swallowing helps you avoid post-meal tiredness., It is difficult to sleep if you have a full bladder. It will make you have to keep moving. Not to mention that water is also healthy for you, and a lack of water can tire you out., If you're really feeling the drowsiness, a splash of cold water will help. Go to the bathroom sink, run the water, and just give your face a few splashes of water. It stimulates the nerves and re-energizes your body., If you keep moving, your body will stay circulated and you will become hyper. Try activities such as jumping jacks or push-ups to help you wake up. Make up games with your sleepover buddies that involve moving around, rather than just playing video games and watching things on TV.Have a pillow fight! This will keep you and your friends active and having fun. If you do have a pillow fight, try to keep the volume down, or do it somewhere where the sound doesn't echo!

, For example, watching movies, playing video games, or playing a board game will keep you occupied. Play on your phone or tablet, but try to rest your eyes every twenty minutes or so.Play games like Truth or Dare, Would You Rather, and Mafia. You have to pay attention in these games, that will keep you alert. You could also play Guitar Hero or Rock Band. This will keep your mind off of sleeping.


When watching TV, try not to watch re-runs of TV shows you've seen before. The fact that you know what eventually happens makes watching the show boring. Try to watch episodes of TV shows that you've never seen, or that you haven't seen in a while. Same goes for movies.
Take frequent breaks when watching any kind of screen, to avoid fatiguing your eyes., Rock or heavy metal is usually louder, or just turn the volume up more. Don't let it get too loud though, or you might wake the host's parents. Take turns using headphones if you have to., This will make the night drag on, and it seems like it will never reach the end of that night. Pay attention to what your friends are doing or talking about instead. The more fun you have, the faster time will seem to pass., Make a rule where if anybody sees anybody else start to fade off, or look drowsy, they can give them a small pinch in the arm or shake them awake. If you see your friends looking drowsy, suggest a change in activities. It's easier to stay awake with help from your friends.

, Just be careful not to hurt anyone’s feelings or make someone sound bad. For instance, talk about the people you have a crush on, the people your friends have a crush on, the school gossip, or the TV shows or movies you like at the moment. Conversation stimulates the mind, and a stimulated mind is an alert mind.Scare yourself silly. Tell lots of super scary stories that will scare each other into staying awake. Try playing a truth or dare game in the dark outside, so you will be too scared to sleep.

, The thrill of hiding from whoever is ""it"" will keep you up! It is also a fun game to play when you have nothing to do. Do not hide lying down, or else you could fall asleep.

, Get outside into the fresh night air (if your parents approve of it). Jump on the trampoline, play flashlight tag, run in circles, have races, or go swimming in the backyard pool at night (with permission from the parents). The cold air will help keep you awake., It doesn't matter if your are a good or bad singer, singing is a great way to pass the time while keeping your mind active. You could play a game like American Idol or The X Factor in your living room or bedroom, even outside. Just be sure not to wake those in the house trying to sleep.

"
"
Make your guests promise they will try to stay awake all of or the majority of the night.,
Do all your outdoor activities first, so you'll have the night for indoor stuff.,
Play games such as truth or dare, and ones that will have your friends on their toes, like scary stuff.

,
Talk about boys, and look in old year books.,
Now, depending on what time you started, it should be around 11:30PM-12:00AM, so it is now time to sneak downstairs, or just get some caffeine and sugar!

,
Now that you're hyper, make prank calls!,
Now just call a radio station and request a song or whatever.

,
This is the time you get bored and want to go to sleep, so go in your bathroom and splash cold water on your face.,
Makeovers!,
Play American Idol!,
Play a card/board game!,
Do whatever you want, its probably 5AM by this time, so congratulations, you've pulled an all-nighter!,
Movies make you tired, so save them for last.

Figure out why the storm is bothering you.,
Pay close attention to the teacher and what they are saying.,
Remind yourself that everything will be alright.,
Focus on things outside of school.,
Get lost in reading a book.",How to Stop Thinking About the Thunderstorm Outside at School," Is the noise level of the storm too loud that you can't concentrate? Try moving to a different part of the classroom or slightly cover your ears with your hands. Can you not help but glance outside the window to look at the overwhelming sight? Ask your teacher if you may shut the window blinds because the storm is bothering you.;
, Work on the assignment that they handed out, or take notes if they're giving a lecture. Whatever the case may be, the goal is to get yourself preoccupied in your schoolwork. Volunteer for anything else if one is needed from the class.

, Calm yourself down, and try to relax a little bit. Understand that the storm will probably be over in less than an hour. Realize that if you were in extreme danger, more precautions would be taken.

, Think about what you are going to eat for lunch, do when you get home, etc. Plan some activities to do once the weekend comes. Pass a note to a friend if one sits close to you. Start getting excited for a sport or club if you have one after school.

, Pick up any book you can get your hands on. Try to get deep into the reading so you can block out the other noises. Imagine yourself as the main character, decide what you would do if you were in their shoes, etc. Predict what you think will happen in the next chapter or at the end of the book.

Speak with your professor.,
Speak with your parents.,
If depression and/or anxiety are preventing you from going to class, get help.,
Make sure you don't oversleep.,
Prepare for your class in advance.,
Get to class early.,
Know your schedule like the back of your hand.,
Tell yourself that you can go to class, and will now decide to do it.",How to Stop Skipping Class (for Good)," Skipping even one class can get you behind on your work. Speak with your professor as soon as possible in order to get caught up, as well as to make it clear to them that although you may have skipped a class (or many classes), you are still making an effort to learn the material and get a good grade. E-mailing them is a good way to do this initially, as it allows you to think carefully as to what you want to say.


Try to follow up by going to your professor's office hours. This will make an even greater impression on them, and they will want to help you pass the class even more.
Even if you've skipped more classes than you have attended, and you think there's no way you can pass at this point, it is always worth a shot to speak with your professor and see if there is any way you can pass the class.;
, Yep, you read that right. Although you might want to avoid getting in trouble, being honest with your parents about poor attendance will motivate you to not stop making the same mistakes. This will also give your parents some foresight, so if you do end getting bad grades, they will not be totally shocked all at once.

, Depression and anxiety are two of the main reasons why college students end up skipping many classes during a semester. Skipping one class leads to more worry and sadness, which leads you to feel overwhelmed, which prevents you from getting to your next class, and this just further creates a negative feedback loop. Dealing with depression and anxiety is very difficult to do by oneself, so get help as soon as you can. And remember, no matter how overwhelmed you feel by college, hurting yourself is never the solution. College can be tough, but remember that it's only temporary.

, Set your alarm loud, and have your coffee ready to brew immediately upon waking up if necessary. Do some stretching and wash your face with cold water. Try to avoid the the snooze button altogether.


If you can break yourself from the snooze addiction, not only will getting to class be easier, but you will likely find yourself feeling more well rested. Repeatedly being woken up by the snooze button is a form of fragmented sleep, which has been proven to not actually make you feel more rested.
If you take a nap in the afternoon, set your alarm to let you sleep for either 20 minutes or 90 minutes, and don't use the snooze button! You snooze you lose!

, Be sure to prepare all necessary homework, read textbook sections beforehand, and have all of your class materials prepared. However, if you fail at this step, don't let it be an excuse to not go to class! Going to class unprepared is better than not going at all.

, Walking into class late can feel uncomfortable, and the mentality of ""I'm already late to class, I may as well just skip it,"" can be entirely avoided by going to class early. However, once again, don't let failing at this step be an excuse! You are in college, so your professors and peers do not really care that you are walking into class twenty minutes late.

, Even if you think you know when and where your next class is, double check. This is especially important during the first two weeks of class.

, This step may sound obvious, but it's still the main reason why some students skip many classes. Going to class isn't actually that bad!


Getting to class may not give the same immediate reward as staying in your dorm and sleeping or hanging out with your friends, but remind yourself that skipping class has consequences. Going to class and making the most out of it can be surprisingly gratifying. Make the decision today to not skip any more classes. You can do it!

Be optimistic about school.,
Encourage other students.,
Take feedback constructively.,
Smile at your peers and teachers.,
Take advantage of extra help.,
Focus on your strengths.,
Stay patient with yourself when you’re trying to change.",How to Stay Positive in School1," Make sure not to focus on the negative in every situation. Instead, try being positive about what you feel good about and are looking forward to in the future.Create a list of things you are grateful for. You may be grateful for your parents or maybe even your new jacket. Try to appreciate the good things in your life.
Write down one thing every day that you are looking forward to. This can help you appreciate the future and what it has to offer.
Imagine all the things that could happen in the future. Think about your future self and all the things you will accomplish.;
, Sometimes taking the focus off yourself can help you to be more optimistic. Help make others feel better and often you’ll feel better as well..


Share any encouraging thoughts if you have them. If you are impressed by someone’s ability in math or science class, tell them. Making others feel good about themselves can make you feel good too.
Give small, thoughtful gifts to your friends. People appreciate when others are thinking of them. Even something as simple as buying a friend a coffee can encourage them to stay positive at school.
Offer practical help if people seem to be struggling. Asking to help someone carry heavy or large items indoors can be a good way to encourage others by showing them you care.

, Though it may sometimes be difficult, it’s important to not get down when teachers offer you feedback. Take what they say and learn how to apply it to be better in the future.Breathe when you get any potentially negative feedback. Take a minute to calm down your initial response before you react.
Take your own notes about the feedback you receive. If it’s written feedback, write down what you think you need to do based on your teacher’s recommendations. If it’s oral feedback, write down what the teacher is telling you and verify that you’re understanding correctly.
Be thankful for feedback. Thank your teacher for giving you feedback. Consider it as an opportunity to improve yourself.

, Smiling can make you feel better. Even if you’re not feeling great, just the physical act of smiling improves your mood.

People will find you more trustworthy and approachable if you’re smiling. Smiling makes you look like an open and warm person that will listen and be friendly.
Smiling makes other people smile. It can be contagious if you see others smiling around you.
You are also more productive when you smile. Smiling makes you feel better, so you work harder and smarter.

, Some teachers may offer extra help either before or after school. Additionally, you can always find a tutor to help you on any subjects you’re really struggling with.Go to any before or after school tutoring that your teacher offers. Talking to your teacher more about your school work, especially areas where you are struggling, can be really beneficial.
Come to any tutoring sessions with specific questions. You can get the most out of your tutoring session if you have clear questions for your teacher. Stating, “I don’t get it” isn’t as useful as “I’m confused about…..”
Find an individual tutor. There may be tutors who are other students at your school. See if you can find any of these students who may be willing to help you out with your work.

, Not everyone is good at every subject. Emphasize the things you do well so you can do those that much better while you’re in school.Enjoy the classes that you do well in. Some classes may be easier for you than others, so make sure to really shine in those classes.

, Optimistic people try to take a longer view. Don’t get impatient with yourself if you’re struggling in school.Catch yourself if you find yourself getting impatient. Recognize when you’re feeling impatient and end your thought process.
Relax your body from your head to your toes. Don’t get tense by being too impatient.
Focus on what you’re currently doing. Try not to think too far ahead, but instead work on this particular homework assignment or this particular test.

Keep organized in your school materials.,
Make your work area tidy and comfortable.,
Stay busy and active during school.",How to Stay Positive in School2," Staying positive in school is easier if you have a clear plan of what you want to accomplish. Have clear benchmarks and deadlines for your goals, so you’ll know when you’ve accomplished them. If you don’t meet your deadlines, try to adjust your goals, but don’t beat yourself up too much.Create a list of things you want to accomplish in school. Maybe you want to take better notes or participate more in class. Think of things that you are struggling with and want to do better on.
Develop a plan for how you’ll accomplish your goals. Find little ways you can improve on a daily basis and work towards achieving your goals.
Set clear deadlines by which you’ll achieve your goals. They should be reasonable deadlines, since your goals may take a while to achieve.
Review your action plan on a regular basis. Remind yourself of what you’re trying to accomplish
Change your plan of action if necessary. If you are struggling to reach your goals, update your action plan. Don’t think of this as a failure, but instead think of it as an adjustment to how you’ll achieve your goals.

, Being organized lets you keep things in order and feel more in control of what’s happening. You'll be able to find everything quickly and easy when it's time to study.


Put all your assignments, notebooks, and class information for each class together. You want to be able to look at everything for each class at one time. Don’t have your class information in too many locations. If you carry just one binder, make sure you have different sections for each class.
Buy organization tools like binders, planners, and book bags. Have places where you can store your class materials and take them with you to different events. Take notes during your classes. It may be useful to recopy your notes after class, since this helps you retain the information better.
Find the best way of organizing your school work that works for you. If what you’re doing isn’t working, then change your method of organizing into something that does., Wherever you do most of your work should be clean and ready for you to work. You need to feel comfortable when you’re working on your schoolwork.

, Try to keep motivated by staying busy. Avoid getting distracted too much by extracurricular activities or your personal life.Keep to a consistent schedule to complete your school work. Give yourself enough time to complete assignments.
Look ahead to see what’s due soon. Plan out the best way you can start working on assignments now, instead of at the last minute.
Being busy can motivate you. Not having enough to do can sometimes make you lose momentum.

Take a nap beforehand if possible.,

Drink lots of water.,
Grab a friend.,
Drink something caffeinated.,
Make the atmosphere cool.,
Get up and move around.,
Switch tasks.,
Eat a healthy snack.,
Keep the lights bright.",How to Stay Awake at Night," If you know you're going to be up all night, then grab a nap in the afternoon. You will want to make sure that you don't sleep for too long and that you don't nap too close to when you would normally go to bed (try to take the nap 6 or 7 hours before your usual bedtime).A half hour nap is good for jump-starting your system. If you go too much over that, you'll get into a deeper sleep and will feel groggier when you wake up. If you go too much under that you won't get enough sleep to help.
An hour and a half nap can help make up for lost sleep, in that you usually get through one sleep cycle in that amount of time so it can help you feel less sleepy, especially if you've been pulling a lot of all-nighters.;
, Daylight (and sunlight) influence our circadian rhythms (which govern our sleep-wake cycles). So, before you pull that all-night event, spend at least 30 minutes outside in the sun and in the daylight. This (and the fresh air) will help keep your sense revitalized.

, Dehydration can make you feel sleepy and cause you to be tired. Combat this early, before the night sets in, by drinking lots of water. It's especially important if you're going to be drinking coffee because coffee can aggravate your dehydration, which will make you crash harder.

, You'll stay awake much easier if you have someone to help keep your brain stimulated with conversation and presence. They can also help check that you're on track with your plan to stay awake.

, Coffee or other types of caffeinated beverages can give you a much-needed energy boost to get you through the night, especially if you pace your coffee drinking so that you don't crash heavily and painfully in those hours between 4 a.m. and 8 a.m. which is when a lot of people fail.


Coffee takes about 15 to 30 minutes to kick in, but the benefits from it can last 3 to 4 hours. If you plan on drinking a cup of coffee every few hours, you'll keep pretty awake and energized.
When you stop drinking your caffeinated drink, you will crash heavily. Avoid it either by spacing out coffee drinks or by utilizing other staying awake methods.
If you don't want to drink caffeinated beverages, drink very cold water and sip on ice chips. The coldness can help to keep you awake and alert.

, To sleep, your body prefers to be at a warm temperature, so the warmer the temperature of your environment, the more you will want to fall asleep and the harder it will be to stay awake. Turn on a fan in your room, if you can, or open the windows.


If your environment is too hot and you can't cool it down, consider taking a cold shower. That will give you a boost of alertness.
You can also apply cold compresses to your head and wrists.

, Moving around and taking a break helps get your blood flowing and keeps you from feeling sleepy. Scientists found that exercising could be more effective than some medications for increasing energy and reducing fatigue (this does not mean that you should stop taking medication if you're on some).Take breaks from your computer screen. Staring at your computer screen for hours and hours on end can cause eyestrain and make your sleepiness and fatigue worse. Relax your eyes for a few minutes each hour, either by closing them or looking at something else for a while.
Exercise. Try to get at least 30 minutes of exercise. This will increase your energy level and help you stay awake. Whenever you're feeling a hit of drowsiness, go for a brisk walk or do some jumping jacks.

, Monotonous work (doing the same thing over and over and over for an extended period of time) can be just as bad as sleep deprivation for staying alert. This means that when you feel yourself getting drowsy, switch tasks to something more difficult that requires greater concentration.

, Low blood sugar can make you super groggy and sleepy and foggy, so you'll need to keep your energy level up with healthy snacks. You especially want to eat snacks that will give you more energy to burn for a longer period of time.Eat things like yogurt and granola with fresh fruit, or peanut butter on a whole wheat cracker and celery. You'll want protein, healthy carbs (like oats), and lots of fruits and veggies.
Avoid sugar. While sugar can give you an immediate burst of energy, it very quickly wears off, leaving you more fatigued and foggy than you were before.

, Light stimulation to your eyes slows your biological clock. These lights hitting your receptors will delay your circadian rhythm, changing your biological clock to restart later and later. Be careful, as this may lead to a prolonged change in your sleeping schedule.

Stay up to date with your homework.,
Research class topics beforehand.,
Pack your bags the night before.,
Get enough sleep.Although many of us are happy to go without sleep in order to cram for the next big exam, coming short on sleep is akin to shooting yourself in the foot.,
Eat a proper breakfast.Much like sleep, your body needs its food to stay in tip-top shape.,
Leave for school early.,
Limit your caffeine.Coffee is a great way to get started in the morning.,
Be punctual to your classes.,
Strike up conversation with classmates.,

Keep your eyes off the clock.,
Maintain a positive attitude.A positive attitude helps in every part of life.,
Question your negative thoughts.if you are prone to self-doubt and depression, you should make a point of questioning all the negative thoughts that enter your mind.,
Consider getting medication.Medication is available if you're having a really bad time with your nervousness and need a bit of an edge up.,
Take a moment to relax.Every once in a while, the anxiety might get to be so much that you can't bear to do work or be around people.,
Remember that school-based anxiety is normal.",How to Stop Being Nervous About Each School Day," One of the most preventable ways to avoid being nervous at school is by staying up to date with your homework. Depending on whether you're going to elementary school, high school or university, you may get a lot or a little bit of homework to wade through each night. It's important to get this work done as soon as possible. If you leave it off, you'll pay for it in stress the next day. It's recommended you finish your homework as soon as you get home. That way, you can relax for the rest of the night without having to worry about anything.


Make a habit of regularly studying the course material on your own time. Pop quizzes are a big source of stress for some people. If you have confidence in your understanding of the material, you'll have no reason to fear tests or quizzes.
Procrastination is a primary cause of nervousness and anxiety.The longer you procrastinate something, the more daunting a task it ends up seeming like.;
, If you find your class goes too fast for you to comfortably keep up, it's a handy trick to look into the class subject the night or morning before you head to school. Most post-secondary courses will have a syllabus you can check from week to week. You can always ask your teacher what the next days' subjects will be in advance. By Google searching the subject or reading up on it via Wikipedia, you'll be a step ahead of the rest and better able to relax.

, For a lot of people, school stress occurs well before they get to the school itself. Rushing out the door in the morning is enough to get anyone's blood boiling. Pack your backpack the night before and leave it by the door. That way, you'll be able to take it a bit easier in the morning. That way, when you get to school, you'll feel refreshed instead of stressed out from the way the day started.


Alternatively, waking up ten minutes early can make all the difference for your morning.

, Sleep deprivation is closely linked to irritability and depression. If you feel you're being stretched too thin, it's possible that you're not getting enough sleep to properly rejuvenate your body. Try to go to bed at a time that will give you time to sleep the full amount you need and still have time left over to get ready in the morning.


Kids and teenagers generally need 9 hours of sleep per day, while adults suffice with 8., Even if your school day goes by amazingly, you're not likely to feel very good if you're on an empty stomach. Breakfast is a necessary part of giving your body energy for the day. You should aim for a healthy, well-rounded meal. Sugary cereals will risk a sugar crash later on in the day.


Oatmeal, eggs and whole grain cereal are good bets for breakfast.

, If you find yourself rushed in the morning, it's going to stress you out before you even get to school. Although no one likes being at school longer than they need to be, leaving 5-10 minutes earlier than you regularly would will give you time to relax before cracking open the textbooks.


Take a look at your transport options. Getting a ride or driving is obviously best. Instead of taking the bus or walking, consider organizing some sort of carpool.

, However, having too much of it can cause bad anxiety and irritability. The amount you should limit yourself to depends on your age and size. Teens should stick with 1-2 cups of coffee in the morning, while pre-teens should do without it completely., If you're already at school, being late for classes is usually totally preventable. Whether between classes or during lunch break, try to keep yourself aware of the time. Having to rush to classes or come in late will bring a lot of unnecessary stress into the equation. If you're new to the school, you should try to figure out approximately how long it takes to get you from one place to another.


If for whatever reason you are late, you should make a point of apologizing to the teacher and asking him for anything you might have missed. This will help minimize the fallout from the lateness.

, School can be made a thousand times more enjoyable if you have a group of friends to spend the time with. Even if you don't have friends at your school, striking up a conversation with a classmate sitting next to you can be great. The vast majority of people in your classes would probably love the chance to have a conversation with someone new.


Of course, this can be easier said than done for someone if they're typically shy. Because nervousness and stress can be a root cause of social anxiety, you may find it's a good idea to eliminate other stressors so that you feel more confident with others.
Remember-- a smile and pleasant eye contact can say just as much as a ""Hello"".

, The lunch break is probably the only time during the school day where you have a lot of freedom to do what you want. You should take the opportunity to do something productive and worthwhile. If you're nervous it may seem like a good idea to hide yourself away. Unfortunately, unless you really feel like you need the rest, the idle time will probably just intensify your feelings of anxiety. Whether it's attending a school club or going for a run around the track, you want to keep yourself in action.


Don't stray too far from your school, and follow the teacher's rules if you're in elementary school. Lunch hour may feel like a long time, but it disappears fast if you're travelling.

, This is an easy trap to fall into if you're naturally shy. Luckily however, there should be lots of things going on at your school that you could join to fit in. If there's a soccer tryout and you like sports, you could stand to make a lot of lifelong friends by joining.

, Teachers aren't just there to give out information. They're there as an authority figure away from home, to help to shape you into the adult you'll become. Many schools have on-call counsellors, which can be a great deal of help if you're going through some emotional issues.


It will probably feel weird opening up about your feelings to an adult. Fortunately, there's nothing they haven't heard before, and will have your best interests and well-being at heart.

, A lot of anxiety is tied to the perception of time.It's common knowledge that the mind perceives time more slowly if you're constantly aware of it. Even if the school day is dragging on, you should do what you can to make the most of your experience there. Even if you're in detention, there are always things you can do to enrich your experience.


If you want, you can use time-checking as a little reward to keep you productive throughout the day. For instance, if you're in the middle of working on a big essay, you should tell yourself you'll check the clock after every page.

, Although this isn't done overnight, it's a slow process of choosing the positive in every thing and situation. For instance, if you're worried that you don't know anyone at the school you're going to, try to interpret it as a chance to make a bunch of new friends instead. It's difficult, but it is possible.

, Challenging these nasty thoughts and reminding yourself that they only have as much power as you give them can make all the difference in a struggle with depression or nervousness.


Learn to distinguish irrational thoughts from real concerns. Real concerns are anything that has a real solution. Irrational fears should be ignored. Even though they might try to get you to cave, it's in your power to turn a deaf ear to your darker side. A real concern may be an upcoming exam for a course you're struggling with, to which the solution would be to study for it. On the other hand, an irrational fear would be something along the lines of ""Everyone hates me. I will never make friends."" Even if you sincerely believe a statement like this, there is no way you could ever know the way so many people feel. It is not a problem with clear evidence or a specific solution, and so it should be dismissed as irrational.

, Go see your doctor and list out the symptoms and severity of your anxiety. From there, he should be able to offer a medication that's specialized to your needs.


Medications affect different people differently. Just because one doesn't work doesn't mean another won't succeed. You may need to try out a few medications before you find one that really fits.
SSRIs and other anti-depressants are taken daily and will help your brain produce serotonin and dopamine over time.
Anti-anxiety medication like Ativan is fast-acting, and generally used to combat a growing anxiety attack.

, Sometimes taking a minute or two to yourself outside can make all the difference. If you find somewhere quiet to recollect yourself, you'll be able to compose yourself without having to worry about people looking at you.


Remember to ask your teacher for permission to leave if you're currently in a class.

, Even though other people may seem to be having an easier time adjusting to the school environment, it doesn't mean that other people aren't feeling the same things you are. Understanding that what you're going through is totally okay is an important step in getting through it. Don't let yourself think that you're the odd one out in this situation. Going to school offers plenty of opportunities. All you have to do is go out and grab them.

, Don't choose anything too wild or inappropriate, but that doesn't mean you have to dress in all black or something. If your shadow buddy told you any clothing restrictions, make sure to keep those in mind. Also, if you have PE, wear a PE friendly outfit. Lastly, check with your parents about your outfit to make sure they approve.

, Become acquainted with the admissions staff present, then get to know your fellow shadows.

, When your shadow buddy picks you up, be polite and tell a little about yourself, then learn a little about him/her.


If your shadow buddy introduces you to anyone, be polite. You don't need to become BFFs, but a little kindness goes a long way.

, Say hi to the teacher, and do what you would do at any class at your current school. You can feel free to raise your hand when you know something and participate. #*Remember: You are judging the school, not the other way around. However, noticeably rude or impolite behavior could be remembered and reported to admissions.

, Some schools will bring you into the admissions office for an interview. During an interview the tables turn and you are being judged. Respond candidly to questions and don't interrupt. Try to relax and be yourself.

, Compare it to any other schools you've looked at. If you can picture yourself happy there, chances are it might be your school. It might take some time to decide whether or not to apply. You will probably be at this school for a while, so there is no need to be hasty.

, You have to know every nook and cranny. Later in your time in school you may get access to keys. Use this opportunity to check which doors they open, and if necessary, make a map. This would be very useful if you attend a huge school.

, This tells you where each teacher is all day, every day. This is useful because when teachers have free classes/periods they have a habit of wandering around the school, putting a dent in you trying to do your own thing.

, Though some believe this is a skit of blagging, in real life almost everything he does in that film is possible.

, If you're not into sports, volunteer to help in the school-library, computer lab or help with the newsletter. These are relatively simple jobs and can gain you access to much needed materials for Ruling The School.

,, You could hang out in the library all day, every day just chatting and playing games on the net. If there is no such place in your school don't be tempted to mitch/skive/ditch school (explained later), as this is really pointless unless you have something to do.

Consider confronting the bully if you feel brave enough and know for sure that the bully is taking your stuff.,
Remember that it's never your fault.",How to Stop Bullies From Taking Your Stuff at School," You may think that you can remember the items that have gone missing, but it is easy to forget so be sure to perform this step as quickly as possible. Make it as detailed as possible; include the dates and times when you noticed your missing items.;
, That way, the teachers can't tell you off for 'losing' your items without labelling them. If items are lost, they will be found quickly. If items are stolen, they will not be found at all or not as quickly.

, If you wait for a few days or even one day the bully will take your stuff home with them or destroy them and your items will never be recovered. You don't need to make a big deal out of it, just tell the teacher that your stuff has gone missing but make it clear that you haven't lost it. All you need to say is something like ""Mr/Mrs Example, my pen has disappeared from my desk and I can't find it anywhere.""


Remember, the longer you leave it, the harder it will be to find your stuff or even implicate the bully. The teacher will also be more hard on you for not telling them sooner.

, Show them the list and give them enough evidence to prove that you are not just losing your items. Ask them for help and they may go to the headmaster/ headmistress of your school, or perhaps just your teacher. If they are convinced that you are only losing your stuff, you have more work to do to gather evidence or evaluate yourself whether they are really just lost.

, Make a mental note of when you remove your items from your desk or locker and make sure that it is all there when you return your items. Return to your desk or locker as soon as possible to make sure that nothing is missing after break times and/or lessons. Once or twice a week you could spend a few minutes watching your desk or locker in a place where no-one can see you; especially when you know the bully comes back from break or comes to the classroom or cloakroom at school.

, You're going to have to concentrate a lot on where you put your stuff and make a mental note if you put it down somewhere. Carelessness is not an option at this point- it is the only way in which you can expose the bully without any evidence suggesting that you're just losing your stuff.

, Find out from other people whether they have seen the bully removing stuff from the place where you keep it. Don't ask them if you know that they're close to the bully, because they'll just lie and then tell the bully that you asked. The bully will then work extra hard to be horrible to you and then steal more of your stuff, because that's just what bullies do. Put the people's names on your list who gave you valuable evidence with what they said or you could tell them to accompany you to your headmaster/headmistress with that evidence.

, You may find that when the bully is being really horrible to you soon after an item goes missing. Include this on your list. You need to include every important detail and how they are being mean to you to create a really honest and believable account.

, Consider leaving a new lock on your locker or a post-it note explaining to the bully that if your stuff continues to go missing, you will go to the headmaster/headmistress.

, If the bully starts denying it in a dishonest fashion and/or insults you, just walk away. The bully will most likely take one of your items after this if this confrontation provokes them, so this is a good time to collect evidence.

, It is the bully's fault for stealing your stuff. Always make completely sure that the bully is taking your items before you go to a teacher though.

Try to relax before the exam.",How to Revise for AQA English Literature Successfully at GCSE," Ask your teachers which texts you will be studying well in advance. This will allow you to start reading and becoming familiar with the texts before you study them in school. That way, you'll already understand what's going on and can get as much as possible out of them when they are taught in class.;
, The specification is always useful when it comes to grasping what examiners want to see in your answers. Targeting your answers to the points raised here will help you focus on the assessment objectives so that you can get as good a score as possible on each question. This is especially useful when making your notes so you can pay attention to matching the notes up with the assessment objectives. Then you can tailor your revision to the specific kinds of questions that will be asked and the bits of information you'll need to know.

, For each text you will be studying, jot down notes on context and background, like the name of the author and when the text was written. Think about how this context might affect your reading of the text itself. When writing your answers, you can get marks for identifying context and noticing how it shapes meaning.

, Jot down a quick summary of each chapter of a novel or after each poem that you read. This will ensure that you understand and absorb what you're reading, as well as making it easier to go back and remind yourself of details about the texts later. This can also help you quickly remember the chapter you should reference so as not to waste time when in the exam.

, This will help you identify and quickly reference the most important aspects. Color-coordinate your highlighting to make quickly flipping through your notes even easier. For example, use different colors for different literary devices: yellow for metaphor, pink for tone, green for historical details. This is particularly useful if you are a visual learner.

, During your lessons when you analyse poems, write down as many notes as possible! Your own notes should be done separately and in your own time to show examiners your individual opinions and interpretations. Remember that with English, there is no right or wrong answer, so your personal interpretations are valid as long as you can back them up with evidence.

, In AQA, the ‘unseen poetry’ section is one of the most daunting parts of the exam. Prepare for this by practicing analyzing new poems as much as possible. Have a teacher, parent, or someone else pick a wide range of poems for you to practice on, choosing poems you haven't read or studied before. For each poem, sit down in a controlled environment and write an analysis, just like you will when taking the test. After each analysis, go over each poem with a teacher to discuss what you did well and what you should improve on. Do this as much as possible to get good at analysing new poems so that you can ace this section on the test.

, While taking notes on the texts you're studying, have a look at sites such as Spark Notes, York Notes, and BBC Bitesize. These sites can offer new information or alternate interpretations that will improve and expand your notes. Also discuss each text with a teacher or friend to get another perspective and answer questions you may have.

, Start organizing your notes and putting them into flash cards. Separate the flash cards into language, structure, theme, form, and context, and jot down the most important points and quotes incorporating all your sources, including websites, personal interpretations, and your teacher's and classmates' interpretations. Read over these as many times as you can.

, A few months before your exam; make sure that you understand all the poems and novels. A way to check this is to teach your family, friends or classmates about the texts without referring to your notes. If you can successfully do this from memory, you can be confident that you know the texts inside out.

, Beginning well before your exam, attempt as many exam papers as possible. You can find old exam questions and practice questions on the exam board websites under the subject. Show your practice papers to your teacher and perhaps organize a one-on-one session with them to go through the paper and get feedback. Consider this feedback and use it to help you with your next practice question. If you have run out of questions, you can always ask the teacher to give you some more that you can practice.

, Starting revision early will mean there is no need to cram in last minute revision. Make sure you are conscious of the time in the exam. When reading the question, know the points you want to address. Remember from all the preparation you have done for the exam, you have all the knowledge and necessary skills to do well.

If your teacher is giving a class-long lecture, the time will go faster if you’re transcribing notes. If you’re sitting in your seat and simply staring blankly ahead, you’ll be more bored and more likely to fall asleep.If taking notes is still incredibly boring, switch up your note-taking process. Switch from cursive, to all uppercase, to all lowercase, to bullet points, to bubble letters. Play around with your handwriting or the style simply to keep yourself busy and entertained.
Not only will you keep your mind focused and help the time go more quickly, you will have notes to refer to before tests and your grades will thank you!;
, It's easy to lose focus if you feel completely confused about the subject matter, but asking questions for clarification can help you in many aspects.Ask your teacher to explain it in a way that you can understand, and really try to get a handle on the difficult material you're struggling with. If you understand what your teacher is talking about, you can actually absorb the information and keep your mind occupied.

, You’re stuck in class anyways, so why not get involved? You certainly won’t fall asleep while your teacher is talking directly to you. If it’s a large class, the adrenaline rush from being the center of attention is sure to jolt your energy. If your teacher is rambling on about a famous author, ask them about that author's life story. If you're learning a simple technique in math, challenge your teacher with hard sample problems. A boring class can be much more fun if you're keeping your teacher on their toes!

, No matter what the topic is, challenge yourself to find something that sparks your interest. If you're learning about a historical event, imagine the modern day equivalent, as if it were occurring on a current day reality show. If you're learning about the scientific process, make up funny experiments that you could use to solve every day things you're curious about. Whatever you're learning, just try to make it fun!

, Try to write down all of the lyrics to a song you’re really loving right now. If you’ve seen a movie over and over again, try to write down all the words from a particular scene. Make a list of all the countries you want to visit, all the presents you need to buy for Christmas, or every thing you want to accomplish before you die. It doesn’t matter what kind of challenge you give yourself, just keep yourself focused and writing.To the teacher or professor, you’ll look like you’re hard at work taking notes or doing homework. It’s a discreet and effective way to pass the time without looking like you’re completely slacking.

, There are certain spots on your body that you can rub or press to help keep you alert. Try gently massaging your temples or ear lobes, the back of your neck at the base of your skull, or the inside of your wrist. Apply pressure for three to five seconds, moving your hand in little circular movements, and see what works for you., Draw a picture, sketch some flowers, or write your name in bubble letters. Anything is better than sitting at your desk doing nothing. Don’t worry if you aren’t an artist– this is not about creating a masterpiece. Instead, just have fun filling your notebook with doodles so that your mind is focused on something., Instead of napping through class, try to get some work done. This will help free up your afternoons, and it’ll keep you busy through a boring class. If you can’t get anything done at your desk, make a to-do list of everything you need to do afterwards. You’ll be prepared and ready to take off running as soon as you’re dismissed.

, Does he or she do something repeatedly? Maybe they say a similar word or phrase over and over again. Maybe they always flick their hair in the same way, motion with their hands when they get excited, or tap their foot when reading aloud. Pay close attention to see these funny little habits, and start counting. Not only will you pass the time by keeping your eyes and ears tuned into your teacher, but it can be comical to see how many times they say or do the same thing.

, Good luck keeping your eyes open for the entire class if you arrive exhausted. Sleep deprivation and a boring class are a recipe to end up face down on your desk, drooling. Grab a coffee or an energy drink before you take your seat, and the caffeine jolt will help keep you alert through the entire thing.If you aren’t allowed to bring drinks to class, make sure you’ve polished off your beverage before getting there.

, If you're completely lost and confused in class, it's easy to get bored and let your mind wander. Instead, read ahead before you get there. You can even prepare questions or comments in advance, so that you stay engaged and focused the whole time. Coming to class with knowledge and curiosity will not only keep you motivated during an otherwise boring class, but it will also earn you brownie points with your teacher.

, This, of course, only works if you’re allowed to choose your seat. When you sit in the front row, you’ll be smack dab in the center of the action, and it will be easier to stay attentive. Back rows and window seats are tailor-made for day dreaming or snoozing., Not only does hunger make boredom even worse, but chewing is proven to keep the brain engaged and alert. Keep things like almonds, snack bars, or crackers in your bag to munch on when you’re stuck in a dull lesson.Don’t be that student who brings a smelly egg salad sandwich or noisy bag of crunchy chips to class. Make sure your class doesn’t have a strong smell and can be chewed quietly.

, Again, there is nothing worse than rolling into class feeling like you could fall asleep before you even take a seat. Make sure that you’re getting plenty of sleep the night before super boring classes.If your body is used to going to bed at midnight, you’ll need to train your body to start falling asleep at an earlier hour.


If midnight is your typical bedtime, push it back to 11:30. Stick to that for a bit, and then push it back to 11:00, then 10:00, and so on until you’re falling asleep at a reasonable time.

Put all your books for A day in the A day backpack and you B day books in the B day backpack. Your backpacks should be big enough for all your books plus extra room for things like gym clothes and such.;
, If you need a Calculator for your A day math class be sure to keep one in your A day backpack. If you need colored pencils for both your A day History class and you B day Biology class it's better to get two sets of colored pencils for each bag. This ensures you'll have what you need.

, A three ring binder is perfect for picking up stray papers. Use tabbed dividers for each of your classes. You could also make a Returned work tab for each class and a notes tab to keep your notes separate from your work. Get a zipper bag that fits in your binder. Ones with three ring hole punch on the side are very helpful. Be sure your zipper bag is stocked with pens, pencils, and everything else you might need. Also put a full package of paper behind a paper tab in your binders so you always have some. Clearly mark your A day Binder from your B day binder. You don't want to get those Mixed up.

, Get a notebook to act as a planner. A large spiral bound with a two sided pocket works best. On the pocket label one side A day and one side B day. Put worksheets and homework in these pockets when you get them. Each day date a top of a paper and mark it as an A day or B day. List your first class and write down you agenda (most teachers have agenda's written on the board) If you are reminded of an upcoming test or quiz write a Reminders: section and put the date and what it's over. Box this so it stands out on the page. In your last class make a homework (HWK) section. List all the homework you got that day in order. (Only put things on this list that are due the next class period so you don't get short term assignments mixed up with long term assignments.)

, A large wipe board calendar is best for noting upcoming project dates, events, holidays, tests, and deadlines. Hang your board in a very visible place so you don't forget to check it often.

, It should be hung near your Calendar Board. Use magnets to keep Forms, to-do lists, flyers, and other important long term papers in one place. You can also write reminders on your board like 'Library books due Friday'.

, Junk what you don't. Some people will suggest keeping a notebook or a three ringed binder for each class but all you're left with is a bunch of barely used binders. Some classes (like Biology or Math) will require their own Notebook or Three ringed binder while others (Like Health or German) will make do with a folder or a tab in your big binder. Many teachers will require a notebook or binder but don't feel obliged to use that. Tailor your supplies to your needs.

, Some people can come home form school and get started on their homework right away. But most people can't. If you can't make a Set time each night to start your homework. Like after you eat dinner or 6:00.

, One advantage of having both A day work sheets and B day worksheet in your planner pocket is if you have free time in an A day class you can finish up your B day Homework (Assuming you don't need a book or something). This cuts down on homework you'll have to do at home. Most teachers give you ten minutes free time before the bell ending class. Use this time to finish your work or work on other class work. You'll be amazed with how much less homework you have at the end of the day.

, Lay out your clothes and backpack the night before. Be sure you know whether you're taking your A day backpack or your B day backpack.Keep a regular sleep schedule. Some people are able to wake up without any alarms because they go to sleep at the same time every day. Set up a morning routine and perfect it until you can be ready ten minutes flat just in case you wake up late one day.

Ask a classmate for help.",How to React when You Feel Faint During a Dissection," If you begin to feel feel faint, remove yourself from the area where the dissection is taking place. If just the sight of the specimen is making you feel faint, then turn away from it. If the smell of the specimen is making you feel faint, then remove yourself from the classroom. You may even be able to ask to visit your school nurse or health center to lie down.


Signs that you may feel as though you are about to faint include: pale, cool, and sweaty skin; lightheadedness or dizziness; nausea; frequent yawning; tightness of the chest; and palpitations.Specimens used for dissection are often preserved in chemicals that give off a powerful smell. The specimen may also have its own natural odors that can be too strong for your nostrils to handle.Wearing a surgical mask during the dissection is not only a safety precaution to practice while performing the dissection; it could also prevent you from smelling the powerful chemical smells which could contribute to your feeling of wanting to faint.;
, If you begin to feel unsteady or lightheaded, lie down.While lying down, try to place your head low and your legs raised in an upward position.If you are unable to lie down, sit down. While seated, place your head between your knees, Once you have taken a moment to lie down or sit down, go outside to get some fresh air.Take the time outside to do some deep and heavy breathing to help your body calm down and return to its normal state.

, After you’ve had your near faint episode, take a moment and calm down. Understandably, you may be experiencing feelings of embarrassment and shame about nearly fainting in class. Don’t be. Everyone has his or her own sensitivities to particular things. It’s a natural response that you are not in control of and should not be ashamed of. Take several breaths to calm yourself down and ease the anxiousness that your are currently experiencing.For example, some people get queasy and want to faint at the sight of blood. This too is a natural response that their bodies have. Again, no need to get embarrassed.

, Oftentimes, we may want to avoid our awkward moments but the best way to handle the situation is to confront it. After you have calmed your body down, head back to class to either finish up the dissection project or ask to do an alternative assignment.One of the best ways to confront an embarrassing situation is to do so with humor. When you return to class, just saying something like, “Well, that was awkward” has the potential to ease the awkwardness and tension in the room., Once you’ve returned to the classroom and had a time to collect yourself, don’t dwell on what happened. Instead, focus on tackling that dissection with all your might (not too much strength, those specimens can be fragile). Arm yourself with a new attitude that you can and will do it.If you absolutely cannot do the dissection because it is making you too ill, don’t attempt to do the dissection. There are other assignments you could do to make up for not being able to dissect the specimen.

, When you return to your class, speak with your teacher about your episode. Let them know you felt uneasy about dissecting the specimen, but you are back and willing to participate in the activity.


If the teacher observed your episode in class, you probably won’t need to go into an elaborate detailed explanation of what you’re feeling. You could say, “Mrs. Jones, I felt a little weird when I first encountered the specimen, but after lying down and getting some fresh air, I feel much better. I am ready to get back to the assignment if you allow me to finish working.”
If you feel like you will not be able to recover or are unable to get past the feeling of uneasiness to the point of fainting, inform your teacher. You are most likely not the first nor will you be the last person to not be able to handle a dissection. They should have alternative assignments or activities that will allow you to experience and learn the lesson of dissection without having to go through the physical act of doing so., If you are comfortable, let your classmates know that weren’t feeling well and felt like you wanted to faint from the activity. Let them know you are okay as many of them would probably be worried and excited from all the commotion. Just let them know you had a minor episode but that you are feeling much better.


Try saying, “Hey guys, thanks so much for asking about it. The dissection just caused me to feel a little faint, but I got some fresh air and I am feeling much better.”
If you do not feel comfortable with announcing to your classmates about what happened, you don’t have to. You may still feel embarrassed about the situation and that’s okay. It’s okay to not want to share that information with others, and letting your teacher know is the more important thing to do.

, If you are working in a pair with another student, ask your partner if they would be willing to do the dissection while you take on the note-taking role. Most of your classmates will understand your issue and would be more than willing to help you as you try to make the experience as comfortable as possible.


If you are not working in a pair, ask your teacher if they would allow you to just look on as an observer as another student does the dissection. Offer to get that student their necessary supplies and to take notes for them as they handle the activity.
You could say something like, “Hey Susan, this dissection is causing me to feel a bit dizzy, like I want to faint. Would you mind if I just watched you do the dissection while I take notes for us? Ok, great. Thanks so much for understanding.”

, Some schools do not allow containers, unless the material is see-through.

, Most of these items have overlapping functions with other parts of the kit. Except for Batteries, you don't need to duplicate items with differing functions (like snacks). Each of these functions may be called a ""kit"".


A Small First-aid kit. (Not the kind you buy in stores)

This includes self-adhesive bandages, topical antiseptics, prescription drugs, analgesics (aspirin, Tylenol, or ibuprofen). Note: Many schools have regulations against students using these products! Never give them to friends! Your school may overlook your personal use, but will always harshly punish those who give them to friends! A note (from one of your parents) should state that you have permission to take the analgesic at your own discretion. A maximum of two doses of one type of analgesic should be in your container This is the best defense to suggestions that you gave any out.


An Air Conditioner/Heater Malfunction kit should be considered if your school is older or often has A/C or heater problems.

This kit may include (depending on climate): a small (3 inch max.) battery operated fan (with enough batteries to last the day), an empty water bottle ( “empty” to avoid leaks in your locker), an emergency blanket, mittens, etc.


An Extended Day kit should be considered if you live in an area where the weather might require school officials to hold you at school until it is safe to leave.

An extended day kit could include extra snacks, a travel pillow, a deck of cards or something else to keep you occupied, and an emergency blanket (if severe blizzards are a threat).


A Power Outage kit should be considered if you are attending school in a building with few (or no) windows.

A power outage kit should include two small LED flashlights (two because your teacher will probably want to borrow one),a book light, snacks(in case the cafeteria is unable to function).


A Female kit (Girls Only) will contain extra products for that time of the month.

A female kit may contain pads, tampons, and a change of clothing. Cosmetics and hairbrushes are optional items.


An Emergency School Supply kit should be the supplies you go to only after exhausting your everyday supply.

You may loan supplies (Pens, pencils, paper) from your everyday supplies, but never from your emergency school supplies. They are your ""Last Resort"".



,


This is not a ""survival"" kit. You only need to store one day's worth of items. For example, four or five adhesive bandages (various sizes) should suffice; a box of bandages would be too much. Remember, you locker space is limited.

,


A plastic or cardboard box that fits at the bottom of your locker is ideal. Your ""Everyday"" items could still fit on top of your kit.

,


Keep a small quantity of such items in your emergency container, so you won't run out. For example, you like eating snacks. You keep a quantity that is easy to reach. Put some in the emergency kit (which is often covered with books) so you will have them when the need arises.

,,


If you are using a clear plastic box, tape it under the lid. If you are using a cardboard (or non-see-through plastic), tape the list to the top of the box; place a copy of the list inside the box.

Look at what needs to be changed in your lifestyle.,
Work your plan.",How to Plan For a Successful Future," At the end of it all, you are planning for a successful future for yourself, which means you need to first get into the mindset of thinking about and for yourself.


Thinking about a successful future is a necessity that should be done without any distractions or interruptions. Being in a quiet place will also help you think on your own as no other people will have little to zero influence on decisions you feel comfortable with. It is your life that you’re thinking about, so staying focused in this moment of thinking, will be of benefit later when you need to stay focused on the actual acts to be successful.
To spend time on your own shouldn’t be discouraged. Before taking action for a better future for yourself, you need some clarity on what it is you exactly want. Ask yourself questions pertaining to what it is that you want, and not what others want for you.;
, Is the life you see for yourself one where you aren’t living for others? Why do you want a change? What could be a manageable change that can be made pretty much immediately? Asking questions like these can help you get to know yourself better and they also get you to rationalize your thoughts, instead of blindly dreaming. The more difficult the questions are to answer, the more likely they are to be most important ones.

, This will assimilate into your mind and help you to persevere towards your dream. Dwelling on things past is a hindrance when you attempt to move forward. Being successful is all about going forward, developing, and letting things go to make it all possible.


Letting go of the past will make you more present with yourself. You may feel like you’re moving forward, but if you’re mentally stuck elsewhere, then your mind is unable to sort out what is currently happening and what needs to happen. What happened has happened, and what needs to happen should be thought about now.
Thinking about what you did can lead you to think about failures. This can discourage you, and can make you start thinking about your self-worth in a bad light. Instead, take failures as lessons on what not to do so you don’t repeat mistakes.
Moving on will help you live with what you’ve done (good or bad). There’s no way to succeed in the future if you don’t accomplish putting mistakes and other failures behind you. Doing this can make you put all of your energy towards reaching your dream, so that nothing is wasted in things that can no longer be dealt with.

, A passion will fuel confidence and create excitement on your path to succeed.


Think about what you can turn into work that doesn’t necessarily feel like work. Passion and success are highly intertwined. It is the one thing that can give you that natural enthusiasm and set you on a trajectory to happiness and success.
Don’t be shy to go all the way with what excites you. If something does this for you, then it is a sure sign that it is your passion. It’s something that you are comfortable doing because it simply makes you feel good about yourself, and what you’re capable of.
If you’re having troubles finding out what your passion is, look for patterns in what you’ve done. Perhaps a hobby you’ve been doing can be made into a career? Or maybe past work experiences emanate something about you as a person. For example, volunteer experience usually speaks to what a person cares about and is willing to go the extra mile for it.

, This will allow you to continuously work to get what you want in life. Confidence and passion work in tandem to better your chances of succeeding through the thing you love to do most.When you’re enthusiastic and proud of what you can do or create, you are better equipped to counter any impending obstacles. Because there was an initial excitement felt, you’ll be more inclined to do the things necessary to keep the feeling there.
Others will notice your confidence. It's one thing to turn a passion into work, but when you emanate a pride that is unique to you and your work, others might see this and offer you great opportunities.
It will make you feel that you are worth it. You may have failed at some things in your past, but once you find that one thing to start feeling proud of, then you’ll in turn have a better sense of whom you are and the direction you want your life to go in.

, When you’ve found your passion it should heavily make gut feelings clearer to act upon. You’ll have a natural instinct to work with your passion, and not against it. After all, a passion makes you feel good and confident about yourself and anything that can diminish these needs to be avoided effects.It’s one of our primal instincts to trust out guts. It’s the purest and most individual thing we have that is hard to sway by what others have to say. Think of it seriously, and how it can benefit you to be successful.

, This can also help you see how much you are diverging away from your original plan (as you will most likely do), but don’t be afraid if you are. Most of the people who have achieved their dreams took the first steps by writing in a journal.Having things laid out before your eyes on paper can put things into perspective. If this is in a list format, then you can see whether or not you are taking on too much that can tire you out before you even reach your goals. Sometimes we dream bigger than reality. This isn’t a bad thing, but it is important to keep in mind what you are mentally capable of handling realistically.
Set benchmarks. When you’ve seen that you’ve done a lot of what is in your journal (or wherever you’re writing), then group it as a small success. This is also a great way of keeping track of how long it takes you to complete things. Don’t shy away from adjusting the goals as it may help you succeed in what you want to do in a more manageable timeline.
It’s a way to celebrate! Checking things off lists are sure signs that you are on the right track to what you want. Take these small wins, and make time to celebrate how far you’ve in making that small dream you had reality.

,


By having a visual, tangible reminder will help you remember that what you are doing is important enough to be constantly referring back to.
Seeing this journal everyday will also keep you on the right track. It will help you steer away from distractions that can prevent you from reaching benchmarks, and other small successes.
It doesn’t hurt to be reminded of promises you’ve made to yourself. Writing things down and seeing them on a daily basis, will make them hard to forget. Since you wrote them down, it’s hard to ignore the fact that these were steps you set for yourself to succeed.

, By saving this you’ll also have the funds to dip in to for the little things that will help you in the grander schemes of things. For example: a car, new places to live are purchases that all count towards you being successful. Whether it be buying necessary supplies or taking small classes for career preparation, every little step counts towards the bigger ones to success.

, Your habits and current way of living and other minute details should be scrutinized to see if they are of any real benefit to you.


Cut out any unnecessary spending can make a huge difference. By having that extra cash on hand because you choose not to buy materialistic things, will help you in the long run. It all boils down to you learning how to spend wiser!. It may mean adjusting a lot of things in your life, but it will be worth it one day.
Research where you are going. If what you want to succeed in requires an education, then you should consider taking some classes so you are prepared (saved money can really help with this, as an education can be very expensive).
Look at the people you surround yourself with. Who you are around can either distract you from what you need to do for yourself, or they can be a great support system. This doesn’t mean you have to necessarily cut out people who are holding you back, but just keep in mind how much time you are spending with who.

, Put it into action by following your predetermined plan when you wrote in your journal. Try to stick as closely to it as possible, yet leave room for change.Don’t wait too long to start putting your plan in to action! Whether it be starting school, or going out looking for experience, you should be on top of opportunities and put yourself out there. The longer you wait, the more difficult it may be to start.
Be flexible. Remember that the plan you make isn’t a concrete one. Life isn’t like what it is you write on paper when it comes to planning your future. Think of your plan as a skeleton, and you need to work with what you are given to build upon it, rather than trying to do everything your way, how you want it.
Keep dreaming. As hard as you work to get where you want, it doesn’t hurt to keep dreaming of more things to do and achieve. Keep your plan ever-growing (but flexible), have fun finding your way to success.

This may help ensure that you don’t experience any flare-ups during class or another inconvenient time. Give yourself the time you need in the bathroom. If you’re late for class, explain to your teacher that you’re sick and have to use the bathroom more frequently.


Let your teacher know why you’re late. Ask your teacher if you can talk to outside of the classroom if you are embarrassed. Remember that teachers are there to help you and letting your instructor know what’s going on can prevent further uncomfortable situations. For example, you could say, “Mr. Newman, could I please speak to you outside about something important?” Once you get out of the classroom, tell the teacher, “I’m very sorry, but I’m having terrible problems with my stomach today. I may need to get up and use the bathroom during class.”
Put your own health first. If you're having trouble communicating with your teacher or are not receiving the help you need, do not hesitate to put your own wellness first. Do what you need to do in order to manage your diarrhea. You should minimize disrupting your classroom and school environment, but your health should be your first priority.;
, If you have to go to the bathroom often, let your teacher know what’s going on and ask if you can sit next to the door. This allows you to slip out if you feel ill without disrupting the class or drawing attention to yourself.


Consider asking to sit on the floor next to the door if necessary. If anyone asks, you can easily say “my back is killing me today and sitting on those chairs makes it worse.”
Avoid making a commotion if you do leave. Get up as gently as possible and quietly open the door to avoid drawing attention to yourself.
Use the bathroom during breaks, even if you don't think you have to go. These preventative trips to the bathroom might prevent you from rushing to go in the future.

, If you have severe diarrhea, you might consider wearing disposable underwear designed for bowel incontinence. These can catch any accidents and prevent odor you might have without exposing them to people around you.They may also give you some peace of mind, which can help with bowel issues.You can get full padded briefs, protective underwear, and/or belted undergarments. Choose the undergarment that you like the best, think is the most comfortable, and is the easiest for you to use.

, Before you leave in the morning, pack an extra set of underwear and pants in case of an emergency. This may also help relieve any anxiety you feel about having an accident. If you get diarrhea while you’re at school, ask the school nurse if she has a spare set of clothing or call your parents to see if they can bring you new garments.Cover the back of your trousers with your book bag or shirt until you can get to a bathroom or the nurse’s office to change.
Bring identical clothing if you can. For example, if you’re wearing jeans, have another pair handy. If anyone asks, you can say “I ate too much at lunch and my other jeans were uncomfortably tight.”
Tell anyone who asks you why you changed your clothes that you’re trying out different outfits during the day.

, It’s easy to feel ashamed or embarrassed if you’re experiencing diarrhea in a public place like school. But it’s important to remember that everyone poops and most people will also have diarrhea at some point in their lives. Keeping these facts in mind may help to calm you and feel less self-conscious about your diarrhea.Allow yourself to use the bathroom without experiencing any embarrassment. Holding in a bowel movement can be uncomfortable and may harm you. If you need, use the bathroom and wait until everyone is gone before you leave.

, Each time you use the bathroom, make sure to thoroughly cleanse your hands. This can prevent the spread of diarrhea to others or may also keep you from getting sicker.Rinse your hands with warm water and then lather with soap for at least 20 seconds, which is about as long as singing “Happy Birthday” twice. Rinse your hands again thoroughly to clean off any soap residue.
Use a hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol if soap and water aren’t available. Cover both the front and back of each of your hands and rub in the sanitizer the same way you would soap.

, Feeling panicky or anxious about diarrhea may make it worse since the body’s response to emergencies is to loosen bowel control. By talking yourself through and reframing the situation, you can calm yourself and your bowels.Avoid thoughts such as “what if I don’t make it to the bathroom” and “this is awful.” Instead, think that accidents are rare and that you’ve never had one or that if you stay calm, your bowels will stay calm, too.
Consider trying deep breathing exercises, which may also calm you and your intestines. Inhale and exhale evenly and deeply for a count of 4 or 5 seconds.

, It’s common to squeeze or contract the muscles around your rectum if you have diarrhea. However, these actions can actually make diarrhea worse by causing muscle fatigue, weakness, pain, and cramping. Avoid straining or squeezing as much as you can., If diarrhea strikes during school, you go to school with it, or a case gets worse, let the school nurse know. She can help you successfully get through the day without too much discomfort.


Be open with the nurse and don’t feel any shame or embarrassment. She’s used to seeing cases of illness in school, including diarrhea. If you have a hard time saying, “I have diarrhea,” you can use an alternative statement. Something like, “I have terrible stomach pains and can’t stop using the bathroom,” will cue in the nurse to your problem.
Ask the nurse if she can give you an excuse for your teachers, a place to lie down, or even an anti-diarrheal. The nurse may also have clear liquids or other treatments more readily at her disposal.

, Your stomach may make telltale rumbling sounds if you have diarrhea. If you’re in class and your stomach decides to participate as well, use different tactics to divert attention from your bowels. You can always be honest and say, “I’m sick and I apologize that my stomach is rumbling,” or laugh it off with an, “I’m sick and my stomach wants to answer the questions in my place.” In addition, you can also distract from the sound by:


Coughing
Sneezing
Shifting in your chair
Laughing if the timing is appropriate
Asking a question
Ignoring the sound altogether

, Chances are that you’re losing a lot of fluids and valuable electrolytes if you have diarrhea. Making sure you stay hydrated not only can help you feel better but also flush out your system more quickly.Try and get at least 8 ounces of clear liquids every hour. Clear liquids include water, broths, juices and even clear carbonated beverages.Broth and clear soups such as chicken soup and 100% fruit juices are good choices because they will also help replace electrolytes.Consider carrying your liquid with you in a bottle or Thermos. Let your teacher or the school nurse know why you have it in case there is a problem. For example, say, “I know it’s against policy to have a drink, but I’ve been very sick and need to make sure I’m drinking enough water throughout the day.” You can also ask your parent or a school nurse to provide a note as an explanation for your teacher.
Avoid drinking any caffeinated drinks like coffee or black tea. You should also not drink alcohol., If you have diarrhea, your stomach is probably very upset and needs a chance to rest. Eating according to the BRAT diet-- which stands for bananas, rice, applesauce, and toast-- can settle your stomach and intestinal tract as well as replace electrolytes.Have boiled potatoes, crackers, and gelatin at lunch if you can. Consider carrying your lunch and snacks such as soda crackers can also help ease your stomach.Other good options are bananas, apricots, and sports drinks.If you bring perishable foods to school, make sure that you can put your lunch in a refrigerator until it's time to eat it. You can also keep your food cold with ice packs in your lunch box.
Try eating foods such as soft fruit, vegetables, and cereal if you are feeling better., It’s important to be gentle on your stomach if you are hungry when you have diarrhea. Stay away from spicy, fatty, or fried foods as well as dairy products. These could further upset your stomach and make your diarrhea worseAvoid adding any spices to your food or eating spicy meals at lunch, such as Mexican food. These can irritate your stomach lining.
Ask if there are alternatives to eat and drink for lunch if you can’t find something other than the daily meal and milk.

, Consider trying an anti-diarrheal medication such as loperamide (Imodium A-D) and bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto-Bismol). These may reduce the number of bowel movements you have and put your mind at ease in class or when you’re walking through the halls.Be aware that anti-diarrheal medications don’t work for all kinds diarrhea and may not be safe for children. Take anti-diarrheal medications only if you are sure your diarrhea isn’t caused by a bacteria or parasite and/ or if you are over the age of 12. If not, you may need to see your doctor to get proper treatment.
Make sure to follow the packaging instructions if you do take an anti-diarrheal medication. If you don’t, it could make you more sick.
Ask your doctor to prescribe a medication such as codeine phosphate, diphenoxylate, or cholestyramine if you have severe diarrhea. These medications should only be used under the supervision of your doctor to prevent serious and potentially life-threatening complications., Moving around too much may also make you feel worse and as though you need to use the bathroom more often. Don’t exert yourself more than you need in classes. Consider sitting out for classes such as gym or extracurricular sports.Take your teachers a note from your parents explaining that you are sick and need to not exert yourself too much.

, It’s common for your bum to get irritated by wiping too often and rough school toilet paper can make this worse. Keep some soft and moist wipes in your bag to prevent or soothe any discomfort you may have.


Try either regular moist wipes or even baby wipes, which are generally gentle on skin."

Keep your locker clean.",How to Make School Less Stressful1," Although it is very easy to let your mind wander and be distracted in class, try your best to pay attention. The teacher may be giving some helpful tips or explaining something that you may need to know. If you pay attention, you will learn the material much more easily, so your work will be easier and go faster. This will also help you stay on top of due dates and other announcements.


Sit near the front of the class and away from distractions like the windows. Sit next to someone who also wants to learn. This person won't disrupt you with silly notes or gossip (you can save that for your break).;
, This will make sure that, not only are you paying attention, but you are also understanding what is going on. Don't be afraid to ask or answer questions. After all, what's the point in you being there if you're not learning? In addition to helping you learn the material, participating will show your teacher you care and help you build a good relationship with your teacher, which can save you some stress later on.

, You may find this boring, but it is very important. It helps you to gain a better understanding of your schoolwork and it also helps to transfer the information from your short-term to long-term memory. Stay on top of your homework and do a little bit every day, so that you remember everything you learn. You will now have a better understanding of your work and you won't have to worry about being in trouble with your teacher. This will also make studying for exams much easier and less stressful.


Make sure that you record all of your homework in a journal so as you don't forget what has to be done for what day. This will also help to cut back on stress and make life a lot easier for you.

, For instance, before you start answering questions, quickly read through the chapter you are studying in the textbook. This will jog your memory and make it easier to get started. Always start with the homework that's due the next day first. This way if it gets late, you don't have to panic. However, if you have extra time, try to get a head start on work that's due later in the week so as to avoid last minute cramming sessions.

, By having neat handwriting it will make it much easier for you to read your notes and it will also make it easier for teachers to correct your work - this will make them much happier, and it's always best to please the person who marks your work. Separating your notes and homework can also be helpful as it makes it much easier to find what you're looking for. Either get two separate copies or else put your notes at the front and your homework at the back.

, Try to choose a space that has few distractions and is comfortable. Make sure you have your pencil case, books, a glass of water, and your homework journal. If you find there are a lot of distractions in your house, do your homework in your local library, at after-school study sessions, or at a friend or relative's house.

, Ask parents or siblings at home for help, or even ring a friend in your class. If you still can't understand, give it your best attempt and talk to your teacher before class the next day. Show them your attempts so they know that you really did try, then ask them to explain the part that you found difficult. Teachers will be more than happy to explain it to you, when they know that you really care. If you continue to have trouble with homework, consider getting a tutor.

, Put all the books for each subject together so as not to forget anything. Don't use your locker as a trash bin. Make sure everything in there is essential.


Do clear outs often. Go through your schoolbag and locker and get rid of things you no longer need, being careful though. You don't want to accidentally throw away something which might be helpful in the future. If there are some things that you're not sure if you should keep or not, either ask your teacher or keep it in a safe place at home.

Join an after-school activity.,
Make the school environment as relaxing as you can.,
Eat a good lunch every day.,
Remember to reward yourself.,
Take effective study breaks.",How to Make School Less Stressful2," Whether it be a sport, arts and crafts, drama, or whatever else it is that interests you, take the time to do this activity every day or week. This will ensure that you are taking some time out to relax and have fun. This has far-reaching good effects. You will be socializing, enjoying your favorite hobby, and feeling a sense of achievement, all of which help combat stress. It will also take your mind off the stress of school, even for just a few hours, which will give you an important stress-free time each day.

, If you have a locker, put up one or two pictures on the door. Get a pencil case and school bag you really like and feel free to decorate them as you wish. Just little things like these may seem silly, but they really do help you to feel more relaxed and at home. They are a way of carving out your own personal space, mental and physical, at school, and having your own space is important in making the place less stressful.

, It's easy to be stressed when you're hungry, so make sure to eat a good lunch, and snack throughout the day if you get hungry. In addition, while pizza and other junk food can taste good, it won't provide you with the nutrients you need to be happy and healthy throughout your day. Opt for a healthy lunch that will keep you going all day - you'll find that this helps reduce your stress levels and has positive effects on your life in general.


Eat lunch with friends in order to have fun, relax, and take your mind of the stressful aspects of school in the middle of each day. This can give you a much-needed break that will keep you going through the end of the day.

, Give yourself little rewards now and then to encourage your hard work. Bring in a nice treat for your lunch, go out with your friends each weekend, have some alone time and read your favorite book or watch your favorite movie each night. Find some small things that you really like to do and do them at the end of each day or week.

, When you get home from school, give yourself a half hour to an hour to just relax. You won't be able to learn anything if you're stressed and grumpy. Do some exercise, meditate, read a book, or go for a walk. This will clear your mind and get you nice and energized before you get started on that homework. When studying for long periods of time, take a 10 minute study break every hour to keep your mind and body focused and fresh throughout your study session.

Seek help to deal with the panic attacks.,
Take it easy and expect a slow but steady recovery.,
Keep talking about things that bother you.",How to Overcome Having Panic Attacks About School," Provided you feel that you can talk to your parents (or guardians), they can be a very good place to start with. They might have some suggestions for helping you to cope with the panic attacks or they might be able to arrange for you to see someone who can help if they feel this is out of their depth, such as a doctor or a child psychologist.;
, You can talk to this person as well as your parents, or in place of them. Explain that you're having panic attacks and how this is interfering with your ability to do well in your schoolwork or to cope with the school environment.

, When you talk to your parents and/or the counselor, they'll want to know the possible reasons that are triggering your panic attacks. Try to pinpoint things that are happening to you that you feel unable to cope with well. For example, you might be experiencing any of the following:


You are being bullied at school and you don't know how to protect yourself or get away from the bullies.
You are failing in a subject, or several subjects, and you don't know how to turn this around by yourself.
You are doing okay with the schoolwork but you are still finding it is stressing you out massively because you feel there is too much of it, or the timetable is too pressing, etc.
You are terrified of upcoming exams or a particular event happening during the school year.
Something bad has happened to you at school, such as being molested, attacked or beaten up. You may have felt too scared to report it, or you may have reported it but felt that this didn't clear up your emotional scars.
You hate school and find it dull, uninspiring and tortuous. This could be because you're very bright, under-challenged, overworked, failing or truly and utterly uninterested in school.

, With the help of your parents and/or the counselor, or perhaps a professional such as a psychologist, ask for help in putting together a plan to deal with the problems that are triggering the panic attacks, as well as learning some coping mechanisms to reduce the panic attacks themselves. This might include reducing your workload, having bullies dealt with appropriately, increasing the challenges of the work, getting psychological assistance for any emotional issues, learning with a tutor, and so forth. Find practical ways to deal with the triggers that are bringing on the panic attacks.


For some further help on dealing with panic attacks themselves, read How to cope with panic attacks, How to survive with anxiety and panic disorder and How to calm yourself during an anxiety attack. There are more articles about panic attacks on wikiHow––just do a search for ""panic attacks"" in the search bar above.

, You won't solve the panic attacks overnight. Even with the best of intentions, the soundest of plans and the love and support of others understanding what you're going through, it will still take time to rebuild your strength and get rid of the panic attacks completely. However, with this support and help, you should find it starts to get easier to cope and the panic attacks will reduce in time. A big part of the problem is often feeling that you're struggling through all this alone; by reaching out and getting the advice and help from others, you are already on your way to making things better.

, Have good channels of communication with at least one person you trust and who has already been through what you're experiencing or at least knows how to deal with it. If you don't feel that a parent or guardian is a good person for this, find someone else who might be, such as an aunt or uncle, an older sibling, a therapist or your doctor. It is important to be able to express your feelings and worries freely.

, Proper nutrition is also essential if you want to do your best in school. Make sure to eat a filling and nutritious breakfast before school. Healthy snacks like fruits and nuts can help keep you energized throughout the day.

Make sure your breakfast has plenty of protein. Good sources include eggs, whole grain bread, yogurt, and peanut butter. Steer clear of foods that contain lots of sugar or refined grains.
It's equally important to keep yourself hydrated, so bring a water bottle to school with you and keep refilling it throughout the day.

, Students who are physically fit tend to have an easier time excelling in school. Whether you're struggling with feeling drowsy in school or you have so much energy that you can't keep still in class, incorporating some physical activity into your daily routine can make a big difference.Try playing a sport at school to keep you active. If you don't like competitive sports, consider jogging, riding your bike, or playing some non-competitive sports with your friends.

, It may be tempting to ignore your teacher and do something else if you find a lesson boring, but this will only make things much harder when you need to complete homework assignments and take tests. Keep your phone and anything else that is not related to your class in your backpack.

If you are allowed to use a tablet or computer in school, make sure you only use it for school-related purposes. If you are not working on an assignment or actively taking notes, put it away.

, One of the best ways to stay engaged during a lesson is to take notes. Whether you're listening to your teacher or reading something independently, jot down the main points.You don't down every single thing. Instead, try to focus on answering the core questions: who, what, when, where, why, and how. For more in-depth material, you can challenge yourself to come up with more specific questions, like, ""To what extent did...?"" or ""What was the effect of...?""Using your own words is more effective than just copying down what you've read or heard.

, If you don't understand something, it's important to get clarification right away. Getting all of your questions answered will make it much easier for you to move on to the next lesson with confidence.If you don't want to raise your hand and ask your question in the middle of the lesson, write it down and ask your teacher later. Writing it down will help you remember exactly what you need clarification on and at what point you became confused.
You can ask questions even if you understand the material perfectly. You might want to know more about a specific topic or how it relates to other things you have learned about. This shows curiosity and interest, so your teacher will be happy to answer your questions.
Answering other people's questions is also a great way to keep yourself engaged in the lesson.

, Many students choose to use study hall hours to socialize, but try to avoid this if you have work that you could be doing. Motivate yourself to stay focused in study hall by reminding yourself that whatever work you don't complete now, you'll have to do at home., When you have the opportunity to choose classes, make sure to choose wisely. You should choose classes that interest you to keep you fully engaged.Classes that are not challenging at all will probably be boring for you, but classes that are too challenging might cause you to become overly stressed. Think carefully about the demands of each class you plan on taking when you are deciding on your schedule.
Make sure to think about your future education goals when choosing your classes. If you want to go to college, it's probably not a good idea to skip high school classes that will be necessary prerequisites for your future degree. If you're not sure what classes you need to take, talk to your guidance counselor or adviser.

, Make sure to keep all of your notes and past assignments in one place. Different systems work best for different people, but all that really matters is that you know exactly where to find something when you need it. This will make it much easier to review what you have already learned when it's time to prepare for tests or big assignments.It's also important to keep your completed homework assignments in the same place every day so you don't lose them. There's nothing worse than losing points for an assignment that you actually did on time!

, In order to get the most out of your studying and avoid the stress of cramming at the last minute, it is important to plan out a schedule in advance. Studying a little bit every night and dividing large assignments up into smaller parts will help you stay on track.It's best to get yourself in the habit of doing homework and studying at the same time every day. You can extend your study period when you have more work to do, and end early on days when you have less work.
Set achievable goals for each study or homework session. For example, if you have an essay due in two weeks, your goal for tonight might be to create a rough outline.Write down all of your assignments in a planner. A wall calendar or mobile app can also help you keep track of your work, depending on your own personal preferences. If your schedule also includes extracurricular activities, work, or other commitments, make sure to keep track of them in the same place. This will help you visualize when you have time to do your work.Make sure to give yourself enough time to complete each assignment. If you're not sure how long something will take, try asking the teacher for an estimate. This is especially important for big projects, like research papers. Your teacher can help you understand all of the various steps that are involved, so you can budget time for each one., While you should consider all of your schoolwork a priority, some assignments are more important than others. If you are struggling to manage your time, make sure not to waste too much on assignments that are not worth much. Instead, focus the majority of your attention on the assignments that will have the most impact on your final grade.This doesn't mean that you should completely neglect smaller assignments. If you do this consistently, the bad grades will start to add up and bring your whole average down.
It might be tempting to do all of your easy homework first and save the most difficult assignments for last, but this is actually counterproductive. You will be more focused and energetic when you first start your homework than you will be after you have been working for a while, so take care of the work that requires the most attention first.You also need to consider the due date for each assignment when determining its priority level. Try to finish assignments that are due the following day before tackling ones that you have more time to complete.

, You will have a much easier time doing homework and studying if you set aside a specific place for it. Your study space should have a comfortable chair and enough space for you to spread out your books and other materials. It should also be quiet and free from distractions.If you don't have anyplace at home where you can study in peace, try to find another location. You may be able to stay after school and do your work in a classroom if you ask for permission. Your local library is also a great option.
Take a 15-minute break every hour if you find yourself getting distracted. Take a short walk or do a task that will not keep you distracted for more than 15 minutes., Everyone learns differently, so the study methods that are most effective for your friends might not work for you. Try to make studying more enjoyable for you by using the method that you genuinely find the most helpful, even if it's not conventional.


One way to make studying more enjoyable is to imagine that you are someone else, like a character from the book you are reading, a famous scientist, or a historical figure. Try to think about how this person might explain the material you are learning about. You can even act it out if you want.Flashcards are great study tools for some people. If drawing pictures on your flashcards helps you learn better than writing words on both sides, go for it!Rewriting material in your own words can also help you retain it better. If you want to get a little creative with this method, try coming up with rhyming lines or catchy phrases., Once you've finished all of your studying and homework for the day, make sure to give yourself a reward for a job well done. This may be going outside, watching your favorite television show, listening to some music, or anything else you enjoy.Remember that you will only be motivated by your reward if you don't give it to yourself on days when you don't finish all of your work.
If you lack the discipline to reward yourself, try getting a parent or older sibling to hold on to the reward until your work is done.

, Nothing makes school more miserable than struggling through your classes alone and not knowing where to turn for help. School will be easier and more enjoyable if you ask for help as soon as you feel you do not understand the curriculum, instead of waiting until you are failing the class and completely overwhelmed.

Ask your teacher for help, or maybe even another teacher at your school. You might understand the material just fine if it is explained in a slightly different way. Remember that your teachers are there to help you learn, so don't be afraid to ask them questions.
Your classmates may also be able to help you. If you are friendly with other students in the class who are doing well, ask them if they would be willing to help you with an assignment or form a study group.
If you need more individualized assistance than your teacher can offer you, think about getting a private tutor. There are many private tutoring companies that can help you, although you will have to pay for these services. Some schools also offer free peer tutoring, so be sure to take advantage of those resources.

, School will be much more enjoyable for you if you get to see people who you like. Friends can also help support you when you are feeling stressed out by school or struggling with an assignment.

Having friends is great, but don't let them distract you in class. Keep your conversations limited to free time, like during lunch or between classes.

, Being involved with school sports and clubs can help you make friends and it can help you become more passionate about school.Be cautious about over scheduling. If you start falling behind with your studying because of your extracurricular activities, you're probably doing too much. Instead of trying to be involved in everything, just choose one or two activities that you really enjoy.

, Elective classes are a great opportunity to learn more about something that interests you. The more passionate you are about your courses, the easier and less stressful school will be for you. Try to take at least one class that genuinely interests you.If your school doesn't offer any electives that interest you, talk to your guidance counselor about what other options are available. Some schools offer students the option to take certain classes at community colleges while they are still in high school.
You can also use electives as a way to explore new subjects that you know little or nothing about. You may discover that you have a passion you didn't even know about!

, You may not enjoy every one of your classes, and that's perfectly fine. It's important, however, to keep thinking about the future. If you really hate one of your required classes or even a specific assignment, try refocusing your attention on your future career goals. Thinking about the class or assignment as a very small step towards achieving a goal that will bring you a lot of happiness in the future might make it easier to deal with."

Taking a hot shower or steam is beneficial for cleaning off germs and preventing the spread of bacteria, but the steam can also soften mucus, thus clearing out your nasal cavities and making it easier for you to breathe.

, As noted above, dehydration is a common side effect in sickness and this applies to your skin as well. Moisturizer can help keep your skin from getting parched and chafing., Makeup is a great tool to help you look and feel your best and certain products are especially useful in disguising a sick face.

, Wearing something tight or restricting will cause you to feel even more uncomfortable than you already are, and wearing bright colors will help put you – and others – in a good mood.

, No matter what kind of sickness you’re experiencing, chances are high that your body is undergoing some form of dehydration. Dehydration can cause your mucus to dry up, further clogging your sinuses and causing you to feel even worse than you already do.You’ll know your body is dehydrated if you start feeling thirsty, dizzy or experiencing dry skin or dark yellow urine.Fight dehydration by increasing the number of fluids you consume on a daily basis. Focus on drinking more water or other beverages rich in electrolytes.

, Forget what you’ve heard about feeding a cold and starving a fever. Food is important when you’re sick because it provides you with the energy necessary to overcome your illness.


When sick, try eating soup or broth. If you’re too nauseous to keep the food down, try adding water to dilute the flavor.

, Herbal tea is known for its healing properties and certain teas are more adept at fixing certain problems than others.Drink Peppermint tea to help with bloating and nausea.

Refrain from exercising if your sickness falls below the neck (nausea, diarrhea, dizziness, etc.)

, Your body relies on sleep to help it fight off whatever infection is currently circulating inside. When you’re sick, sleep often feels impossible, so try using one of these tips to catch up on Z’s:


Sleep upright, propped up against a pillow. This will allow the fluid drain from your nose and will help you to feel less congested.

Change your routes.,
Find a safe space.,
Avoid oversharing.,
Distract yourself.,
Address the issue if necessary.",How to Ignore Jealous Classmates1," Take a different path to class. This may mean a different hallway or a back staircase in a larger school. If you go to a small school, see if changing the order you visit your locker or the bathroom helps alter your course to class.


Eat your lunch outside the cafeteria if your school allows it. Many schools offer smaller outside sitting areas or let students spend time in the library.
Ask your favorite teacher for help in finding new hangouts in the building. Even if you’re quiet in class and feel like the teacher doesn’t notice you, he or she definitely does and will be happy to help you feel comfortable in school.
Stay away from where they hang out. If you find yourself dealing with jealous classmates, avoid the areas where you know they hang out. While this may not be entirely possible, you can minimize your interactions with them by making a note of where they like to hang out.;
, If you feel like the pressure of dealing with your jealous classmates is too much, find a place in the school where you can go calm down when you feel overwhelmed. Even if you can’t find a physical spot, form a relationship with one of the adults who work in your school so that he/she can help you get a break from your classmates when you need it. Having a place to recenter your mind will help you resume your daily schedule with a fresh perspective.Secure your spot by volunteering. Most schools allow students to help out if they’re interested. For example, you could ask to be an office aide or a teacher’s aide during his/her off period. This way you could have time away from your classmates as well as an opportunity to build a relationship with adults on campus who can help you.
If you like to read a lot, you may be able to find a nook in the library. Check with the librarian if you feel nervous. You might say, “Hi, I’m feeling stressed and would like to calm down with a book. Can you recommend a good title and somewhere I can get started with my reading?”
If you you’re a star athlete, you may be able to get permission from your coach to hide out in the locker room. You could always offer to help your coach in exchange for spending extra time in the gym or locker room.
If you are in theater, offer to organize the costumes so that you can spend some quiet time in the dressing room.

, While it’s fun to talk about what’s going on in our lives, oversharing can open the door for jealousy because it can signal to others that you feel like you have something they don’t. Studies have shown that we are more likely to share stories and accomplishments that make us feel good about ourselves, which is a recipe for creating jealousy in those around us.Remember that you can share good news without oversharing. For example, tell your friends if you win the highly coveted part of Juliet in the school production of Romeo and Juliet, but refrain from adding that you’re also top of the class and just got a cell phone upgrade.
When others share their good news, celebrate with them before turning the subject to yourself. If you immediately respond to someone else’s success with a comment about your own, then it sounds like you’re trying to one-up people.

, Even if you can’t entirely avoid your jealous classmates, you can block out their negativity. Plan mental escapes for yourself, such as reading a book, sketching in your notebook, listening to your favorite band on your phone, or flipping through a catalogue from your favorite store., Perhaps people are jealous of you because of a misunderstanding or perhaps the problem lies in the way you act. If ignoring jealous classmates is not working, it may make sense to examine your behavior. Ask a trusted friend their impressions about your problem. They may be able to provide valuable feedback."

Change your perspective.,
Remember that jealousy is more about them than it is about you.,
Focus on enjoying your friendships.,
Assume the best of your classmates.",How to Ignore Jealous Classmates2," How you look at a situation affects how it makes you feel. When you feel like your classmates are jealous of you, it’s easy to let those thoughts weigh on your mind.By shifting the way you view the situation, you can change the way you react to it.


When you start to feel like your classmates are jealous of you, challenge those beliefs and try to look at the situation from a different angle.Take on the view of a person outside the situation and think about how they might interpret your classmates’ behavior. For example, you could pretend that your friend is in your place and coming to you for advice. What would you tell him/her?
Consider their jealousy as a compliment. While feeling singled out can feel hurtful, remind yourself that your classmates are seeing your positive qualities or achievements.

, Because jealousy stems from insecurities, people who become jealous are reacting to feelings within themselves.If you feel like their jealousy is getting to you, remind yourself that you can’t change who they are, so worrying about the situation will only cause you more hurt.
Don’t personalize someone else’s views of you. While it may feel like how your classmates think of you is important, what’s more important is what you think of you.

, If you spend too much time worrying about what others think of you, you risk spoiling your experiences. When you start to feel the weight of your classmates’ jealousy, shift your thoughts back to enjoying your time with friends.When you go on school-sponsored trips to compete in sports, arts, or academic events, plan to have fun with your friends during the times between competitions so that no matter who wins the top prize, you have a great trip. If your classmates still give you a hard time about bringing home the win, turn the conversation back to the fun activity you planned.
If you have a class, club, or other situation that puts you in contact with your jealous classmates, ask a friend to be around for you to lean on for support, even if you’re just texting them. Knowing that you have a friend who wants the best for you can help you ignore those who are jealous.

, When you feel that your classmates are directing their jealousy toward you, believe the best of them. While you may feel that their comments, sideways glances, or cold interactions with you are because they are jealous, they may be experiencing another type of stress or may worry that you’re feeling negatively toward them. When you assume the best, you bring positivity to your relationships.Oftentimes, we get so focused on one way of thinking that we forget that we are not mind readers. You don’t know what someone else is thinking, so allow yourself to believe people are thinking positively of you.
When in doubt, ask your classmates how they are doing. That way you will find out if something is bothering them.

Remind yourself that you worked to get where you are.,
Keep your eye on the prize.,
Surround yourself with friends who share your drive for success.,
Make a vision board.",How to Ignore Jealous Classmates3," When others are jealous, it’s easy to start questioning yourself, but you worked for your accomplishments. Don’t allow their negativity to degrade your achievement.


If you win an award or position at school, you may experience jealousy from friends as well as your other classmates. When this happens, remember what motivated you to go for your goal in the first place and all of the work it took to get there.
Celebrate the effort that your opponents also put into working toward their goal because they may have put in the same amount of work that you did. Congratulate them for all that they did accomplish and encourage them to work alongside you moving forward.

, Since it’s easier to drag down others than it is to boost ourselves, jealous people often try to prevent you from achieving your goals so that they won’t feel bad about not meeting theirs. When this happens, take a step back and ask yourself what’s most important to you., While not everyone has the same goals, successful people share common traits, such as resiliency and persistence. Stay on track to continue your successes by forming friendships with other people who are goal-oriented.As a group, you can support each other.


Start a support group at your school.
Found a club to help you find other students who share your interests.
Volunteer to mentor other students.

, Create a visual reminder of your goals to keep you on track, even when you feel like others are against you. Whenever you feel like your classmates are getting jealous, you can look at your board and remember why you’re working so hard. Take a photo of your vision board so that you can look at it when you’re not at home.

Avoid bragging.,
Compliment your classmates.,
Look for a common goal.,
Offer to help them work on achieving something important to them.Even if they say no, you’ll feel better for having offered.",How to Ignore Jealous Classmates4," Be proud of your accomplishments and speak highly of yourself, but don't brag. Sometimes it’s hard to tell when you’re bragging instead of showing confidence in yourself, but considering your motives for speaking can help.


Ask yourself why you want to speak about an accomplishment of yours. Does it fit into the conversation? Did it just happen recently, so it’s all you want to talk about? Is your classmate interested in hearing about it? Answering yes to these questions means that your accomplishment is probably relevant to the situation. However, if you only want to talk about it because you feel insecure and want to make yourself feel better, then you may be bragging.
Don’t boost yourself up by putting others down.

, Studies show that people who report higher levels of jealousy are more likely to be insecure, lack self-worth, and be afraid of losing their friends.If you tell your classmates what you like about them, then they are less likely to feel jealous of you.Congratulate your classmates when they win or receive a high grade. For example, compliment the students who finish the chemistry experiment first by saying, “Wow, you guys did a great job. Today’s lab was really tough!”
Make a point to see something good in your classmates, and let them know that you recognize those good qualities.
When someone wears a cute outfit or a new pair of shoes, say something like, “Oh, I saw those shoes in the store window! They’re so cute.”

, Make a connection with your classmates and avoid jealousy is to find a common goal that you both share.This is especially important if you have to work together on a team or in a group because it’s hard to avoid someone’s jealous attitude if you have to spend time with them.


If you are team captain, remind your jealous classmates that you are all there to win.
If you are the star in the play, help your classmates focus on putting on a great performance by pointing out that you’re all needed to put on a great show.
If you are working on a group project for a class, tell the other student that you’re happy to be working with them on your shared task and that you know that the two of you will create an awesome product. You could say, “Hey, I’m glad we get to be partners on this. I bet our project will get an ‘A’.”
Strive to see the best in others so they can recognize their own value. This can help lessen any jealousy.

,


Ask yourself why you would be jealous if your roles were reversed. Consider your classmate’s feelings. Are their goals and needs going unmet? Do you have something that they lack? Figuring out why the other person is jealous can help you figure out how to make the situation work for both of you."

, A great way to make school fun is to be a part of a sports team. When you play for a school sports team, you'll have pride in your school and will look forward to representing the school. Developing pride in your school will connect you to your school and make it more fun to attend.Attend games and sporting events. Whenever your school's team is playing a game, go cheer them on. Many sports offer free admission to students. Consider going with a group of friends to make it a fun outing to connect with your friends.
Don't limit yourself to only basketball or football games.
Support girl's team sports as well and go to lacrosse and softball games.

, Schools have many different activities throughout the year that are available for any student to participate in. Check your school’s website or newsletter to find out when activities are available and how to participate. Most schools will have several to choose from.

Festivals

, Although you may get in trouble for texting on your cell phone during class, you can write an old school note to pass to a friend between classes. Writing notes to a friend on notebook paper is easily overlooked by a teacher because it looks like you are completing classwork or taking notes on the lesson., A great way to pass the time in a boring class is to doodle or draw. You can stay engaged and learning by drawing your notes instead of writing them. This will wake up your brain and help you learn the material in a class you’re struggling to focus in.Try drawing pictures with your notes. Make your notes into a graphic novel so you are learning while you draw.

, If you’re having trouble in a slow class, you can write your own short story. If you include information about the lesson in your short story, you’ll make class fun and learn the information at the same time.

, When class gets boring or you’re assigned boring information to read, make up a game to play to entertain yourself. A fun mind game can engage you and bring your focus back.Count the number of times the teacher says a particular word. If you are learning a lesson in math, count how many times the teacher says ""add."" Ask friends to track other words, and keep score over several days. Have a prize for the person who picks the most used word for the week.
If you’ve been assigned reading material that is boring, try reading it as fast as you can and then write down everything you remember. Time yourself and then try to beat your fastest time.

, Taking a break to stand up and walk around when your mind has lost its focus is a great way to stop the boredom. Breaks actually help the brain retain information and make connections, so your bathroom break can help you learn the information better. Ask to go to the bathroom, and then take some time to walk around or do a few stretches before coming back into the class., You have a brief moment between each class to change your books, but you can use this time to socialize with your friends as well. Memorize where your friends will be after classes, and find a place you can meet with them to catch up before you have to catch the next class. If you don’t have enough time to meet them, send them a text to talk about the latest news.

, Find friends to eat lunch with during your lunch hour. The lunch hour is your break in the day to be able to hang out with your friends and enjoy yourself. Find a table to sit at every day so everyone knows where to meet.


If you're allowed to go outside during lunch, consider finishing your lunch quickly to provide more outside time to play and socialize.
Play table games such as paper football with people at your table.
Challenge yourself to meet new people each lunch period if your group of friends is not in your lunch period.

, As soon as the bell rings for the end of the day, it becomes your free time. Meet friends when school ends to walk or ride home together so you can hang out everyday. If you have after school activities, meet friends after school to have a snack together and hangout before the activity starts.

, Ask your friends what classes they are planning to take next semester. Talk to your counselor about signing up for the same classes so that you will have people you know in your classes.

, Choose electives that are exciting and interesting. Make your schedule more fun by taking at least one class each semester that you'll enjoy., Each teacher has a different style of managing her classroom and teaching the material. Ask older students which teachers are fun and which ones are more strict. You may have options when you are registering for classes to ensure that you get teachers that have more fun in the classroom.

, Many courses require projects as a part of your grade. Signing up for classes where you will have a creative outlet to do a project with a group or on your own can help you have fun and enjoy the class. Project based learning can be a fun departure from just reading a book.


Observe the classes you will take next year to plan ahead.
Ask older friends or relatives which classes require projects.

, It’s important to get enough sleep at night to be able to have a great day at school. When you’re well rested, your mind is ready to learn and you’re able to keep your emotions in check. If you go to school tired, you will get stressed easily. School will definitely not be fun if you’re stressed.Studies suggest that adolescents should get between 8.5 and 9.5 hours of sleep each night.

, If you get your homework done and turned in on time, you will go to school each day without stressing. When you are late with a homework assignment, it’s easy to start stressing, and it can ruin your whole day. To make sure school stays fun, find time to do all of your homework and turn it in on time.


Keep track of your assignments in a planner or agenda to know when they are due.
Work on homework while you're on the bus to and from school so you don't have as much to complete at home.
Do your homework with a group of friends (without copying each other's answers) to turn homework into a social activity.

, Staying hydrated is very important to your health. If you’re dehydrated, you can lose focus and become agitated easily, so if you want school to be fun, you need to stay hydrated. Bring a reusable water bottle to school to keep yourself hydrated all day long."

Select a bag.,
Pack the bag for any Medical emergencies: If you don't have any medical problems then forget this step, unless you want to bring a first aid kit.,
Pack for Feminine Emergencies: Alright, you got your period during B period....what to do?,
Pack for clothing Emergencies: Gym is the major cause of wardrobe emergencies.,
Pack for odour related emergencies: Everyone who uses deodorant forgets deodorant sometimes...but no one has to know that YOU do... so include a stick of deodorant in your bag.,
Pack so you have something to eat in a Food Emergency situation: If you are rushing to catch the bus and you forget to grab your lunch, no worries, you can eat something from the status you keep, for example a few granola bars, in your locker.,
Smile: Your emergency bag is useless if you can't smile.",How to Make an Emergencies Bag for School (Girls)," Preferably one that can fit on the top shelf of your locker, or if you use those stacking shelves one that can fit under there. Don't bring it home with you- it will be too big to fit in your backpack. A few good stores for middle school girls to buy bags include Aeropostale, Target, or even Walmart!;
, If you have asthma bring an inhaler and eye contact liquids if you wear them. If you do have eye contacts also bring an extra pair of glasses, just in case. If you have allergies and your school allows you to take medicine always keep it in your locker. Include some band aids or plasters, some paper handkerchiefs, a lip salve and moist wipes.

, Luckily if you make this bag you'll be covered. Buy a whole box of tampons, pads, whatever it is you use, and keep it in there. Put about ten in your bag, in case a friend needs some, and for you of course. You also may want to keep a pair of absolutely new underwear (again, in case a friend needs it... don't let them borrow used, and tell them to keep it. So a variety pack of undies from Walmart or something is ideal)

, If you have uniforms disregard this, otherwise this is important. Keep a variety of socks in your bag, in-case you forget them, or a friend does (its very common) also keep a pair of sneakers (if you don't have enough sneakers to just leave a pair lying there it is recommended that you buy a pair of $5 Keds knockoffs from Walmart or a similar store. You can even color on them to make them more appealing. Also leave a T shirt and shorts in there in-case you forget gym clothes. Make sure that you have a sweater/sweatshirt in your bag as well in-case it gets chilly or a teacher tells you that you need to cover up.

, Also, add a small bottle of body splash or body mist, as perfume isn't allowed in many schools! Make sure you check with your school first though, some don't even let you have body spray.

, Buy a box and slip it near the back for a quick snack after gym or something for a friend who forgot their lunch. You can put any type of food in your locker as long as it won't go bad and try keeping it as healthy as possible. If your school has a cafeteria this trick works more for a quick between class snack or if you have no money.

, A smile in school is very important. You want to have a nice smile which comes off looking nice and then people will have an easier time talking to you. However nice your smile is, if you have bad breath, nobody wants to talk to you. So just in case bring some mints, minty gum (trident is good for your teeth), and maybe even some dental floss for after lunch. Also, remember to take good care of your smile.

Play mind games.,
See how long you can go without blinking.,
Work on an assignment.,
Narrate everything that is happening.,
Make a to-do list.,
Sharpen all your pencils.,
Combine your classmates’ names to find the funniest one.,
Think of puns related to the dull class.,
Stare at someone until they get uncomfortable.",How to Have Fun in a Boring College Class," These are the sorts you don't need to do anything other than sit there and stare ahead, acting as if you're listening but you're really miles away thinking about completely different things.

Try stacking people on top of each other in your mind's eye. This will for sure entertain you for an extended period of time since people are all different. With your mind, see how many people fit in the given room you’re in by stacking them. Perfect for when you cannot focus on one more word and want to get through this class.
Count how many hairs you have on your entire head. Warning! Do this only if extremely bored. Since singular hairs are small and hard to count, this will take a whole lot of time and before you know it, the class will be over! This might become aggravating at times but at least you’re learning how to be patient.;
, Test yourself. What better way than drying out your eyeballs, right? Bonus points if someone asks you if you’re okay.

, It might be for that class or another class, but make hay while the sun shines. The class might be boring but at least you're getting the assignment work done, and since that is what counts by way of marks, it's a productive response to a dull class. Also, by doing homework in class it looks like you’re actually doing classwork.

, Be sure to do it as quietly as possible though! State everything that is going on as it happens. You can do this alone or team up with a classmate sitting beside you. Very entertaining. Bonus points if you make someone laugh., Boring as it may sound, it is actually very useful and may occasionally be entertaining, depending on what kind of person you are. To-do lists keep you focused on tasks that you have to get done. How ironic that you’re doing it in class, where you should be focused on the lecturer instead. What a shame.

, Warning! This will be very obnoxious and may enrage those around you, regardless, carry on. Sharpening pencils is both relaxing and entertaining, especially if the pencil was extremely dull before. Bonus points if the people around you let you sharpen their pencils and even join in.

, Combining names is always a good idea. For the best results, try putting together names together that should never have become one. Bonus points if you whisper it to someone and they giggle., Puns are always a good idea, though most only receive a loud groan. This will entertain you, and possibly people around you, for a good while. Bonus points if you tell someone a pun you’ve made up and they laugh or, what will most likely occur, groan.

, If you’re feeling extra adventurous, try staring someone down until they look away or start laughing nervously. This might make you seem very creepy, but if you live through this class, that’s all that matters in the end. Bonus points if the person on the other side also starts to stare you down."

, Get in the shower (if needed), brush your teeth, etc. Also, you should try to get in bed around 8:00 to 9:45, depending on your age. Try not to make it past 10 if you can. For breakfast, eat something healthy like cereal or oatmeal.

, If it's cold outside, dress warmly, being cold all day will definitely not help you have a good day at school. And light and open clothes if it's hot out. Try to wear something comfy. Yet, it might reflect who you are. It's always fun to get a shirt and wear it to school, it gives you a confidence boost and you get complimented a lot!

, This means having at least one of these things; five pencils, an eraser and a pencil sharpener.

Find an attention-grabbing opening statement.,
State the basics.,
List your qualifications.,
State your main ideas on how to improve the school.,
Find support for those ideas.,
Keep your ideas short but very strongly worded.,
Reiterate your main points briefly.,
Emphasize your benefits to the audience.,
Ask the audience for their vote.,
Have someone to look over your speech.",How to Write a Student Council Speech," To begin your speech for student council president, you need to begin with a strong, attention grabbing opening. You'll likely be giving this speech during school hours, so your classmates' attention spans might be a bit strained.


Do not merely start by saying, ""My name is ___ and I'm running for student council."" Your classmates will already know as much and this is not really a unique statement. There will be time to state the basic information after you've gotten the class's attention.You can open with a question. Something like, ""If there was one thing you could change about this school, what would it be?"" Or a question that adds some humor, like, ""I know what you're thinking. Why should I listen to this person?"" and then proceed to lay out your credentials. Quotes on leadership, power, and guidance would also make good openings. However, make sure to double check your sources and especially if you're finding quotes online. Many online quote databases, like Quote Garden or Brainy Quote, sometimes attribute quotes to the wrong sources.If you're stuck, look up and read famous speeches. You can find many speeches from presidents, world leaders, civil rights activists, and others online. Pay attention to how they opened their speeches and ask yourself, ""Was this interesting? Do I want to keep reading/listening? Why?"", Once you've gotten your audience's attention, you should state the basics. Talk briefly about who you are and why you're running.


State your name and your place or grade in school. This may feel somewhat unnecessary if you go to a small school, but it's considered a formality. If you're missing this part of the speech, you may end up looking sloppy in comparison to other students.State what you want. That is, what you're running for. Do you want to be the president, vice president, treasurer, secretary? Even if you think most students are aware of what position you're running for, make sure you state it here to remind them.Try to keep this section brief as it's not as important as your qualifications and plans to improve the school. Even once sentence would suffice. For example, ""My name is Ramona Hart, I'm in the 11th grade, and I'm running for treasurer of the student council.""

, Perhaps the most important part of your intro is listing your qualifications. Students need to know what they have to gain by voting for you.


Any accomplishments relevant to the position warrant mentioning here. If you're running for secretary, for example, talk about your summer job filing papers in your uncle's law firm. If you're running for student council president, talk about your leadership experience being captain of the swim team.While this section is important, try to keep it minimal. A couple of sentences laying out your qualifications is enough as the body of your speech is where you should spend the most time. For example, let's go back to the above example. From there, we could say, ""I am currently enrolled in advanced placement algebra and I have been an honor roll student for three years. This knowledge of numbers and diligence qualifies me to have responsibility for finances for our student council."", You should have at least three ideas you feel would benefit your school and classmates. This gives your classmates incentive to vote for you and shows you want the position as an opportunity to help others.


You should list your ideas and then expand on them later in the body. It might take a bit of research to figure out what you want to change. Ask around the school, talking to students and teachers, and see where there's room for improvement. What are the concerns of the students? What are people happy with regarding the school? What would they like to see change? Asking these questions can help you get a sense of your audience and community.Remember, you should not make promises you cannot keep. Do not say anything just to get elected. While many students might want gum chewing policies eliminated or for the lunch period to run twice as long, this is probably not necessary or possible. Try to focus on areas that seem important to keeping your school running safely and efficiently. Concerns about things like bullying, academic standards, and extracurricular activities should be your concern over fun and games.A good opening statement for your body would state the causes important to you and what you plan to do about them. For example, if you were running for president, you could say something like, ""I understand we need to improve how we handle bullying, increase interest in extracurricular activities, and expand access to AP courses throughout the school. As your president, I would work to bring in speakers to talk about sensitivity in the classroom, increase advertising for basketball games and quiz bowl tournaments, and start a tutoring program to help students struggling with certain subjects."", You should do a little extra research in addition to talking to classmates and teachers. Have some specific plans on how you would enact change in your school.


Using the school library or computers, figure out the best means to tackle certain problems many schools face. How have other schools dealt with bullying? Poor test scores? Low interest in extracurricular activities? What can you reasonably do as a student council member to address these problems?You do not have to have a point by point plan laid out, but a few sentences on some preliminary ideas can help you stand out from your peers. People are more inclined to vote for someone who's thought about how to solve problems in addition to identifying problems., Your body should be about two paragraphs of 5 to 6 sentences each. This might sound brief, considering how much information you'll have to get across, but you have limited time and must keep people's attention. It can help to write more than you need and gradually cut down your speech to the bare essentials. This will help it to be shorter meaning that students won't get bored when to listen to your speech.

, When you reach your conclusion, briefly go over your main points. A one to two sentence summary of your plans as president should start off your conclusion. Something like, ""With my experience and passion, I believe I could be a great leader. I promise to do my best to curb bullying, increase student interest in the school, and increase overall academic achievement., You should emphasize your benefits to the audience one last time. However, do so differently than you did in the initial introduction.


Do summarize, briefly, your qualifications but do not put the main focus on them. This is where you should sincerely state your passion. Students should not just vote for you because you'd do a good job but because you genuinely care about the school. State your passion for your community and how much you want to see other students succeed. Lots of students have high qualifications. You can set yourself apart by being a candidate who really cares., The last part of your speech should be a sincere request that the audience votes for you. Try to come off as humble. Instead of saying, ""I expect your vote next Saturday!"" say something like, ""I would be honored if anyone of you chose to vote for me next Saturday."", Have a friend or family member, or even a teacher, you trust to take a look at your speech. Ask for honest feedback, even if it's negative. You should write your speech, at least, a couple weeks before the election so you have time to have a few people look it over and give you advice. You should even give them on a number based answer from 1-5.

Weight? When you decide what you want to be like, think about what you're going to do to achieve this and how to make the school year easier, or more fun. Study more? Have more friends? After you have spent a long time thinking about it, tell your mom/dad. They can help a lot.;
, To start off a good school year, you need to have a good summer. What good will it do if you're complaining about what a horrible summer you had all school year? Try doing some fun things. Go on a vacation, play with friends, remodel your room, spend time with your parents, or try out a new hobby. When it's time for school and your teacher asks what you did this summer, you will have lots to choose from!

, When it's time to go shopping for school supplies, choose cool stuff. Like instead of getting normal pencils, get cool ones with a pattern you like. Instead of getting a plain ruler, get a bendable one. When your getting your backpack, get the one you really like, because you'll have this all year. And for notebooks, get one with an awesome pattern, or your favorite animal.

, If you wear really drab or uninspiring clothes, it's time to make a change. Choose cool clothes that you like. Fashion is a neat way to express yourself, so don't try to copy what your best friend is wearing, or what the most popular girl in school is wearing, because if it doesn't fit your personality, you won't be able to pull it off.


If you're not sure what style you have, try looking at fashion magazines or watch TV shows and see what the people are wearing. If you like an outfit, try to get something similar. Remember your accessories and shoes are a part of your whole look.

, Make sure you write down any homework assignments you get and when they're due. Do your homework the night you get it. You don't want to get behind! Also, make sure you ask for help if you need it. Teachers love it when you do this, and it will ensure you don't get stuck during exam time.


Tidy your desk and locker (if you have one) regularly.

, It helps if you have clean surroundings so make sure your house is clean and your desk is tidy because it's nice to be able to study in a comfortable and clean place. Make sure your room is clean too; you don't want to wake up every morning to a mess!

, Do homework on time, take notes, pay attention, etc. Talk to your teacher about anything you don't understand and ask lots of questions. This will make your teacher adore you and appreciate your efforts to succeed. Try volunteering for everything your teacher(s) need help with. If you really want to impress your teacher(s), do extra work. This will make your teachers putty in your hands.

, It adds stress and you won't do it properly. Revise and study the same day you get home from school so you can help the information settle in your mind longer term.

, Once you've finished all of this, do a page of extra work, and pack every thing in your backpack. When your parents come down they'll be asking 'Pack your Backpack? Brushed your teeth?"" Imagine their faces when you say yes to everything!

, On the first day of school wear your favorite outfit. This will make you feel comfortable and confident. Make sure to get a lot of sleep the night before, because if you're tired the first day that's not the way to start off the school year! Say hi to everyone and tell them your name and Try to make new friends. Get to know your teacher, too! If your school has lunch on the first day, pack something you love! This way if you end up having a bad morning, at least you have something to look forward to!

, Wear an outfit that loads of people complimented you on, or one that you save for special occasions (just make sure it's not too dressy. A ballgown/tux would not be suitable here!). Try practicing a smile before hand so you know you'll look your best. Make an effort with your hair so it looks great in your photo. Remember, as long as your face and top half looks good, you don't need to worry about the rest because this part won't be in the picture.

, Choose activities you enjoy. Not only will you be doing something you love, you'll make lots of new friends. This will look good on future job applications, too!

, Go to the store and buy food that you like. Packing your own lunch not only shows responsibility, you get to choose what you want to eat.

, Stay toned so that you can do activities you like soccer. Being healthy will make you look fantastic and feel like joining in sports and other physical activities.

, It's a lot more enjoyable to do tasks with people that you like. This doesn't mean to dumping your old friends though. Try doing stuff they like, so as to boost your friendship with them.

, This can be done by keeping secrets and promises. This will not only boost your friendship but also make that person like you more.

, At the end of the year invite the class (and the teachers) to a pool party. If you can't invite the whole class, invite 1-5 of your closest friends to a sleepover. After how good you've been this year, your parents will probably say yes! Have fun at the sleepover; you've earned it.


Other fun ideas include a sleepover or simply a trip to the shopping center. Whatever it is, make sure your friends enjoy it too.

, Don't be the teacher's pet, just be you. Offer to help in class and bring in your homework on time as this will hopefully give you a good report too! You can joke around with friends but if you get told by your teacher not to, stop joking around and pay attention!

Invite them to sit with you at lunch.,
Introduce the new kid to your friends.,
Help them with their schedule.,
Check in with them frequently.,
Be ready to help them with homework if you share classes.",How to Welcome the New Kid at School," Reach out to the new kid first. They might feel nervous or anxious about reaching out to other students, whether it’s for friendship or to get help. By being the first to talk to them, you’re letting them know there’s nothing to worry about. Be positive when talking to them and be kind. Try to greet them early in the school day; this gives you a chance to get to know them and help them out throughout the day.You want to be sure to introduce yourself by name and make them feel welcome. For example, you can say: “Hi! My name’s Lucy! I’m so happy to meet you. What’s your name?”;
, Learn a little about them by asking questions. Show that you’re interested in them and want to learn more. Asking about their interests will help you see if you have any points in common with them. You’ll also be able to suggest extracurricular activities for them, or even set them up with future friends.It’s best to do this outside of class. You don’t want to get the new kid in trouble with their new teachers. Do this in breaks between classes or at lunchtime.
Asking them what activities they were involved with at their old school is a great way to help guide them towards activities they can do at their new school.

, Don’t be afraid to go into your own interests as well. This can help develop a bond with the new kid, especially if you have interests in common. It also gives you a chance to suggest after-school activities for them to try.You should give the new kid a bit of information about yourself at the beginning of a school day when you introduce yourself. Something as simple as “I play trombone in the school band” gives them an idea of your interests.
If your interests involve meeting up after school or on weekends, talk to the new kid about that the day before your meet up. This gives them a chance to know ahead of time, and can be an opportunity for you to invite them to come with you.

, It’ll be easier for you to help them through the school day if you’re near them in class. Speak to your teacher about sitting next to the new student. As long as you explain that you’re doing it to be helpful, there shouldn’t be a problem., One of the scariest things for a new kid is not knowing where to sit at lunch. Everyone already knows where to sit, and they’re usually stuck eating alone. Save a seat for the new kid and your table and you’ll make a great impression.


If you’re used to sitting with your friends, this is a great chance to introduce them to the new kid.

, Don't try and take full responsibility for the new kid feeling welcome. Introduce them to your friends and to others in your class. This will help them make more friendships for the future and feel comfortable even when you're not around. They might even find a group they completely click with and integrate them completely., On top of getting into a new school, new students have to deal with a whole new schedule. They’ll probably have a lot of questions about the classes themselves, where they are and even the teachers.


If there are any resources available at your school to help students with their schedules, check if the new student has access to these. If they don’t, try and help them get access to these. For instance, many schools provide their students with an agenda, or a printed list of events planned for the year.

, The first day is particularly stressful for new kids, and you’ll want to make sure they’re doing well throughout the day. Try to make yourself available frequently after that too, though. Make sure you’re also checking on the new kid throughout their first few weeks at their new school.


If you’re comfortable doing so, you can give the new kid your phone number or social media contact info. This gives them the chance to reach out to you whenever they need it., Changing schools can be especially jarring, especially if it’s done after the beginning of the year. A new kid’s head might be spinning with all the new things they have to learn about their school and fellow classmates. If you really want to help them out, offer to do your homework together. You can take some time between classes or at lunch to help them with anything they’re having difficulties with.


If English is the new student’s second language, you can be very helpful by giving them a hand with their homework."

Help them make friends.,
Let them join clubs and activities.,
Be punctual.",How to Help Your Kids Like School1," Kids tend to adjust better to school when they enjoy seeing their friends and hanging out with them. If your child doesn’t have friends at school, have some of their classmates over to play or invite them to an activity with your child. Have your child play with other kids in the neighborhood that also attend the same school.Ask the school psychologist if there’s a social skills group and consider recommending your child for the group.
During the summer, you may also want to look into programs to help your children socialize, and this may also make transitioning into the school year a bit easier.;
, See what activities are available for your child to join at school then get them involved. For example, they may have sports teams, clubs, or other activities that they can join. Even elementary schools offer activities such as boy scouts or girl scouts and reading clubs. Joining clubs, sports, and activities can increase their involvement with school.If your child is interested in music, let them join the band, choir, or orchestra. If they like sports, see what sports are available. You can also look at academic clubs such as debate or science clubs.
Make sure that your children are not overscheduled. It is important for them to get plenty of rest in the evenings.

, Kids can feel left out if they get to school and other kids are already playing or involved in an activity. Also, kids can feel abandoned or worried about your safety if you’re late to pick them up. For children that are especially shy or anxious, make the extra effort to be on time to big days such as the first day of school, field trip days, or going back to school after an illness.If you have a problem being on time, consider setting a timer or alarm to alert you when it’s time to go.

Close strong.",How to Write a Speech to Get You Elected," This doesn't just mean verbal restraint in front of young audiences. Every age group has different issues that face it and you must understand their concerns. Even underclassmen and seniors at the same schools have different concerns.;
, An individual's relative position in society has a tremendous influence on their mindset, and their confidence (or lack thereof) influences their political actions.Are you trying to win over the self-assured, or the downtrodden? Know your target demographic.


It could be claimed that such information is more relevant to adult office-seekers than to young adults who covet student or club positions. But perhaps it could be said in response that anyone who claims that socioeconomic status isn't important to high schoolers clearly remembers nothing about being a teenager.

, It is often useful in a speech to remark upon something of special interest to your audience. This doesn't have to be about serious subjects; many politicians open with remarks about the local sports team.Any admission that you know little of sports teams cannot hurt you, as long as you don't follow it up by discussing your familiarity with the owners of sports teams., This is not just about keeping it short, though that is usually a good suggestion; nor is it simply about keeping within the allotted time. If this is a big speech and the crowd has been waiting for you, it is almost inappropriate to deliver a brief address. Give them what they came for, but know when to call it a day.

, What are people talking about right now? Have recent events made something especially important? You must keep up on issues of pressing interest that are relevant to the position for which you are applying.

, Has the audience been put to sleep by previous speakers? Is your speech at the climax of some long conference or association gathering? The audience may need a wake-up call. Such a speech may not be appropriate at all times, when more sedate discussions of ideas are more appropriate.


William Jennings Bryan's ""Cross of Gold Speech"" at the 1896 Democratic National Convention was perhaps the finest examples of a speech perfectly timed to fit the occasion. Coming at the end of a nasty debate (and the day before the party was to nominate its presidential candidate), the dramatic delivery and hopeful message of the speech won the admiration of the delegates. The next day, the convention nominated Bryan as the party's presidential candidate., Remember that your goal is to be understood, not simply impress people with your intelligence. People will already think you are smart if you have the same ideas as them, and the use of words or phrases that are currently uncommon will not be beneficial. Keep sentences short and easily understood., If this speech matters to you, mistakes are unacceptable. It may also be useful to have a friend proofread it as well.

, There will undoubtedly be parts that are grammatically correct but sound awkward. There will also be points that require special emphasis. You will only know how and when to do so by practicing the speech out loud., You are already convinced of your own greatness. Your job is to convince others. If the friends who listen to you are anything like your target audience, then you must pay some heed to their recommendations.

, It is vital that you grab the audiences attention quickly. According to at least one speechwriter, ""Audiences decide if they like you, and if you are a person of character, in between eight and 20 seconds of the start."" You need to indicate something about your purpose within the first minute, even if it is not yet stated openly. You must at least make it clear that you are going to discuss something that they want to hear about.


Many candidates chose to discuss something about themselves in the opening. In particular, most focus on something that connects them to either the issue they will discuss today or the audience they are talking to. Explain how you are a personally connected to something that matters to them.

,


Your ultimate goal must be stated within the first minutes. Details are not necessary at this point, but in the ideal scenario you will be laying out a vision that you share with the audience.
Once again, the amount of specifics you provide about how you will achieve your goals should be tailored to fit the audience. Are they one that is interested in such specifics, or will generalities do?
Your tone must be relatively upbeat. You can criticize the current situation, but those leaders who have been most successful at building mass followings have presented messages of hope.

, Any proposal that you present must be tied to your ability to make it a reality. If you can make clear that you are the best hope for the change your propose, you have made you election a necessity for at least some of those who are listening. If that group is large enough, your victory is all but assured.

, Yes, yes, the introduction is vitally important. Well it is. The conclusion is nearly as vital. Here, you must explain to the audience what they must do in order to make change happen.


While obviously you want them to vote for you, it is often better to create a small amount of distance here. Give the audience agency; allow them to ""make a statement"" on election day. The speech should explain how your election is simply the best way they can empower themselves.

Accept that you cannot always be the smartest person in the room.,
Acknowledge your strengths.,
Don’t compare yourself to others.,
Nurture yourself.,
Boost your self-esteem.,
Acknowledge what you can control.,
Consider the alternative.",How to Handle Smart People1," There will probably be people who are able to comprehend certain things easier than you. Everyone is talented in their own way and are good and bad at different things. If you expect to be the smartest person everywhere you go, you will probably end up being disappointed. Get over your need to always be the brightest and best.;
, Each person has skills, experiences and talents that make them unique—including you. Focus on what you are good at and not what you lack.You may not be able to discuss quantum physics but you can probably do things that the people you think are smarter than you can’t, such as paint a mural, write a book, diagnose engine trouble, make people laugh or sing soprano. Recognize where your strengths are because self-confidence makes you more resistant to negative thoughts.

, Doing this is going to make you feel bad, especially if you already suffer from low self-esteem or self-confidence. Realize that even smart people are just people, and you are the one that decides who is better at something than you are. You may see a certain behavior or hear some responses and then make judgement calls, but you don’t really know whether this person rehearses what they say privately or if they also feel as insecure as you do.


Realize that you are not less than these smart people, and treat yourself fairly.
It will take some time and practice to get rid of old habits and ways of thinking, so be patient with yourself. In time, you will be able to see yourself as you truly are—brilliant in your own way., When smart people threaten your ego daily, you need to pay some extra attention to yourself. Do something just for you that you really enjoy, such as swimming, yoga, reading a book, taking a hot bath or taking a drive through the mountains. Exercise can also really boost your mood—if you can get past the fact that you will probably not be the most fit person at the gym right away., When you feel good about yourself, you won’t be as worried that the people around you might be smarter than you are. After spending time with smart people, do something you are really good at. Don’t be afraid to admire yourself for it, and show it off to friends and family members for validation. When you are content with your own capabilities, you will be less threatened by smart people.

, Some people may be genetically wired to be able to retain and comprehend information more efficiently than you. However, you can be as prepared as possible by studying the material you will be discussing beforehand or really stand out from the crowd by working harder than anyone else.Additionally, you may not be able to control what smart people do or say but you can always control how you react.

, Being in a room full of smart people can be annoying but consider what it would be like to be in a room of people who are the opposite of that. If you had to work or go to school with people who have less experience, ambition or intelligence than you, then it could get boring or frustrating quickly. By dealing with smart people regularly, you will also become smarter.

Prepare a speech.",How to Win Votes in a School Election," Student governments have many offices with different responsibilities. Make sure you know what you what the position does, and what you will be able to do once you get there. There are limits to what you can do while in office, so knowing your responsibilities can keep you from making foolish campaign promises that you can't keep.;
, School offices can be a great opportunity to help your fellow students and make your school a better place. Ask yourself why you want the office and why should people vote for you. If you don't have a clear reason for running, you won't have anything good to tell your fellow students.


If you are looking for specific areas that you can improve in your school, talk to authority figures, such as your teachers or the principle, current members of the student government, or even your fellow students.

, Come up with one to three big reasons why people should vote for you, memorize them, and be prepared to tell them without hesitating to anyone who asks. People have short attention spans, so while you may have plenty of big ideas for fixing the school, you need to be able to address them quickly.



Writing a slogan, a short tagline for your campaign, is a great way to keep your ideas short and simple. It can be serious or funny, but make sure it is about you. It needs to remind people who you are, and that they should vote for you.

, Talk to your friends about running, make sure they think it is a good idea, and ask for their help in running.You won't be able to do this alone, and it looks good if the people who know you best will vote for you. Your network can also help with more practical activities, such as designing and making posters, passing out buttons, and encouraging their classmates to vote for you.


Encourage your network to bring in more friends to help. There is nothing wrong with additional support.

,, Talk to friends and other acquaintances. Introduce yourself to people you don't know, and convince them to vote for you. People won't vote for you if they don't know who you are.Not everyone will want to talk to you about the election. That's fine, just let them walk away. You don't want to be pushy or overbearing.
Don't get so focused on winning over one small group that you forget larger ones. You probably can't win over everyone, so don't be discouraged by the votes you don't get.

, Sometimes the hardest thing is actually getting people to participate in the election. If you are the one pushing them to vote, they may be more likely to vote for you.

, You and your campaign team should make posters, buttons, t-shirts, and other items that will let other students learn your name even if you don't get to talk to them. Most importantly, your name and the position you are running for should be big and clear on everything you make.


These items are great places to use a slogan, if you made one.
For posters, create and hang as many as possible. Make sure they follow any guidelines the school sets, as you don't want school officials taking them down.
Buttons and stickers can go on all kind of items, and schools may not put the same limits on them as they do on posters. You can also pass them out with other small trinkets, which are great ways to help students remember you., To get any votes at all, you need to have the right attitude. Act as if you believe you will win, and that the school will be a better place with you in office.

, Your school may give you the opportunity to address your fellow students at some point before the election. If so, be ready with a short speech that focuses on your campaign themes, and reminds people why they should vote for you.


Stay within the time limits the school gives you. You want to get as many of your ideas out there as you can, but people have short attention spans, and nobody will listen if you talk too long.
It is a good idea to practice your speech before giving it. Ask your friends if they will listen to you read it out loud. This can help give you confidence to speak in front of a large group, and provide useful feedback.

Get involved.,
Ask questions about school.,
Listen to your child.,
Model a positive attitude towards school and learning.",How to Help Your Kids Like School2," Volunteer in your kids’ classrooms, attend events and performances, and chaperone field trips. Join the Parent-Teacher Organization so that you know what’s going on at school. Involving yourself in your children’s education can help to keep you informed and show your kids that you’re invested in their learning.Even if you can’t volunteer during the day, attend school events such as plays, concerts, and sports games, especially if your child is participating.

, Make a stronger home-school connection by asking your child about their experiences at school. While some kids love to talk and describe their day, others may respond with a simple, “It was okay.” If your child is hesitant to open up, ask small questions to see how they’re doing in school. Ask more specific questions instead of, “How was school?” or, “What did you do?”For example, ask, “Did you sing songs?” or, “Tell me something funny that happened.”
You can also look for ways to reinforce what your child has learned at school by encouraging them to use that information in their daily life. For example, you could ask them to solve a simple math problem while preparing dinner, or ask them about a historical figure that they learned about in school and share what you know about that person as well.

, If your child is upset by something at school, listen to them. Even if you think the problem is small or silly, validate their experience and that they’re feeling lousy. Ask them about what’s happening and why they are upset. Give comfort and empathy for their experience. Let them know you support them and are there for them.Say, “I’ve noticed that you’re not liking school much lately. What’s going on?” You can also say, “I’m sorry this is hard. I’m here for you.”
You can also foster problem solving skills by asking your child what kinds of solutions might help and offering them your input as needed.

, If you express a dislike of things like reading, writing, math, or school in general, then your child may adopt the same attitude. Instead, speak positively about the benefits of education and lifelong learning.

For example, if your child brings home instructions for a science project, then you might say something like, “Ooh! I always enjoyed learning about science when I was in school! I remember getting really into my project for the science fair.”
Read books for pleasure in view of your children as well. You can also read books to your children to encourage them to enjoy reading. Try setting aside 30 to 60 minutes every day for quiet reading time where you and your kids just sit and read.

Deal with any bully issues.,
Address learning or attention problems.,
Talk to the teacher or counselor.",How to Help Your Kids Like School3," If your child is afflicted with a bully at school, take some action. Talk to your child’s teacher or principal about what’s going on. Call the child’s parents and talk to them. You can also teach your child to stick up for themselves and for others being bullied. Teaching your child to stand up to a bully helps increase their confidence and handle problems.If your child is being bullied, empathize with them and tell them that they do not deserve to be bullied about anything. Tell them to seek the assistance of an adult or tell the bully to go away.
Make sure to give your child specific suggestions for how to respond to a bully and rehearse these suggestions with them. For example, you might encourage your child to tell a bully something like, “No. You can’t have my pudding cup. Bring your own next time!”

, If your child is having a hard time understanding concepts or is struggling with certain subjects or just cannot stay focused, you may want to see if they’re experiencing learning difficulties or attention problems. Talk to your child’s teacher about difficulties you notice at home and ask if they notice any problems at school. If you both have concerns, schedule an appointment with the school psychologist or a child psychologist in your community.If your child does have learning or attention problems, they can receive accommodations in school. These accommodations can help them experience more success.

, If your child dislikes attending school, schedule a meeting with their teacher and/or school counselor. Talk about any problems they have noticed such as lagging behind academically or problems with peers. Ask them for feedback about your child’s behavior. Then, ask what can be done to help your child adjust better.Raise your concerns and talk about what your child is doing or saying that makes them dislike school.
If your child is struggling with a subject, then look into getting them some tutoring so that they can get better with the subject and gain confidence.

Never be afraid to ask smart people for tips.,
Accept feedback.,
Show interest.,
Form relationships.,
Treat smart people as equals.,
Understand why people brag.",How to Handle Smart People2," If you find yourself surrounded by smart people, you may feel compelled to hide your ignorance. Pretending like you know something you don’t can make you feel really stupid when someone figures out you don't really know what you’re talking about. If there’s something you don’t know or understand, fess up and ask questions. That’s how you learn.Don't ignore questions you can’t answer, make up answers or force the question on someone else to get the spotlight off you. Take responsibility for figuring out how to answer the question and what the correct answer is and why., Years of being smart has probably taken its toll on these people. Realize that their circumstances, personalities and personal experiences are unique. They may not have been born smart, and those who have been smart for most of their lives probably had to deal with being ostracized socially and treated differently. Their intelligence may be the only thing they have to be proud of.


When you understand more about someone’s motives and background, you may discover that you share similar insecurities. Finding out the reasons behind certain behaviors and personality traits can help you to relate and feel less intimidated by smart people.

, Smart people have years of experience exercising their intelligence. Ask them how they study for tests, do their homework, brainstorm ideas or complete certain tasks on the job. Smart people usually love to talk about what they are good at, so don't be afraid to ask them to clarify or explain certain steps so you can understand it better.

, Criticism can be rough, especially if you’re used to doing high-quality work or school assignments. It can make you feel defensive when others offer advice or critique your work. However, the people you consider smart probably have a lot of suggestions they can offer you. It is likely that they are as good at what they do because they were willing to consider outside input instead of letting criticism destroy them.


Don’t get upset if someone points out that your work could use some improvements. You want to do well and for your work to show it. Refusing to accept advice will make you appear unprofessional, and may prevent you from receiving useful feedback in the future.Find the smartest person in your class or team and ask them directly for their opinion or advice on how to resolve issues or make processes better., When you show interest in what someone has to say, it allows the other person to open up more so you can get to know them better. Ask how or why the smart person does tasks a certain way, and request that they actually show you an example of their process. Don’t let your own ego get in the way of acknowledging when someone does something in a way you hadn’t thought of before., You don’t have to be super close friends with co-workers or your peers at school but finding areas where you connect can help you get along. Ask about hobbies, kids or favorite sports teams. The more you interact positively with the smart people, the more likely they will be to help you out or offer feedback later.

, Just because these people are smart does not mean they are better than you. Be respectful, but talk to them as if they are like anyone else. Chances are, they already consider you to be one of their peers and not a minion.

, People who one-up, brag or show off to you are actually trying to impress you.When people purposefully act like they are smarter than you, it’s because they usually have low self-esteem and want validation from you. Go ahead and give them praise, even if you don’t feel like they deserve it. People who are more secure about themselves will probably not need to make you feel inferior later.


Don’t mistake self-confidence for arrogance. It's ok to take pride in your work or what you are good at.

Work together.",How to Handle Smart People3," Everything gets easier with practice. Whatever the task or issue is that you feel the others are smarter at than you, work to get better at it. Practice daily and teach yourself to be as smart as they are.


If they seem to understand math and always get As, then get a tutor, study your math book or take classes online to get better at working through math problems. With time and hard work, you will likely get as good as they are at math.
If the smart people always have good ideas at meetings, then spend extra time outside of work brainstorming ideas. Time and effort can make up for many traits you may or may not have naturally.

, Reading can inform you on many different topics. Choose diverse material from reliable sources and really delve into it. This is how the experts became experts—by studying, practicing and becoming good at what they do. When you absorb a lot of information, you have much more to offer and bounce ideas off of during discussions and meetings.

, Focus on quality over quantity. If it takes you a little longer to finish your math problems, write your paper or complete a project, then accept that—as long as the end product is worth the wait. Know that getting better at something and practicing your intelligence takes time as well. Get to know and learn from the smart people first.

, Prove to yourself as well as your teachers and peers that you are also smart. Don't be afraid to talk about your ideas or answer questions. Study and work hard, and show off your knowledge whenever you get a chance to contribute.

, When you are constantly fretting about how well the smart people are doing, you aren’t focusing on yourself. When you aren’t focusing on your own work and studies, you’re not learning or accomplishing as much as you could be. Competing with others is distracting, and it can make you feel bad if you aren't winning. Make it a habit to redirect thoughts to other things instead of how smart others are compared to you.

, Smart people will not get all your papers or work done. They will not think or study for you. If their presence bothers you, the best thing you can do for yourself is ignore them. You have better things to do than spend the energy letting yourself get upset over how smart others appear to be.

, Distract yourself with new scenery and experiences. You won’t have the time or energy to worry about what the smart people are doing. Changing up your usual routine can also really improve your mood, which may help you to stop thinking about how much smarter the people are than you.

, Be self-confident, know your strengths and learn from the smart people. Every project, paper and discussion is a chance for you to shine. Try your hardest to do the best you can, even when you think it doesn’t matter. In time, you will become one of the smart people you admire.

, Smart people can be valuable allies at school or in the work place. Instead of comparing yourself to them or competing with them, enlist their help with something. You will probably learn a lot from these people and discover that you have a lot to bring to the team as well. Ask to partner up for a study group or work project and be amazed at how beneficial this can be and how much more efficient you become.

, It sounds hard, but do what you want to do. If there's a really hot girl/guy you want to know, talk to them. If you want to experiment with a new table, go for it!

, If you want friends or just people's attention, you have to be kind and considerate.

, A very general rule that you just can't brush aside. Make them feel that you are happy to see them (even if you're not).

Valley-fold the upper right corner diagonally down.,
Line up the right edge with the left edge.,
Flip and valley-fold the bottom up.,
Repeat this fold a second time.,
Bend the top triangle down over the front.,
Tuck the tab into the top pocket.",How to Fold a Note2," Bring the upper right corner diagonally down and to the left.


The left edge of the fold should be flush to the left edge of the note.

, Fold the right edge over so that it meets and lines up with the left edge.


The lower edge of your previous fold should lie beneath your newest fold.

, Turn the paper over to the back. Fold the bottom edge up, using roughly 1/3 of the total height of the paper.

, You should use another 1/3 of the paper.


The resulting shape will look like a triangle sitting on top of a rectangle. The bottom corner of the triangle should rest just past the mid-point of the rectangle's upper edge.

, The upper tip of the triangle should meet the lower edge of the rectangle.


Don't worry if the tip falls just short of the lower edge. The note can still be completed even if this occurs.

, Fold the tip of the triangle into the diagonal that lies across the rectangle. Crease well to secure.


This step completes your basic rectangle fold.

Fold your paper in half vertically.,
Fold the upper and bottom portion into triangles.,
Fold the bottom and top and the opposite directions.,
Bring the top and bottom inward.,
Tuck the folded corners in.,
Fold each vertical side into the center.,
Fold the note in half horizontally.,
Slip the bottom layer into the top arrow.",How to Fold a Note3," Use a valley fold.


Note that the width will be halved but the height should remain unchanged.

, Bring the upper left corner diagonally down and to the right. Fold the lower right corner diagonally up and the to left. Unfold when done.


The edge of each corner should be aligned with the edge of the note.
Crease the edges well so that the fold leaves a mark.

, Bring the upper right corner diagonally down and to the left and the bottom left corner diagonally up and the the right. Unfold.


Again, the edge of each corner should be aligned to the edge of the main body of the note.
Crease well before unfolding.

, Fold the top edge down so that the edge meets with the lower marks left behind by your previous folds. Fold the bottom edge up to the corresponding lower crease.

, Push on each corner of the note, gently pressing it in between the top and bottom layers of paper.


When done, there should be a triangle at the top of the paper and a triangle at the bottom. When looking at the top triangle from the bottom, each tucked-in corner should form an ""M"" shape.

, Slightly lift the left edges of both upper triangles, exposing the bottom portion of the note. Bring the left edge in vertically toward the center and fold. Repeat with the right edge.


You should now be left with a double-sided arrow shape.
Each edge should meet with the exact vertical center of the note.

, Bring the bottom arrow up so that it overlaps the top arrow.

, Slightly unfold the note and tuck the overlapping bottom arrow into the fold of the original top arrow.


You should be left with a secure arrow that has one head.
This completes the arrow style fold.

Flip the paper and fold the sides in.,
Tuck the left side into the right and flip the note over.",How to Fold a Note4," Bring the right edge to meet the left edge.


The width will be halved while the height will remain unchanged.

, Bring the upper left corner diagonally down and to the right so that the edge of the folded triangle is flush to the edge of the main body. Fold the lower right corner diagonally up and to the left in the same manner.


Crease well, then unfold.

, Bring the upper right corner diagonally down and to the left and the lower left corner diagonally up and to the right.


The edges of both triangles should be flush to the edge of the main body of the note.
Crease well before unfolding.

, Bring the top edge down so that it meets with the bottom of the upper crease marks made by your triangle folds. Do likewise with the bottom edge by bringing it up to meet its corresponding crease marks.

, Push in on each corner, reversing its direction so that the corner is tucked in between the top and bottom layers of the note.


From the front, the resulting shape should look like a short rectangle with a triangle on the top and triangle on the bottom.
When viewed from the bottom of the fold, each tucked corner should form an ""M"" shape.

, From the back of the paper, fold the bottom triangle in and up.


The base of the triangle should line up with the new bottom of the paper.

, From the back, bring the point of the upper triangle down so that it meets the base of the lower triangle.


Crease well and unfold temporarily.
Note that the base of the upper triangle does not need to line up with the top of the paper. It is more important that the point of the upper triangle meets the base of the lower triangle.

, Take the top layer of the bottom right corner and fold it up so that it meets the point of the bottom triangle. Repeat with the bottom left corner.

, Repeat the fold needed to overlap the top and bottom triangles. Fold the top layer of the right and left corners down to meet the tip of the upper triangle.

, You will need to create a horizontal crease across the left and right sides of the newly-created top diamond.


Take the bottom tip of the left half of the newly-created top diamond. Bend the tip inward, toward the top tip of the diamond. Crease well before unfolding it back into its previous shape.
Repeat with the right half.

, Bring the right half of the bottom diamond out so that it crosses the base layer of the paper but rests behind the right half of the top diamond.


Repeat with the left half of the bottom diamond so that it rests beneath the left half of the top diamond.

, This action will create a secure diamond on the front.


Carefully unfold the right flap. Fold the right flap in the opposite direction, tucking it into the top-most pocket.
Repeat this action with the left flap.

, Turn the note over to the back and fold the right vertical edge to the left. Fold the left vertical edge to the right.


Only fold the edges as far as they will go comfortably and withing ripping.
The left side should slightly overlap the right.

, Slip the points of the left side into the corners of the right side to secure the shape. Turn the note over to the front once more.


This completes the diamond note fold.

Be sure you understand your assignments.,
Use a planner to budget your time.,
Prioritize your assignments.,
Set time aside specifically for school work.,
Have a designated work space.",How to Focus on School Work1," It is nearly impossible to focus on school work that you don’t understand. Before you leave school, try to ask the teacher or another student to explain any assignments with instructions that aren’t clear to you. Once you clearly understand what your teacher wants you to do, then you can begin focusing on your work.

Sometimes it might be helpful to see if your school offers tutoring, especially if you find that confusion over your homework is often why you struggle to focus on it.
Working with a tutor will definitely help you stay on task with your school work and help improve your grades, as well.;
, This is especially important if you have a busy extracurricular schedule or are on the forgetful side. Writing your assignments in a planner will help you visualize your day, week, or month ahead and help you plan your assignments around work and social events. This will help you stay focused on your work and keep you from becoming overwhelmed, which can lead to procrastinating.You can use either a physical notebook-style planner or download an app on your phone or tablet.
Be sure to organize your planner. Using color coded tabs or sticky notes can help you keep track of your assignments work, and extracurricular schedule. For example, use blue tabs to denote upcoming assignments or tests, red tabs to show your work schedule, and yellow tabs to show your social schedule.
If you use a physical planner, be sure to keep it neat. A chaotic-looking planner that you can't read or understand won't help you focus. Avoid scribbling out words or writing illegibly. Write neatly and be sure to write in erasable pencil or use white out to make changes to assignments written in ink.

, Beyond just budgeting time for your assignments, you will also want to rank your assignments in order of importance and due date. This will help keep you focused on assignments as they come due and keep you from getting bogged down by trying to do too many assignments at once.For example, if you have a five page English paper that’s due in a week, that assignment should take priority over a science project that’s due in a month. Tests should always be marked as high priority in your planner.
Take into account how long assignments will take, as well. Think about the ""big picture"" of your school schedule. Instead of only focusing on what is due in the next few days, for example, take a macro view and consider what assignments are due this month. Then, as time allows, make an effort to chip away at future projects. This way, when those due dates approach, you won't have to rush and stress out over how to find the time to complete those assignments., What time of the day you choose doesn’t matter, as long as you set aside a dedicated block of time for focusing on your school work. During this time, you have to mentally tell yourself that for this block of time, your only goal is to get as much school work completed as possible. The amount of time you’ll need to set aside will vary based on how much homework you have and how difficult your assignments are, so be sure to allot enough time to complete your work.If you’re a morning person, get up early, eat some breakfast, and work on assignments before school or work. If you are a night owl, then arrange for time to work before bed.
Regardless of which time of day you choose to do your work, be sure that you’re getting enough sleep. It’s counterproductive to be sleep deprived while you try to focus on your school work.

, Avoid trying to focus on your school work while watching TV or lying on your bed because it is too easy to fall asleep or get distracted. Designate a quiet area as a work-only space. This can be your kitchen table, a table at your local or campus library, or your desk in your room. Regardless of which space you choose, make sure that you have sufficient space to work and spread out so you can focus on your school work."

Dress well.,
Embrace your identity.,
Join clubs and activities.,
Get out into the community.,
Treat others with kindness.,
Show off your talents.,
Focus on the friends you have.,
Don't be afraid to use available services.,
Learn self love.,
Remember that your disability one part of you.",How to Fit in at School if You Have a Disability," Choose neat, clean clothes that fit you comfortably and match each other. You may want to follow popular fashion, or create your own style. If you look like you care about yourself, others are more likely to care about you.


Personal hygiene is important. Make sure you brush your teeth, use deodorant, and wear clean clothes. If you choose to wear makeup, get adult help or find some tutorials, so that you understand how to apply it.;
, If you use a wheelchair, get one with awesome colors, or decorate it yourself. If you're autistic, stim to your heart's content. If you act comfortable with your disability, others will be comfortable with it too.

, This is where you can meet new people who share your interests.

, Do activities and attend events like sports games, school dances, the library, concerts, museums, car shows, church, the zoo, or just about anything. You could even volunteer for organized community projects, like cleaning up the park, taking care of public gardens, or help in a soup kitchen.

, People love it when you treat them nicely. Learn how to listen well, and always assume the best of others.

, Most people with disabilities have special gifts. If you are good at a sport, go ahead and try out for the team. If you are good at music, learn to sing or play an instruments. If you have artistic talents show your art in art shows or on the Internet.

, Some people won't understand you or your disability, and that's all right. They aren't worth your time. Instead, focus on people who get you, and don't waste your time worrying about everything else. Life is too short to live by others' standards.

, Depending on your school and your disability, these will vary. Here are some examples of accommodations that disabled students could receive:


Extra time on tests
A person who takes notes for you
Access to a social worker, speech therapist, or psychologist (They may also be able to help with social skills)
Using the elevator instead of the stairs
An aide or interpreter
A separate room for exams
Sitting on an exercise ball instead of a chair

, Accept yourself the way you are, and build your self-esteem. This is important for all children and teenagers, but especially for disabled people.


Practice positive self talk. Look at yourself in the mirror, and say ""I am a worthwhile human being. Sometimes my life is rough, but I am strong, and I've got this.""
Surround yourself with others who believe in you. They are a good influence.
Read articles written by other disabled people. (There are plenty online.) Focus on your specific disability(ies), but also learn about the disability rights movement.

, It will most likely always be there, but it is not your only trait either. Many cool, super smart, successful people, and even celebrities have documented disabilities.

Wear headphones or earplugs.,
Turn off your phone.,
Avoid checking social media and other online distractions.,
Schedule work breaks.,
Set a goal and reward yourself for completing it.",How to Focus on School Work2," If you have loud roommates or siblings, it can be difficult to concentrate on your school work with noise all around you. Try wearing noise cancelling headphones or earplugs to block out audible distractions so you can better focus on your homework.


You can find foam earplugs at any drugstore or convenience store. Aim for earplugs with a Noise Rating Reduction (NRR) of 32 or 33, as this is the highest noise cancelling rating available over the counter., Your smartphone is likely one of the biggest distractions when it comes to focusing on your school work. If you can’t turn it completely off for practical reasons, then at minimum turn off wifi and data so you can’t check social media or email. Disconnect while you work on your homework, and you will find that it will be easier to focus on your work and to work faster.If you must leave your phone on, then turn it to silent (not just vibrate) so you don’t hear any incoming calls or texts to distract you from your school work.

, The computer can be just as distracting and addicting as your phone, so it’s important to minimize distractions there, as well. Because you likely need the internet to do a lot of your assignments, it’s not as simple to “disconnect” while you’re on a computer. You’ll need to actively stay off of social media and gaming sites in order to focus on your work.Consider browser extensions that disconnect social media for you. Browser extensions like Nanny (Google Chrome) and Mac Freedom (Windows and Mac compatible) block your access to your top time-wasting websites., After working for a solid 45 minutes, give yourself a break for 15 minutes. Get up and stretch, have a snack, or check your phone. This will help you reset and recharge so you can continue focusing on your school work.Make sure that you set a timer or alarm clock so that your breaks are only fifteen minutes. Dragging breaks out longer can derail your efforts to focus on and complete your school work.

, Homework is no fun. However, if you set attainable goals for yourself and reward yourself for completing them, it will help make school work seem less overwhelming.For example, tell yourself that you need to finish your algebra homework within an hour so that you can watch your favorite show before bed. Setting a goal with a clear reward at the end will help motivate you to stay focused on completing your work."
"
Work on one assignment at a time.,
Don’t try to do too much at once.,
Speak with your guidance counselor or advisor.,
Take care of yourself.,
Talk with your doctor if nothing is helping you.",How to Focus on School Work3," Pacing yourself is important because it is easy to become overwhelmed and distracted if you try to work on too many assignments at once. Approach your homework one piece at a time, and work on each piece to completion. Avoid having two or three half-completed assignments, as this can be stressful.

, Make sure that you aren’t setting yourself up for failure by setting unrealistic goals for yourself. Trying to complete too much school work in too short a time is a recipe for stress and discouragement.


For example, don’t expect that you can come home from school and spend an hour writing a quality ten page paper. Research papers take time to both write and research, so it’s unrealistic to expect to squeeze all of that work into one evening. Instead, spread your writing and research out across several days to make the project more manageable.

, If you are truly struggling to focus on your school work despite taking steps to help refocus yourself, try speaking with your advisor or guidance counselor. He or she might be able to help you see issues that you missed, such as an overly heavy course load.Asking for their help is nothing to be ashamed of. In fact, it’s their job to help you when you are struggling!

, Even the best time management and homework techniques won’t be helpful if you aren’t taking care of yourself first. Be sure that you are getting enough sleep and eating properly. Pulling all-nighters to complete your homework might work in the short term. However, this technique will backfire because you’ll become exhausted and have even more difficulty focusing on your work.Don’t skip meals, especially breakfast. Even if you aren’t hungry in the mornings, have some juice or pack a portable snack like an apple or a granola bar for later., If you have tried many different techniques to focus on your school work and spoken with your advisor or counselor, then it might be helpful for you to talk to your doctor about your struggles. He or she might test you for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) to see if that could be the cause of your concentration problems.If your doctor determines that you have this disorder, then he or she might recommend medications, dietary changes, therapy, or a combination of these to Treat ADHD.

Choose wisely.,
When on the field, run at a normal speed, not too much to tire you out and not to slow to make it obvious that you aren't trying.,
Hang around the other team.,
Make sure you don't get anyone's flag.,
When you are out, go to the very back of the line.,
If you can choose your position, choose defence.,
If playing defence, don't move from your spot and make sure that you watch the ball and maybe step closer to the side of the gym that the ball is on to make it seem like you want to get it.

,
Move your stick around every once in a while.,
Look engaged.,
If you are doing push-ups, go all the way down and stay for the amount of time that everyone else takes to do two.,
Bend a lot.,
For sit-ups, only sit up halfway.,
Choose the right weights.,
Act puffed out.",How to Fake Your Way Through Gym Class and Still Get a Good Grade," When you choose your flag, choose the biggest size. Put the flag directly at your waist and clip it together loosely. Have your flag in plain view. This way, someone can easily grab your flag and get you out of the game.;
, When you are running, go for the best player's flag. They will realize that you are trying to steal their flag and take yours.

, Preferably in the center where you can plainly be seen and have your flag stolen easily. Go near the weak players at times so it isn't obvious.

, If you are playing horribly one minute, then capturing ten flags the next then your teacher will know something's up.

, Make sure you are watching the game intently to make it seem like you want to play.

, You will only have to stand near the goalie and hit the puck away if it comes near you. If you cannot choose your position, then hang around the good players. They will hit the ball for you if it comes near because they know you aren't a strong player

,, Maybe hit someone else's stick ""by accident"" so it seems like you are trying hard.

, When it isn't your turn, watch the game. Don't zone out because it will be obvious that you don't want to play the game.

, Therefore when everyone is sweaty from doing thirty, you will have only done fifteen.

, When doing pull-ups, bend your elbows and jump. Maybe bend your legs too. This is the perfect time to use a fake injury to get out of exercising. Say you hurt your wrist or something like that. If they send you to the nurse, don't go to the nurse. Just go to the bathroom or take a walk around the school. Just make sure you have a pass to avoid unwanted detention!

, Then the next time don't do one. Then go halfway, then don't do one, and so on. Do a real sit-up for the last one they call. You don't want to seem like you aren't trying.

, There will probably be a selection of weights you can choose from. Choose the second to lightest one. You don't want your faking to be obvious.Then when lifting it, don't strain too much. Just lift. You don't even have to lift it all the way. Just make it seem like you are making an effort.

, When time is up, when you drop your weight, go ""phew!"" Then you can wipe the ""sweat"" from your forehead.

Prepare some conversation starters.,
Practice a conversation before it happens.,
Put yourself out there.,
Start with the people in your class.,
Be approachable.,
Pick up on social cues.,
Listen to other people.,
Resolve conflicts.",How to Fit In at School1," Starting a conversation with someone that you do not know is difficult. Prepare yourself by thinking of some conversation starters. Some easy ways to start a conversation are to introduce yourself, give a compliment, or ask a question.

Knowing what you are going to say already will stop you from being as nervous or freezing up.

Introduce yourself by saying something like, ""Hi, my name is John. You're in my class/your locker is next to mine...""
You can also compliment someone's clothing, hair, or anything else that you notice about them.
Ask someone in your class about an assignment or about taking notes. Even if you already know what the assignment is, it's still ok to ask just to get the conversation started.
If you are not ready to have a full on conversation with someone, simply smile and say hello. Try smiling and saying hello to one new person each day. Then you can build up to asking a question or giving a compliment.If you are joining a conversation that has already started, listen to understand what the conversation is about. When no one else is talking, make a short comment that relates to the ongoing conversation.;
, Try writing down what you plan to say or saying it out loud in front of the mirror. You can also practice with another person in your family. The conversation you actually have does not have to go exactly as you planned it, but it is still good to practice and build your confidence.If you try something out and it does not work as you planned, try a different approach next time. Don't beat yourself up because things don't go as planned; no one is perfect.

, You are not the only the person that is trying to fit in at school. Sometimes you have to be a little assertive to get the process started.Try talking to a person that is alone. It's less intimidating to talk to one person instead of a group of people. A person that's alone may also be in the same situation you are in.

If you see someone is sitting alone, observe the person for a second. Are they reading a book? Do you like their outfit, shoes, or hair? You can then introduce yourself and comment on something you observed about them. You may say, ""Hi, how is the book you're reading?"" or ""Hey, I really like your shirt. My name is...""

, Having a class with someone is a quick way to establish common ground.You will be more comfortable talking to someone that you are sitting next to than going up to a random person in the cafeteria. Simply introduce yourself to the people that you sit next to. If you cannot think of anything to talk about, you can always talk about the class you all have together.

, You don't always have to start the conversation. Other people may want to talk to you if you look approachable. Smile at people as they walk by. Don't walk around with headphones or with your arms crossed.Be the type of person that you wouldn't mind going up to yourself.

, You can learn a lot by observing the body language, facial expressions of others, and voice tone. People often speak without saying anything. Understanding what people are saying can help you identify if someone is in a good or bad mood, if someone is annoyed or upset, or is someone is happy. This will help you respond in an appropriate way.


Raised eyebrows can signal that someone is surprised or questioning something.A smile indicates that someone is happy. While a frown shows that someone is upset.
Slumped shoulders show that someone is tired.
If someone has crossed arms and a mean look on their face, it would not be a good time to approach and start a conversation.
Foot tapping and fidgeting indicates that the person may be nervous or irritated.
Fast talking shows that someone is excited or trying to get an important point across., Listening is an important communication skill that can help you at school. Always look at the other person when he or she is speaking to you and wait until the person is finished speaking before you say something. While the other person is talking, try not to fidget, look around, laugh, or do anything that shows you are not paying attention.

You can nod while the other person is talking to show that you understand what is being said. You can also say ""ok,"" or ""I understand"" to show that you are listening as well.

, Having the ability to resolve conflicts will help you be accepted by your peers and make friends.If you are involved in a conflict, try to be a leader and help get everything sorted out. Suggest to everyone involved that all of you should work together and be peaceful (e.g. no name calling, blaming, or yelling). Then let everyone tell their perspective on the issue. Once all perspectives are on the table, find the common thread in everyone's perspective. Lastly, brainstorm about ways to resolve the conflict and come to an agreement.


Respect other people's feelings and ideas during the conflict.
Conflict happens in all types of relationships and is completely normal.

Do not freak out!,
Clinch your anus when you feel your stomach growl.,
Wait until the teacher starts talking before you fart.,
Lean forward on your chair, so that your torso is on the table and your butt is puckered out (your butt cheeks will be split so the fart won't be able to flap between them).

,
Slowly let the fart come out.

,
Once the fart is over, sit upright in your chair and begin to sniff the air.

,
Never say ""Who farted?""",How to Fart in Class Without Anyone Noticing," Remember that there is a way to fart and still be savvy.;
, Even though you may feel immense pressure, it's best to not let the fart come out while your stomach is growling. The more pressure you feel, the more deadly and loud the fart will be when it comes out. So make sure your stomach isn't growling before you let one rip.


Clinch your fists to attempt to hold it in. Bite your lower lip (if necessary). Do anything to discreetly try and mask that you have to fart.
If the feeling increases, clinch your buttocks muscles. Hard.

, This way everyone will be busy focusing and the teacher's voice will mask the fart noise.

,,,, or ""Did you fart?"". Other students may assume whoever smelt it dealt it. If someone else asks who farted, say ""You farted!"" To someone next to you.


If people start suspecting that you farted, pretend to smell the air about you. Announce ""This room smells like farts"". This will transfer the suspicion to someone else.

Build self-confidence.,
Develop your interests and talents.,
Start your own group.,
Be optimistic.",How to Fit In at School2," Everyone likes to be around confident people. It is important that you have positive thoughts, feelings, and beliefs about yourself. We are often hard on ourselves when we make mistakes or compare ourselves to others. While these negative thoughts are normal, you can replace them with more positive things.

Focus on the positive instead of the negative. Everyday write down three good things about yourself or three things that went well because of something you did.Did you give someone a compliment today? Did you help your mom with dinner? Did you answer a question correctly in class today? All of these things matter.
Mistakes are a part of life. Instead of beating yourself up about them, think about them as a learning opportunity instead. If you did poorly on a test, tell yourself that you will study harder next time to improve your score.
If you are very critical of yourself and think harsh thoughts, combat those thoughts with positive self-talk. Ask yourself, ""Would I speak to my friend like this?""You would never tell your friend that he or she wasn't smart or funny or a loser. You would encourage your friend and talk about all of their good qualities.
Don't be afraid to try new things. It's perfectly fine to not do everything perfectly or be good at everything that you do. Just give yourself credit for trying and doing your best., Everyone is interested in different things (e.g. music, sports, art, theater, anime, science, board games, etc.). It is important that you explore and find what interests you and what you are good at. If you are good at drawing or playing the piano, try to do those things to the best of your ability. Go to art class or music class. Being good at something will help be more confident as well.

Never change your interests based on what you think is popular or what other people like.
It may take time to identify your talents and gifts. If you are not sure what you are good at, ask some people that know you well. Your family, friends, and teachers may have an idea. Ask them and see what they say.

, You may feel like no one else is interested in the same things you are, but you are wrong. There will be people at your school who like the same things you like. You should never pretend to like something or be someone else to fit in. Go where people are that share your interests. Sometimes you have to be assertive and take some action.


Observe other people at school to help identify what they are interested in. Pay attention to the books and magazines they read, graphics on their t-shirts, or just any conversations that you may hear.
If you are interested in something and would like to start a school club around the interest, talk to one of your teachers about starting the process. They will be able to point you in the right direction., Having a positive outlook on life will make you happier and more successful.Try to identify all the good things in your life and believe that you can make good tings happen for yourself. If things don't go your way,find a positive takeaway instead of blaming yourself. When things go right or you do something well, be proud of yourself.

Tell yourself positive things. ""If I study hard, I will do well on my test."" or ""If I join that club at school, I will meet some new friends.""
Instead of saying, ""I don't fit in because I'm a loser."" say, ""I haven't found my niche yet, but I'm going to say hi to 2 people I don't know tomorrow.""

Join a club or organization.,
Observe the school dynamics.,
Try sitting at different groups during lunchtime.,
Do not be afraid to float.,
Introduce yourself to your teachers.,
Invite people to your house.,
Be a good friend.",How to Fit In at School3," It is easier to bond with someone when you all have similar interests. Join a club or an organization at your school that aligns with your interests. This is a great way to meet people who like the same things that you like. You will always have things to talk about with people who like the same things that you do. Joining a club will also give you an opportunity to talk to people outside of normal school hours.

If you are not sure about the different organizations at your school, ask a teacher or a guidance counselor. They will be able to point you in the right direction.

, Become familiar with your classmates and other people in your school. Take the time to identify the different cliques and which students seem to be friendly. Are there students who seem rude or make fun of other people? Are you drawn to certain groups of people or particular students? Once you understand the school better, you identify where you would like to fit in.Take your time figuring out your place. It can be hard to change groups once start hanging out with a particular group.

, When you have sat with each group you are interested in becoming a part of, choose a group that you most enjoy being around. Not all groups will accept you; sit near a group and they may invite you to sit with them. If they don't, go up and introduce yourself. If they don't seem to like you, or are mean or negative towards you, they're not worth making friends with and you can find better people to be around.


If you walk by a table and see an empty seat, you can say, ""Hi, is anyone sitting here?"" or ""Do you mind if I sit next to you?""
Bring your lunch to school to make things a little easier. You can avoid waiting in line or walking around trying to find somewhere to sit. If you bring your lunch, you can immediately sit down when you walk into the cafeteria., There may not be only one group for you. Many people hang out with different groups at school or only hang out with a couple of people. Figure out what you are most comfortable with. You may eat lunch with one group and talk to different people in the hallway or after school. It is important for you to be happy and have a sense of belonging at your school. So associate with all the people that you want to.

, Your teachers are a great resource at your school. They know the school and students better than you do. Your teachers can suggest some students that you can talk to or even introduce you to some people you can be friends with. Get to class early or stay a little later to introduce yourself to your teacher.Your teachers can also help you deal with conflicts that you may have with other people at school.
Having a good relationship with your teachers will help you to have a more positive experience at your school., After a few weeks of getting to know these people, invite a few of them over to your house to hangout or do homework. Spending time outside of class can help you develop deeper friendships and really get to know people.Having real friends will make fitting in at school much easier.

, The best way to make new friends is to be a good friend yourself. Be loyal, honest, and fun to be around.Think of all the qualities that you look for in a friend and the things that attract you to certain people.Well, those are the same things that will help you fit in with people at your school.


Show genuine interest in other people. Ask someone how their day is going or what did they do over the weekend. Ask questions that will require more than just a yes or a no. For example, say ""How was your weekend?"" instead of ""Did you have a good weekend?""
Share with other people. If you have some food, ask your friend if he or she would like some.
Help other people. If you see someone trying to carry something and open a door, go hold the door for them.

It will be fun to see how long you can sustain the interaction and then talk afterwards about the funny faces that you were making.
Watch out that you don’t make eye contact with someone who may tell on you or find it uncomfortable or offensive.

, If you have a large class it may be easy to start a quiet conversation in the back without disturbing the rest of the class. Start your conversation when the teacher isn’t in earshot. Avoid trying to chat with people trying to listen to the teacher. It will be obvious who else wants to waste time with you because her eyes may be wandering.


Say something like “Is it just me or do you find this stuff boring too?”, Use your imagination to create a story about mundane things like the chipped paint on the wall or the cowlick on your classmate’s head.

Class time should be valuable so try to examine why you feel the need to waste your time in class., If you want to waste time in class because your teacher isn’t making a connection, talk to him after class. Let him know that you don’t feel engaged and see if you can come up with a solution together. Your teacher will appreciate that you’ve taken initiative and will focus on getting you engaged.If you still feel the need to waste time in class despite your teacher’s efforts, talk to your parents and vice principal. Chances are you have already been in trouble for wasting time in class. You may need to find a solution your teacher alone can’t provide.

, Class may not be challenging so you feel the need to waste time and challenge yourself. Rather than wasting time doing something unproductive you could focus on your work and become engaged in the class. Ask questions or ask for special projects or presentations., If you feel like no one’s paying attention to you it’s easy to waste time in class. Listen to your lecture and ask questions about what you are interested in. Ask questions to your classmates if you don’t understand what they are asking or if you simply want them to participate to. Get the topic going in a direction that gets everyone engaged.You may ask the teacher to have a debate so that your mind must work to create a valid argument.

, Class is more enjoyable when you work with your friends. Often classes won’t allow you to talk to your classmates but group work sets aside time for that. While you still need to get the work done, group activities gives you a chance to waste a bit of time as you talk to your classmates."
"
Decide carefully when to zone out.,
Sit away from the teacher.,
Ask or answer a question early in the class.,
Listen to your teacher.",How to Zone Out when a Teacher Is Talking to You and Not Get Caught1," If you zone out during a presentation or a time when you’re expected to speak in class, your cover will be blown. If, on the other hand, you zone out during someone else’s presentation, or on a day when the class sees a film, you’ll be far more likely to successfully zone out without getting caught.;
, A seat far from the teacher is a good place to zone out for two reasons. First, it will provide crucial distance between you and anything which might disrupt your thought vacation. Second, it will reduce the chances of you being discovered for zoning out. If you’re using an electronic device to block out the teacher’s lecture, you’re less likely to be caught when you’re not sitting front and center in the teacher’s line of sight.

, When you show that you are engaged, the teacher will be less likely to call on you again. Asking or answering a question before you zone out will ensure you earn your requisite participation points with the teacher while limiting the likelihood he or she will expect more of you later.

, This seems counterintuitive: how can you zone out when you’re paying attention? But if the class is so boring that you’d dig up an article online about how to zone out and get away with it, chances are that you’re stuck in a truly boring class. Listening to a few minutes of your teacher drone on about binomial fractions or Wuthering Heights is sure to numb your brain enough to allow the zoning-out process to spontaneously take over.

"
"
Rest your eyes.,
Get comfortable.,
Engage in a simple, repetitive motion.,
Don’t try to focus.,
Let your mind wander.,
Distract yourself.,
“Write” in your notebook.,
Focus on a point in front of you.,
Have a friend act as a lookout.,
Listen for key words.,
Offer vague answers.,
Balance zoning out and paying attention.",How to Zone Out when a Teacher Is Talking to You and Not Get Caught2," Reduce your rate of blinking. Don’t close your eyes or you might fall asleep, but don’t focus your eyes on anything in particular. You can look at your desk, your book, or the floor. Imagine you’re staring through the object directly in front of you. If you wear glasses, remove them. Give your eyes a gentle rub before zoning out.

, Lean back against your chair. Plant both feet on the floor. If possible, remove your shoes. If you’re wearing a constricting tie or jacket, loosen or remove it. Breathe in slowly and evenly, inhaling through your nose.

, For instance, you might roll a marble back and forth between your thumb and index finger. Or you might wiggle a pen or pencil rapidly in your hand using the same fingers. Using an object in this way can help you concentrate on your personal daydreams or fantasy., Trying to fight a daydream or a zoned-out feeling by shaking your head, arching your eyebrows up and opening your eyes wider, or rubbing your face or eyes vigorously in an attempt to “snap out of it” will draw attention to your efforts. Instead, let yourself return from the period of zoning out naturally. Return from your zone-out session slowly.

, Thinking about things you’ll be doing later when you’re out of class, or things you did yesterday are some of the easiest things to daydream about.Alternately, you could imagine yourself in an exciting adventure with wizards, monsters, and/or space aliens. Don't smile or show any emotion to the imaginary visions you're seeing or you might get caught.

, It’s easy to become immersed in a good e-book, or a show. A simple classic like solitaire, pong, or chess is available on almost every laptop. Newer games with 3-D graphics and lots of exciting action are good choices too if you turn the volume off. Any entertaining distraction can help you zone out and ignore what’s going on around you.


Be careful not to let your teacher see you using these devices in class; you’re likely to have them taken away.

, Don’t write words or take notes, just move your pencil or pen up and down with its tip suspended just above the page. Stare at the page but do not focus on it. Unless your teacher is paying close attention to you, the movement of the pen up and down across the page is likely to fool them into believing you are actively engaged in note-taking. This is a good way to zone out without getting caught.

, It could be on the desk, on the floor, or on your book. Keep your eyes on that spot but relax your eyes. Looking at a nearby object in a natural way will prevent you from getting caught zoning out.


Pretend you’re reading the book. Stare intently at the book in front of you. Your teacher will think you’re reading or reviewing material relevant to the lecture, but you’re really just using the book as a zero point.

, Tell your friend “Hey, I’m going to zone out for a few minutes. Please let me know if I should be doing something or if I miss something important.” Begin your zone-out session. After you come back, thank your friend for his or her help. Copy the notes they took in the last few minutes while you were mentally checked out.

, If your teacher has words or phrases he or she frequently uses like ""Got it?"" or ""Understand?"", you can listen for them and mentally drop out until you hear them. When people are hypnotized, the hypnotist always plants a wake-up cue in their minds so they will not be hypnotized forever. Usually, they use a small bell to wake their subjects up. Think of your teacher’s catchphrase(s) as your little bell. Limiting your zone-out time and returning to attention in this way will ensure you don't get caught.

, If your teacher suspects you’re drifting off into your own private world, you might be called on to answer a question. Reply with answers that could plausibly be those of a fully engaged student. “Could you please repeat the question?” and “I’m not sure” are both acceptable, though your teacher might be upset at your inability to proffer the correct answer.


If your teacher asks if you’re listening to him or her, apologize but deny zoning out. Say instead that you were thinking about what had just been said. This can be risky, since your teacher may then follow up on your comment and ask you to relay what they just said, or your thoughts about it.

, Don’t zone out during the entirety of your class. Only zone out for as much time you need to feel refreshed and relaxed. If you zone out the entire time you’re in class, the odds that you’ll be caught by your teacher increase dramatically. Plus, you’re likely to miss something that you might need to know later.

Avoid eating a heavy carb load before class.,
Come to class well rested.,
Read the material being covered in class.,
Find at least one interesting thing in the course material for the day.,
Make a game out of listening for keywords from the teacher.,
Count how many students say something in class.",How to Zone Out when a Teacher Is Talking to You and Not Get Caught3," Carbs provide fuel for your body, especially when you’re engaged in athletic events requiring endurance. While it’s a good idea to load up on carbs before engaging in physical activity, doing so before class can lead to postprandial somnolence, better known as a food coma. A food coma is the feeling of drowsiness following a meal with lots of carbs.


Carbohydrates in foods with a high glycemic index like snacking crackers, cookies, and soda are more easily digested than foods with a lower glycemic index, and leads easily to exhaustion and sleepiness.A balanced meal of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains is the best option to stay alert during class.

, Failing to get adequate sleep can lead to deficits in energy, motivation, and concentration.You will be more easily distracted and less likely to remember what was talked about or covered in class if you have not gotten at least 6-8 hours of sleep each night. Set a regular bedtime for yourself which enables you to obtain the requisite amount of sleep. If you wake at 6, for instance, tuck into bed around 10 the night before.

, If you read the material which will be covered in class the night before you go, you’ll have a better time keeping up with what the teacher is talking about. Use your reading to come up with some questions to ask in class. Coming into a class with some background knowledge will help you better connect with the new material presented in the lecture.

, As you take notes, if anything surprises you or makes you laugh, put a star by it. This will help improve your recall later and make the class more enjoyable. It’s always more fun to be in a class where you find at least something of interest than it is to be in a class where everything is boring. Listening and looking actively for an interesting tidbit will keep you alert and engaged.

, For instance, if the class is about the American Revolution, count the number of times you hear the word “Revolution.” Each time you hear it, put a small tally at the top corner of your notebook. Listening actively and being engaged in what the teacher is saying will keep you focused and prevent you from zoning out.

, Each time a student speaks, make a note of what they asked and what the answer was. Paying attention to what your classmates say can be a good source of information. Oftentimes, a teacher will address interesting and significant information in response to a student’s question. Paying attention to your peers’ comments and questions is not only respectful, but it can increase your attention on the class as a whole.

Have fun.",How to Survive the First Day of School," You're going to be lost if you skip this step. It's the most important. Make sure that you have all your school supplies, such as folders, paper, pencils, and pens. Your school will most likely have the list online, at a store, or you could pick it up from the school. If you can't find a list, just get what you think you'll need.


Get your schedule before the first day of school, this saves you from getting lost. Look over it a few times before the first day of school, or visit the school and take a look around.;
, It'll probably make you feel more confident if you're not wearing the same clothes as last year. Of course, it really doesn't matter if you wear the same outfits, but at least have a few new outfits to wear.


Make sure whatever you wear follows your school's dress code.

, Plan out what you're going to wear and what you will need for class. Also, put out any makeup, accessories, or any hair products you'll be using.


Put your school supplies, bag, gym clothes, lunch bag etc. together in an easy place to find so in the morning you can just pick it up and go without having to search for them all.

, Have sufficient change for last-minute needs, snacks, a cab home in an emergency.

, There's nothing worse than looking terrible on the first day of school. If you tend to oversleep, set an alarm on your phone, iPod, or alarm clock to wake you up on time.

, You'd be surprised how much happier and more focused you'll be after eating a good breakfast. Try cereals & muesli, toast, pancakes, fruits, or other filling and healthy breakfasts. A protein rich breakfast may make you feel sluggish and high GI or sugar rich foods may affect your ability to stay focused.

, It's your call. If you want something familiar and routine, take a bus ride and sit next to someone you already know (no need to add to the nerves by sitting next to a stranger, you can conquer that on the second day back). However, if you are really nervous and want your parent to drive you to school for comfort, have them drive, but expect that there will be heavy traffic.

, Get to the bus stop early in case it comes earlier then you'd expect.

,,, You want to seem approachable and like you had the best summer (even if you didn't). Instead of coming off as a boring or sullen person, compliment people. Everyone needs a little confidence boost on the first day of school.


Be friendly to the new kids who might be there.
Smile, and wave to anyone you remember from last year.

, You might want to do this before the first day of school though, because you'll want to make it to your classes on time!


Call up your friends that go to the same school and arrange to meet up in the morning, that way you won't have to sit alone at lunch or wonder where they are.
Sit next to people you feel comfortable with if it is not possible to get lunch with your friends.

, Don't be worrying about your upcoming class, or thinking about how your friends said Mrs. Smith is terrible and evil when she's four classes away. You need to focus on meeting your new teacher, taking notes, listening to rules, etc. Daydreaming on the first day of school is a terrible, wrong idea and will probably give your new teacher a bad first impression.

, However, don't be needy and begging for friends, just be yourself. New schools are also a great opportunity to change your style without people making fun of you or thinking you're phony.


Look for friendly faces.
Show a friendly face, smile (smile back if someone smiles at you).

, ""It's hot."" ""She's mean"" ""This is boring"" ""My lunch was nasty"". Be positive. Nobody likes to hang around a moper.

, It's good to get into practice using your diary early. Also write down what you'll need to buy in addition to the things already purchased––usually these are things the teachers request at the start.

, They are nervous as well. Some people are just horrible at good first impressions.

, If you want to, you can put it in your phone so you have it secure.

, School doesn't always have to be boring. Make jokes, talk to people, sing. Do something crazy! Remember not to be disruptive when you should be paying attention, though. If you want time to fly by, enjoying yourself is a great way.

Ask your child what is going on.,
Find out if they are struggling with a particular subject.,
See if their courses are too easy.,
Determine if their courses are too difficult.",How to Figure Out Why Your Child Struggles in School1," Sit down with your child, tell them they are not in any trouble and that you want to talk about school. Ask them how school is going. Give them the space to talk. Listen attentively and write up some notes afterward. If necessary, ask your child follow up questions to figure out whether there is a problem with a teacher, a classmate or a particular subject.For example, you could ask them:


“What do you think of your teacher this year?”
“Do you have any new friends at school?”
“Are there any really hard classes this year?”
“What is hardest about school?”;
, It is important to know whether it is one subject in particular that your child finds difficult. Although your child may be performing poorly across the board, it could be that one subject is at the root of their challenges.Start by asking your child if there is a particularly challenging subject and then inquire with their teacher:


“Is there one subject in particular that they are having a hard time with?”
“Do you think one subject is at the root of their struggle?”

, If the subject matter of one or more of their courses is too easy, your child may not be sufficiently engaged. You can determine whether it is too easy by examining the textbooks or other course materials, as well as by observing your child doing their homework. If the materials are too elementary, their struggle may be a result of disengagement rather than any learning difficulty., It is possible that your child’s school struggles are a result of inappropriate placement. Examine the textbook and related course materials to see if they are at an appropriate level of difficulty. Then, observe your child completing their homework and see how much trouble they have with it. If the material is too difficult for them, they simply need to take a lower level subject that includes appropriate introductory material. After taking the introductory course, your child may be in a better position to perform."

Don't offend the seniors.,
Try a lot of clubs and activities, but not every one of them.,
Go to the Homecoming game and dance.,

",How to Transition From Elementary School to High School," High school is a great experience that you can only do once, so be prepared for fun! If you have any friends who are upperclassmen, connect with them so you'll see familiar faces on the first day of school.;
, You might learn some of the school's traditions, rules, and staff. You should also get used to the size and feel of the school. However, if you're feeling uncomfortable, sit with some old middle school friends or talk with a guidance counsellor. Sharing problems will help ease the stress.

, Or, if you are at a totally new school where you know no one, try asking people about their interests, and eventually you'll be friends.

, Your teachers will have a higher expectation of you than in eighth grade, but they'll be a little easier the first or second week. Also, you'll want to make a great first impression.

, Watching 10th graders and doing what they do is a good start, but don't try to fit in rudely, by pretending to like things you really don't like, just to be popular. Hang around people who can give info, as to what is acceptable for a freshmen to do.

, Ask your big brother/sister questions and listen to the answers.

, For example, if they have a business on selling stuff at lockers, don't start selling stuff out of your locker. They will feel like you're mocking them, so don't try to copy seniors. Let them be who they want to be, they're graduating.

, There will be a wider range of things to do in high school, besides your academics, so pick 1-2 clubs and establish yourself. But don't try out for every club, as a freshman can only handle so much work and clubs.

, You'll have so much fun, you'll realize that those 8th grade dances were nothing!

You may also need money to pay for certain things, depending on your school and its requirements, so you should discuss that with your parents.


If your parents are required to be involved in orientation, they will need to work that into their schedules and be aware of dates and times.
You can start a conversation with your parents by saying, “Can we talk about my orientation tomorrow? I’d like to go over a few things.”
If you would like some extra time to walk around the school to find your classrooms, talk to your parents and let them know that you would like an extra hour or so to do this. You can say, “I’d like extra time at orientation to be able to walk around and see my classrooms” to start a conversation with your parents about this.

, Work with your parents or guardians to determine who will pick you up and drop you off or how to use the public transportation in your area, if applicable. Maybe you will even choose to walk or bike to your orientation if you live close enough.


If your parents will be picking you up and dropping you off, work with them to determine what time you need to be there and what time you should be leaving the house to be there on time. Then work to determine how long you will be there and what time they should plan to pick you up. You can ask, “What time should we leave the house in the morning so that I get to orientation on time?”
If one of your friends is going to orientation at the same time as you, you can ask if their parents would mind picking you up and/or dropping you off. Your parents and your friend’s parents may even coordinate times that they can pick up and drop off you and your friend. Ask your parents’ permission before doing this. You can also arrange to be with your friend at orientation, which could make it much more fun.
If you will be using public transportation, look at bus/train schedules to find out what time you need to be at the bus or train stops. Google Maps will often provide routes via public transportation, which can be very useful and save you time.If you are walking, make sure that you know exactly how to get there. Talk to your parents about which route to take if you are unsure.
If you plan to ride your bike, look it over night before. Make sure that the tires have air in them and that your bike is in working order. It would be a good idea to take it for a test ride if it’s not too dark out. If the bike is broken, you will need to repair it yourself, ask a parent to assist you repair it, or take it to a shop.

, It’s a good idea to bring a backpack to orientation because it is likely that you will be bringing home plenty of books and papers.


Make sure to pack any forms that you or your parents filled out. Designate a special folder for these forms so that you don’t lose them in the bottom of your backpack or get them mixed in with other papers.
You can ask your parents if they have filled out the necessary forms by posing the question: “Have you filled out the forms for my orientation? I’m getting ready to pack my backpack.”
If your high school provided you with a list of things that you’ll need for orientation, review the list and make sure that everything is in your backpack and ready to go. If you need assistance, ask a parent or guardian for help with the task by saying, “Can you please help me make sure that I have everything on my list for orientation?”

, It’s a good idea to have the next day’s outfit picked out and ready to go the night before so that you don’t spend too long deciding what to wear the next morning and end up being late to your orientation.


Pick out your outfit and set it aside on a hanger or neatly folded somewhere in your room.
Pick out what shoes you would like to wear and set them near your outfit so that you know where they are and they are ready to go.
Decide how you plan to style your hair for orientation. If you need to prepare anything for your hair the night before, you will be able to do so by already deciding how you plan to style your hair.
Set out your toiletries in the bathroom or bedroom (depending on your preference). This is a good time to determine which shampoo, conditioner, soap, hair products, makeup (if applicable), and hair brushes you would like to use in the morning and have them ready to go.
If you shower at night, make sure that you have the toiletries for your morning routine ready to go in your bedroom and/or bathroom to save time by having to look for things or not knowing what you would like to use.

, It’s a good idea to get plenty of rest the night before orientation so that you are well-rested and ready to face the day. If you have a nightly routine, start it a little earlier than usual and take your time so that you can prepare your mind and body for sleep.


If you have trouble sleeping, a great way to fall asleep is to read while you are in bed.
If you are worried about falling asleep quickly, try sipping on a warm drink before you go to bed, such as warm milk or chamomile tea. The warmth of the drink will help you relax.
Taking a warm shower or bath before bed can help you fall asleep quickly. This is because the warmth of the shower or bath raises your body temperature and the subsequent cooling effect of stepping out of the shower or bath lowers your body temperature, inducing drowsiness., Waking up early will ensure that you will have plenty of time to get ready and prepare for the day ahead. Waking up early in general can be correlated with better grades.Set your alarm clock an hour earlier than you normally do so that you do not have to rush and can have a relaxing morning routine. Using an alarm clock will help wake you up at the desired time.
If you have a phone, you can set an alarm using your iPhone or Android phone. This is generally done by using the default alarm application or downloading a third-party alarm application to use.
Avoid hitting the snooze button. It’s an important day and you need to make sure that you are able to leave your house on time and not be late to your orientation.

,


Eat breakfast.
Brush your teeth.
Shower, if you choose to.
Get dressed with the clothes you set out the night before.
Style your hair, if you choose to.
Apply makeup, if applicable.

, Before leaving the house, check your backpack to make sure that you have all the required forms, documents, and materials for orientation.

, If you have a schedule, look at it to see where you need to be at the time you have arrived. You may have to wait around for a bit, depending on how early you are.


Follow all directions and listen carefully in the orientation. Take notes if you feel you need to.
Remember that you can socialize with friends anytime, but the information you are getting at your orientation is critical to understanding how your school works and what the expectations are for its students.

, If you know that some of your friends are going to orientation at the same time as you, arrange a time and place for you and your friends to meet. This way, you’ll have someone familiar by your side while you are learning about your new school.


Call, text, or message your friends the night before to find out what time they are going to be at their orientation. If they are going at the same time as you, ask if they would like to meet somewhere and go through orientation together. Being with a friend can make orientation much more fun!
Remember to pay attention to information being given to you, even though you are with your friends. You don’t want to miss out on anything important.

, If you do not already have your schedule for school, it is likely that you will be receiving it at orientation. Follow the instructions given to you at your orientation to obtain your schedule.


Once you receive your schedule, look it over to make sure that it is correct. If the classes look incorrect, ask a nearby teacher or instructor for help. You can say, “Excuse me, would you mind helping me? It looks like I have the wrong class on my schedule.”
Review your schedule carefully to see what time your classes are and what classrooms they are located in.
If you are with friends, you can compare your schedule with theirs to see if you share any classes. This can be the most exciting part of receiving your schedule!

, This often involves standing in a line to get your picture taken. You may or may not receive the card the same day that you get the picture taken.


When it is your turn, follow the photographer’s instructions. They may tell you to face your body a certain way or to tilt your head in a certain direction. This is so that the pose in the picture looks consistent with the other students’ pictures and so that your posture looks nice in the photo as well.
After the photo is taken, depending on how your school works, you may receive the photo ID a few minutes afterward. If that is the case, you may be directed to stand in line again to receive your ID.
After you receive your school ID, be sure to store it in a safe spot in your backpack or wallet.

, If you are receiving your textbooks at orientation, follow the instructions provided to you for getting them. Your school may have a “book room” that holds all of the textbooks. You may have to wait in a long line to receive your textbooks.


When it is your turn, give your name or present your schedule to the teacher or school employee working there. They will retrieve the books for you.
When you receive your textbooks, store them in your backpack.

, Once you have your schedule and information about your locker, you can find where it is located and make sure that the combination provided works and that the locker opens.


Look over your locker to see if there is any damage. If there is, report it to a teacher or school employee.
Practice opening and closing your locker a few times so that you are familiar with it.

, Once you have your schedule, and you are finished with your orientation activities, walk around the school to find your classrooms. This can be a fun activity to do with your friends.


Obtain a map of the school if you do not know your way around. You can ask teachers or school employees if they have any maps or where you can find one.
Once you know the location of your classrooms, try walking to them in the same order as your schedule. This is a great way to familiarize yourself with the routes you will be taking to classes every day.

, If you have time, ask some students what grade they are in (even if you already know) to start a conversation. This is a great way to meet and introduce yourself to new people!


You can start the conversation by saying, “Hi, my name is Sarah. I’m going into 10th grade. What grade are you going into?” After you have started the conversation, you can ask what teachers they have and if they have any favorite teachers.
Try talking to at least two or three different people you don’t know. It’s good to step out of your comfort zone and talk to new people. You never know when you will have things in common with them and make a new friend!
If your friend’s friends are there and you haven’t met them, try talking to a couple of them and getting to know them more. This is a great way to grow your circle of friends and meet new people, and it doesn’t require you to step out of your comfort zone as much. You can say, “How do you know Michael?” which should start up a conversation and lead to talking about other things.

Make sure the volume is either down or off.,
Hide your phone.,
Make sure that there are not cameras where you are texting because the caretaker can catch you.

",How to Text During School," Go anywhere where there won't be a teacher. The restroom works best. Ask to go to your locker or something. Even crouching by your locker pretending to get a book will work.;
, Unless they are your best friend, they could tell on you. Beware of your worst enemy. Keep your friends close and enemies closer doesn't apply.

, If you don't know how to turn it down, then the best you can do is muffle it. Press the biggest speaker up against your belly or thigh.

, If someone thinks they saw you text, or you think someone saw you text, put your phone away. Even if you are mid message the text to your friend is not worth risking detention.

Speak to your teachers and school librarian about good websites for learning about science, history, and other subjects over the summer., Ask your teacher or school counselor for the next year’s syllabi. Also ask for lists of textbooks or other materials that will be used. You don’t need to start reading the textbooks over the summer, but you can look through them to see topics that you might like to learn about in advance.

, Don’t look at your notes right away. Give yourself a few weeks to clear your head and rest from the stress of the school year. When you’re ready, take a day or two to sort your notes and put them in order. Skim them while you organize as a way to review from last year. Type up anything that you think will be helpful for future courses and as a way to review them more intensively., Focus on other ways to keep learning over the summer, like reading a lot of books. The best thing you can do in the summer is to dedicate some time to academic-type activities. For example, you can work on your creative writing.If you do want to review, borrow notes from your friends.
You can also go online if your teacher posted material on your school or class websites.

, Make a list of the things that gave you trouble in the past year, like quadratic equations or history. Plan how you’ll review those things, like using math websites for homeschooled students or reading books about history. Add information that you learned from consulting your teachers or the syllabi to your list.


If you were in a class that didn’t finish the curriculum and you need that information for next year, like subjunctive verb tenses in a language class, add those to your review list.

If your child is spending too much time playing video games or watching television and not enough time studying, they may simply not be putting in the time to succeed., You should make sure that your child’s study partners are supporting rather than hindering their learning. If they do their homework with friends, make sure the group studying is supporting their learning and ability to get homework done.If your child is studying mostly with a friend, see if the relationship is distracting for your child.
If your child is studying alone, see if they are focusing on the work or if they get easily distracted by pets or other activities in your home., Lack of supervision may be a cause of your child's struggles at school. Your child may need some parental supervision during their study time. If your child normally does their homework on their own, try offering some support. Sit with your child while they do their homework. You should respond to questions and offer instruction where necessary. However, you should avoid doing their homework for them, since this would defeat the purpose of learning.


If you are having a hard time making time to assist them with homework, you could look into a homework helper or a tutor for a particular subject., See if they are missing space or equipment.

To prepare for the meeting, review notes from your conversations with your child, as well as their school history (e.g., past struggles, school changes). Consider what questions you want to ask their teacher. For example, you might want to ask the following:“Why do you think my child is struggling this year?”
“Have you noticed any changes in my child’s behavior recently?”
“What advice do you have in terms of getting my child back on track?”
“Do you think my child has a learning disability?”
“How could we determine whether or not they have a disability?”

, If you suspect your child has a particular learning disability, you might want to get a recommendation from your doctor for professional help. Common types of learning disabilities include ADHD, dyslexia (i.e., difficulty with reading) and dyscalculia (i.e., difficulty with math). To determine whether or not your child has a learning disability, you can ask your family doctor for a recommendation for a child psychologist, educational psychologist or other professional.

For example, you might want to learn 13 elements and their atomic numbers each week.If you plan to do a science or technology project, list the minimum number of steps you need to do each week.

, Pick a few hours each week that you will set aside to study. Write these on your electronic or paper calendar. Schedule your studying around your fun activities, like sports practice. Scheduling fun first will motivate you.List your weekly goals on each Sunday so you can refer back to them during the week.

, Look at your goals and choose a way to reward yourself for achieving each of them. Talk to your parents about rewards they might give you for hitting your goals. For example, you might give yourself a manicure after you make your goals each week or ask your parents if you can spend extra time out with friends.

, Even if you’re learning different things, doing it together will give you extra incentive to do your work. Try doing a science or technology project together, like coding a game.

Get involved in a cool extracurricular.To make school seem a little bit more fun, get involved in an activity that you like.,

Make goals for school.",How to Stop Feeling Worried About Going to School on Monday," A lot of what creates stress about school is whether or not you are sufficiently prepared to arrive on time with everything you need. To get rid of preparedness concerns, do as much as you can on Sunday evening. Taking action will relax you so that you can sleep well and make you feel more confident when Monday comes.

Check to make sure that you have everything you need in your backpack, and pay special attention any completed assignments that need to be turned in.
Pack a healthy lunch so that you can grab it quickly in the morning.
Set your alarm and make sure that its batteries are fully charged. This way you won't have to worry about whether or not you'll be on time.
Pick out your clothes too, so you won't need to make a decision in the morning.;
, Even if you're not worried about anything in particular, talking can be a great way to release your anxiety. Let someone you trust know how you feel, and take advantage of how relaxing it is to know that you are supported by people who love you and will listen to you., It seems like relaxing should be easy to do, but in truth a lot of the things we do to relax don't work very well, like watching TV or hanging out on the computer.Try out a relaxation technique that will be your go-to when you're worrying a lot about Monday. Techniques like deep breathing, tai chi, and yoga help your mind relax along with your body.

Deep breathing, for instance, relaxes an important nerve in your brain that can send a message to the rest of your body to become calm and loose., A soothing bath is a great way to settle down and take your mind off of nervous anticipation for the next day. If you have bath salt or essential oils (like lavender, chamomile, or jasmine), use them to increase the calming effect.Try to let your worries about school fade away as you soak up the warmth.

But, if school is still on your mind, use the bath as a place to remind yourself of all the reasons why school is not as bad as you think it is.

, Sleeping too little will leave you feeling groggy and irritable the next day, but so will sleeping too much. Try to get a solid 8-9 hours of sleep, leaving an extra hour before bed to settle down.If you're having trouble sleeping, don't give up and go on the computer or do something else. Give yourself time to fall asleep, and make sure that you take long, deep breaths as you're drifting off., Eating a good breakfast will make you more alert, active, and focused. So, whatever the cause of your worry, a well-rounded breakfast (fruit, protein, dairy, and whole grain) makes you more able to handle the difficulty and drudgery of school. Eating breakfast also kicks off your metabolism and helps you make better food choices throughout the day.Getting nutritious in the morning can boost your confidence, too., If you show up without being aware of your academic obligations, school will continue to be a place to dread. Make a to-do list to update yourself on what you need to do before each coming day. That way on Sunday night you can rest easy knowing that you haven't accidentally forgotten anything.

If you don’t already have a calendar or planner, get one. Then you can mark down important dates—all of your tests, finals, and due dates should be included as soon as you know them.
You can also use your to-do list to see how much time you have for non-school activities. It will help you make choices about when to do schoolwork versus when to do other things. If your calendar is full of due dates for the coming week, you can say no to taking on other activities.

, If you’re dreading Monday because of a quiz or exam get better prepared by learning how to keep anxiety in check. The following tips will help you feel more confident once you are already secure with the material on the test.Talk to your teacher beforehand about what types of questions will be on the test—don’t let anything catch you by surprise. This can cause your mind to go blank.
Remind yourself that you can do the test in any order, based on what you remember first. Don’t try to force yourself to follow the order already given on the page.
Finish studying by Saturday and only use Sunday or Monday morning for brief reviews of around 10 minutes. Avoid cramming so that you can get some distance from the material—surprisingly, this can help you perform better overall.

, If you are worried about going to school because of how difficult your classes are or out of frustration from getting behind, talk to your teachers. Getting help early on is important because class will only keep going, making you further and further behind.Everyone has trouble in one class or another, so don’t be embarrassed to ask for help when you first realize you need it.

Make your teacher’s job easier by paying attention in class to the best of your abilities. It’s not always easy to do at the time, but focusing and staying on top of your schoolwork can actually make class interesting rather than burdensome.

, Sometimes being worried about school is not easily eliminated, and this could be a sign that you might need help from someone who is equipped to deal with anxiety. Talk to your parents if you show any of the symptoms listed here, and pay special attention if you are just beginning at a new school, or are starting a new grade. Transitions like these often come with more extreme feelings of anxiety and symptoms such as:Refusal to leave the house
Physical symptoms like headaches, stomach pain, nausea, or diarrhea
Tantrums
Anxiety at the thought of separating from your parents

, The downside is that you have to get through school, and that can make it seem like a terrible punishment. But, the positive is that school is not permanent, and once you're done you'll be in a position to see how good it was for you in the long run.

If you have thoughts about school, like how terrible it will be or how much you don’t want to go, remind yourself that there are good parts of school that you can see here and now.For example, tell yourself, “oh c'mon, it’s not that bad—at school you get to see all your friends!”
You can also try looking at school as a challenge. Your worry isn't coming from nowhere. After all, school really does present a challenge, and recognizing that will help you summon the strength and bravery that it takes to make it there.

, In order to boost your confidence so that you know you are ready to be successful in school, take some time to think about all the things you like about yourself. Write down all of your features and personality traits that you like--your eyes, for example, or your sense of humor. Continue to think about your positive traits, adding everything you are good at in school--maybe you're a modest biology whiz or an excellent speller. Then, add all of the things you have achieved to the list, including your talents, good things that you've done for others, and meaningful compliments that you have received.Keep your list close to you, as it will be a good resource. When you feel worried and don't quite know why, look at the list to remind yourself of how capable you are of getting through school.

, Chances are good that when you go to school you'll come into contact with people you really like...and others you're not so fond of. If you're concerned about being uncomfortable around schoolmates, arrive ready with a strategy that suits you. For example, if you're soft spoken and shy, be prepared to avoid talking and being around people who get you down. If you're outgoing, make it a point to stick close to friends who can buffer you from people you really can't stand.

Just make sure to do whatever you can to stop from reaching a boiling point, that point when you're so frustrated or angry at someone that you want to fight with either your words or your fists.
As a rule of thumb, being polite and kind is a good plan. Even if you don't feel the other person deserves it, do what you can for the sake of a smooth school day.
However, if a person or group makes you fear for your safety or your reputation, you may be a victim of bullying. If so, you should tell school officials who can help get the situation under control.

, Write a fun note to yourself in the morning that will make you chuckle a bit and remind you not to worry too much about school. Make sure that the message of the note is positive, so don't write about not worrying, write about something separate from worry altogether.

The more personal the note is, the better. Write a little joke that you have with yourself, or reference something funny you've seen or done recently.
Change the notes enough so that they don't lose their effect .

, Maybe you love to draw or sing, but these are things you do outside of school. By getting involved in a club or class that lets you do what you love, you can start to associate going to school with having a good time. Instead of worrying about tests, essays, and due dates, focus on how much you like the drama club you just joined or the art class that you're enrolled in., Spend time thinking about your future in order to make goals for school. It may not seem like life after classes exists, but thinking about how to get where you want to be after school can help you get motivated. Setting school-related goals will fill your Sundays with a sense of purpose, and maybe even excitement. But, make goals for yourself that are reasonable. Aim high, but don't bite off more than you can chew.

For example, if you're already pretty good at algebra, set a goal to secure an A in the class for the end of the semester.
Make sub-goals so that you can have a short-term sense of achievement, too. Every time you ace an assignment or quiz, reward yourself for getting one step closer to your main goal.

This is simply done by saying, ""Hi I'm , and what's your name?"" or ""So, where did you go to school last year?"" Start with simple questions. Compliments are also a great conversation starter that make the other person feel great. For example, ""I like your shirt, where'd you get it?""

, Don't ever dump your old friends that you make throughout the year when you make new ones who might have a better social standing. Hang out with your new friends, but put in time for the old ones. Call, text, or instant message them once in a while.

, Study. This is the year where it all begins. You must be getting good grades to get into a good college. Contrary to what you hear, freshman year does matter. So don't slack off and always study. Take breaks when you need them though!

, High school always looks great in the movies. But in the movies nobody ever does homework or takes a test. Why? Because that would be boring. Remember, you're at school to learn. Don't let drama take over your life. Stay in touch with reality.

keep your self on a schedule for the week, don't overbook yourself. And finally, as much as possible, try to maintain a high GPA."

Keep faking your headache until the next day.",How to Fake a Headache at School," Primary headaches are cluster, migraine, tension, and TAC (Trigeminal autonomic cephalalgia) headaches.You have a better chance of getting away with this charade if you pay attention to the details.


There are many different headaches but it makes the most sense to fake tension, migraines, cluster, or sinus headaches.Primary headaches can be triggered by things you do in the day including eating habits, sleeping habits, posture, and general stress.;
, Depending on what type of headache you are trying to fake, the pain will come from different parts of your head. Some headaches may radiate while others are focused.


Tension headaches are usually felt at the front, top, or sides of your head.Migraines can be felt in the entire head, or the pain may be felt shifting from one side of your head to the other.Cluster headaches provide a very focused pain on one-side of your head that is located around the eye region.Sinus headaches are felt in the cheekbones, forehead, or the bridge of your nose., There is a wide spectrum of pain that a headache can bring. Be sure to fake enough pain to get out of school but not so much that your overall health comes into question. It’s not enough to say that your head hurts because being able to describe the detail will make it seem real.


Tension headaches bring about a pressurized band-like pain that you can describe as mild to moderate. Pain can also vary in intensity throughout the day if you’re trying to mimic a chronic tension headache.Migraines can be very intense with a pounding and throbbing pain. The intensity can be very severe so it may not be wise to choose a headache with such involved symptoms.Cluster headaches are constantly throbbing with a burning or piercing pain.Sinus headaches will vary in intensity depending on other sinus symptoms like a runny nose, plugged ears, fever, and facial swelling., You may have to act out the symptoms several hours in advance If there’s a specific class you are trying to miss. You are more likely to be believed if multiple witnesses have seen you display the same symptoms. Understand how long a headache should last and if it should only occur at certain times of the day.


Tension headaches can occur several times a months depending if they are chronic. They can last from 30 minutes to several days. Chronic tension headaches will vary in intensity throughout the day. The pain may also be present as soon as you wake up.Migraines come with an assortment of symptoms including vomiting and seeing bright flashing dots or wavy lines.Unless you actually have experienced a migraine, it would be unwise to mimic this type of headache.
Cluster headaches can last anywhere from 30 minutes to 90 minutes. They can also recur throughout the day from 3 to as many as 8 times. Cluster headaches also occur very regularly and often at the same time of day.Sinus headaches occur when you suffer inflammation and congestion usually brought on by a cold or flu.It would be unwise to try and fake a sinus headache because these symptoms are difficult to mimic.

, These two types of headaches are more believable because they are less involved as the other primary headaches. However, if you have actually experienced migraines before or are experiencing congestion in your sinuses, it may also work in your favor to fake those types of headaches.


You don’t have to actually name your type of headache but you do have to display the distinct characteristics to make it as believable as possible.

, Both tension headaches and cluster headaches can occur before you get to school. Tension headaches happen as soon as you wake up while cluster headaches can disrupt your sleep.Rub the front of your head or side of your head as both types of headaches happen in focused areas at the front of your head.
Tell classmates who will be with you throughout the day. As well, tell teachers if you have them in both a morning and afternoon class. For example, if you are in high school and you want to skip out of 5th period English, complaining to your 2nd period math teacher won’t help you because there’s no way your English teacher will get the message. Instead, complain to a classmate who will be with you in 5th period English.

, Immediately establish that you have a headache by alerting the right people. If you do not have a school nurse or health professional, go to the principal’s office and alert the administrator.


Agreeing to “tough it out” in the morning sets a precedent for later in the day.

, When your head is in pain it will be difficult to receive a lot of stimulation. If people are talking too loudly or there is too many things going on around you, act like this is making your headache worse. Become easily agitated if people don’t take you seriously.Don’t take this too far or you may cause a rift between your friends or land in detention rather than the nurse’s office.

, Fake being listless to the point that standing or keeping your head up seems to make your pain worse. Tension and cluster headaches don’t last long but can recur during the day so spread out the pain and vary the intensity.If you want to participate in recess or sports during lunch, headaches can also occur because of a poor diet. Wait until after lunch to start faking the symptoms and complain about how your food tasted “off”.

, Laying down is often seen as the best way to relieve the pain from a headache. Make sure to ask permission from your teacher and state that your head hurts and you would like to put your head down for a bit. Your eagerness to stay in class will make the pain seem real as you aren’t immediately trying to just getaway., Headaches can be caused by a number of factors including certain foods, changes in sleep, poor posture, missing meals, or stress. Keep this in mind and choose one to tell people.Don’t overdo it. Say things like, “I didn’t get very much sleep last night” or “I haven't eaten since dinner” to a couple of people who you know will be able to put two and two together.

, It takes time to get better from a headache and often times they recur. It will be easier for you to fake a headache if you fake the symptoms correctly for a chronic tension headache.


You don’t want to fake a headache in the morning and be seen playing sports after school. Prepare to keep up the rouse for the entire day.

, Let your friends know far in advance so both you and them have ample time to adjust to the thought that you're leaving. Ask your teachers—both at your old and new schools—if there's anything extra you should complete before you leave.

, Make sure you get phone numbers and e-mail addresses from your friends! You want to keep in touch with them and keep your friendships.

, Yeah, that's right. Cry. It's okay to cry. You will feel upset, sad, and maybe even mad. Find someone that you can confide in and tell them your feelings. Express any fears and excitements you have about moving. Being able to talk about it will make the move a less stressful experience, and you'll be open to making new friends if you know your old friends will always be there for you.

Don't sweat it.",How to Start a New Life in a New School," This may sound like effort, but checking out the school website, photo galleries, and reviews might give you an insight on how life at your new school is, and whether or not it is similar to life at your old school. If it is different, don't sweat it!;
, If you want, try slightly changing your appearance. Take the opportunity of starting a new school to keep the things about you that you love and get rid of the things that you're less than happy about.

, However, don't think that this change in attitude is permanent. Obviously, you aren't going to be yourself the first couple of days, especially if you aren't used to being the ""quiet one"" (but that doesn't mean you have to be one!) This quiet feeling will not last.

, On your first day at your new school, try to arrive early so that you can ""blend in"". Arriving late will give you that excluded feel, and won't make a good impression on your new teachers!


Arriving early will give you the chance to socialize with people already at school. This can help to make you look as if you're already ""in the know"".

, Although it may seem awkward, this is the way to get things rolling. Start to talk about the smallest of things and especially about the other person. By doing this, you'll be right on track in a week or two (maybe less than a week).


Be friendly. Introduce yourself to teachers and classmates. You don't need to be overbearing, but smiling and saying hi can help others realize that your quietness is shyness, not snootiness.







, The key to this is you starting the conversation and showing your attitude towards other kids. Let's face it, no one's going to come straight up to you and want to be best friends. It's you that has to go up, say your name, ask questions, get to know people, and maybe even share things about yourself. It may seem scary, but it's definitely worth a shot.

, Find people you have things in common with. Although you can't necessarily be picky on the first day, be on the lookout for long-term friends, not just people who are looking to be nice to you to better their reputation.

, Everyone advises this in hundreds of situations, it's true anyway. You don't need to change how you act or look, you don't need to dye your hair or start wearing tons of make up just to fit in. It might take a little while, but you'll find a group of friends who want to hang out with you, not someone you've created to try to be more ""cool."" Also remember that you'll get a new teacher, or set of teachers, who don't know your past mistakes, and only know the new you.

, Most schools have a list of extra-curricular activities you can choose from. In almost all schools, being on a sports team or the star in the musical is considered ""cool"".


If you're in high school, these activities look great on a college application.

, Try to bump up your smarts a little. It would be awesome if you were in the social scene, known, and outgoing, as well as loved by your teachers. However, for this to come, work your hardest on your studies while still maintaining that social balance.



Study often to try to get good grades. Remember that the reason why you're at school is to learn. Sometimes, when you are eager to fit in, you will pretend to act uneducated just for the attention, even if it's not conscious. This will attract attention, but only because people will think you're stupid, which won't make them want to be friends with you.







, Fitting in is a piece of cake for some and a challenge for others. The important thing is to take it easy, and to act like yourself. If you do, you'll have friends who like you for you in no time.

, This isn't always easy, but the sooner you find friends the sooner you'll feel comfortable in your new school. Talk to people in the hallways, join a club or a sport, or sit by someone that looks nice at lunch. You may go through a couple friend groups before you find the one that's right for you

, You're likely missing your old school—you may even resent your friends for getting to stay when you had to move. It's important to remember, though, that they are likely feeling your absence just as much as you are. Make an effort to keep in touch with them. This will help strengthen your friendships and help keep you grounded.

, Sometimes you feel like you have butterflies in your stomach. Try eating something or drinking a glass of milk.

, Make sure to limit your time in the shower so you will have enough time to do everything else. Wash your hair with a good smelling shampoo, and a good smelling body wash. Don't forget the conditioner!

, Ponytails go with almost every look. If you are a guy, put gel or mousse in your hair and spike it. It looks cool and original and girls love it.

, For girls make sure you picked out a cute outfit. Don't pick something out that makes you look geeky or like a school teacher or a teacher's pet. Wear a cute colored camisole with and cute colored scoop neck shirt (not to scooped, you don't want to be known as someone who reveals to much) and put on a small, light hoodie that matches you shirts. Then maybe some dark wash jeans or capris. Since it's still summer, you should wear some black flip-flops (if your school allows it) or some kind of cute pair of shoes. If you are a guy, just a nice pair of good fitting jeans or khaki shorts with a clean, cool looking graphic tee shirt with a cool pair of shoes and a hoodie.

, (Deodorant, body spray etc.)

, If you like wearing makeup. Don't go overboard. Yes, most girls at this age do but YOU shouldn't. It does not look good and you will look like a clown or an owl. Just some clear lip gloss, some blush, concealer, and some mascara. No need for eyeshadow or eyeliner really.

, The teachers told us whether or not we needed like highlighters or notebooks. But be prepared to buy some or have some handy. Make sure you have your schedule and all the stuff you need to find your classes.

Think of boring things.",How to Sleep on the Night Before the First Day of School," If you’re like most people your age, then you probably got used to going to bed later and later—and waking up later and later—during the summer. This may be one of the reasons why it’s particularly hard for you to fall asleep on the night before the first day of school. To make sure your body is ready for sleep, you need to make a plan to start going to bed earlier and earlier at least a week in advance, so you’re actually tired by bedtime.Start by going to bed a half an hour earlier than you normally would and waking up half an hour earlier than you normally would. Keep doing this until you’ve reached the time when you’d actually be going to bed and waking up for school.
If you get into the same sleeping and waking routine at least a few days before the first day of school, then it’ll be much easier for you to fall asleep at the right time.;
, On the day before school, you should make sure that you have all of your school supplies in order and packed away. You don’t want to get worried about having to rush out to get a notebook an hour before bedtime, or that will get you riled up. You should also pick out your outfit in advance so you don’t stay up worrying about all of the different options you’ll have to try on in the morning.If you feel like you have everything figured out before the big day, you’ll be able to sleep more soundly.
Make sure you check the weather for the next day, too. You don’t want to have the perfect outfit planned and then to wake up to find that it’s way too warm or cold to wear it.

, Another thing you should figure out before the evening is how you’re getting to school. Whether you’re taking the bus, catching a ride with your friend and your mom, getting your older brother to take you, or walking, you should have this ironed out the day before so it doesn’t make you lose any sleep. Don’t tell yourself you’ll figure it out in the morning or you may lose sleep over it.


In the morning, the hardest thing you should have to decide on is how much milk to pour in your cereal. If you make yourself have too many decisions to deal with in the morning, then you may not be able to sleep as soundly.

, Caffeine or sugary foods can make you hyper and can give you the jitters and make it harder for you to get to sleep. If you do drink soda or caffeine in other forms, try to not have any after noon, so your body has time to settle down. Avoid sugary energy drinks at all costs, too; they’ll give you a quick energy rush but will leave you feeling shaky and may even give you a bit of a headache.


If you feel yourself having excess energy in anticipation of the big day, do some exercise. This can help you feel healthier, happier, and more relaxed.

, In general, you should have everything taken care of before you get ready for bed on the last day of school. This can mean figuring out where to meet up with your best friend, knowing where your homeroom is, or finding the new shoes you wanted to wear on the big day. If you leave anything up in the air, it will only cause you to lose sleep, so make sure you’ve got all of your ducks in a row before you hit the hay.


Even master procrastinators should take care of as many odds and ends as possible. You don’t want to be running late on your first day of school or feeling frazzled because you can’t find your glasses.

, If you can't find it within a minute, just go and borrow to save time as you are going to make friends. Hope you learnt something!, A nice warm bath can help you feel relaxed and can calm down your mind and give you some time to think. You may be so busy talking to all of your friends, texting people, and memorizing your schedule to really slow down, and some time in the bathtub will make it impossible for you to do too much at once. Put your cell phone away, throw some bubbles in the bath, and spend some time with your eyes closed feeling like you don’t have a care in the world.


Some scented bath bubbles or bath bombs can really help you feel refreshed and relaxed.
Try humming to yourself as you soak up the suds. That can also help you let out some tension!

, Though it may seem next to impossible, tell yourself you won’t think about the first day of school after a certain hour. Say that after 8 pm or so, you won’t talk to your friends about it, you won’t talk to your family members about it, and you won’t go online and chat about it. This will help you stop obsessing over it and will make your mind turn to other things.


Of course, it can be next to impossible to stop thinking about something right away, but if you make a goal of it and even tell other people about it or write it down, it’s much more likely to happen.

, Meditation can also get you in a calm frame of mind and can make you feel more at peace and less excited. Just find a quiet room, get a comfortable seat, and focus on relaxing your body one part at a time. Focus on the breath rising in and out of your body and try to avoid thinking about anything at all other than calming down. Just doing this for 10 minutes a day can help you feel more relaxed and may help you fall asleep more easily.


You can even practice concentrating on your breath rising in and out of your body after you get to bed. Counting your breaths can be even more effective than counting sheep.

, Another way to unwind before bed is by playing a simple, non-electronic game that can soothe your mind a bit. It should be something you play by yourself, which can help take your mind off the fact that school is starting the next day. Here are some games that you can try:


Crossword puzzles
Sudoku
Solitaire

, On the night before the first day of school, you want to eat something that is healthy and nourishing enough for you not to have trouble going to sleep because you’re hungry while also not making you feel so full and uncomfortable that you have trouble resting. Eat some healthy veggies, some lean proteins, and some pasta, rice, or another simple side dish, avoiding any overly rich or fatty foods, such as french fries or dishes with thick sauces.


Give yourself at least 2-3 hours to digest your food before you head to bed.

, Reading can help you feel more relaxed and to take your mind off of the fact that you’re starting a new school year the next day. Pick a book that isn’t too challenging and which is a real page turner, so you have something to keep you interested in those last few hours before you have to try to sleep. Read a few chapters under soft lighting and don’t get distracted by your phone or other people talking to you. Reading, in its own way, can be like a form of meditation, and if you really follow the rhythm of a story, it can make you feel relaxed.


Don’t pick a book about topics that are too disturbing or serious, or that may lead you to stay up even later. Of course, if murder mysteries always make you fall asleep, then go for it.

, You should find a relaxing calming down routine that works for you well before the evening before the first day of school. Everyone’s routine is different and you can try a number of things, which can include listening to soft music, drinking chamomile or peppermint tea, reading a novel, or writing in a journal. You can even try to do these things in the same order, so that your mind and body know when you’re ready for sleep.It can be hard to just get off the phone with your best friend, finish up that summer assignment, or stop playing your favorite video game, and then to head right to sleep. If you do this without some kind of a transition to sleep time, then your mind will still be racing.
Give yourself at least an hour to luxuriate in this routine before bed.

, Even though you may be addicted to electronics, you have to put them away if you want to be able to fall asleep more easily. You should shut off your television, computer, and cell phone at least an hour before you go to bed, so you don’t feel overstimulated. This can help your mind relax and stop racing and can help you focus on getting ready for bed.


You should get in the habit of doing this every night, not just on the night before the first day of school. It will help you have a happier, healthier sleeping schedule.

, A recent study has shown that at least 1 in 10 teenagers receives and sends text messages in the middle of the night, after they are woken up. You should turn your phone off, and even leave it in a different room, if you want to have the most restful sleep. If you leave your phone by your pillow, then you’ll be less likely to fall asleep because you’ll be anticipating a message from one of your friends. Plus, you’ll be less likely to be woken up while you do fall asleep.Think about it: what can your best friend say to you at 2 a.m. that really can’t wait until the morning? Almost nothing.

, Another way to make sure you go to bed on the night before the first day of school is to avoid any intense or stressful conversations before bedtime. Don’t pick this night to tell your best friend why you’re mad at her; save that for another day. If your sister wants to have a “big talk,” ask her if it can possibly wait until the next day. You already have enough to worry about as it is, and you don’t want to stay up rehashing your conversation or argument.


If you and your friends do chat about what the first day of school will be like, don’t let the conversation go on for too long. You don’t want to get too excited speculating about all of the things you don’t know about.
Talk about things that are light, simple, and which don’t stress you out. You can even work on spending more time alone as you get closer to bedtime so you don’t have to worry about other people at all.

, Your brain uses lighting cues to help set your internal “body clock,” so the sooner you start dimming the lights, the sooner your brain will get the idea that it’s time for sleep. After dinner time, try not to spend too much time around bright lights, and read by a softer light or even light some candles, so you start feeling like it’s really time for sleep. This can make a big difference and can help you fall asleep a lot more easily.When you get up in the morning, let the light flood into your room. This is a way of telling your body that you’re ready to wake up.

, When you’re lying in bed, try to think of the most boring things possible to help yourself get to bed more easily. As long as you don’t think of anything too complicated, like chemical equations, almost any topic that doesn’t excite you at all will do. You can force yourself to drift off by thinking about topics that are so completely uninteresting that you feel like you have absolutely no choice but to fall asleep. Here are some things you can think about:


All of the multiples of 2
The states and their capitals
All of the people you’ve ever met who are named “Dave” or “Ashley”
The entire plot of the last book you read or movie you saw
The lyrics to your least favorite pop song
The names of as many farm animals, vegetables, or flowers as you can think of
Your least favorite school subject

, Will you be making it or taking it? If making it, what can you make now and what needs to be made in the morning? Sandwiches need to be made just before you go, or else they'll go all soggy but cookies, a piece of fruit, a drink and some snacks can usually be packed the night before, in readiness. If buying lunch, ask your parents or guardians for the money now, to save rushing in the morning.

, It depends on what school you go to. It depends on what time you need to leave for school. Normally it is good to wake up an hour or two before school starts so you can be prepared if anything goes wrong.

Be open to new friends and experiences.",How to Start a Great School Year," You can just leave all of your troubles, bad grades, grudges, enemies, or fights behind. Start FRESH!;
, You will need a backpack, pencils, pens, paper, folders, etc. - all of the usual supplies. Buy the folders you like best. Dress them up with stickers or doodles. The more amusing your folders are to you, the more you will love to take them out and do your homework!

, Don't hunch over your books or shuffle with your head down while walking. Stand up straight and proud, walk tall, and let your books feel like they are in great hands! Be friendly in the hall, say hi to your friends, and to new people you recognize from classes. If you are new at public school, keep in mind that all the freshmen are new, too. You will all make new friends this year. If you are new at a private school, this may not be the case, but all the freshmen are new to the idea of high school and are still just as scared as you. Look for friendly people in class, at lunch, or at your locker (if you don't have a locker, then nearby your desk). Having good friends will boost your confidence, and you will have a great time at school!

, Don't be scared. Everyone else is probably just as nervous as you are. If volleyball is really what you want to do, but all of your friends are into soccer, play volleyball anyway - you'll make new friends on that team. You don't have to run with just one crowd all the time. Have friends in all sorts of places, so that you'll feel comfortable wherever you are.

, You may have heard this a lot of times before and think classes are lame, but this is such a good idea. If you do listen to the teacher and take notes, you will save so much time on homework, and you will actually ""learn""! That is why you go to school! School is not just a place you sit at desks and stare at the chalk, and then socialize with your friends.

, Decide right away that you will put some effort into it. If you find you have a hard time focusing when studying alone at home, see if you can find a study partner, or even better, a study group (three or four people who will agree to study together). You'd be surprised at how much your study improves when you have someone else to quiz you and how much less nervous you are about tests. Which brings us to...

, If you panic, it will not help. It may just make things worse. Relax and go over your notes and textbook. Read it through one time quickly. Then read it again - you will probably actually understand it. If you create a mental picture it in your head, it's more likely you will remember that picture while doing the test.

, It may sound strange to think about this from Day One, but the truth is, if you ask your teachers and counselors early what you can do to earn honors for graduation, you will be better able to work toward them. It will give you a goal to strive toward.

, Don't let people walk all over you. Be polite, but set your limits. Think about the nicest person you know - that person that everyone says, ""Oh, she's nice, she never says anything bad about anyone,"" or ""That guy is great - he's so polite."" Try to be like that yourself, and remember how good you feel when someone else is nice to you for no reason at all. It makes your day - and you can pay that forward to someone else every single day, whether it's the class jock or the class geek. There's an old saying: ""It's very nice to be important. It's much more important to be nice."" Being warm and friendly to everyone at school (even the not-so-cool kids) is good exercise for the rest of your life.

, School is all about learning. Part of what you will learn is how to get along with different personalities, and that's really what life requires you to do. Don't be too upset if your old friends from middle or elementary school seem to be drifting away - they're probably making new friends, too. Growing up sometimes means that we have different interests than we did before, and the friends we used to have don't always share them - that's okay. It doesn't mean you can't still be friendly with them, it just means you're both moving on with your lives and growing in different directions.

Find all of your friends, or people who are helping you with your campaign, and ask them to help you hang up your campaign posters.",How to Make Posters for a School Election," Try asking the person who is in charge of the school elections or the principal. Choose a time when they are not busy and, if you easily forget things, bring a notebook and pen to take notes. Ask for other specific details, such as where/not you are allowed to hang the posters. Also, ask what they would like you use to hang the posters.;
, Most local stores will have these supplies in the craft aisle. Look at multiple stores to make sure you are getting the best price possible. If you have the option, buy colored poster-board such as neon pink, orange, yellow, or lime-green so that the words you write on it will stand out. If you would like to be original, get plain white poster board and color the whole thing yourself!

, Try to get at least one black marker, for that color will show up on most poster boards. Make sure that the color of marker you get doesn't match the color of poster board you own (for example, don't buy a red marker if you bought red poster board). For the best deal, get a big pack of markers so you'll have more variety on your posters. Also, you can buy some stickers, glitter, etc. to give your poster more color to stand out!

, Make sure the table isn't wet or dirty, though. If the table has other items on it, you may want to remove them from the area so you will be writing on a clear, flat surface. Also, make sure there is glue, tape, and scissors near by so you will not have to get up and retrieve them later on.

, Make big, bubble letters that spell out your name. Add a funny slogan or quote. Attach humorous pictures to the poster. Do whatever you would like, as long as your name is easy to read. If you have sloppy handwriting, you may want to let a friend or family member write out the words for you. Also, try adding a picture of yourself to the poster so that people who see it will know who you are.

, That way, your poster will stay dry if some people splash water on your poster. Plus, it makes it a better poster.

,, See if they can come over to your house to help with making posters if your friends are creative. You will get way more posters completed while having fun with your friends. Tell them exactly how you want it to look, or let them surprise you with a poster design of their own. Play some music while working for some extra inspiration and to set the mood.

, Roll them up, and bring them to school in something where they will not get crumpled. Make sure to bring tape, sticky tack, or whatever you plan on hanging them with along with you. Try not to ride the bus that day if you have the choice. If you're not old enough to drive, ask your parents if they could drive you to school just for that morning.

, Think of ideal hanging locations, such as the front door of your school, in the cafeteria, above a popular drinking fountain, near a classroom door, etc. Make sure you hang up as many posters as you possibly can! Also, put plenty of tape on the back so it will not fall down. Place the poster high up on the wall to avoid having it torn down.

Find other interests.",How to Make Your Girl Enemy Jealous2," If you don't have a lot a friends, talk to new people. She may not see you as a threat if you don't have a group.


You don't have to make hundred of friends. Just make a group of people you know and get to know them.
Choose close friends. That way, they can back you up and you have friends that will be there for you.
Know lot of people. Even if they're not friends, talk to new people so everyone at least knows you and thinks you're a cool person.

,


Say your name and talk about anything. It's a good idea to read books and watch movies to find topics.
Be friendly and bright, or mysterious if you're shy. But be nice!
Be natural and don't rack your brain thinking of clever things to say. Witty things will come with not thinking about it.
Be fun. You can crack a joke, or do anything funny.
Big Tip: If you're doing this when she is around, don't glance to make sure she's watching. Pretend she isn't there, and talk to your friend.
Remember,  conversations are to talk about something, not just to make someone jealous.

, Do the same! Study and be a good student.


Whether she flunks every test, or is a teacher's pet, do well in your classes. School is meant for learning, after all.
If she is a flunker, just do well and ignore her. She'll be jealous of your straight A's.

,


Participate in class. Ask questions so the teacher (and students) know you're there.
Pay attention. If you pay attention, you may find things to point out, or points to make. You're be appreciated for having your own opinions.
Ignore her. During class, even if you want to eavesdrop on her for gossip, DON'T. It will look like you're staring at her (awkward) or it will just look weird. Stay focused, it will take stress off having to look popular around her.

,


If you find other things you like, it will give you new conversation topics.
If you find other things you like, it makes you well-rounded.
Don't try to like what she likes to beat her at it. If she's on the basketball team, so be it. If you don't like basketball, don't do it. If you like tennis, try out for the tennis team.

If you're anywhere else and she's there?",How to Make Your Girl Enemy Jealous3," Even if you don't you may just look at her profile to see what she post and what caption she uses. If you start to feel jealous, here's what you do.


Put the phone DOWN. Comparing herself to you doesn't help you. It just makes you angry.
Remember social media is a way to make your life seem cool. If she post a picture saying, ""In Hawaii AGAIN :)"" You can post of you doing what seems cool. For example, ""When I was in the mountains <3"" To show that your life is pretty cool too.

,


Write down what you're feeling on a piece of paper, and rip it up.
Try to block her out.

Consider how many pockets and divisions you want.,
Choose something sturdy.,
Try out the handles, straps, and any closures.,
Choose a lunchbox that can contain spills.,
Choose something washable.,
Choose something with style.",How to Select a Lunchbox," You may need a larger lunchbox if you are carrying a lot of food for extended trips away from home (even if your extended trips simply mean long workdays). If you use a lot of hard-sided containers, or if you carry a large water bottle or Thermos, plan for the size of those items, too.;
, Insulation might not be so important if you have a short commute and there's a fridge you can use when you get there. Otherwise, if you want to be able to branch out from peanut butter and jelly, get something insulated and use a freezer pack to keep it cool until lunchtime.

, Do you want to stack things or place them side by side? Do you want everything in one compartment or do you want to keep certain things separate? Do you need a separate pocket for a napkin or fork? Do you need features to contain an ice pack or keep a beverage bottle from tipping?

, Plan to use it for at least a full year.

, Make sure they will make a loaded lunchbox easy, comfortable, and secure to carry (won't pop open or tip over).

, If your soup or drink leaks, or if that nice, squishy peach gets squished, at least the mess will be contained and not all over the rest of your stuff.

, For heavy use, this may mean a hard-sided mini cooler, but many soft-sided lunchboxes have plastic or foil liners that can be wiped down and even removed for cleaning.

,


For adults, a plain outside will do fine for the office, but choose fun characters or sophisticated quilting or handbag styling if you prefer. If it's been a few years, look again. There are many styles to choose from.
For kids, choose something fun. A favorite cartoon character might be worth the extra expense if it helps convince your younger child that what's inside is fun. For older kids, it's probably best to let them choose the style, so long as it fits everything it needs to.

Think about who you want to be.,
Look for inspiration.,
Make a list of goals.",How to Reinvent Yourself for the Coming School Year1," Before any reinvention takes place, you should first take a good look at yourself and your reason for wanting a change. Take quiet time by yourself to reflect, daydream, and visualize your reinvention, and how it will help you in the upcoming school year. Ask yourself questions that will help you decide who you want to be, such as:”Is right now a turning point for me?”
”What are my academic goals for the year?”
”What are my social goals for the year?”
”How can I improve myself to better enjoy my school experience this year?”;
, A key step in determining who you want to be is identifying who you admire most. This sort of inspiration can come from friends, family, teachers, or your famous idols; the aim is to learn from the best, by example. For instance, your English teacher or favorite author might be a huge inspiration for you as an aspiring writer., The best way to visualize your ideal self is to write down the changes you want to make and things you want to achieve this school year. Written goals can often provide enough motivation to turn words into action, and can serve as visual reminders of your aspirations. To keep yourself motivated while gearing up for the new school year, write daily or weekly lists of your short-term and long-term goals.E.g. “I will get an A in both math and science this semester.”

Make eye contact.,
Smile.,
Be a good listener.,
Have open body language.,
Learn to read other's body language and social cues.,
Start slow with small conversation-openers.,
Be yourself.",How to Make Friends in School1," If you’re shy, it can be hard to meet others' eyes. But doing this can make the difference in others gravitating toward you to make conversation, or being put off by your energy.


The correct ratio of eye contact depends on the person, the context, and any cultural factors. Still, maintaining eye contact between 30 and 60% of the time during conversation is preferable. Typically, you must hold eye contact more when you are listening than when speaking.;
, Smiling doesn’t just feel good to us. Sure, a smile can combat stress and relieve pain, but others are more attracted to you when you do it. Smiles are also contagious; so, you’re more likely to get one in return when you give one., Improving your listening skills can significantly influence how great a friend you can be. Showing that you are willing to share the talking time makes the other person feel respected and valued. Here are just a few of the habits of good listeners:Good listeners allow the other person to finish talking before inserting a remark.
Good listeners ask for clarification when they don’t understand the speaker (e.g. “I’m confused…do you mean?”).
Good listeners encourage the speaker to continue talking by giving feedback (e.g. “Go on, I hear you.” or “Really?”).
Good listeners indicate their attention by using nonverbal gestures such as smiling, laughing, or nodding.
Good listeners try to match the emotional energy of the speaker to demonstrate they understand the message (e.g. raising your voice or dropping your jaw to indicate surprise).

, As you can see, the nonverbal parts of communication are often just as important as what actually comes out of your mouth. If your body language is open, you are more likely to be perceived positively by others around you. Open body language consists of legs stretched out, posture relaxed, knees apart, leaning forward, elbows away from the body, and arms and legs uncrossed. When making conversation, avoid standing when others are sitting (when can be construed as intimidation), fidgeting, or turning away from the person you are talking to.

, Sometimes, others may not come off as approachable. Certain kids at school may not want to make friends or have a new kid join their group. Pay attention to the cues of others before entering into new social situations.


For example, if a person is exhibiting closed body language - arms and legs crossed and elbows tight near the torso - they may not be willing to engage in conversation.Other social cues may include a frowning or sneering facial expression or taking a step back. People who are interested will usually have a mild or welcoming facial expression and move in close to your personal space., Sometimes, all it takes to initiate a lasting friendship is an interesting story between the two of you. Rather than approaching people and trying to find out every single fact in one go, take small steps by asking intriguing questions that can bridge into a longer conversation. You can ask questions like:”How do you know ____ (insert name of a mutual acquaintance)?”
”What was the peak of your day?”
”What movies, books, TV shows have you enjoyed lately?”
”What’s your favorite thing to do over the weekend?”
”What was the craziest YouTube video you watched this week?""
""What sports are you into right now?""

, You may feel pressured to become more like popular people or others who have tons of friends. Picking up a few practical habits through observation can be beneficial, but you should never change who you are to gain friends. Doing so is unfair to you and the other person. There is surely someone out there who will enjoy you for you.

Give yourself a style makeover.,
Find new friends.,
Change the things around you.,
Be more active.,
Explore new opportunities.,
Learn new skills.",How to Reinvent Yourself for the Coming School Year2," Fashion is an excellent place for a new start, and a great way to experiment with new personas. Reinvention is all in the individual elements that you choose to alter - going from long hair to a short pixie cut, for example, is very transformative. Try playing around with some other style details, such as:the color of your wardrobe (e.g. going from colorful clothing to all black clothing, or vice-versa)
the cut of your clothing (like moving from baggy, shapeless garments to more tailored, sleek-looking pieces)
your signature jewelry (for instance, wearing a bold new necklace instead of a modest charm necklace)
footwear (switching from sneakers to tall boots, for example)

, Finding new people to spend time with at school can greatly improve your mood and perspective on things. To do this, try reaching out to acquaintances that you see irregularly and reconnect, or approach a social group at school to see if you can hang out with them. In both cases, be friendly, upfront, and proactive - ask ice breaker questions like, ""Hi, how's your day going?"" and let conversation unfurl from there.To expand your friends circle, try sitting at a new table at lunch and strike up a conversation.

, To truly reinvent yourself, you should spruce up the things that you see on a daily basis. Change and positivity are key factors in reinvention, so taking steps to improve your physical surroundings can help your personal development. This could mean redecorating your living space, updating your wardrobe, or anything else that will be a visual aide with brightening your perspective., Maintaining your mental and physical health is an important part of reinventing yourself, as going through this period of transition will require you to be at your best. Regular exercise can provide you with relaxation, better sleep and mood, and stronger immune function, all positive changes for a better you. Make a point of getting active as much as possible, with easy to schedule exercise like:walking or jogging
jumping rope
working out on a treadmill, elliptical machine, or fitness stepper

, Reinventing yourself means venturing into the unknown and trying something new, so make the most of any opportunities that come your way. Travel is a great way to explore, but even simple actions like trying new restaurants, listening to new music, or shopping at new stores can freshen your perspective and open your mind. Make a list of new things you would like to try and hold yourself to crossing at least one thing off your list per week (e.g. “eat at an Afghan restaurant.”), Learning is key to self-growth and personal improvement, and should be a vital part of your reinvention. Learning new skills can prompt the brain to release dopamine, a neurotransmitter that is directly related to feelings of pleasure; the long term effect of gaining a new skill, on top of the dopamine kick, can provide a lasting sense of fulfillment and self-esteem. Look at your community newspaper, local classified ads, or online listings to see what lessons are available near you (e.g. swimming, guitar playing, swing dancing).As a bonus, opt for lessons in an activity that you can continue at school once it begins, such as swimming or playing an instrument).

"
"
Avoid self-criticism.,
Cut out bad friends.,
Leave old habits behind.",How to Reinvent Yourself for the Coming School Year3," Building Self-Confidence is a difficult but important part of reinventing yourself, and it requires a commitment to positive thinking. Be conscious of your reaction to things and make an effort to adjust your thinking in key moments. For example: stop yourself from making negative generalizations (such as, “I always screw things up.”)
avoid jumping to negative conclusions (e.g. “No one at the party will like me.”)
view setbacks as temporary (e.g. “I didn’t do well in school today, but tomorrow will be better” instead of “I’m doing horribly in school.”)

, An important part of reinvention and self-improvement is removing yourself from anyone who make you feel bad or insecure. Your social circle should be a source of happiness and support for you, as friends influence our lives, thoughts, and actions tremendously. To remove toxic friends, be upfront, honest, and unapologetic about your feelings, and state your intention to remove yourself from negative energy; real friends will recognize their fault and be understanding about it.Approach a bad friend by saying something like, “Your negative comments are affecting me and I deserve better from a friend. If you can’t be a positive influence in my life, I will have to keep my distance from you.”

, True reinvention means leaving behind bad habits and moving forward. Make a point of being conscious about your vices, flaws, and patterns and dealing with them in a proactive way. Whenever you feel yourself slipping into old habits, gain momentum by doing something, however small, to get yourself out of the spiral.E.g. If you feel yourself procrastinating or avoiding something you have to do, make an outline of the steps you will have to do to complete your task. Planning it is one small step towards getting things done.

Join a club or organization.,
Participate in sports.,
Volunteer.,
Go outside.",How to Make Friends in School2," Your school or community probably sponsors a host of different clubs for children, adolescents or young adults. Research what clubs are available in your area and sign up for one (or many) that sound interesting to you.


Being in a club lets you spend your time outside the classroom constructively. It also helps you learn valuable skills and gain experiences that can help you win college scholarships. More importantly, these extracurricular opportunities give you the chance to form relationships with peers., There are a multitude of advantages of playing sports at your school. Playing a sport at school offers a lot of benefits. It helps you stay fit, hone your leadership and team-player skills, learn organization and commitment, and make new friends.Think about what kind of sports you may be interested in, and aim to try-out at the beginning of the school year when appropriate.

, Helping out in your local community allows you to give back to others, but you can also get something in return. Volunteering gives you meaningful experiences and helps you look more attractive to colleges and employers down the line. Community service also connects you with people you might not otherwise meet from all walks of life.As a result, you may have greater empathy for others, and therefore, be an even better friend.


You may be able to participate in volunteer opportunities through clubs or sports. However, you can also visit websites such as Volunteer Match to find a range of options in your area., If you live in a neighborhood with other nearby families or have a local park, it may benefit you to spend more time outdoors. Doing so enables you to connect with nature and animals, but you might also catch the eye or strike up a conversation with a new bike-riding buddy or catch partner.

Recruit teachers or club organizers to help with friendship match-making.,
Role-play conversations or scenarios with a parent or sibling.,
Seek professional help.",How to Make Friends in School3," When your parents open up their home to your classmates, fellow club members, or team members, two things happen. You are encouraged to build lasting friendships where you can let others get closer to you. Your parents have the opportunity to meet and build rapport with your friends, too.Talk to your parents about having some sort of gathering in which you can invite a few friends at school. Extra points if one of your parents has friends who have children about the same age as you – that way everyone gets the chance to socialize.

, Is there a teacher or other adult in one of your extra-curricular activities with whom you have a good relationship? Enlist this person to help you meet other youth your age who share the same hobbies or interests.Your teachers or club organizers will have built relationships with an assortment of students. If this person knows you well, he should have a good idea of what kind of person you will click with best.

, If social situations make you particularly nervous or you lack confidence in making friends, practicing with someone else could help.

This person can walk through different scenarios with you and offer pointers based on areas where you need help.Suggestions for role-play material might include starting a conversation or asking a potential friend to hang out.

, If you find that, no matter how hard you try, you cannot seem to connect with others at school, you might need to talk with a mental health professional, such as a psychologist or a psychotherapist.

In your sessions, you may role-play and complete exercises that help you feel more confident making new friends.

Make a good first impression.,
Show confidence.,
Be fun.,
Smile.,
Say hi.,
Love yourself.,
Stay healthy.,
Be clean.,
Care for your skin.,
Groom yourself.",How to Make Everyone Love You (Teen Girls)," First impressions are crucial, so make sure yours is stellar. First impressions are always the ticket to having people love you. If people see you dressing well, then they'll want to be friends with you. But, if they aren't attracted to being your friend, then how will they ever have a chance to know what's hiding beneath all the baggy clothes? Get a look that suits you, and wear it with pride.;
, This is incredibly important, as it makes or breaks the whole process. You can be a shining beauty, but if you do not have confidence, you will not go very far toward your goal. Walk with your head held high, back straight and a smile on your face. You might feel awkward, but trust that it doesn't look as bad as you think it does. Speaking clearly and loudly is also part of having lots of confidence. Try not to be overconfident, or people might start to think that you are just downright cocky.

, Everyone loves to be around people who can make them laugh and smile. Having fun is what also attracts people to you. When other people see you having fun, they'll want to join in on whatever you're doing, so make sure you look like you're having fun! Be hyper, crack jokes, make people feel comfortable around you. Even if someone approaches you that isn't exactly your type, that means you're off to a good start because everyone will love and want to be your friend.

, Everyone loves to see a smile - it will light up their whole day.

, Even if you are just walking in the corridors, say hi to people. They will realise that you are a nice person and will want to know you better.

, This goes without saying. If you love yourself, then people will see that and respect your self image. Compliment yourself. Treat yourself - massages, a mani/pedi or just hanging out with your friends without doing any homework or other stressful activities.

, You don't necessarily have to be fit, but eating 2 servings of fruit, 5 of veges and plenty of water really helps. Water, when the proper amount is consumed (8 metric cups per day), makes your skin glow and flushes out all of the toxins. Eating a balanced diet with plenty of fruit and vegetables does help your complexion too. Exercise regularly, aiming for three times a week. Build it up from there. You don't have to slog away at the gym either. Join a dance class, get some yoga DVDs or go biking with your friends.

, No one likes a smelly girl. Shower once a day, or at least every second day. Wash your hair every second day. You should exfoliate once to twice a week. Salt mixed with body wash is good for your body, but mix in a little white sugar with your facial cleanser to exfoliate the face. Don't do this too often, otherwise it can irritate the skin. Brush your teeth - preferably with a whitening product - twice a day, floss once daily so as not to make your gums bleed and use mouthwash for minty fresh breath. Don't forget that spritz of perfume before you leave.

, Develop a skin cleansing routine for oily skin. If you are blessed with naturally flawless skin, still wash with cold water every morning and evening to prevent those dreaded pimples. Those with skin problems - try to keep your products as natural as possible. Tea tree oil is perfect. Cleanse every morning and evening. To wet your face, use warm water to open the pores. Gently smooth the cleanser over your entire face in circular motions, then rinse with cold water. These are just general instructions - please read the back of your products. And don't forget to moisturise!

, Get a manicure - French tips are easy and always classy. Make sure you look presentable, that your clothes are neat. try to get some fashionable items into your wardrobes - wearing 'fad' items can actually gain you some respect. But don't directly copy the trend (say, if black converse are in, get a red pair). Make it your own.

Some conversation starters can be... ""Hi I love your shoes...I'm (name) by the way"" Or ""It's really hot/cold today!"" 'How was your weekend?"" Or even just ""Hi what's your name?"" Talk to lots of different people to make lots of friends.;
, If you don't have a seating plan, try to sit next to someone you don't know very well or haven't spoken to. That way you can find out more about them. Don't be shy or scared because being quiet will mean that you're missing out on making friends.

, Some people make friends faster than others and that's both normal and okay. All you have to do is be friendly––compliment people sometimes; they may be more likely to want to be your friend if you're nice to them. And be approachable. Smile! Even if you don't talk to someone, a simple smile can help!

, Sites and networking places such as, Instagram, Facebook, Twitter or even just message can help a lot. Talking to people on the weekends is also very helpful as you can find out more about them. Don't be afraid to ask someone for their number or online name, just to chat. It is a great way to find out what or how people are doing.

, If you are interested in joining any clubs of after school activities, feel free to do so. It is a great way to meet new people in your school that have the same interests as you. You don't just have to make friends with people in your form. Having a wide range of friends is a good idea.

, Hanging out with people after school is a good way to get to know people more and have fun. On your first few days of school, all you should try to do is to talk to people. After you have gotten to know people a bit, that is when you should be organizing events where you can have a great time!

, Real friends don't need you to change. They love you for who you are! So just be original, because as the saying goes.....""an original is worth more than a copy."" It's extremely important that you don't change yourself to please other people. Just be who you are and people will like you for the person you really are. If they don't, then that tells you that those persons aren't a good fit with you.

, Saying 'please' and 'thank you' are important. Offer to help someone with their work if they are struggling. All of these kind gestures can go a long way. If you can't help someone, complimenting is also an amazing way to come across as a very nice person, and it will make people want to be your friend.

, If someone tells you a secret, fight the urge to tell someone. This can be a long term help to making friends. Just be loyal to your friend. Everyone wants to make friends with a nice, trustworthy person, so be honest and reliable.

Understand that changing schools is just a transition and will soon be over.,
Don't try to act like everyone else.,
Try to open up as you meet new people.,
Start by finding an opening.,
Once you have a group of friends, try not to bring up profanity, vulgar language, or obscenity in your conversations.

,
Keep your words to a limit.,
Always listen to the person speaking, even if it's not interesting.,
Maintain a good reputation.,
Don't tell everyone about anything bad you did at your old school.",How to Keep a Clean Reputation at a New School," You are not permanently the ""new kid"". When you first arrive, everyone tries to get to know you. This is normal.;
, Be yourself, and you will end up with friends who like you for who you are, not someone you're pretending to be.

, Start engaging in others' activities or groups. Don't just walk up and start talking, though. This can be taken as weird or desperate.

, An appropriate example would be like this: Let's say a kid does a presentation on 'Minecraft'. If your interests are similar, don't stress, but also don't miss the opportunity to talk to him/her. You can say something along the lines of ""Your presentation was really good!"" When they reply, continue the conversation. If you and that person get along, congratulations! You've made a friend! Continue trying to build friendships. The more friendships you build, the better network of friends you have, making your life a bit easier, as almost everywhere you go in the school there should be at least one person you know.

,, Although people will be interested in you and ask you questions, don't just go letting out every secret of yours - ask them about themselves.

, They listened to you, so you should return the favor.

,


Try not to be too negative. Instead of, ""Ugh, oh my gosh, I hate my parents. They never let me do anything."" say something like this: ""Man, I wish my parents would let me do more"". The first sentence makes you sound stressed, rude, and overall just a mad person, but the second sentence seems a bit less negative. People always prefer to be friends with positive people!

, Start off with a clean slate!


Don't show anger or jealousy towards other students. Have respect for even the meanest student. Always keep a nice face, and not a frowning, squinted face. Squinting makes you look unapproachable and rude.
If you don't know about a subject, don't talk about it! It's really annoying when people try to act like they know about something when they actually don't.
Be honest. If you lie, someone will find out eventually, and it will just make possible new friends think you are a dishonest person, and they won't want to be friends with you anymore.
Be nice and caring to everyone. Always make peace and do not start drama.

, What do you like about yourself? Emphasize those traits, skills, and talents that make you uniquely who you are and not like everyone else.

, Start out with a casual smile or a half-hearted wave. Don't stumble to blurt out a ""Hey!"" to someone who you barely know. It takes time. They will warm up if you start out small, but you can't just stay quiet and shy. It intimidates people, believe it or not.

,, Call yourself sweet names and compliment yourself when you feel lousy. List all of your best qualities and then look in the mirror and tell yourself, ""I can do this, I know there is someone out there who thinks I am gorgeous and then there are others who want to be me. I'll make them proud"".

,, Instead of trying to fit in with the popular crowd, real leaders are genuine individuals. When people see that you are your own person, they will want to be surrounded by you because you exude self-confidence. Who cares about social status. Be yourself.

Wait patiently for the results.",How to Win a Student Council Election," Depending on the size of your school, you may be lost in a sea of names. It may even be harder if you’re running against students who are constantly in front of the entire school like athletes or frequent award winners. Think about what makes you unique and how you want the students to remember you and develop a campaign slogan around that.Don't: use a crude or vulgar slogan. It turns some people off, and could get you kicked out of the race.Do: consider funny acronyms (MIA: Mike Is Awesome), puns (Drop the Mike into Student Council) or plays on famous slogans (Just do it. Vote for Mike.)

, Talk to fellow students and get engaged. Put a face and personality to that catchy campaign slogan. Meet as many students as you can by attending as many different school functions as you can. Even if you aren’t the most popular person running, there’s no reason you can't change that.


Passion is infectious. Showing everyone how badly you want to win and how hard you’re willing to work for it can help your cause.Don't: act ""fake"" or pushy.Do: greet people and explain your positions as though you were talking to an acquaintance.


, Take a quick poll to find out what the majority of your fellow students are looking for in the upcoming new year. Whether you ask your circle of friends, stand up at the end of a few of your classes, or walk around the cafeteria during lunch, you will soon get a clear picture of what’s important to most of your classmates.


It’s often difficult for students to express themselves especially in front of an audience. Asking your peers one-on-one might be an easier way to get authentic answers rather than sarcasm or silence.
Ask yourself what you’re looking for and see if this aligns with the answers people are giving you. Better yet, give some examples to help ease conversation. You can ask whether people want an extra school dance, another vending machine, or an extra pep rally. Just remember to be realistic as the power of your position is surely limited.

, Speak to your principal, vice principal, and teachers to understand the election process and how much power each elected position holds. You may learn that the position you want has too many responsibilities based on your already full calendar of extracurricular activities.


Ask questions like: what is the election format? When is the election? What responsibilities does each position have? Create a checklist so that you make sure you’ve done everything required to get a nomination.

, Each school is different but you may need a combination of students and school officials to vouch for you to make your nomination official. Make sure that you know the minimum number of people needed to make your nomination official.

, The most important thing is to get your name out there so don’t get caught up in elaborate designs. Make sure your name is clear and visible, and build from there.

Don't: make the design too elaborate or complicated.Do: make sure the poster catches the eye and that your name is clearly readable from a distance.


Make a budget for your posters. Posters can be costly depending on how large your school is and how involved you plan to make the poster, so make sure you calculate how much you want to spend on poster material like paint, poster board, and tape.
Posters are visual but should not just show but also tell. Don’t try to fit in too much text on your posters because people will tune it out. Additionally, don’t just have a cool image without your name, what you’re running for, and why you should be elected.Check for spelling and grammar errors. Make sure people can read your posters from a distance and that the fonts you choose aren’t cluttered or illegible., Make sure to place these posters in high traffic areas like the cafeteria, school gym, or outside of the bathrooms. Make sure to ask school officials where you are allowed to place your posters because you don’t want to cover important school displays or safety markings.Step outside of the box. It doesn’t hurt to wait a day or two to see what your competition is doing. You want to stand out not blend into all the noise. Try changing the shape or message of your poster to stand out from the rest.
Don’t place your poster over anyone else’s as it will look petty and could get you kicked out of the race.

, Whether you create buttons, pamphlets, or t-shirts, ask school officials what is acceptable and then devise a strategy on what will be the most effective. For example, some schools may only allowed posters of a certain size whereas others may allow free t-shirt giveaways.


Make a budget. Depending on what you plan to make, costs can quickly add up. For example, creating 100 flyers will be a lot cheaper than creating 100 t-shirts.
Everyone loves free stuff so sometimes it’s worth it to have a few giveaways but make sure that voters will have a positive association. There’s no use in spending money on something nobody wants or worse, spending money and not getting their vote. Be cautious if attempting to win votes this way.Effective giveaways are things that will have the dual purpose of advertising your name by being visible while being in use like t-shirts, stickers, mugs, or balloons.

, Whether you recruit your friends or your basketball team, campaigning is always easier when you have help. Choose people that have your best interests in mind.


Be mindful of everyone’s time. Don’t take advantage of those who are willing to help you.

, Whether you are campaigning alone or together with a team, manage your resources by creating a calendar.


Make sure everyone has access to the calendar. Either make copies, send an email, or use a shared app. You don’t want someone to miss an important deadline because they simply forgot.
Color code key dates so you can prioritize and follow up with your team as each date draws near.

, Start a campaign event or page and invite as many people as you can. Different social media sites have different restrictions so be sure to choose the right social media site to spread your message effectively.


Don't: treat your social media page as a text chat. This is your public face, so avoid mean comments and off-topic posts.Do: show that you know what goes on at the school, making school-wide inside jokes or congratulating a school sports team after a victory.

Don’t bombard people with unwanted messages. You can lose votes if your campaigning is seen as annoying.
Get creative. Social media is meant to engage people so don’t just make this a one-way conversation. Get people talking by asking questions on sites like Facebook or Twitter. Social media sites may have special apps to help you create creative campaigns that will have your peers talking. For example, hold a Candy Crush tournament and giveaway prizes so people associate your name with a very addictive apps.

, Make yourself visible and speak to as many people as you can throughout the school. Get people familiar with you so that they trust you enough to give you their vote. Don’t act like someone who you aren’t because people will see through that and will ultimately vote for someone else.


Speaking to strangers can be a scary proposition, especially if you are shy or an introvert so take it at your own pace.
When you speak to people, ask for clarity and empathize with their concerns. ""Do you mean you want an extra school dance or to change the homecoming schedule? I completely agree that November seems a bit scattered.""
Bring someone with you for support. Ask open ended questions to break the ice like “where are you from?” Level the conversation because no one wants to be talked down to so be authentic. For example, say something like “Hi, I’m trying to run for the student election but I’m a bit shy. Thanks for chatting with me and giving me the chance to get to know as much about my peers as I can...” You can also talk about topics that have nothing to do with the election to break the ice like what’s happening in pop culture.Avoid targeting a specific group but tailor your message for your audience. While you can ask your teacher if you can speak to her class or approach different clubs or teams, don’t focus all your energy on a single group. For example, you don’t want to alienate the chess club by concentrating your message on the football team.

, Ask school officials what the parameters of the speech will be because you may have to say several speeches to different groups or a single speech to the entire school. You may also have the opportunity to choose when and where you deliver the speech so be prepared.


Often schools will give a time limit for speeches, so be aware of the format.
Strike the right tone. Some of us are naturally funny, serious or somewhere in between. Knowing your audience will help you strike the right chord when you are writing your speech., Be prepared and write down what you say. It may be tempting to speak from the heart but you may be squandering a perfect opportunity to capture votes with a perfectly crafted message.

Don't: write an essay. Avoid long sentences and complex arguments.Do: keep it clear, direct, and above all short.


It’s easy to lose your train of thought when in front of the audience so having something prepared will keep your focus.
It’s easy to get bored when someone begins to ramble so put yourself in your audience’s shoes and eliminate any chances of delivering a boring speech. Audiences expect a path and a destination from your speech so make sure you have both by creating an outline.Focus on keeping it simple and keep revising to reduce any contradictions, confusing language, or boring exposition. You want to get your core message across in the most memorable way possible., People quickly form their first impressions within a few seconds so prepare to capture the attention of your audience immediately. Engage your audience as soon as you start and build from there.Don't: open with a joke that not everyone will get, or that your funniest friend vetoes.Do: start with a slogan, anecdote, or anything with a little pizazz.


Be careful not to offend just for the sake of garnering attention.

, Depending on how long you have, it’s easy for people to drift in and out of a conversation, so make sure to emphasize your core points by repeating them throughout your speech. More importantly, make sure your message is coherent by using transitions between topics.Don’t be afraid to use pauses for emphasis. Silence can provide a dramatic spotlight to an important point.
Use phrases like “What does this mean” and “Here’s the most important thing” to help drive home your points., It’s easy to use notes as a safety net but maintaining eye contact is important. While some of us are better public speakers than others, reading your speech can be the kiss of death if your delivery is boring and bland.


Enlist the help of teachers, members of the debate team, or anybody comfortable with public speaking to give you tips specific to your personality. While you may not be shy, there are often subtle tricks to improving your body language and delivery. For example, standing with a straight posture and smiling portrays confidence and a friendly personality.
Rehearse as much as possible in front of as many people as possible. The more practice you have and the more feedback you can get gives you the opportunity to improve and gain confidence.
Don’t be afraid to use theatrics. For example, dress up like a famous tv character or use a visual metaphor like sparklers for how the school will change if you’re elected. Keep the props, storyline, and lesson simple but don’t play it safe. If you’re going to commit to this you have to commit all the way or you may come across negatively., Once you’re happy with what you’ve written and practiced how you want to deliver it, stand up in front of your audience and confidently give your speech.


Vary the tone of your voice to emphasize key words.
Finish strong. Whether you want to end with a bit of funny theatrics or on a serious note, make sure your ending has your audience talking well after the speech because it will be the last thing that they remember.Keep it short. The attention of your audience will wane quickly. This is especially true as the size of the audience grows., Depending on your school, you might be subjected to a Q & A from your peers or teachers. Make sure you know all the facts about your campaign and important school policies.

, Talk to as many students as you can so you can leave a lasting impression right before they vote.


Make sure you understand the voting procedures and impart that to the voters.

, Lead by example and place your vote. Stay by the polls in case anyone needs your advice or help.


Staying by the polls will give that final impression to potential voters so make sure to be friendly. Being overly eager will give off an air of desperation so keep things cordial and only answer questions if asked. Keep the atmosphere light and fun.

, Stay positive. If you have done everything in your power then you should be proud of your effort.


No matter what you do, you can’t get into the minds of your voters so don’t dwell on a loss. Be cordial in defeat and learn from your experience.

, This is preferably done on a computer. Write ""PETITION"" in a large font. Hit return and write ""for (your goal)"" below in a medium font. That will be your title. Although you may sign your name on the petition, do not type your name.

, If it is a small goal, like salsa in the cafeteria, you only need one or two sentences. Larger goals, such as loosening the school's bathroom policies, may require a more letter-like format. Write the letter as if you are writing for your English teacher, using proper grammar and well-developed points. The things that you need to present are:


What exactly you want changed (e.g. Better bathrooms, no bathroom time limits, etc.)






Why you want it changed (e.g. No one wants to hold it or sit on a gross seat)
Some kind of scientific, medical, or other proof to back you up (e.g. ""Sucking it up"" can cause constipation, people who hold their bladders as youth will need adult diapers later on, excretion is a basic right of living beings)
Alternatives that provide the pro's of the rule and not the cons (e.g. Placing a guard or smoke detector in the bathroom can deter druggies without punishing those that must go)

If they do, it can greatly augment the number of votes you receive.;
, Identify groups at your school who have a vested interest in one particular aspect of the school’s operations and solicit them for help. Sports teams and academic clubs are great groups to approach, since these groups utilize school resources for activities from which individual members benefit.Approach the football team to see if they need new equipment, a better playing field, or more support from the student body. As a student representative, you may be able to help them achieve these goals.
Get involved in special events and fundraisers for particular causes as well. If the chess team has a fundraiser to help them travel to a tournament, your presence at the event could be reason enough for the entire chess club to vote for you.

, Some schools do not allow faculty members to be involved in student elections in any way. Others require a faculty supervisor for candidates. Figure out your school’s policy and, if necessary, enlist faculty support. Approach a teacher who you know you work well with and ask him or her.

, Every school has different rules and guidelines for the use of marketing materials in your campaign. Make sure you are aware of these rules and follow them closely. You don’t want to be disqualified from your campaign.


Don't hang flyers or posters for your campaign in areas of the school where they are not supposed to be.
Don't pass out trinkets or gifts to potential voters if this is not allowed in your school.

, You're not going to win if people don't know you're running. Put up eye-catching posters with memorable slogans to attract the attention of your classmates. Make sure to use bright colors and place these posters in highly trafficked areas of the school, as this will help make sure your signs get seen.If there is a particular hallway or room where students congregate often, place your campaign signs in that area.
Use neon green, yellow, orange or pink poster boards to make your signs. These colors have been proven effective in catching people's attention.

, Make fliers, buttons, and pamphlets to pass among your peers. As helpful as signs will be to your campaign, giving the voters something physical that they can hold on to will serve as a reminder that you are running throughout the duration of the campaign. In your fliers or pamphlets, make sure you espouse some positions and give the voters some information about yourself. Try handing out candy. Everyone loves candy and they really like the people who give it to them for free!
If your school doesn't allow you to hand out candy, then try handing out bracelets, pencils, and stickers. You may find that people are sticking your stickers on the wall and that is just extra exposure.

, If you school will allow you to, write your campaign slogan or “vote for …” on the sidewalks around your school or in the parking lot in chalk. These sidewalks are highly visible areas to promote your campaign. Again, use bright eye-catching colors and memorable slogans.Again, neon colors are ideal for catching the attention of your classmates.
Make sure to check with your school to ensure this is allowed.

, Don't run for class president your first year out. Try one of the other positions, instead. If you're new at the school, try volunteering for a position that's not elected your first year, such as yearbook or newspaper. It will be a good way to get to know classmates and the school and gain experience before you run.


You may also wish to start your own club or organization. Spearheading an initiative like this will allow you to stand out from the crowd as someone who is willing to invest his own time to improve the student experience.

, For example, if you like writing, run for secretary. If you're a leader, try president or vice president. It is best to attempt to win a position in which you will naturally excel., If you make reasonable pledges that are appealing to the majority of people, many of those same people will vote for you (for example, say you'll create a short break between classes during each day). However, don't pledge to do something you know you can't do, like getting rid of homework; most people won't believe you and those who do will be disappointed if you can't make it happen.Always be aware of the limitations of your office. You don't want to make promises now only to find out later that you don't have the authority.

, Most school elections give the candidates an opportunity to deliver a speech to their classmates. This speech will likely be one of the most important components of your campaign. Here are some tips for delivering a quality speech:


When you make a speech, keep it short, and to the point. Tell the voters why you are the best candidate for the office you're running for.Speak clearly and stand confidently like you know you are deserving of the office you're seeking. When making a speech, don't try to plead, bribe, blackmail, or make promises you cannot fulfill. Know what you can and cannot do in the office you're seeking. Add humor to your speech. Don't lie. Be honest. If you make impossible promises you aren't able to keep, no one will vote for you in the future.Make hand gestures and move around your audience while making speeches. This will help keep their attention.

, If you get elected president, make all of your possible promises come true, and try to make a good one, so you can get elected once more.


Make a note of the things you promised to do while campaigning.
Tackle those issues one by one, checking off your initiatives as you go.
Be prepared to fight for something you promised the student body. Perhaps you said you would try to increase the amount of time between classes, but the school's administration says it can't be done. Don't just give up. Ask questions of the administration and challenge any inconsistencies in their explanation. Your classmates voted for you so that you could represent them. Even if you can't get them what they want, you can at least say you tried your best.

Understand that your child is going through lots of physical and emotional changes.,
Middle school isn't as sunny and jolly as the principals claim it is on open house night.,
If your child is bullied, report it.,
Be there for your child.,
Be patient.,
Don't get mad at every bad grade.,
Help them with friends.,
Encourage their passions.,
Ask questions.",How to Support a Middle Schooler," Puberty can make a simple issue into a tragedy for your child, boy or girl, and you must understand that it isn't completely your fault. When your child's emotions are as strong as they are during puberty, simple things like changing voices, growing pains, and stronger B.O. can be extremely stressful and maybe even devastating.;
, When kids starting searching for their own identities, some people get left behind, and some of the ones ahead get completely lost. Strict teachers, more homework, and stress are part of middle school. Don't call the principal to complain every time your kid does, just be there to get them through it. (After all, you can't call your boss and demand your annoying co-worker is fired!)

, But just because the problem is gone doesn't mean your child isn't wounded. Encourage them to lean on friends and family whenever anything is too tough to bear.

, Give out lots of ""I love you!""s, hugs and kisses (though maybe in private from now on!), advice, and a shoulder to cry on. Every girl and boy will feel lost from time to time--this is life! Knowing they are loved and that they have someone to lean on is essential for their emotional health.

, Your son/daughter DOESN'T hate you. You're NOT ruining their life. Middle school is stressful, for the millionth time, and that can build up. Don't let them drink or smoke or do drugs.

, If they start bringing home a series of F's, that's one thing. But if they are an A/B student, don't flip out if they have a bad day and don't do so well on a single quiz.

, If your pink-everything girly girl comes home with a group of goths, sit her down and ask if that's truly who she wants to hang out with. Tell her to be honest, and remind her that there are plenty of fish in the sea, and being with the wrong ones will only do her bad. If this is her new crew for sure, accept them (unless they truly are a wretched example!)

, Trying to make your artsy son play football isn't gonna help anyone! Their passion may be the only escape from the pressures of middle school, so please don't take that away!

, Kids LOVE to know their parents care!

Make sure you have high self-esteem.,
Do not get rid of your friends because they get made fun of or may get you made fun of unless they are the ones being mean.

,
Although it can be hard, act confident.,
Try to get new clothes that are a little more in style.,
If you don't already like your face, wear a little makeup and make sure your face is always clean.

Join more school groups to meet more people.

,
Stand straight and walk confidently.

¤ Just act mature and be yourself.",How to Go from Freak to Cool," If you don't, learn that everyone is different and that you can be proud of who you are. If you still can't seem to find friends, a counselor may be able to help. Friends help build self-esteem and even if your friends are freaks, they can help you a lot.;
,, Do not take it personally when people are mean. If they are really mean, who cares if you impress them, they don't care anyway. Try to ignore them, but tell a trusted adult if they harass you.

, If you don't have much money, you can go to resale shops like Plato's Closet and Goodwill or cheaper stores for your clothes. If you can, go to the mall.

,,,,,,, Don't let other people make you sad. Just think you don't need to make fun of other people to make yourself feel better. Don't let others rule your life. Oh and one more thing make sure that you are nice to be around. Because if people enjoy being around you you will et more friends. Find people who like the same stuff as you. Good Luck!!!!

Write and give a solid speech.",How to Run for Student Council President," The Student Government or Student Council at your school is the elected governing body that plans and executes programs that the school can benefit from in one way or another. Run for a position as early on as you can. If you’re elected, you’ll be seen participating in and helping to organize fundraisers, fun events, and more. This will also allow you to gain the experience you need to be an effective president later on., Most of the time, every grade level has a president, vice president, secretary, and treasurer, so don’t automatically start off running for the highest position available. Even if you get elected to be the treasurer or the secretary, it can help you to establish yourself in a leadership role and start climbing the ladder towards the presidency., Every school has their own unique process for electing students. Make sure to learn about application deadlines, obligatory paperwork, and any other requirements for running. You can get this information from the adults at the school who lead and oversee the student council. This will keep you from overlooking something and getting disqualified or appearing unprepared when you run for presidency., Most schools have a wide variety of club options from athletic teams (soccer, football, volleyball, etc.), to artistic clubs (chorus, dance, photography), and many others in between. Read through the list of different clubs that your school offers and attend two or three meetings of different clubs that involve something of interest to you. Additionally, make sure to attend all social events that your school holds, such as prom. Consistently participating in these after school activities will allow you to get to know students who you may not have normally crossed paths with., If you want a shot at being elected president, you need to always present yourself as a responsible, professional individual. This will help students who know you well or just a little feel like they can trust you. Try to participate in class discussions and make good grades. Being known as the student who is always sleeping in class or is always on their cell phone won’t inspire others to trust or respect you., Promising flashy, fun, and temporary services like a water slide or free cake might help you gain a few students’ vote, but the only way to gain true loyalty is by listening to the wants and needs of the students and making it your focus to help them. This might mean talking to the principal about adding a vegetarian lunch option or asking teachers to volunteer to stay at school an hour late once a week so that struggling students can have a study hall.Make sure to survey students from different social circles and backgrounds to get this information.

, Do your best to make a mental note about the different things you learn about people. Even remembering their name and saying “Hi, Ashley!” or “How’s it going, Ron?” in the hallway will make them feel truly noticed and cared for.For example, if an acquaintance tells you in passing that they’re going to Florida for spring break and you see them on the first day back from school, you could walk up to them and ask how they enjoyed their time in Florida.

, Once you start getting to know many of the students at your school, you’ll start to notice that one student’s problem could be helped by another particular student. When you notice this, make sure to speak up. This shows that you have an impressive network but also that you are considerate enough to use it to help others.For example, if you overhear a couple of cheerleaders trying to figure out where they can hold their annual car wash fundraiser, you might suggest the parking lot of a local business that you know another student’s family owns.

, If your friend asks you to do something outside of school or you get an idea for an activity on your own, spread the word and let everyone know they’re welcome to join. This shows that you’re inclusive and don’t discriminate.If a couple of your close friends want to go bowling on Saturday night, spread the word to everyone you talk to that week. At the end of the conversation you might say: “Hey, I almost forgot. A bunch of us are getting together to go bowling on Saturday night. It would be awesome if you could join us!”

, Based on the wants and needs of the students, develop a solid, realistic purpose for your campaign that can benefit everyone the most. Is there something that really needs to be changed? Have you discovered an opportunity to make a difference? Identify your vision and begin to communicate it as much as you can.If you’ve overheard several students talking about their struggles with being bullied at school, you might decide that your vision should have an accepting, inclusive, anti-bullying focus.
If your school only does one volunteer activity each year that a lot of students enjoy doing together, you might create a vision on paying it forward and plan to provide more volunteer activities and events.

, Come up with one good, catchy slogan to put on all of your marketing materials. Something like “Jack for Council President” is boring and overdone, so get creative and come up with something that communicates your vision, rhymes, or makes a comedic reference.If you want a funny rhyming slogan, you could do something like, “Don’t be wack, vote for Jack!”

, Putting attractive, eye-catching posters all around the school with your slogan is a necessity. Post them everywhere that you think people walk by frequently. Also, create buttons, pencils, or fliers with your slogan on them to hand out at school. These will get your name out there and possibly even communicate your message and intention.For example, if your vision is about bringing together students of different backgrounds and social circles, you might create an artistic poster that has only the word “unite” in all caps and features drawings or headshots of the faces of a few different students who have varying styles and ethnicities.
Consider how many students go to your school when deciding how many posters you hang. If only about 100 students go to your school, you can hang 10 posters or less. If your school has 1,000 students or more, you may want to put up closer to 50 posters.

, Use technology to your advantage and create groups, post promotional videos, etc. to have a presence on social media websites such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. This gets the word out off campus and also gives people another opportunity to connect with you, show support for you, and learn about you., Your campaign speech may be the last (or only!) bit of information that students hear from you until it’s time for them to vote. Because of this, it’s important that you write, practice, and give a strong speech spanning about 2-3 minutes. In your speech, you should:


Introduce yourself
Explain why they should vote for you by talking briefly about your qualifications and positive personal characteristics
State your platform/express what you’d like to change
Explain how you are going to accomplish goals and make changes
Finish with your slogan"

Letters to the editor.",How to Start a School Newspaper in Middle School," Starting a school newspaper can be fun, but it's a huge responsibility. Don't bother starting if you're not planning to follow through for the entire year. If you start the newspaper, you will assume the role of the editor. The editors' job is to:


Make sure you have the articles in on time (preferably by email).
Design the templates for the articles.
Format and proofread the articles on your computer to get them ready for printing.
Write one article. The editor traditionally writes either the front page or * Sell the newspaper (unless you hire a salesman).;
, Arrange a meeting with your principal to discuss the idea of a school newspaper to bring it to his/her attention. Remember, if they say no, make a compromise.

, This is essential for the success of the newspaper. A teacher brings something very important to the party, and that is authority. A teacher is there primarily to help make sure that everyone gets their articles in on time. With a teacher, staff simply feel an obligation to get their articles in. This really makes your job a lot easier. Students in middle school will tend to slack off if not given authority. A teacher not only sees to it that articles are handed in on time, with a teacher around, staff will quit over 80% less. The teacher will also be responsible for printing. Once he/she has the articles, he/she would have to format them onto legal-sized paper and print the copies. It's a big responsibility for one teacher, so I would recommend getting two teachers to split the work. If you can't find a teacher for your newspaper, look for other ways to do it. Two students can run a good school newspaper. You may need to do an online edition on your schools website. The school librarians will probably be happy to help. Your main problem may be teachers who won't allow club meetings to be announced.

, Typical school newspapers have 12 articles, so I would recommend hiring 11 people to do the articles leaving one for you, and a salesperson, who will be responsible for advertising and selling the newspaper. Some people can pair up to do one article, so you could hire more than 12 people. Try to assign people to their articles in consideration to their personality and responsibility.If you have more applications than you need, meet with your teacher or principal to make a decision together on who will make the staff.

, Arrange a meeting with all your staff during a recess or after school. Make sure you all exchange emails so when people send you their articles, all you have to do is copy and paste, rather than having to retype the whole newspaper. Also, get your teachers email so you can send him/her the final copy for printing.

, Because most school newspapers have 12 articles, brainstorm 12. Some ideas are: games, colouring contest, short story, horoscopes, advice, random facts, sports, poetry or fashion. Once you have these articles planned out, open a word document and come up with cool titles and layout for your newspaper. You can copy a few things from the internet, but if it has a copyright, make sure to say where you got them from. Save it to the desktop if necessary. Remember the newspaper will go onto legal-sized paper.

, Recommend to your staff that once they hand in their first article, get a head start on their next article because life happens e.g. sickness, vacation, family affairs etc. Also tell them to let you know if they can't get one article in so you can cover for them. Print off the schedule and give it to all your staff members.

, Brainstorm at a meeting where the proceeds will go. It could go to somewhere in your school, a local charity or even a staff party at the end of the year. Anything to keep them motivated.

, Use your common sense for what's suitable for a middle school newspaper. Don't print anything hinting on weapons, violence, drugs, or basically anything that's illegal or not fit for middle school.

, If you have your schedule on track, your teacher should be able to print it, but you will have to fold it. Ask for him/her to print 50 copies and if the newspaper is popular enough and you sell out easily, next issue ask for 75 or 100 copies. Go into the office, or wherever your folding site may be, and get going. This shouldn't take to long, maybe 20 minutes to fold all the papers. If you have a large school, print more copies, or do an online edition.

, You shouldn't have to do very much in this department as long as you have a good salesman. Ask your salesman to start advertising every day a week before sales on the P.A system at your school. Also ask him/her to put up posters of the school newspapers. This way is more permanent and doesn't need to be tended to. Arrange with whoever controls the announcements in your school that your salesman can come in to advertise.

, To offset the costs of printing, you may need to sell advertising. Advertisers love school newspapers because their audience is very defined (students). Brainstorm some potential advertisers, they should be selling products targeted at students, e.g. Tutors, driving instructors, job postings, cinemas etc... Don't include too many ads (no more than 40%) and intersperse them throughout the publication. Consider adding certain sections to attract advertisers e.g. film reviews for a cinema ad, study tips for a tutor ad.

, Find a certain date, time and place to sell your newspaper. The salesman will also take care of the sales, so all you have to do is find a way to get the newspapers to him/her before they are to go on sale.

, If you have an advice column or a letters to the editor column, place a shoe box with a hole in it to place the letters in somewhere. Decorate it so it draws more attention, but all you really have to do is indicate that it's for the newspaper. If you get no questions or letters, make a few up. If you follow all these instructions correctly, you should have a a fair newspaper at the end of it all and have fun.
