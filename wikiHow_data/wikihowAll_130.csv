Select a cut of meat.,
Remove all noticeable fat.,
Marinate the meat (optional).,
Coat the meat in the seasonings of your choice.,
Dehydrate the meat.,
Wait and watch.,
Alternately, use an oven if you don't have a dehydrator.,
Place the fresh jerky somewhere dry to store.",How to Make Beef Jerky," Choosing a lean cut like sirloin, flank steak, top round, or eye round will save time later.


Some jerky nowadays is also made from turkey. Turkey has a mild flavor, making it a perfect sponge for all your yummy seasoning. Plus, turkey is very lean.
Your jerky need not be limited to beef and turkey, however. Many types of jerky — bison, deer, elk, caribou, and salmon, among others — can and should be used.;
, Fat causes the jerky to spoil much faster. Slice your meat into very thin strips less than 1/20"" thick (sometimes a butcher will do this for you for an extra fee if you ask). To make it easier to slice, freeze it for about 5 hours before slicing. You can cut with or against the grain; some find that strips cut against the grain are easier to chew. Trim the fat as you go along, since fat does not dry.


While it is true that fat causes meat to spoil faster, it's also not very tasty and very chewy beneath your teeth. That could be mentioned since most people don't enjoy eating the fat, especially on a jerky. You can still feel its texture, even when it is dried up.

, Use a solution of olive oil and vinegar sea salt, or a recipe of your preference. If you choose to marinate the meat, place in the refrigerator for 10 - 24 hours so that the beef can absorb the flavor. This step is optional; the additional moisture can make dehydration take longer and the resulting jerky may be stickier. Brown sugar is a great addition.


One good combination marinade is liquid smoke, soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, Tabasco, and brown sugar.
Another great marinade is dark Belgian ale (yes, you read that right!), honey, soy sauce, mustard seeds, garlic, and lime.
Add some kick to your jerky with peppers! Habanero, jalapeno, or Anaheim peppers made a great addition (in moderation) to most jerky recipes.
Add some unusual flavors to your jerky by adding some pineapple juice (Hawaiian jerky); some ginger (Asian jerky); or some curry powder (Indian jerky). Don't be afraid to experiment!

, Don't be afraid to use salt. Salt will aid in dehydrating. Note: a simple marinade of oil, vinegar, liquid smoke, and brown sugar is recommended for the following seasonings.


Try dusting your marinaded jerky with a little bit of salt, pepper, cinnamon and chipotle pepper.






Or try dusting your marinaded jerky with a little coriander, cumin, clove and (even less) nutmeg for an African-style jerky.






Honey, red pepper flakes, and black pepper can also work for a mild and hint of sweet jerky.
Try dusting your marinaded jerky with some crushed oregano, chili powder, garlic powder, and paprika.







, Now comes the rewarding part — removing all moisture from your jerky. Using a dehydrator is the standard way of cooking jerky, although you can use an oven (see Step #3). Leave enough room between pieces to allow air to flow around the meat. Avoid letting the meat separate if possible.


In a dehydrator, spray the racks with non-stick cooking spray and place your prepared meat on the racks.

, Beef jerky takes from eight to twelve hours in order for it to be truly jerky and dried up wonderfully.


Check the consistency of the jerky regularly after 2 hours, and every 30 minutes thereafter, until it meets your satisfaction. Cut into the jerky to ensure that it is not raw inside. Jerky should turn a deep brown or burgundy color.

, Set the temperature to 165° F (70° C) — any less may cause early spoilage as it's not hot enough to kill bacteria in the meat, and will only incubate the bacteria already present in the meat, and allow it to preheat.


Heat is not intended to cook your jerky; gentle heat aids in the dehydration process by causing the moisture to evaporate.
Place your prepared meat directly on a wire rack, with a saucepan or catch underneath to catch the marinade dripping from the jerky.






Cook for 1 - 3 hours, depending on the cut of meat. Dehydration could take even longer, so be sure your meat is cooked through before taking from the oven. Check the jerky after 90 minutes and every 30 minutes thereafter.







, Ideally, use mason jars for the safest seal. Place jerky in the refrigerator or freezer until ready to eat. Enjoy the homemade jerky within two weeks of its preparation. Beef jerky can last up to three months, though.


Ideally, the jerky should be vacuum sealed in plastic with a pouch of oxygen absorber in order to hinder spoilage, although this is not practical in most home situations.

",How to Cook London Broil in the Oven," The garlic, salt, red wine, balsamic vinegar, soy sauce, and honey need to be combined into a thick liquid.




Use a blender or food processor to mince the garlic cloves and salt into a paste.
Add the red wine, balsamic vinegar, soy sauce, and honey to the blender. Continue pulsing until the ingredients are evenly combined into a thick liquid.;
, Poke a few holes in the meat using a sharp fork or knife.






The acidic vinegar will break the meat down even if you do not pierce it beforehand. Poking holes in the steak helps the marinade soak deeper into the meat sooner, however, and is especially useful if you cannot marinate the meat for a long period of time.

, Pour the marinade into a large, heavy-duty sealable plastic bag. Add the meat to the bag and seal. Place the bag in the refrigerator as the steak marinates.






Turn the bag every few hours to ensure even distribution of the marinade.
The longer you allow the meat to marinade, the more flavor it will absorb. Allowing it to soak past 24 hours could cause it to become tough, however.

, Allow the broiler to heat up for 10 minutes.






Most broilers only have ""on"" and ""off"" settings. If your broiler has ""high"" and ""low"" settings, preheat it on high.
Make sure to use an actual broiler pan, rather than a baking pan. A broiler pan has a rack built in that prevents the liquid, rendered fat from becoming too hot and becoming a fire hazard.
Do not use aluminum foil in the broiler pan.

, Remove the broiler pan from the broiler and carefully transfer the steak from the marinade bag and into the pan.






For best results, allow the steak and marinade to return to room temperature before adding it to the hot pan.
Reserve the marinade for basting, if desired. Only use the marinade for basting if you plan on adding it during the middle of the cooking process. The raw meat may have contaminated it, and it will not be safe to use on fully cooked meat.

, Put the broiler pan on the top rack of the oven and cook the steak four to six minutes on each side.






A London broil that goes for 8 minutes will cook to rare, while a steak that cooks for 10 minutes will cook to medium-rare to rare. For a medium-well steak, a full 12 minutes may be necessary. Broiling the steak for too much longer will likely dry it out, however
If desired, baste the steak with a small amount of your reserved marinade when you flip the meat halfway in the middle of the total cooking time.

, After pulling the steak out of the oven, allow it to rest for five minutes before carving and serving it.





, Line a baking sheet with heavy duty aluminum foil.






If you do not have heavy duty foil, use a double layer of standard foil.

, Position the steak in the middle of the foil and fold the sides of the foil together, creating a packet for the meat to cook inside.






Folding the foil over the meat traps heat inside, lessening the overall cooking time while trapping more of the marinade and juices inside.
Make sure that the packet is loose. While you want most of the heat to stay trapped inside, it is also important for air to circulate inside the packets, as well.
If desired, you can also add a few chopped vegetables to the packet before folding it up. Sliced bell peppers and sliced onions make good choices.

, You do not need to turn it or do anything else to the steak while it cooks.





, Allow the steak to rest for 5 minutes before serving.






Exercise caution when unfolding the foil packet. The steam that escapes will be hot, and could burn you if you are not careful. Unfold one corner of the packet, pulling the foil toward you so that the steam escapes in the opposite direction. Wait until the majority of steam escapes before unfolding the rest of the packet.
Cut the meat in 1/2-inch (1.27-cm) slices to serve.
Use a serving spoon to drizzle the juices that accumulated in the packet over the slices of steak.

, The skillet should be preheated over medium-high heat for 5 minutes and the oven should be preheated to 325 degrees Fahrenheit (163 degrees Celsius).






Note that this method works especially well for thicker cuts of steak, since it minimizes overall cooking time. The less amount of time the steak spends inside a warm oven, the juicier it will be.
Make sure that the cast-iron skillet is well-seasoned beforehand. A well-seasoned cast-iron skillet will not need to be greased before you add the meat to it.

, Let the steak cook in the skillet for 2 to 3 minutes on each side.






Use tongs to flip the steak and verify that it has browned nicely on both sides.
For best results, remove the steak from the refrigerator 2 hours in advance to allow it to come to room temperature.

, Remove the cast-iron skillet from the stovetop and transfer it directly into the oven. Cook for roughly 15 to 20 minutes or until it reaches desired doneness.






Cast-iron cookware is safe to use in the oven, but many other types of pans are not.

, After removing it from the oven, let the steak rest for 5 minutes. Carve it into thin slices, cutting against the grain.

Preheat the oven to 400 °F (204 °C).,
Place the leg of lamb in a roasting pan.,
Rub the lamb with herbs, spices and oil.,
If you're roasting vegetables, add them to the roasting pan.,
Roast the lamb for 30 minutes.,
Reduce the heat to 350 °F (177 °C) and continue roasting.,
Allow the lamb to rest for 15 minutes.,
Whip up the mint sauce.,
Arrange slices of roast lamb on a platter.,
Pour a little mint sauce over the lamb.",How to Cook Roast Lamb," It takes only a few minutes to prepare the roast for cooking, so preheat the oven before you get started.






;
, Choose a metal, glass or ceramic pan that's just large enough to hold the entire leg of lamb. If you're roasting the lamb with vegetables, it's fine to use a slightly larger roasting pan.








, Place the garlic, rosemary leaves, salt, pepper, and lemon zest in a bowl. Pour in the olive oil and mix well. Rub the mixture all over the leg of lamb.









If the mixture seems dry, add a bit more olive oil. You need enough of the rub to cover the entire leg of lamb.
Make sure to cover the entire surface of the meat, so that each part cooks evenly and has great flavor.

, Arrange them around the leg of lamb in a single layer, so that the vegetables cook evenly. As they cook, they'll absorb juices that run off the meat.









Don't pile vegetables up the sides of the leg of lamb, since this may cause the lamb to cook unevenly.
If you use russet potatoes, you might want to parboil them first to make sure they cook all the way through. Peel the potatoes and chop them coarsely. Bring a pot of water to a boil and boil the potatoes for 10 minutes, until they are halfway tender. Add them to the roasting pan when the meat is ready to cook., Place the roasting pan in the oven and roast at a high temperature for half an hour. This will create a delicious crust around the leg of lamb.








, Roast for another hour at this lower temperature to make sure the meat gets cooked all the way through. Use a meat thermometer to check the internal temperature of the lamb and determine if it's ready. Leg of lamb tastes best when it's cooked between medium rare and medium well.








For medium rare leg of lamb, remove the dish from the oven when the internal temperature has reached between 145 and 150 degrees Fahrenheit.
For medium or medium well leg of lamb, remove the dish from the oven when the internal temperature has reached between 150 and 155 degrees Fahrenheit.

, Tent aluminum foil over the baking dish and let the lamb rest. This gives the juices time to reabsorb into the meat, creating a succulent, tender dish. After 15 minutes, you may carve the lamb.








, Mix the mint, sugar, vinegar and water in a bowl. Use a whisk to whip the mixture until it's thoroughly incorporated., Place the slices in an artful pattern on a single platter, or put a few pieces on the plates you'll be serving to people., Use a spoon to ladle a little sauce over the lamb slices. Its bright flavor provides the perfect contrast to the deep umami of leg of lamb. As an alternative, you may serve the lamb with some of the juices from the bottom of the pan, to keep the meat moist.

Know that your beef’s source may help, but is no guarantee.,
Choose it cold, and keep it cold.,
Isolate raw meat.,
Use or freeze raw beef sooner rather than later.,
Avoid the “danger zone” as much as possible.,
Wash your hands and all preparation surfaces thoroughly.,
Cook and reheat beef to the recommended temperatures.,
Take precautions when eating out.,
Accept that foodborne bacteria are everywhere.,
Identify common signs of foodborne illness.,
Know when to seek medical attention.",How to Avoid Beef Bacterial Contamination," According to research, it may be somewhat safer to buy grass-fed and/or hormone free beef as opposed to commercially raised beef; the latter type of ground beef was about 20% more likely to contain multiple potentially harmful bacteria strains. However, the same testing revealed that 300 out of 300 packages of ground beef of all types contained at least one potentially harmful bacteria.No matter how it is raised, prepared, packaged, or stored, all beef contains bacteria, and some of it can potentially harm you. There is no such thing as bacteria-free beef, although most of the time the bacteria that is present is harmless.;
, Buy beef that is displayed in a cold setting and feels cold to the touch, and keep it that way until you are ready to cook it. Bring a cooler to store your purchased raw beef if you cannot refrigerate it within an hour or so of purchasing it.Bacteria of all types thrive in temperatures ranging between 40 and 140 degrees Fahrenheit (4-60 degrees Celsius). This range is known as the “danger zone,” and your beef, raw or cooked, should stay out of it as much as possible.

, Don’t just pitch a package of raw meat into your shopping cart, on top of the cereal boxes and bag of apples. Bacteria from the meat may have made its way onto the wrapping during the packaging process, and any leaking juices can transmit bacteria.Place meat packages into individual plastic bags (such as the rolled produce bags found in supermarkets) before placing them into your cart. Wash or sanitize your hands after handling the package, if possible. Separate meat packages into their own bag(s) when checking out. Take extra care if you utilize reusable shopping bags — double bag your meat packages in plastic first.
Isolate raw meat in your home refrigerator as well. Place it in a sealed container on the bottom shelf of your fridge, where juices are less likely to drip onto other foods., The “sell by” date is just a recommendation made by the retailer; it makes no guarantee regarding safety or freshness. To reduce the risk of bacteria development, ground beef in particular should be used or frozen within two days of purchase; whole cuts can be kept for a couple days longer if necessary.Only high heat can kill bacteria; cold can only make them dormant, and the colder, the better. Set your refrigerator at 40 degrees Fahrenheit (4 C) or below, and your freezer at zero degrees F (-18 C)., During any stage of the process, and whether or not the meat is raw or cooked, you should limit as much as possible its time in the 40-140 degrees Fahrenheit (4-60 C) range. Keep it cold, or keep it hot — not in between.It is safest to thaw frozen beef in the refrigerator. If you need to thaw it faster, place it in a container of cold water in the sink, and change the water every half hour or so. Thawing in the microwave is another option. Do not just let frozen (or refrigerated) meat sit on the counter.Serve cooked beef while it is still hot, and refrigerate any leftovers before they get to room temperature. Never let beef sit out for more than two hours, and never more than one hour at between 90 and 140 degrees Fahrenheit (32-60 C) — this is the extreme danger zone within the “danger zone.”

, Other than thorough cooking, proper cleaning is your best defense against beef bacterial contamination. Immediately after handling raw meat, wash your hands for at least 20 seconds with warm water and soap. Turn on the faucet before handling the meat, or use your elbows instead of your contaminated hands.Wash any utensil or preparation surface that comes in contact with raw beef with soap and hot water. For example, don’t put raw burgers on a tray, cook them on the grill, then return them to the same tray without thoroughly cleaning it first.
Take special care with cutting boards. Whenever possible, dedicate a separate cutting board to meats. Wash the used board immediately, and consider sanitizing it with a solution of one teaspoon of bleach to one quart of hot water. Discard well-used, rutted cutting boards (or sand down wooden ones); ruts offer ample hiding places for bacteria., If you choose to have your steak rare or your burger deep pink and cool in the middle, you simply have to accept that you are increasing your risk of acquiring a bacterial illness. High temperatures are the surest — and really, only — way to kill bacteria in beef.Cook steaks, roasts, chops, etc. to an internal temperature (based on a probe placed into the center of the thickest part of the meat) of at least 145 degrees Fahrenheit (63 C). Let the meat rest for three minutes or more before serving.
Cook ground beef to an internal temperature of at least 160 degrees F (71 C). Bacteria tend to collect on the surface of meats, so ground beef is a greater risk (and thus requires a higher cooking temperature) because the grinding process spreads any surface bacteria throughout.Reheat any type of cooked, refrigerated beef to an internal temperature of 165 degrees F (74 C). Test several spots if using a microwave, since the heating can be quite uneven., Truth be told, you may well eat the majority of your beef outside of your home. As such, you have to rely on the safety measures taken by the food preparer. Whether eating at someone’s house, a restaurant, or a roadside stand, seek out clean locations that clearly prioritize food safety.Especially when dining abroad at a food cart or similar location, eat only meat that has been freshly cooked upon your order and is still hot throughout. Ensure that all plates and utensils are clean — use antibacterial wipes if necessary.

, Simply put, all food contains bacteria. Not all bacteria is bad for you, and most of the time you won’t fall ill from the bacteria in your beef or any other food product. You can significantly reduce, but never completely eliminate, your chances of developing a foodborne illness caused by bacterial contamination.The bacteria found in the beef you buy at the store or restaurant can come from the animal source (the cow), production machinery, contamination during packaging, shipping, or display, or any number of other sources. You can’t see, smell, or taste bacterial contamination; beef doesn’t have to have “gone bad” or be rotten to make you sick.

, Numerous bacteria can cause foodborne illnesses in humans; see a list of common culprits at this USDA webpage. In beef, the most common (but not only) contaminants include salmonella, e. coli, and listeria.If foodborne bacteria such as these make you sick, you will typically experience flu-like symptoms of varying severity. These can include vomiting, diarrhea (sometimes bloody), abdominal pain, fever, and chills. Symptoms can start a few hours to a couple of days after contamination, and can last for hours or several days.

, For the vast majority of healthy adults and older children, a foodborne illness caused by contaminated beef is likely to be nothing more than a very unpleasant experience for a few days. However, people in higher-risk groups need to take greater precautions if a foodborne illness is suspected. And, even the healthiest of individuals needs to know when to contact the doctor when experiencing a lingering or severe foodborne illness.People at elevated risk for severe complications from foodborne illness include: infants and young children; pregnant women and their fetuses; the elderly; and those with weakened immune systems (due to illness, disease, medication, heredity, or another cause). Persons in these categories should contact a medical provider immediately if a foodborne illness is suspected.
No matter your age of level of overall health, contact your doctor if you experience any of the following: signs of dehydration; prolonged vomiting that prevents keeping liquids down; diarrhea for more than 2 days in adults or for more than 24 hours in children; severe pain in the abdomen or rectum; a fever higher than 101 degrees F (38 C); stools containing blood or pus; stools that are black and tarry; nervous system symptoms; signs of HUS (see this link for details).

",How to Make an Inside Out Cheeseburger," To cook the inside-out cheeseburgers, you’ll want to preheat the grill so you know it’s hot enough when the burgers are ready. Set your grill to medium-high and allow it to heat fully.If you prefer, you can cook the burgers under the broiler in your oven or in a frying pan.;
, To season the meat for the burgers, place 2 pounds (907 g) of ground beef into a large bowl. Add 2 tablespoons (34 g) of Worcestershire sauce, 2 teaspoons (2 g) of paprika, and salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste to the meat. Use clean hands to gently mix the beef with the seasonings until they are thoroughly combined.Be careful not to overwork the ground beef when you’re mixing it. That can result in tough burgers.
You can add whatever your favorite burger seasonings are to the ground beef. For example, garlic powder, onion powder, and crushed red pepper are tasty options.

, After you’ve mixed the seasonings into the meat, use your hands to gently shape the ground beef into 12 thin, round patties. They should be approximately 3-inches (7.5-cm) in diameter. Set the burgers aside for a moment.If you’re have trouble forming the ground beef into round patties, you may want to use mold to help you get the shape right. The lid from a peanut butter jar or other small jar can work well., After you’ve made the patties, add 4 ounces (112 g) of shredded sharp cheddar or pepper jack cheese and 1 scallion that’s been finely chopped to a small bowl. Toss the ingredients together so they’re well blended.You can use any type of hard cheese that melts well for the burgers. Swiss, Gruyere, and Monterey jack are tasty options. You can also mix two or more types of cheese for the burgers if you like.
If you’re a fan of bacon cheeseburgers, turn these into inside-out bacon cheeseburgers by mixing 4 slices of cooked, crumbled bacon in with the cheese and scallions.

, Once you’ve mixed the cheese and the scallions, use a spoon to add 1 to 2 tablespoons (7 to 14 g) of the cheese mixture to the center of 6 of the patties that you’ve made. Make sure to leave a ½-inch border around the edges of the patties.It’s important not to overstuff the burgers with the cheese filling or it may leak out when you grill them.

, When you’ve added the cheese mixture to the 6 of the patties, cover them with the remaining 6 beef patties. Press and pinch down along the edges to ensure that they are sealed, so you form a single burger with each pair of patties.Be sure to seal the two patties together all the way around. If there are any openings, the cheese may ooze out during grilling.

, When you’re ready to grill the burgers, press down on each to flatten it to a 4-inch (10-cm) patty. Use a basting brush to lightly cover each burger with canola oil to prevent it from sticking to the grill.Remember to brush both sides of the burgers with the oil.

, Place the burgers on the preheated grill. Allow them to cook on the first side for 3 minutes.While the total overall cooking time for the burgers depends on how done you want them, you should always cook them for 3 minutes on the first side regardless of whether you want them medium-rare or well-done., Once you’ve cooked the burgers for 3 minutes on the first side, use a spatula to turn them over on the grill. Let them cook for another 4 to 7 minutes depending on how done you want the burgers.For medium-rare burgers, cook the burgers for another 4 minutes.For medium burgers, cook the burgers for another 5 minutes.
For medium-well burgers, cook the burgers for another 6 minutes.
For well-done burgers, cook the burgers for another 7 minutes.

, Once the burgers are finished cooking, transfer them from the grill to a plate. Let the burgers sit for 3 to 5 minutes to ensure that they are juicy when it’s time to eat., When you’re ready to serve the burgers, place each one on a hamburger bun or roll. Add your favorite toppings, such as lettuce and tomato, and condiments, such as ketchup or barbecue sauce, and enjoy.You may want to toast the buns on the grill before putting the burgers on them.
Serve the burgers immediately after topping them for the best flavor and texture.

You should get about 20 to 23 small cheese balls. Place these on a baking sheet and freeze them for 30 minutes.You can use Mozzarella, Colby, or Monterey Jack Cheese.

, Peel one onion and grate it against the large-hole side of a box grater. Place the grated onion in a mixing bowl along with 3/4 pound (350 g) of lean ground beef and 2/3 cup (150 g) of ground lamb. Use a wooden spoon or your fingers to gently combine the onion and the meat.If you can't find ground lamb, you can easily substitute ground pork.

, Sprinkle the meatball mixture with ½ teaspoon of salt, ½ teaspoon of ground black pepper, and ¼ teaspoon of ground cumin. Stir the seasonings into the meat until they're incorporated. Place the mixture in the refrigerator and chill it for 30 minutes.Chilling the meat mixture will help the flavors develop.

, Remove the meat mixture from the fridge and use a few spoons or a small cookie scoop to portion out meatballs. You should get between 20 and 23 meatballs. Gently flatten each meatball between the palms of your hand and put a frozen cheese ball in the center. Spread the meat over the cheese and form a round ball. Set each stuffed meatball on the baking sheet.If the meat sticks to your hand, you can dip your hands in warm water. This will make it easier to handle the meat., Pour 2 tablespoons of olive oil into a large skillet and heat it over medium-high. Once the oil shimmers, add enough meatballs to cover the skillet in a single layer. Fry the meatballs for 10 minutes and use tongs to turn them every once in a while. The meatballs should be completely golden brown on the outside. Remove the meatballs to a serving plate and fry another batch of meatballs (if you couldn't fit all of them in at once).You can garnish the stuffed meatballs with 2 tablespoons of minced fresh parsley.
Consider serving the meatballs with a dipping sauce or glaze them with a little honey and pomegranate molasses.

Peel the tongue while warm.,
Cut the meat into 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) slices.,
Store leftovers in the fridge.",How to Cook Beef Tongue1," Larger tongues can take much longer to cook, so choose the smallest tongue you can find, ideally below 3 pounds / 1.4 kg. Tongue has a short shelf life, so purchase it very fresh or frozen from a reliable butcher. (If frozen, thaw in the refrigerator for maximum safety.)


Some tongues include the glands, bones, and fat at the root of the tongue. This area is edible when cooked, but not everyone likes the soft, fatty texture.You may cut it off at home (before or after cooking), or look for a pre-trimmed ""Swiss cut"" tongue.Brined tongue packs extra flavor and can be prepared the same way as fresh tongue.;
, Place the tongue in a clean sink and scrub thoroughly under cold running water. Clean until the surface is free of dirt and blood.


Many recipes recommend soaking the tongue in cold water for an hour or two, changing the water whenever it becomes murky. Store-bought tongue is usually clean enough to skip this step, but it can freshen up the tongue's flavor., Fill a large pot with chick or beef stock, or moderately salted water. Add vegetables and herbs of your choice. An onion or two, a couple bay leaves, peppercorns, and a carrot form a good simple base. Feel free to add other ingredients, such as oregano, rosemary, garlic, or chiles. Bring to a boil over high heat.


Use a pressure cooker or slow cooker to speed up the process.
If you want to create a thicker sauce to serve with the tongue, add four cans of condensed French onion soup.

, Add the tongue to the broth and cover the pot. Bring to a boil again, then reduce to a simmer.


Keep the tongue completely submerged. You may need to add more water or weigh it down with a steamer basket.

, The tongue is ready when it turns white and a knife easily pierces the thickest part. This typically takes about 50–60 minutes per pound (0.45 kg) of meat.Fast cooking or undercooking makes the tongue tough and unpleasant. If you've got the time, err on the side of caution and keep simmering for an extra hour or two.
If using a pressure cooker, heat until it starts to steam. Reduce to medium heat and cook for 10–15 minutes per pound (0.45 kg). Let cool until steam releases on its own.

, Transfer the tongue onto a plate with a pair of tongs. Wait until the tongue is just cool enough to touch, then cut through the outer white layer lengthwise with a sharp knife. Peel off this layer with your fingers, cutting when necessary. (This layer is technically edible, but has an unpleasant taste and texture.)


The tongue becomes much harder to peel once cooled. If it's already cooled to room temperature, though, it can help to submerge it in ice water.
Save the broth to make a soup or flavor sauces.

, Cut diagonal slices with a sharp knife to serve with salsa verde, on a sandwich with brown mustard and greens, or baked for another half hour with roast potatoes. There's plenty of meat there, so consider saving some larger pieces to grill or try with the other recipes below.


If the meat is tough, it's undercooked. Return it to the broth and keep simmering.
You can easily turn a portion of the sauce into gravy by adding flour.

, Boiled tongue will keep for about five days in an airtight container in the fridge."

",How to Cook Chorizo," Place it on the stove top and click the heat to medium-high.;
, It is best to do this quickly, before the skillet becomes too hot.


Alternatively, you could also wait until after you add the chorizo to the skillet before turning on the heat.
Adding the chorizo after the skillet becomes too hot will increase the likelihood of one side burning.

, The links should start to brown.


Turn frequently, using tongs, as you fry the chorizo links to prevent one side from burning. Both sides of each link should be equally browned.

, Turn the heat down to medium-low and add 1/2 cup (125 ml) of water.


Add the water carefully to prevent it from splashing. Keep your face and any bare skin along your arms away from the top of the skillet, since the hot steam that will rise after you add the water could cause minor burns.

, Cover the skillet and simmer for 12 minutes.


When finished, the chorizo will be brown all the way through.






Check the internal temperature by sticking an instant-read meat thermometer into the center of the thickest link. When done, the temperature should be at least 160 degrees Fahrenheit (71 degrees Celsius).







, A grill can be covered with nonstick cooking spray or nonstick aluminum foil.


Nonstick aluminum foil creates the least amount of mess, but the grill marks will not be as dark. If you do use foil, poke a series of holes into the foil using a fork to allow heat to vent through.
Nonstick cooking spray is another alternative that works well at preventing the links from sticking to the grate too severely.

, Regardless of whether you use charcoal or gas, the grill needs to be at a relatively low heat.


Preheat a gas grill to medium-low.
If using a charcoal grill, create a low pile of charcoal and distribute it evenly around the bottom of the grill. After lighting the grill, allow the flame to burn down until white ash begins to form over the coals.
Do not use a high heat. Using a high heat will singe the chorizo, causing it to burn on the outside while it is still cold and undercooked inside.

, Close the lid and grill the links for 15 to 20 minutes, or until browned and cooked through.


Frequently turn the chorizo links using tongs. This ensures even cooking.






Closing the lid prevents the majority of ""flare-ups."" The fire can flare up when exposed to too much oxygen.






When done, the chorizo should have an internal temperature of 160 degrees Fahrenheit (71 degrees Celsius). Check this by sticking an instant-read meat thermometer into the center of one of the links.







, Give the broiler 5 to 10 minutes to reach its ideal temperature.


Most broilers only have one setting, but some have a ""high"" setting and a ""low"" setting. If your broiler has two settings, use ""high.""

, Space them apart evenly to ensure even cooking.


Coating broiler pan with nonstick spray is unnecessary, and you should not cover it with aluminum foil. A broiler pan has a rack inside that is designed to hold the meat above the bottom of the pan, preventing it from sitting inside its drippings as it heats. As such, you should not cover the rack in anything that will prevent the oil from dripping away.
If you do not have a broiler pan, you can use a baking pan lined with aluminum foil, but this is far from ideal. If you do this, carefully monitor the chorizo as it boils to make sure that you do not see too much steam or other signs that the fat in the chorizo has become too hot.

, Position the pan so that it is 7 to 9 inches (18 to 23 cm) below the top heating element of the oven.


The broiler in an oven only uses the top heating element. The bottom heat source is not used.

, The chorizo should be well browned and the internal temperature should be at least 160 degrees Fahrenheit (71 degrees Celsius).


Turn the links every 4 minutes using tongs to ensure even cooking and even browning.






Check the internal temperature by sticking an instant-read meat thermometer into the center of the thickest chorizo link.







,


Paella is a traditional Spanish dish consisting of rice and a variety of other small, finely chopped ingredients. These ingredients can range from green vegetables and beans to snails. The spiciness of chorizo works well in accompaniment with the other spices found in paella, especially for non-traditional mixed paella.

, Stir-fry chorizo, chopping it coarsely as you cook it, before adding it to scrambled eggs, frittatas, and omelets.


Chopped tomato, chopped bell peppers, and Serrano ham complement the taste of chorizo and eggs, as well.

, Chorizo that has been stir-fried and coarsely chopped can give a kick to many lentil-based soups, bean dishes, and cooked peas. It also works well as a substitution in casserole or pizza recipes that call for sausage.

, As a pork-product, chorizo is complemented by the taste of apples.


Slice t he chorizo and fry it in oil until it crisps up. Add a small amount of apple cider to the pan and simmer the contents until the cider thickens and becomes the consistency of syrup., Cut the links into thirds or halves and simmer in red wine for several minutes.


Serve chorizo braised in red wine with red grapes.

Carve and serve the roast.",How to Cook a Whole Pig," Find an out of the way place where you can fashion a bed of coals that will serve as the roasting pit. A flat, open space will work best. For best results, dig a shallow ditch and fill or ring it with gravel or flat stones of a uniform size, allowing space in the center for the wood you'll be burning to produce the coals. You also have the option of simply lining a flat patch of ground with stones and then burning off the wood.If you don’t have a lot of space to work with, or have no desire to start a fire directly in your backyard, consider using a metal clamshell grill to burn the wood.Setting up a roasting pit on flat ground may damage any vegetation growing underneath the area where you lay out the stones.;
, Whether you’re assembling a store-bought roasting spit or cobbling together your own, you need to have a way to hold the pig over the heat once it’s time to get cooking. Situate these support materials on either side of the pit lengthwise. Some people have success simply using ‘Y’-shaped sticks which hold the spit in their crooks. Others prefer to construct more elaborate setups using spare lumber or well-spaced cinderblocks. As long as the supports you build will hold the weight of pig and spit, they’ll work just fine.When using wooden supports, make sure to drive them into the ground partially so that they’ll be firmly rooted.
Whatever you decide to use as your supports, they should be tall enough to hold the spit 1-2 feet (.30-.60m) over the pit.

, Traditionally, slow roasting of this type is done using wood coals. Gather the wood you’ll be using to start the fire. Most people prefer to use basic types of wood that burn clean, like hardwood, or varieties like applewood that add flavor to the meat with their smoke. Arrange the firewood on top of the stones in the pit in tight clusters. Get a fire going and wait for it to consume the wood and die down until only glowing coals remain. Wood coals burn at very high temperatures for a long duration. Their constant heat will roast the pig to perfection.You will likely require 5 or more bundles of wood to have enough to spread out over the surface of the pit.
You can supplement the wood coals with bagged charcoal if you choose. This will keep the pit burning longer and make the heat more consistent. However, charcoal doesn't burn as clean as wood coals, and may influence the flavor of the meat.
Roasting a whole pig is an all day event. Cooking an average size pig of 75-100 pounds (34-45kg) will take the better part of twelve hours.

, Most experienced culinary veterans recommend around 250 degrees Fahrenheit (121 degrees Celsius) as the optimum temperature for a slow-roast. The pit needs to be kept hot enough for the heat of the coals to penetrate into the meat of the pig, but not so hot that it cooks unevenly or too fast. The coals will need to be raked and repositioned as the pig roasts to keep cooking temperatures even, and more wood may need to be added when the pit begins to lose heat.Test the temperature of the pit by holding up a culinary thermometer at about the point where the pig will be suspended.
Cooking temperatures do not have to be exact, as how quickly and evenly a pig will get done depends largely on its size, thickness and positioning. Aim for 225-250°F (107-121°C) as a rough guideline. Any cooler than that will take much longer., Buy your pig from a farm supplier or butcher. If possible, have the butcher ""dress"" the pig and remove the organs and troublesome accessory tissues before taking it home. The pig’s internal cavity should be totally empty to better conduct heat, or to allow you to stuff it should you so desire. You may be able to save a few bucks dressing it yourself, but it will add greatly to your workload.Pigs come in different weights and sizes. Obviously, the larger the pig, the longer it will take to cook. If you don’t have all day to spend slow roasting, or aren’t feeding as many people, think about buying a small suckling pig.
Ask your butcher about the means to transport the pig home. They will often be able to supply zip-up bags that will keep juices from getting all over your car and prevent the meat from being exposed to the open air.
If you’ve bought a whole frozen pig, it will need to be thawed before it can be cooked. To thaw a frozen pig carcass, submerge it in a light ice bath and allow it to warm gradually as the ice melts. This can take several days if the pig is large enough., Pig carcasses are often covered in dirt, feces and bacteria, so it will be necessary to clean the pig before cooking it. Wipe down the pig’s extremities and any incisions or openings made by the butcher with a cold, wet towel. If you’re working outside, spraying the pig off with a hose can cut down on your prep time. Sprinkle the carcass liberally with coarse salt and massage it into the skin. Do the same for the inner cavity.The pig will need a good wiping down even if it has already been cleaned by the butcher shop where you bought it.
Salt not only works as a seasoning but has antimicrobial properties which can kill lingering germs.

, At this point, you can season the pig further, if you wish. Additional spices such as black pepper, cayenne, turmeric, paprika or seasoned salt can be rubbed into the skin, or you might inject a strong marinade or brine underneath the skin using a meat injector. This will impart extra flavor to the pig as it cooks. Don’t forget to zest up the pig’s inner cavity as well, if it’s accessible by hand.Try working a specially blended dry rub into the skin prior to cooking.
Injecting brines and marinades into the meat will add moisture to keep it from burning and make it especially tasty once it’s done., To successfully roast the pig over open heat, it will need to be affixed to a spit—a long, straight pole that runs through a piece of meat being cooked whole. Spits are large, pricey and somewhat unwieldy, and aren’t the kind of thing most people have lying around in their homes, but they can sometimes be rented from farms or traditional barbecue suppliers. You can also purchase a sturdy metal rotisserie to get the job done, or fashion your own out of stripped and whittled wood if you’re feeling crafty. Guide the spit carefully through the anus or rear opening of the pig and out through the mouth. This may be a 2-3 man job.The spit should be long enough to lay atop the supports at either end of the fire and strong enough to support a pig up to or over 100 pounds (45kg).
Tie the pig’s legs and midsection to the spit using wire or twine to keep it from sagging and flopping around as it hangs over the coals., Once the pig has been secured to the spit, lift and place it on the supports to rest it over the pit. The pig should be centered and suspended roughly 1-2 feet (.30-.60m) above the coals. Any closer and the heat may cause the skin to scorch. Make sure the spit doesn’t slide or move around after it’s been mounted.Make sure you have help getting the pig positioned over the coals. They can be heavy!

, Let the pig cook at a moderate distance from the coals. One helpful guideline to keep in mind is that the pig should cook one hour for every ten pounds of its weight; for a pig of average size, 75-100 pounds (34-45kg), this means 4-6 hours on each side. Sit back and enjoy a cold beverage in the meantime! At the halfway point, turn the pig over to begin cooking the opposite side. Remember to keep the pit hot by adding more wood provisionally, and rake and reposition the coals if any one part of the pig is cooking faster than another.”Slow and low” is what experts recommend when roasting a whole pig. It’s time consuming and demands constant attention, but makes a great centerpiece for a day of cooking and socializing.
Brush on a coating of barbecue sauce, or use a turkey baster to drench the pig in a savory marinade as it cooks. This will ratchet up the flavor and keep the skin crisp and juicy.

, When the pig is nearing completion, its skin will begin to brown and bubble, but there’s no way to tell if the meat inside is done except to temp it. Use a professional-grade meat thermometer to take an internal temperature reading in different areas of the pig. The soft belly and bacon sections (the fatty tissue on the backside) are best served at around 145°F (63°C), while tougher, more sinewy parts like the shoulder and haunches will need to be at least 160-165°F (74°C) before they’re safe to eat.You will need to take a temperature reading several times throughout the cooking process. Do not serve the pig if any part of the meat is below 145°F (63°C).
If an area is particularly slow getting done, reposition the coals underneath that area to increase the heat.

, After 10-12 hours the pig is now a crispy brown and the internal temperature is right—it’s time to eat! Take the pig off the coals, remove the spit and tell everybody to dig in. You can either carve the roast up into sections, dice it all together like pulled-pork barbecue or have everyone tear off their favorite sections by hand. When cooked right, the meat should be tender enough to pull apart. Slather the roast pork in your favorite sauce, serve it with a few sumptuous sides and enjoy!The meat should be juicy when fully cooked, but not bloody or red. If it isn’t quite done enough when you cut into it, it may need a few more minutes.
Pair a roasted pig with other backyard cookout favorites like grilled veggies and baked beans, or go for the more island-inspired flavors of wild rice, fried plantains and pineapple.

Serve in corn tortillas.",How to Cook Beef Tongue2," Tongue needs a long, slow cooking process to become tender. Refer to the simmered recipe above for instructions on cleaning, then simmer in hot, salted water for at least 1 hour per pound of meat (0.45 kg).


For extra flavor, add onions, carrots, garlic, bay leaves, and/or your favorite chiles.
Check on it every hour or so. You may need to add water to keep the tongue submerged.

, You'll have plenty of time to make your own salsa while the beef is cooking. Just combine tomatillos with serrano peppers, diced onion, garlic, cilantro, lime, salt. Blend until combined but slightly thick. (For amounts and extra details, see linked recipe.)

, Once a knife can pierce through the thickest part of the tongue, remove it from the water with kitchen tongs. Once cool enough to handle — but still quite warm — cut through the white outer layer and peel off with your fingers. Slice into rough ½ inch (1.25 cm) slices for your tacos.

, Tongue is a fatty meat, and tastes delicious when it develops a crisp outer layer. Add a generous amount of oil or lard to a pan, about 3 tbsp (45 mL) for six slices, and heat until it shimmers. Add the tongue and fry until brown and crisp on all sides, flipping occasionally.If you're using a grill instead, brush the slices generously with olive oil and heat on a 425ºF (220ºC) grill for about 10–15 minutes, flipping once.
For a healthier options, just brown lightly in a small amount of oil, then simmer in the salsa verde for a few minutes., Set up platters of beef tongue, corn tortillas, and salsa verde for your guests to make their own tacos. You can also add all your favorite taco toppings, such as lime and cilantro.

A small ham can instead be submerged in cold water and thawed in two or three hours, replacing the water with fresh, cold water every half hour.


You can cook the ham without thawing, but it will take approximately 1.5 times as long to cook as a thawed ham.;
, Check the label on your ham. Most store-bought spiral-cut hams are ""ready to eat,"" but you may still want to follow the cooking instructions below to warm it up. If the ham is ""ready to cook,"" you must cook it before it is safe to eat., Remove all packaging from the ham and wrap it in foil to seal in moisture during cooking. Line a baking sheet with foil as well.


If you really hate dry ham, place a second baking sheet on a lower rack of the oven and fill it with water., Set the wrapped ham cut-side down on the baking sheet. Preheat the oven and time the cooking process depending on the state it was in when you began, checking once every 20–30 minutes for the beginning of overdone, dry edges:



Ready to eat hams just need to be warmed up. To keep it moist, heat in a 250ºF (120ºC), for approximately 20 minutes per pound (0.45 kg).To speed up the process at the cost of some moisture, heat at 350ºF (175ºC) instead for 10 minutes per pound (0.45 kg).Test with a meat thermometer if you have one, until internal temperature reaches about 120ºF (50ºC).

Ready to cook hams are only partially cooked, and should reach an internal temperature of at least 145ºF (60ºC), then removed from the oven and left alone for three minutes while cooking completes. This typically takes 20 minutes per pound (0.45 kg) in a 325ºF (160ºC) oven.Fresh (raw) ham is rarely sold as a spiral cut, but if you have the exception, cook for approximately 25 minutes per pound (0.45 kg) in a 325ºF (160ºC) oven, until the internal temperature is at least 145ºF (60ºC).Let sit for a few minutes while cooking completes, before carving.

, This is best done 30 minutes before the ham is finished cooking, or once a fresh or ""ready to cook"" ham has reached an internal temperature of 145ºF (60ºC). Score the ham with a diagonal pattern using a knife and brush on the glaze of your choice, then return the ham to the oven for another 30 minutes.


Most store-bought spiral-cut hams come with their own glaze power, which can be mixed with water to form the glaze.
To make your own simple glaze, mix equal parts brown sugar and mustard. Use honey mustard for a sweeter glaze, or Dijon mustard for a more acidic flavor.

, Place your ham cut-side up on your cutting board and examine the pink, cut surface. The ham should have three visible ""seams"" of connective tissue between the pink muscle. These are either white or reddish pink. Cut along one of these seams from the outer edge all the way to the center.For best results, use a flexible meat carving knife with hollow ovals or scallops cut next to the blade edge.
Some boneless hams contain significant amounts of ground meat reshaped into a ham, and may not have visible seams. In this case, carve through to the center from any point on the edge, then repeat with two more slices to divide it into three pieces.

, If a bone is present, cut in a close circle around it until you reach the second muscle seam. Cut outward along this seam to release the first stack of slices., The final seam will divide the remaining ham into two stacks of slices. Cut all the way around the bone in a tight circle to release them. Arrange slices on a serving platter or transfer directly to guests' plates.


If the ham is large, cut the stack of slices in half before serving.

Look for tough, lean cuts.,
Look for meat labeled ""chuck"" or ""roast."",
Do not rely on packages labelled ""stew meat.""",How to Choose a Cut of Meat for Stews1," In a stew, you’re going for tender bites of meat amidst a medley of earthy vegetables. In order to soften everything up, of course, stew requires a substantial cooking time. This means that you actually want to avoid the fancy cuts that are considered the best for steaks, because they will turn tough and chewy when cooked in a stew.It’s not the fat you’re looking for in a tough cut, it’s the collagen. This is the connective tissue within the flesh itself that will break down over a long cooking period, leaving the meat tender and juicy.
In general, flesh from the front shoulder or rear end of an animal will be the toughest and leanest.;
, If you’re getting meat from a butcher or a meat counter at the supermarket, they’ll be able to point you towards the cuts from the shoulder and rear end. Even within these areas of an animal’s body, however, there are all sorts of specific cuts of meat.All of the following cuts will work great in a stew: Chuck, Chuck Shoulder, Chuck Roast, Chuck-Eye Roast, Top Chuck, Bottom Round Roast, Bottom Eye Roast, Rump Roast, Eye Round Roast, Top Round, Round Tip Roast, English Roast, and Pot Roast.

, Sometimes pre-packaged meat labelled in such a way are perfect for making stew. However, in many cases it is instead an assemblage of the odds and ends from different cuts of meat. The reasoning here is that those pieces of meat from different parts of the animal will cook at different rates.With pre-cut “stew meat” that feature different cuts of meat, you'll end up with some tender pieces of meat in your finished stew, but others that are tough and chewy.
Further, fat content will differ between pieces of meat, making it hard to tell how lean your meal will be.
If stew meat is the best option, choose the package that seems to have pieces that are generally the same size, and which contain visible white striping within the flesh.

,, Add 1 tbsp. (14.8ml) of canola or olive oil to the pan.

, Turn the roast on each of its sides when they reach a caramel color.


Browning a roast helps it to seal in the juices during the cooking process. It is recommended whether you use an oven or a slow cooker.

, There are several ways to achieve a delicious result from a pork roast recipe, so choose what is preferable for your meal.


Cook the pork roast in the oven on 325 degrees Fahrenheit (163 degrees Celsius). Cooking time will be 35 minutes per lb. (0.45kg) of meat. A pork roast with the bone in will cook faster than a boneless roast. It will result in a crispier surface texture with less moisture. This is an ideal method if you want to make gravy.
Cook the pork roast in a slow cooker, for the most tender roast. Place the brown roast in the slow cooker for approximately 6 hours on low. If your roast is extremely large, you may want to cut it into a few pieces. Always reduce the amount of liquid you add to the slow cooker, unless the recipe is intended for crock pot use.
Cook the pork roast in a Dutch oven on your stove top. You will want to bring all the ingredients, including the added liquid, to a boil. Then, turn down the temperature and cook covered on low for 2.5 to 3 hours.

, This pork roast recipe, and most other recipes, can be adapted according to the way you want to cook the roast.

, Add the onions and the apples to the roasting pan, Dutch oven or slow cooker.

, You can also use chicken broth.

,


If you are using a slow cooker, use 1/2 cup (118ml) of beef broth, and 1/2 cup (118ml) of apple juice. The moisture stays in the crock pot while it cooks, and too much moisture can make the roast soupy.

, (2.1g) of chopped sage, thyme or rosemary.


If you are using a slow cooker, use half of the spices that are called for in the recipe. The long cooking time increases the intensity of the flavor.

, This will allow the fat to drip down and flavor the meat.

, Some experts now say that pork must reach over 145 degrees Fahrenheit to be safe.

,, Cover it with aluminum foil so that it doesn't lose too much heat.

,, Pour it into a frying pan and simmer it on high heat until it is reduced by half. Pour it over the slices of roast pork.

Choose a type of ham.,
Figure out what quantity you need.,
Thaw frozen ham slowly.,
Consider soaking salty cured ham.,
Bring your ham to room temperature before cooking.,
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.,
Place the ham in a large baking dish.,
Score the ham if you plan to glaze it.,
Cook for the right number of minutes per pound.,
Make the glaze.,
Glaze the ham when the internal temperature reaches 135 degrees.,
Let it rest for 15 minutes after cooking.,
Carve the ham.,
Store the leftover ham.",How to Cook a Ham," You can buy fresh, uncooked ham, ham that has been preserved by curing it, and ham that has been preserved with smoke. Some ham is packed in juices, and some is packed dry. Each type is available bone-in or boneless, and you can buy it pre-sliced to make it easier to serve. If you're not sure what type of ham to buy, consider these popular choices, each of which has a different flavor:


Fresh or frozen uncured ham. This type of ham has never been cooked or cured. It has the light meaty flavor of fresh pork, similar to a pork roast or chop.
Cured ham. Ham can be preserved by curing it with salt. Virginia ham, for example, is cured with a thick crust of salt. Salt is a distinguishing flavor in cured ham.
Cured and smoked. Smoke is used to preserve this type of ham, lending it a very distinctive smoky flavor.;
, The cooking time will depend on how much meat you're cooking. Since hams take awhile to cook and make excellent leftovers, you might want to figure in a little more than you strictly need for one serving per person. Here's the breakdown for how much ham you need depending on what type you buy:For boneless, you need ¼ to ⅓ pound per serving.
For ham with a small bone, you need ⅓ to ½ pound per serving.
For ham with a large bone, you need ¾ to 1 pound per serving.

, If you bought a frozen ham, it's important to thaw it the right way so it's not still frozen in the middle when you try to cook it. If this happens, the ham won't reach the correct internal temperature and may not be safe to eat. There are two ways to safely thaw a ham:


Refrigerator method: Place the frozen ham in the refrigerator the day before you plan to cook it. It will slowly thaw while remaining cold. Allow at least 24 hours for the ham to fully thaw.
Cold water method: If you're shorter on time, you can submerge the ham in a large pot of cold water. Let the ham soak in the water for several hours, until it has fully thawed. Keep the water cold so the outer parts of the ham don't get too warm while the inside thaws.

, Dry-cured ham is rubbed with salt to preserve it. Soaking for a few hours before cooking will take the edge off the salty taste and make it more palatable. To soak a ham, submerge it in water and place it in the refrigerator. Allow it to soak for four to eight hours, depending on how much salt you want it to retain.

, This ensures the entire ham will heat to the proper temperature. Remove the ham from the refrigerator two hours before cooking to bring it to room temperature.

, Whether you have cured or uncured ham, it needs to be cooked to an internal temperature of 160 °F (71 °C). Cooking it at 325 °F (163 °C) over the course of a few hours will ensure that the ham doesn't get dry on the outside while the inside cooks.


If the ham was vacuum packed or canned, it was already fully cooked. That means you can eat it straight from the package or heat it to just 140 °F (60 °C) before eating.

, Use a glass, ceramic or foil dish that's big enough to hold the ham and deep enough to hold the drippings.

, Score through the skin and fat, but not the meat.You can make a cross-hatched pattern for a pretty final effect. The scoring allows the glaze to seep deeper into the ham to flavor it down to the middle.


If you have a pre-sliced ham, skip this step.
If you want to season the ham with whole cloves, press a clove into each intersection made by the score marks.

, You'll need to cook the ham until it reaches an internal temperature of 165 °F (74 °C). The amount of time you cook the ham depends on how much meat you're cooking and what type of ham you have. Check the temperature using a meat thermometer to make sure you don't over or undercook the ham. Here are the approximate cooking times:



For fresh ham: 22 to 28 minutes per pound.

For smoked ham: 15 to 20 minutes per pound.

For cured (country) ham: 20 to 25 minutes per pound.

, You can make the glaze while the ham is cooking. Use whatever glaze recipe you like, whether it's spicy or sweet. Bring the glaze ingredients to a simmer on the stove, then reduce the mixture until it’s pourable but thick. To make a classic sweet honey glaze, use these ingredients:


2 tablespoons mustard
1 cup firmly-packed brown sugar
1/2 cup honey
1/2 cup cider vinegar
1/2 cup butter
1 cup water

, This should happen within the last half our or so of cooking. Check the temperature with your meat thermometer, then carefully remove the ham from the oven to glaze it.


Use a pastry brush to baste the ham, and try to work it into the grooves you scored.
Return the ham to the oven and continue cooking until the internal temperature reaches 165 °F (74 °C).
If you'd like, you can finish the ham under the broiler for the last 10 minutes.This creates a crunchy crust over the meat.

, Remove the ham from the oven and set it on the counter to rest. Tent aluminum foil over the pan to trap the moisture inside. The ham's drippings will reabsorb into the meat while it rests, resulting in juicy, delectable ham. Skipping this step will result in dry ham.

, Use a very sharp carving knife to carve the ham after it's finished resting. Using a blunt knife is dangerous, since it could easily slip off the meat. Sharpen your knife using a whetstone or knife sharpener, then carve the meat as follows:


Trim off a few slices off the narrower end of the ham.
Set the ham on the flat part where you cut off the slices. This will create a stable base.
Make horizontal cuts across the side of the ham, from the outside to the bone.
Slice vertically along the bone so the slices drop to the cutting board.
Repeat with the other side of the ham.
Don't throw the ham bone away! It makes a delicious soup base.

, After serving up your feast, save the rest of the ham for later. It will keep in the refrigerator for up to a week. You can also place ham slices in a freezer safe container and freeze the ham for up to a month. Use the leftover ham to make delicious sandwiches and one of these classic dishes:

",How to Cook a Pork Loin," Although there are general guidelines for the time you should cook a pork loin, the best way to avoid food poisoning through undercooked meat is to buy a meat thermometer.









Your pork loin should reach a temperature of at least 145 °F (63 °C) in the center before you stop cooking it. Some people prefer to cook meat to 160 °F (71 °C), which used to be the recommended temperature to kill organisms, but has recently been amended.;
, Place it in the refrigerator overnight. Use the tenderloin within 1 to 2 days of thawing.








, If you see a large chunk of fat and you would like a leaner meal, cut it off with a boning knife or chef's knife.








, It should be packaged with a weight written on it by the supermarket. Knowing the weight will help you cook it for the right amount of time.








, Some people prefer using these simple seasonings to bring out the natural flavor of this excellent cut of meat.








,









You can marinate the pork for 1 to 8 hours. Find a marinade that you like. Pork marinades often include sweet ingredients like brown sugar and apple juice or hot spices.
Rub the pork with additional herbs and spices to create a dry rub. You can use an Italian seasoning, rosemary, garlic powder, thyme or store-bought seasoning mixes.
For a more complicated recipe, consider stuffing the pork tenderloin. Butterfly it to create an opening for the stuffing. Mix a breadcrumb, rice, cheese or other stuffing. Spread between the 2 pieces and secure them with string. Bake in the oven.

Preheat your oven to 425 °F (218 °C) to roast the loin. Place it in the skillet in which it was browned or on a roasting pan. Place the loin in the oven for 20 to 40 minutes. A smaller loin will take 15 to 20 minutes to cook, while a larger loin will take longer. Use a meat thermometer to determine whether it is done.
Preheat your grill over medium high heat to grill the loin. Turn off 1 side of the grill after it is preheated. Place your tenderloin on the side of the grill that is turned off. The loin should be grilled with indirect heat. Turn it every 5 minutes. Cook for 20 to 40 minutes. Insert a meat thermometer to test doneness.

,, Cover it with aluminum foil.








, This will allow the juices to settle and the tenderloin to stay moist.








, Serve it with salads, grains or vegetables.

Default to beef chuck roast.,
Cut the meat into same-size pieces yourself.,
Try lamb stew.,
Make pork stew with cuts from the shoulder.,
Experiment with meat from other grazing animals.,
Get a whole chicken for an especially lean stew.",How to Choose a Cut of Meat for Stews2," Beef is the classic type of meat for stew. Chuck roast, which comes from the shoulder of the animal, is arguably the best cut for this type of dish.Since the shoulder is constantly used when the animal is alive, the muscles that make up this cut of meat are initially very tough. After stewing, however, pieces of chuck roast will be especially succulent and flavorful.

, You want to cut your meat into individual pieces yourself for two reasons. First, it will be easier to trim away the gristle from a larger cut of meat, as opposed to small pieces. Further, by doing it yourself, you can ensure that the size of the individual pieces are uniform.As a rule of thumb, shoot for cubes of meat that are a bit larger than 1x1in (2.5x2.5cm).

, Lamb meat will be sweeter than beef, and will pair well with especially savory herbs and vegetables. Lamb also pairs particularly well with red wine. Almost any cut of lamb will work in a stew, but shoulder is the best.Buy a piece of shoulder with the bone removed and cut it into evenly-sized pieces yourself.
For a slightly cheaper but comparable option, look for arm shoulder chop or cut of meat from the neck.

, Pork can be used in stew as well, and has a relatively mild flavor compared to other red meats. The best cuts include those around the shoulder, commonly referred to as the ""butt.""This area of a hog is referenced by many slang terms, but anything that includes the terms ""Boston,"" ""butt,"" or ""shoulder"" will work.

, There are all sorts of other meats that can be used in a delicious stew. For instance, venison and bison are both especially enjoyable, not to mention lean. Fortunately, the rules for selecting a cut of beef are the same for these animals as well. Go for cuts from the shoulder, neck, or rear end.

, If you’re making a chicken stew, the rules are somewhat different. In particular, you’ll want to get a whole chicken instead of processed cuts of breast of leg meat. This way, the different parts of the chicken will provide a wider range of flavor.Watch a video online to learn how to cut up a chicken's body for stew. There are a few tricks, such as how to hold the body, that will make cutting the chicken easier.

Choose lean meats for better nutrition.,
Balance small portions of meat with plenty of veggies.,
Get organic meat whenever possible.",How to Choose a Cut of Meat for Stews3," The leaner the cut, or less fat it contains, the healthier it will be. Generally, cuts labeled “select” will be the leanest. These cuts will also contain either “round” or “loin” in the name. “Top round” cuts of meat are not only ideal for stews, they are also especially lean.Keep in mind that while you do want tough cuts of meat for stew, this does not mean fatty cuts. In fact, the fattiest and most “marbled” cuts, which are also the most expensive, do not cook well in a stew anyway.

, Meat contains some healthy nutrients, such as iron, zinc, and vitamin B12, as well as protein. However, centering meals around meat, especially red meat, is unhealthy. This is because red meat is particularly high in saturated fat. Diets centered on meat are also linked to higher incidences of cancer.In order to keep your stew relatively healthy, make sure vegetables and beans are prominently featured.
As a rule of thumb, use enough meat so that each meal-sized portion contains 3 or 4 ounces of meat. Visually, this amount would be equal in size to a deck of playing cards.
Vegetables offer variety in flavor and consistency as well. For instance, potatoes, carrots, tomatoes, and onions go great in most stews.

, A ""certified organic"" label is given to meat that is derived from animals that were not treated with antibiotics, hormones, pesticides, or biotechnology. Organically raised cattle were also allowed to graze in a pasture for at least a third of every year.Keep in mind that the healthiest meat comes from the healthiest animals. Unfortunately, much of the meat available for human consumption comes from farms where issues such as overcrowding, extensive antibiotic use, and forced feeding are common.
While organic meat is nutritionally comparable to meat from animals treated with chemicals, other methods of cattle raising are objectively unsustainable, and increasingly contribute to the risk of antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria.
Note that “grass-fed” animals, unless certified organic, may have been given antibiotics and hormones. The grass fed label means that they were allowed to graze naturally for part of the their lives and were not force-fed grain.

",How to Cook a Bone in Ham," Generally bone-in roasts weigh 10 lbs. (4.5 kg) or more. They can feed a large family on a special occasion.;
, Most spiral hams or honey-baked hams are pre-cooked, meaning you simply have to warm it up in the oven for 10 minutes per lb. (0.45 kg).


You may be able to pick between a half-ham roast and a full-ham roast. Cooking times will vary, but preparation is very similar.
Cook a 1/2 lb. (0.22 kg) of ham for each person you plan to serve. Increase the amount to ensure leftovers.

, Most hams in supermarkets are boneless. You may need to inquire with a local butcher or pig seller in the area, if you can’t find an uncooked, bone-in ham at the supermarket.

, You can remove the skin yourself at home.

, If your ham is fresh, it should have a cook-by date that is within a week. A frozen ham may be prepared within a few months.

, It will take between 2 and 4 days to defrost completely before you can cook it.

, Unwrap it completely. Discard any juices.

, You can cut horizontally, parallel to the meat. Leave some fat on the ham’s surface for flavor.

, Some hams come with a glaze that you can mix with water.

, Your diamonds should be 1/4 inch (0.6 cm) deep, cutting through the fat and slightly into the top of the flesh. Scoring will let the glaze seep in and render the fat from the top.


You can use a clean piece of cardboard to guide the knife along the top like a ruler. , If you like a traditional flavor and look, stud each of the diamonds with cloves. ,, A 20 lb. (9 kg) ham can take 7 hours to cook, while a 10 lb. (4.5 kg) ham takes between 3 and 4 hours. Cook 10 to 14 lb. (4.5 to 6.4 kg) hams for 22 to 25 minutes per lb. (0.45 kg).
Cook a larger ham for 18 to 22 minutes per lb.
Always check the core temperature with a meat thermometer.

, Choose a shallow rack with a sturdy pan to catch drippings.

, Test the ham halfway through the cooking time. When a meat thermometer reaches 130 degrees Fahrenheit (54 degrees Celsius) in the center, you can start to baste or glaze the roast ham.

, Brush your glaze mix onto the surface of the ham. If you are basting the ham with its own juices, use a baster.


Cover the surface of the ham with pineapple slices for extra flavor.

, Baste or glaze the ham every half an hour. Cover it with aluminum foil if the surface appears too brown or dry.

, Place it on a carving board to rest for 15 minutes and cover it with aluminum foil. , Cut inward until it reaches the bone.

, Remove the knife.

, Cut a 1-inch (2.5 cm) slice of ham from skin surface to the bone. Repeat until the top section of the roast fans out into slices.

, Then, cut away the sides of the ham along the fat lines on each side.

, Carve the slices from top to bone, just as you did on the first side.

Allow to cook through and serve!",How to Cook New York Strip Steak1," The secret to getting a great pan-seared steak is having a hot pan and by only cooking as long as is necessary. The best strip steaks have a crisp, seared exterior that can only be achieved with a piping hot pan, so your first step is to set your pan on your stove and turn the burner to high heat. While you're waiting for your pan to heat up, you can remove your steaks from their packaging and start seasoning them.


Here's an easy test to see if your pan is hot enough — wet your fingers in the sink and flick the water onto the pan. If the droplets immediately sizzle and evaporate or ""dance"" across the surface of the pan, it's ready!;
, As your pan starts to warm, set your steaks on a clean cutting board or platter. Season each side with salt and pepper. The precise amount you use is up to you — some guides, for instance, recommend using a mixture of about 1/4 teaspoons pepper and 1 & 1/2 teaspoons salt for every two steaks.A good rule is to err on the side of using too little salt (after all, you can always add more when the steak is done).


At this point, you can also add any additional dry seasonings you want. Pre-packaged mixes like Johnny's, etc. are a good choice, as are your own concoctions (for instance, rosemary, thyme, and minced garlic is one common combination).
After seasoning your steaks, coat each with oil. This is important for getting a crispy sear — the oil essentially ""fries"" the outer layer of the steak.

, Using a pair of tongs, lay your steaks onto the hot pan. To avoid getting hit by hot juices, lay the steaks away from you, rather than towards you. They should immediately begin to sizzle and crackle — this is a good thing! Move the steaks an inch or so from their original location a few seconds after you add them to the pan to prevent them from sticking, then simply let them cook.


Some cooking guides recommend letting your steaks warm to room temperature before adding them to a hot pan under the assumption that this helps them cook more evenly. Although letting your steaks warm for 20 to 30 minutes almost certainly won't hurt them, there is some evidence to suggest this claim is just a myth., The trick to getting an excellent steak from your pan is to only cook each side as long as necessary — cooking too long can make the meat tough. Let your steaks cook in the pan until they develop a dark brown crust on their bottom side flecked with black, charred portions. Depending on the heat of your pan, this usually takes about three to four minutes, though longer or shorter is possible, so keep an eye on your steaks.


For a well-done steak, you may want to cook a little longer — up to or beyond five minutes. Conversely, for a rare steak, you'll want to flip the steaks a little earlier — as early as two to two and a half minutes.
The debate about whether to only flip a steak once or whether to flip numerous times is an old one. Conventional wisdom dictates that steaks should only be flipped once to give them the best possible crust. However, many modern steak aficionados disagree, instead recommending frequent flipping., Once you've flipped your steaks over, there's not much left for you to do other than watch it cook (unless you're of the belief that constantly turning the meat makes it taste better). Wait until your steaks have developed a dark crust on the bottom similar to the one on top, then check for signs of done-ness. If your steaks aren't quite done, consider finishing them off in the oven or giving them a few extra minutes in the pan. Below are common signs of a done steak:


A firm texture at the edges that becomes softer towards the center of the meat
No red remaining in the center (pinkish to light brown is OK)
An internal temperature of about 120o to 150o F (49o to 65o C)."

Refrigerate for at least eight hours.",How to Cook Lamb Steaks1," Many butchers don't sell pre-cut lamb steaks. However, your butcher will be happy to cut them for you from a whole leg of lamb. One leg of lamb will typically yield six steaks, each large enough for one serving size.Ask for steaks cut about 2/3-inch thick. This allows for a quick cooking time and tender results.
If your butcher doesn't have a leg of lamb, this method can also be used to cook lamb chops.;
, Peel and chop the garlic into fine pieces. Mix the garlic, rosemary, olive oil, and a pinch of salt and pepper in a shallow baking dish or another nonreactive dish. This marinade will penetrate the steaks for a tender result. If you're in the mood for a different flavor combination, try one of these:

Mix your marinade.,
Soak your steaks before cooking.,
Heat your grill.,
Add your steaks.,
Remove when done.",How to Cook New York Strip Steak2," Like many other cuts of meat, New York strip steaks can be given extra flavor by soaking them in a marinade before cooking. We've provided a recipe to one simple but delicious marinade above, but literally hundreds of others will also work well. There aren't any hard and fast rules for making your own marinade, but there are a few basic guidelines that most marinades follow. If you're a novice, try including the following ingredients in your marinade to start with:


A source of fat. Usually, this is an oil, like vegetable oil, canola oil, olive oil, sesame oil, etc.
An acid. This can be a citrus juice (like lemon, lime, or orange), wine, vinegar (balsamic, red wine, apple cider, etc.) or another acidic liquid.
Other seasonings. You can get creative here — anything from Worcestershire sauce to dijon mustard to peanut butter to parsley to garlic to soy sauce can work, depending on whether it pairs well with the other ingredients.
Salt and pepper to taste.

, When your marinade is mixed, put your steaks in an airtight plastic bag or a seal-able fridge container and coat them evenly with the marinade. Let them sit in your fridge for at least two hours so that they're able to soak up the flavor of the marinade — some chefs let their meat marinade overnight or even several days to give it an extra dose of flavor.

, As with pan-searing, good grilled steaks require a high-temperature initial searing to develop their delicious crust. For this reason, you'll want to start your grill or barbecue well before you plan to cook. Keep the lid close to speed up the grill's heating process.


For gas grills, pre-heating is easy — simply set one or more burners to ""high"" and shut the lid for 5 minutes or so.
For charcoal grills, first, you'll need to light your charcoal, wait for it to flame up, and finally ash over before cooking can begin. This process can take upwards of half an hour, so leave yourself plenty of time. Once your charcoals are ready for cooking, spread them out evenly with a grill tool to prepare the entire grill for cooking.

, Use a grill brush to lightly paint the bars of the grill with olive or vegetable oil, then lay your steaks on the grill surface with a pair of tongs. Allow them to cook much as you would during a pan searing, flipping them after three to five minutes once a suitable crust has formed.


Once you're familiar with a gas grill, you can usually expect to get consistent results from it. The same can't necessarily be said for charcoal grills, whose cooking times can vary based on how much charcoal is used and what temperature the charcoal is burning at. Thus, you'll want to keep an extra-close eye on your steaks when cooking over charcoal — turn them as soon as you're satisfied with the dark brown crust on the bottom edge.

, After your initial turn, allow your steaks to continue cooking for another two to four minutes until they're cooked to your liking. Check for the same signs of done-ness as described above (firm texture at edges, soft in middle, no red inside the meat, etc.) and, if satisfied, remove them from the grill and serve!


Optionally, you may want to consider painting the steaks with leftover marinade during the cooking process to help them develop a delicious exterior. However, you won't want to apply any marinade once the steaks are finished cooking — since the marinade has come in contact with the raw steaks, this can transfer harmful bacteria to them.

"
"
Heat a dutch oven.,
Brown your steaks in a pan.,
Slow-cook the steaks in a plastic bag.,
Optionally, prepare a sauce.,
Re-brown the steaks and serve.",How to Cook New York Strip Steak3," This method for cooking your New York strip steaks may be unfamiliar to amateur chefs, but, when done right, allows you to get deliciously tender medium-rare steaks very consistently.To start, fill a dutch oven about two-thirds of the way full with water and set it to a medium heat.


You want the internal temperature of your dutch oven to reach about 130o F (54o C) before you begin to cook your steaks. If your dutch oven doesn't have a built-in thermometer, you can use a candy thermometer by attaching it to the side of the oven.

, The problem with cooking steaks in a moist environment like a dutch oven is that there's no way to give them a nice, crispy crust like they'd get on the grill or in a pan. However, there's a way around this — by giving the steaks a quick pan-crisping before (and, as we'll see, after) they're cooked in the dutch oven, we can still give them their desirable crust.


Season and prepare your steaks and pan exactly as directed for a pan-searing above. However, only cook your steaks one minute per side — remember, you're trying to brown the outsides of the steaks, not cook them through.

, Once your steaks have slightly-browned exteriors, place them in a sturdy plastic bag and seal it (you may want to double-bag them to prevent water from leaking in). Remove the air from the bag either with a vacuum-packing tool or by lowering the bag into the water with the seal open, then sealing once the water has forced most of the air out.


At this point, drop the bag of steaks into the dutch oven and close it. If necessary, raise the heat setting of the oven slightly to bring it back up to 130o. Cook at this temperature for about two to two and a half hours.
As the steaks cook, periodically check their progress. Move the bag and turn it over about once every hour or so to ensure the meat cooks evenly.

, While you're waiting for steaks to finish cooking, you have plenty of free time to prepare other dishes if you'd like to. One thing you may want to consider doing is making a simple sauce or garnish to put on your steaks once they're finished. For instance, you can make a delicious mushroom garnish by melting a few tablespoons of butter in a saucepan, then tossing in some mushrooms, chopped shallots, and minced garlic for flavor — simply cook the ingredients together until they're flavorful and fragrant.


You can ""eyeball"" these ingredients if you'd like — it's hard to add ""too much"" of any one of them. For precise measurement recommendations, see the ingredients section above.
For extra flavor, try adding a splash of white whine!

, After a few hours in the dutch oven, the steaks should be deliciously tender and cooked all the way through. At this point, if you'd like, you can toss the steaks back into a hot, oiled pan for one or two minutes on each side to improve their outer crusts. The steaks should now be ready to eat!


If you made a sauce or garnish, pour a spoonful over each steak before serving it on its plate.

Finished.

",How to Cook New York Strip Steak4," Once you remove your steaks from the pan, grill, or oven, you'll probably get a whiff of their delicious aroma and want to bite immediately. Resist this urge! Instead, let your steaks sit under tented tin foil for about ten minutes before you cut into them. You'll be glad you did — steaks that get a chance to rest are slightly moister and more flavorful than those that don't.The reason this ""resting"" tactic works has to do with the way that a piece of meat is constructed at the microscopic level. Meat is made up of tightly-packed muscle fibers — as these fibers cook, they contract, forcing out moisture in the inside of the meat. By giving the meat a chance to cool slightly after cooking, you're allowing the fibers to relax and reabsorb some of this flavorful moisture.

, New York strip steak is a versatile dish that pairs excellently with countless side dishes and garnishes. For a quick solution, try serving your steaks with sauce. Pre-made sauces are ready instantly, while from-scratch sauces can take as little as a few minutes to prepare, making them a great choice if you're in a hurry. Here are just a few sauces that some food experts recommend for strip steak:Flavored butter (garlic, parsley, thyme, etc.)
Barbecue sauce
Peppercorn sauce
Pesto
Red wine reduction

, What meal is heartier or more satisfying than steak and potatoes? Lots of potato side dishes pair excellently with steak, making for a complete, filling meal. Try serving some of the following potato sides with your steak:


French-fried potatoes (fries)
Baked potatoes
Scalloped potatoes
Roasted potatoes
Mashed potatoes
Boiled potatoes

, While potatoes are super-reliable side dishes for steak, they're far from the only things that pair well with it. There are a huge variety of foods that taste great with steak. Here are just a few serving suggestions — note that there are no real limits to what you serve with your steak except the ingredients you have handy:


Fried/caramelized onions
Wilted spinach/chard/collard greens
Macaroni and cheese
Grilled or fried tomatoes
Salad
Roasted vegetables
Onion rings

Preheat your broiler or light the grill.,
Place the steaks on the broiler rack or grill.,
Sear the steaks on both sides to seal in the juices.,
Baste the steaks with extra marinade as they cook.,
Turn the steaks and cook for three more minutes.",How to Cook Lamb Steaks2," Lamb steaks taste best when they are seared with high heat or fire, so broiling or grilling are the optimal cooking methods. Allow the broiler or grill to fully heat up before proceeding.


If you're using a grill, let the coals burn until the fire dies down and the coals glow bright red. The steaks must be grilled over very high heat.
If you'd prefer to use a stovetop method, heat a cast iron skillet over medium high heat. Allow it to get very hot.

, Use tongs to transfer them from the marinade to the rack or grill. Reserve the extra marinade in its container. Arrange the steaks so that they are all centered over high heat with no overlap. If you're using a cast iron skillet, you may need to cook your steaks in more than one batch.

, Let the steaks cook on one side for thirty seconds, then quickly flip them to cook on the other side for thirty seconds. This keeps the steaks moist inside as they cook. Let the steaks continue cooking on the second side for five minutes., Use leftover marinade to baste the steaks as they cook. A basting brush or barbecue mop is the best tool for the job.

, After three minutes, remove the steaks to a serving platter. This cooking time results in a medium rare steak that's still pink in the middle.


If you prefer medium to well done steaks, let them cook for an extra 30 seconds to 1 minute.
If you prefer rare steaks, remove them after the last side has cooked for 2 minutes.

You could use a big skillet if your chuck steaks are thin.;
, Once the oil is hot and shimmering, add the seasoned steak to the Dutch oven. The steak will sizzle as soon as you add it to the pot. Let the steak cook on medium heat until it browns. Use tongs to turn the steak so that it browns on all sides. Use the tongs to take the steaks out of the pot once they're seared. Pour off and discard any fat from the pan.Wear oven mitts when searing the steak since the hot oil may sputter.

, Pour in about 3/4 of a cup of liquid. This will keep the chuck steak moist as it cooks and will make it even more tender. Try using one of the following as braising liquids:Beef or vegetable broth
Apple juice or cider
Cranberry juice
Tomato juice
Dry wine mixed with broth
Water
1 tablespoon of a liquid seasoning like barbecue sauce, Dijon mustard, soy sauce, steak sauce or Worcestershire sauce (You can add these to water to dilute them.)

, To add even more flavor to your braised chuck steak, stir in dried herbs of your choice. You'll need to stir in about 1 teaspoon of dried herbs or 1 tablespoon of fresh herbs. You can use herbs like:


Basil
Herbes de Provence
Italian seasoning
Oregano
Thyme

, Cover the Dutch oven with a heavy lid and place the steak in the oven. For 2 1/2 to 3 pounds of chuck steak, bake the steak for 1 hour and 15 minutes to 1 hour and 45 minutes. The chuck steak will be completely tender when it's finished braising and ready to serve. If you check the temperature, the steak should be between 145 degrees F (62 C) for medium-rare and 175 F (79 C) for well-done.To check tenderness, insert a fork or knife into the steak. If tender, the fork or knife should slide in easily.

Purchase high-quality steak.,
Thaw your steak.,
Make sure your steak is dry.,
Season your steak.",How to Cook a T Bone Steak1," A firm, bright red, steak will be fresher than a soft, darker colored, one. Also look for an even distribution of thin white lines of fat, known as marbling, throughout the surface. The marbling melts and moistens the meat during cooking, making your steak tender and flavorful.Choose an evenly cut steak that is about 1 1/4 inches (31.75 mm) thick.
Check the packing and expiration dates to confirm freshness.
If you're buying your steak in the United States, look out for the USDA beef grade on the label, which is an official indicator of quality: ""Prime"" is the best, followed by ""Choice,"" and then ""Select."";
, Take your steak out of the fridge or freezer before cooking to let it thaw to room temperature, about 70ºF (21ºC). Avoid cooking your steak cold because the meat will contract and be tough to chew., Pat it down with a paper towel. The meat should be dry so that you do not end up steaming it instead!








, Gentle seasoning, such as a sprinkling of salt, will help enhance the natural flavors of your steak. If you're feeling adventurous, you could also try pepper, paprika, or other dry spices.









Avoid over-seasoning because it will prevent you from tasting your steak's natural goodness.
If you use salt, don't season your steaks right before cooking, as this will add moisture which will interfere with the cooking process.
If you would like to use wet seasonings, it is best to marinate and refrigerate your steak for a couple of hours. Remember to also allow time for it to be removed from the fridge and reach room temperature before cooking."

, Turn on a gas grill to high heat or prepare a charcoal grill so the coals are hot. Set a 12 inch cast-iron skillet on the grate and add 2 tablespoons of coconut oil in the bottom of the skillet. Let the pan and oil heat up for a few minutes.You could also use canola oil if you don't want to use coconut oil. Avoid using olive oil or butter since these have low smoke points and will burn.

, Add the seasoned potatoes and chopped onions to your hot cast-iron skillet. Stir the potatoes quickly so they're evenly coated in the coconut oil. Let them cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until they're as browned as you'd like them. Remove the potatoes and onions to a pan.








If you want crispy potatoes, avoid stirring them often since this will prevent a crust from forming. If they start to stick to the pan, add another teaspoon or two of coconut oil.

, Add one teaspoon of coconut oil to the empty cast-iron skillet. The skillet should still be hot and placed on the grill. Crack the egg into the skillet. Fry the egg according to how you like it. Breakfast steak goes especially well with an egg cooked over easy.









You could cook several eggs if you plan on serving breakfast steak and eggs for a crowd.

, Turn on your grill to high heat if you're using a gas grill. You could also heat a charcoal grill till it's hot. Dump the coals evenly in the center to maintain the heat.


To tell if your charcoal grill is hot enough, hold your hand about 5 inches above the coals. If you can only hold your palm there comfortably for one second, your grill is hot.

, Lay the breakfast steak directly on the grill and let it cook for 4 to 5 minutes. Wear oven mitts and use tongs to turn the steak over. Cook the other side of the steak till its as done as you like. For example finish cooking the steak for:








3 to 5 minutes to get medium-rare
5 to 7 minutes to get medium
8 to 10 minutes to get medium-well

, Once the steak is cooked to your liking, use tongs to take it off the grill. Place the steak on a plate or cutting board. Loosely cover the steak with aluminum foil and let it rest for 5 minutes.Resting the steak helps the juices redistribute within the steak. It will also finish cooking.

Fillet steak: the most expensive cut, often consumed when eating out as a treat. This cut does not have a bone. Also known as eye fillet steak; fine texture and most tender.



 


Sirloin: this cut is large in size and can include a bone or may be boneless. The fillet and thin minute steak form a part of the sirloin. It can also be termed a ""contre-filet"".






T-bone, Porterhouse steak: these contain a large bone. Also known as strip loin steak. Good barbecued or grilled.






Rump steak: the tender, lean cut. Taken from the upper part of the round (hindquarter). Great for barbecuing.






New York cut: Boneless strip loin steak.






Skirt steak: This piece comes from the inner thigh and is coarse-grained, lean and flavorsome. Best for stews and casseroles, requires slow cooking.;
, Do you prefer tender pieces or is a tougher texture fine for you? The more tender the steak, the higher the cost.

, If it has been hung prior to sale, it will be more tender. This is more likely to occur with a boutique butcher rather than a supermarket butcher.

If the broiler is in a sliding tray under the oven, you won't need to adjust the rack. Turn the broiler on while you salt and pepper both sides of your chuck steak.If you like, you can use any steak seasoning to flavor the chuck steak.

, Place the seasoned steak onto a baking sheet or skillet and place it below the broiler. Depending on the thickness of the steak, broil it for 7 to 9 minutes. If you'd like it on the medium or rare side, cook it closer to 6 or 7 minutes.Depending on the type of broiler you have, you may want to leave your oven door cracked so you can monitor the cooking.

, Use a sharp fork or kitchen tongs to carefully turn the chuck steak. Place the steak back under the broiler and let it cook for another 5 to 8 minutes, depending on thickness. Check the steak's temperature.If you want a medium-rare steak, remove it from the broiler at 145 degrees F (60 C). For a medium steak, let it cook to 160 degrees F (70 C).

, Remove the steak to a cutting board or serving plate. Place aluminum foil over the steak so it forms a tent and let the steak rest for about 5 minutes. This will help the muscle tissue in the steak redistribute the juice so it doesn't all run out when you begin cutting the steak.The steak should cool down about 5 degrees from the time you take it out from the broiler and after it's rested.

If you want to keep it simple, just use coarse salt and pepper. Don't be afraid to coat both sides of your steak with the seasoning since this will give it flavor and help it brown. You should be able to see seasoning on the steak. You could also use:Cajun seasoning
Chimichurri
Teriyaki
Montreal steak seasoning

, Place a heavy bottomed skillet (preferably a cast iron skillet) over high heat. Add a few tablespoons of coconut oil, grapeseed oil, or vegetable oil in the pan to heat. You want the pan to get really hot so the steak sizzles immediately and begins to brown.


Coconut, grapeseed, and vegetable oils all have high-smoke points so they won't burn as your pan heats up. Avoid pan-frying a steak in butter or olive oil which will burn.

, Place the steak in your hot oiled skillet and let it cook for 1 to 3 minutes. Carefully turn the steak and sear the other side for another 1 to 3 minutes. The steak should be a dark golden brown color on the sides. It will still be mostly raw inside, but you'll finish the steak in the oven for even cooking.


You can turn the steaks frequently while they're searing so they sear evenly and brown faster., Place the entire skillet with the seared steak into the preheated oven. Cook the steak for 6 to 8 minutes or until the steak reaches the level of doneness you'd like. If you check the temperature, the steak should be between 145 degrees F (62 C) for medium-rare and 175 F (79 C) for well-done. Transfer the steak to a plate and let it rest a few minutes before you serve it.Letting the steak rest helps the juices in the meat distribute evenly.
Ensure your skillet is ovenproof before placing it the oven. Even if it says it's ovenproof, check to see if it can be used in a 400 degree F oven.

Choose the chuck steak.,
Store and handle the chuck steak.,
Serve the chuck steak.",How to Cook Chuck Steak4," If you're buying steak to feed several people, try to choose smaller steaks that are about the same size. If you can't find any, you can purchase one or two larger steaks to cut into smaller portions. This way, the steaks will cook evenly.


Chuck steaks can be irregular since they include a lot of muscle from the shoulder area of the beef. Look for a chuck steak that doesn't have too much fat and seems to be an even thickness., Try to use your fresh chuck steaks as soon as you bring them home. If you can't use them immediately, you can refrigerate them for up to 2 or 3 days. To store them, remove them from the plastic wrap covering and place them in a non-plastic dish. Cover the dish loosely so there's some air flow. Put the steaks in the meat compartment of your fridge or put them on the bottom shelf so any juices don't drip onto other food.When handling and storing raw meat, it's important not to place, touch or store raw and cooked meat together. Keep them in separate compartments and use different cutting boards when wrapping and handling them.

, For a classic meal, serve the chuck steak with cooked potatoes (mashed or roasted) and a side salad. For more adventurous sides, consider serving the chuck steak with coleslaw, roasted vegetables, a vegetable gratin, or sauteed mushrooms. You can also serve the steak with almost any kind of sauce (barbecue, pesto, hollandaise, or a flavored butter).You can also thinly slice the chuck steak and serve with stir-fried vegetables and rice. Or you can fill a tortilla with the thinly sliced chuck steak to make fajitas.

You'll want a thicker cut of meat, at least an inch thick but hopefully thicker. You'll also want to choose a piece of meat with good marbling, which means thin little veins of fat in between the meat. Finally, be aware of the cut of meat you get.


Thicker is better. Why? A thinner steak is harder to cook well: Perfectly cooked on the outside often means overdone on the inside, because it's so thin. But not just this. Your steak will shrink a bit as it's cooked — the muscle fibers will tense up (like a balled fist) and some juices will be lost (although hopefully not too many). A thicker steak makes it easier to get a perfect crust on the outside and a juicy, pink center on the inside.
Marbling is the amount of intramuscular fat in a piece of red meat. Cuts with good marbling are often tender, luscious, and more flavorful.Wagyu or Kobe beer, for example, are renowned across the world for their marbling and taste.Look for a cut of meat with good marbling on it for best results. It's cost more, but it's worth it for a great-tasting steak.
What cut of meat are you going to spring for in your meal? This is a question that only you can answer. When you think of steak, you're probably thinking ""ribeye,"" so that's a great start. T-bone, porterhouse, sirloin, and strip steak are all great options, too.;
, The bigger the cut of meat, the more generously you should salt it. And be sure to salt it for at least 40 minutes.If you salt immediately before cooking, the salt leeches moisture to the surface of the cut, leaving you with a drier steak. If you salt and let the cut wait for 40 minutes or longer, the moisture drawn out by the salt eventually seeps back into the meat, tenderizing it and giving it more flavor.


Be sure to let your steak come to room temperature, too. Steak that's at room temperature cooks more evenly and takes less time to cook.

, You want your cast iron skillet to be really hot when you take it out so that it sears the steak quickly. For best results, leave in the oven for at least 20 minutes.


Position the highest rack in your oven about 4 to 6 inches (10.2 to 15.2 cm) below the broiling range.

, Although olive oil is great for other types of cooking, it's a little too strong for this cut of meat. Best to choose a neutral oil.

,, If your skillet has raised ridges, place it at one diagonal for 15 seconds, and then on the same side, at the other diagonal for a crosshatch pattern. Do not cook for longer than 30 seconds per side. Your steak should begin to sizzle immediately on the hot pan.

, Cook on one side for 2 minutes, and then the other side for an additional 2 minutes. Flip using tongs, not a fork, as this will cause juices to leak out. Cooking the steak on each side for 2 minutes will give you a perfectly-cooked medium-rare steak.


If you prefer your steak medium, then add an additional one minute cooking time to each side. That means cooking at 3 minutes per side instead of two.,, Why do this now and not before cooking in the oven? It's very possible that pepper placed on the steak before cooking will burn, causing a slightly acrid taste. Many professionals have taken to peppering their steak afterwards instead.

, The steak will continue cooking somewhat during this time. Also, the juices that were sent into the middle of the steak during the cooking process will eventually spread out evenly throughout the steak, giving you a juicier piece of meat when you finally cut into it.

Transfer the ground spices to a small bowl and add in the sugar, paprika, garlic powder, and onion powder.


Use a spoon or your finger to mix all the spices together until combined.;
, Pour half the spice mix over the top of the steak and use your fingers to spread the spices around and massage them into the meat. Flip the steak over and repeat on the other side.


Transfer the steak to a plate and put it in the refrigerator to marinate in the spice mix for three to four hours.

, Once the steak has been marinating for two to three hours, you can start preparing the grill. While the charcoal or wood is heating up, take the steak out of the fridge and let it warm up on the counter.


Once the grill is ready, the steak will be at room temperature and ready to go on the grill immediately., Use a wire brush to scrub the grill clean to remove old food particles that have been burned on. Once you’ve removed the larger pieces, go over each part of the grill with a grill brush and give the grill a good scrubbing. Empty out old ashes from the bottom of the bowl.When you're finished cleaning the grill, remove it from the braai and set it aside so you can light the fire.

, Stuff the bottom of the chimney starter with a piece of newspaper. Fill the chimney starter with as much wood or charcoal as you can fit. A braai needs a good, hot, large fire, so you need to start with a lot of fuel.When the chimney starter is full, use a barbecue lighter to light the newspaper in the bottom of the starter. Light it in multiple places around the starter.


Once the fire is started, it will begin to spread and the charcoal or wood will burn down.
Continue burning the fire in the chimney starter until the wood turns to embers or the charcoal turns gray., When the wood or charcoal is ready, pour the embers into the bowl and spread them out evenly with charcoal tongs. This will ensure that there aren't any cool spots, and that the steak cooks evenly on the grill.


Concentrate the coals in the center of the bowl so the heat will be directly below where the steak is cooking.

, Carefully place the grill back into the bowl of the barbecue. If your grill has multiple racks, place the grill on the lowest one, nearest to the fire. Let the grill sit over the coals for 10 to 20 minutes to preheat. This will ensure the steak starts cooking as soon as you lay it on the grill.


Ideally, you want the grill to be 2 to 6 inches (5 to 15 cm) from the bed of embers.When the grill is good and hot, use the wire brush again to give it a final scrub., As soon as the grill is ready, use a pair of long-handled tongs to transfer the steak to the center of the grill. Don’t use a fork to move the steak around, or you'll pierce the meat and release the juices.


Cook the steak for three to five minutes on the first side. After three minutes, start checking the underside for browning.
When the first side is brown, flip the steak with tongs and cook for another three to five minutes on the other side., A braai steak is traditionally only cooked to medium rare. This will take about seven to 10 minutes in total. If you have a meat thermometer, the ideal temperature for the steak is 120 to 125 F (49 to 52 C).If you don’t have a meat thermometer, gently press the steak with your finger when you think it’s done. If the meat provides little resistance and gives easily to your push, then it’s ready., As soon as the meat is cooked, remove it from the grill with the tongs. Place the meat on a fresh plate or wooden board. Set the meat aside to rest for about 10 minutes.


Resting meat makes for a juicier steak because it prevents the juices from spilling out when the meat is cut., Steak and potatoes are a classic combination, and roasted potatoes are a great side dish for braai steak. Asparagus is also a fantastic pairing with steak, and grilled asparagus nicely complements a braai steak.

Prepare the steak before you cook it.,
Know what to avoid.,
Slow cook thick steaks first.,
Prepare a pan to sear the steak.,
While your pan is getting scorching hot, paint some olive oil or rendered fat (healthiest options), vegetable oil or butter onto both sides of the steak.,
Lay the steak in the pan.,
Serve and eat.",How to Cook a Steak on the Stove," Generously salt both sides about an hour before cooking. Salt actually opens up your taste buds to allow more flavor in your mouth. This will make the steak taste even better.;
, So for steaks 1.5"" thick and above, it's difficult to cook the center enough without overcooking the rest of the steak. Just taking it straight to a burning sear for 4-5 minutes each side leaves you with a tiny strip in the middle of perfect steak, grey overcooked steak outside of that getting more overcooked as you reach the surface that most likely has a great sear.

, Put the steak in your preheated oven at 225º straight on a wire rack with something to catch any drippings. In about 15-25 min (depending on how thick it is), you should have a uniform temp of 115º.


For thinner steaks, less than an inch and a half thick, there is no need to do this - searing the steak over the stove will adequately cook it all the way through without burning or overcooking the outside.

, Get an iron skillet or frying pan and heat it over the stove to make it as hot as possible. Charcoal gets hotter than gas, but your stove will work fine too.

, This allows for a better sear and adds even more flavor. Feel free to add some more salt for a better crust; coarse salt is best for this.

, Don't move it, and time it while it cooks. Don't leave it alone, as it will overcook fast. Cook for 30-90 seconds depending on how hot your pan is. Flip it, add a few drops of the oil again, and pepper it. The hot oil will break out the pepper's flavor. Another 30-90 seconds and you should have a perfect, edge to edge pink, amazingly seared steak. If the sear isn't to your liking, leave it longer, but the sear is not as important as the middle, which should be no hotter than 130-135.


Sear thinner steaks longer to cook all the way, as needed. Sear them for up to 2-3 minutes each side.
It will get very smokey! You will smoke out your entire house. Guaranteed. (Smoke alarms, windows, maybe even run the whole thing outside for a minute while it sears?)

, Put your steak on your plate with any sides you like, including a baked potato, asparagus, or other vegetables. Pour whatever drippings you have in the pan over the steak and maybe add a small pad of butter on top. Eat shortly after cooking - you don't want cold steak!

Refrigerate the meat and marinade.,
Cook the meat.",How to Marinate a Steak1," Tougher and/or low-fat cuts like flank steak, sirloin, skirt, flat iron, round, and hanger steaks are best for marinating. The marinade soaks into the meat, adding flavor and helping to tenderize the meat.


Don't ruin expensive steaks by marinating them; quality cuts like rib-eye, porterhouse, T-bone, filet mignon, and NY strip are great as they are don't need to be marinated.
For more info, see How to Understand Cuts of Beef.;
, Marinade works because acids break down muscle and connective tissue, which is a slow process; if the meat is thick, the outside can get sour by the time the marinade actually penetrates the core.


In general, the more surface area that's exposed to the marinade, the better the marinade will do its job.

, A basic marinade consists of an acidic liquid (which will break down muscle fibers), oil, and other flavorings, such as sweeteners, herbs, and/or spices. Marinades can be sweet and salty, Italian flavor, barbecue flavor - if you have a taste for it, chances are you can make it into a marinade. Choose a bottled marinade or mix your own using one of the ingredient lists in this article.


Most marinades use one of the following acidic liquids as a tenderizer: wine, vinegar, or lemon juice. However, don't go overboard: while acidic marinades work by breaking down (denaturing) protein bonds, putting a steak in a highly acidic marinade (pH around 5 or lower) for more than two hours has the opposite effect, tightening the protein bonds, drawing out moisture, and making the meat tougher.
There are also tenderizing enzymes in ginger, kiwi, papaya, and pineapple. It's possible to go overboard with these, too, turning the steak into mush.
Dairy products like Greek yogurt and buttermilk can also have a tenderizing effect, although the way this works is not fully understood. Most likely, it’s due to the lactic acid content.

, You can use any type of plastic, glass or ceramic food storage container. Pour enough marinade over the meat to cover it entirely. Don't worry about adding too much.


Marinating a flat cut of meat in a large ziploc bag can be very useful since you will need less marinade to completely cover it here than you would inside a bowl.
If you're running low on time, you can work in the marinade by massaging the meat. Otherwise, time will do the work.

, Put the sealed container in the fridge for 2 to 24 hours, depending on the strength of the marinade.

, Shake off excess marinade, let the meat come to room temperature, and grill, bake, fry, or otherwise cook the meat according to your recipe.

2 medium shallots, minced
1 tablespoon dried thyme leaves
3 tablespoons (packed) dark brown sugar
1/4 cup soy sauce
3 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce
2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
1/3 cup vegetable oil

, Marinating the steak in salt and pepper overnight causes the flavors to seep into the cut of meat, so you'll taste savory heat all the way to the center of the meat when you cook it. Here's what you'll need for this marinade:


1 1/2 teaspoons of salt

Add marinade or rub (optional).,
Let your steak reach room temperature.,
If marinade or rub was not used, add salt now.",How to Cook Steak1," While it's impossible to say that ""steak"" means any one cut, it does tend to mean certain cuts over others. Choose one that suits your liking, taking taste, juiciness, and price into consideration:



T-bone: T-bone steaks are strip steaks and filet mignon separated by a bone shaped like a ""T."" It is a fan-favorite, but the fact that it comes from the cow's loin — where meat is extremely tender — makes it a little pricey.Porterhouse: Part tenderloin and part strip steak, the porterhouse is surprisingly like the T-bone steak, with a thin wedge of a bone between the two cuts to impart loads of flavor.Almost identical in price to the T-bone.

Rib Eye: Ribeye comes from the rib of the steer, hence its name. It is what many of us think when the word ""steak"" comes to mind: It has beautiful marbling (thin layers of fat in between meat), giving it a silky texture and a robust taste.New York strip: New York strip steak comes from the short loin, a place where muscle is seldom used and therefore particularly tender. Although not as tender as a ribeye, New York strip steak has great marbling as well.

Sirloin: ""Sirloin"" can refer to either top sirloin — a tasty but expensive cut of meat — or the bottom sirloin, in which case it's just called a sirloin steak. This cut comes from the rear back of the animal, near where the T-bone and porterhouse are.;
, Why are thick steaks better than thin steaks? With thin steaks, it's nearly impossible to get a perfectly brown, crispy outside and a pink, juicy interior. With thick steaks, getting that balance is a lot easier. It's always possible to share a 12 or 16 ounce steak with two or more people, and sharing one big steak between two people is always better than having one small steak per person.

, To soak or not to soak — that is the question. Many steak aficionados frown on the idea of adding anything but salt and pepper to a great cut of meat. And for good reason: The meat itself is supposed to shine. But if you do decide that you want to marinade your steak, now's the time to do it. Here are two simple ideas to add extra flavor to your steak if you so choose.


Marinade: 1/3 cup soy sauce, 1/2 cup olive oil, 1/3 cup lemon juice, 1/4 cup Worcestershire, 2 pieces crushed garlic garlic, 1/2 cup chopped basil, 1/4 cup parsley.Marinade for 4 to 24 hours before cooking.
Rub: 4 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, 2 tablespoons fresh ground pepper, 2 tablespoons sweet paprika, 1 tablespoon onion powder, 1 tablespoon garlic powder, 1 tablespoon dried oregano leaves, 2 teaspoons ground cumin., If your steak has been stored in the refrigerator while you waited for the perfect opportunity to grill it, now's the time to take it out. Getting your steak to room temperature will do two things:


Hasten the cooking process. Meat that's warmer takes less time to cook.
Harmonize the doneness of the outside and inside of the steak. If the steak has been refrigerated for a day, it will take longer for the internal temperature of the steak to come up. This means that you risk charring or burning the outside of the steak in order to cook the steak to medium on the inside.

, The bigger the cut of meat, the more generous you should be about adding salt. Remember, there's twice as much meat in a 16 ounce T-bone as there is in an 8 ounce ribeye. Salt accordingly.


Salt in advance. While some people salt up to four days in advance, only 40 minutes or so is strictly necessary.You can salt your steak and wait the requisite 40 minutes while it gets to room temperature.
Why no pepper? Pepper can burn during the cooking process, while salt cannot. Burnt pepper doesn't taste very good, so it's better to apply it after the cooking has taken place.

"
"
For best results, use hardwood coal.,
Arrange the all the hot coals on one half of the grill.,
Start the steak on the cool side of the grill, where no coals are resting.,
Flip often to begin developing a crust on each side.,
Use a thermometer to test for doneness.,
Alternately, use the the finger test to help approximate doneness.The finger test involves touching the fleshy part of your palm underneath your thumb to approximate the doneness of a piece of meat.,
Once the meat is about 15° F below your ideal temperature, sear it quickly on both sides to develop color.,
Take your steak off the grill about 5° F before it reaches your ideal temperature.,
Season with pepper and let the steak rest for at least five minutes.,
Enjoy.",How to Cook Steak2," Briquettes can be used if you don't have hardwood coal (such as mesquite). But hardwood coal burns hotter and faster, making for a better final product. Of course, if you only have a gas grill, that's acceptable, too. Just be prepared for a different flavor from your steak in the end.


Do not use lighter fluid to start your coals! Lighter fluid will give off fumes and can be tasted in the steaks. It's better to invest in a proper bbq chimney.

, This is your hot side of the grill. The other side is the cool side of the grill (even though it's still pretty darn hot). You're going to use the cool side of the grill to start with and the hot side of the grill later. It will help ensure a more perfect specimen of meat in the end.

, Cover the lid and slowly allow the steak to start cooking using indirect heat. This, in fact, goes against common practice: Many people try searing the steak to begin with in order to ""seal in the flavors."" This practice has no basis in fact.If you start with your steak on the cool side of the grill, you're giving it enough time for the whole steak — not just the outside — to rise in temperature. Additionally, by the time your steak is nearly finished cooking, it's been given enough to develop a nice crust. All you have to do to finish is quickly move it over the hot portion of the coals.

, Staying on the cool side of the grill, use tongs to flip your steak over often, about every minute or so. The grilling myth is that steaks should only be flipped once before serving. In fact, steaks which are flipped often over indirect heat cook more evenly and are juicier.When you're not flipping the steak, remember to put the cover on the grill.

, It may not sound very manly, but it sure is scientific. Plus, it works: Human judgment is a lot more fallible than a thermometer. We should all take note. Here's is the breakdown of how internal temperature breaks down to doneness:


120° F (48.8° C) = Rare
130° F (54.4° C) = Medium rare
140° F (60° C) = Medium
150° F (65.5° C) = Medium well
160° F (71.1° C) = Well done

, Open your hand and relax the palm. After each step, touch the inside of your palm with your other hand.

Fingers not touching at all (palm open): This is what raw meat feels like.
Thumb touching index finger: This is what rare meat feels like.
Thumb touching middle finger: This is what medium-rare meat feels like.
Thumb touching ring finger: This is what medium-well meat feels like.
Thumb touching pinky: This is what well done meat feels like.

, If color has already developed, keep the meat on the cool side of the grill instead, as searing releases juices in the steaks.

, Why take it off before it's hit your ideal temperature? The steak will continue to rise internally by about 5° F after it's taken off the grill.

, As you cook your meat, the juices travel to the inside of your meat as the muscle fibers contract. If you cut your steak right after you take it from the grill, the juices in the center fall out more freely. If you wait for at least five minutes, the muscle fibers relax and the juices spread out more evenly throughout the whole steak.

, Enjoy your wonderfully cooked steak alongside some scalloped potatoes and garlic-sautéed spinach, for example.

After 3 minutes on both sides, turn the oven down to 500° F (260° C).

,
Cook the steak according to the following chart.,
Season with pepper and let the steak rest for at least five minutes.,
Enjoy.",How to Cook Steak3," This distance is probably the ideal distance if you want to cook your steak medium-rare or medium. If you want your steak to be a little rarer, position the rack down at 6 inches (15.2 cm). If you want your steak to be more well-done, position the rack at 4 inches (10.2 cm).

, Cast-iron pans are perfect for broiling because they conduct heat extremely well. If you don't have a cast-iron pan, a roasting pan or grill pan will also work. Preheat for 15 to 20 minutes to get the pan nice and hot., If you're using a grill or a grill pan with raised ridges, lay the steak down at a diagonal so that you get good grill marks. Both the bottom and top of the steak should begin to sizzle if the oven is hot enough.

, Flip the steak using tongs, not a fork, as this will cause unnecessary and premature drainage of juices.

,, The chartbelow lists the approximate times to cook the steak at 500° F, given the thickness of the steak:


Rare (120° to 130° F)

, As you cook your meat, the juices travel to the inside of your meat as the muscle fibers contract. If you cut your steak right after you take it from the grill, the juices in the center fall out more freely. If you wait for at least five minutes, the muscle fibers relax and the juices spread out more evenly throughout the whole steak.

Use a nice neutral oil to cook the steak in. Olive oil is great for pasta and eggplant, but not so great for cooking steaks. Canola or another vegetable oil is probably better.

,, For best results, use a thermometer to check the internal temperature of the steak. Here's a guide of how internal temperature corresponds to doneness:


120° F (48.8° C) = Rare
130° F (54.4° C) = Medium rare
140° F (60° C) = Medium
150° F (65.5° C) = Medium well

Pot roast, chuck roast or any inexpensive cut may be used. The muscle fibers and connective tissue that make these cuts stringy or tough are broken down by braising, which gelatinizes the collagen into a more palatable texture. Low heat and long cooking times are used to make a tough cut of any kind of meat moist, tender, and delicious, when cooked properly. Common cuts of beef for braising include:


top blade roast
eye roast
seven bone, or center-cut pot roast
shank
ribs or short ribs
brisket
It's unlikely that you would ever want to braise any kind of lean steaks or loin. You could, but because these meats are tender already, it'd be a bit of a waste.;
, Other than a pot and your cut of beef, the only other absolutely essential ingredient is a liquid in which to simmer the meat. Because this is an opportunity to add a dash of flavor to the dish, it's most common to use wines, stocks, or other flavorful liquid, as opposed to water.Common braising liquids include:










Beef stock or broth. You can match the stock to the dish by using a beef-based broth or stock, although using chicken stock would is universal for braising any type of meat, and might add a nice complexity to your braised beef. Stock is just broth that hasn't been seasoned, so stock is generally better for braising, since it allows you to control the salt-levels, but either is acceptable. Just go easy on the salt if you use broth.Red wine. Dry red wine can add a nice acidic note to beef, especially when combined with another braising liquid, like stock. The alcohol cooks off, resulting in a rich and fragrant dark sauce. Especially fruity or sweet red wines would be less desirable, but fine if paired with an equal amount of stock to cut the sweetness. The fruitiness of a white wine would pair better with chicken or pork. Since it'll season your dish, make sure it's something you'd like to drink--pour yourself a glass for ""research.""

Dark beer. English cooking at its finest. Stouts, porters, or black lagers all lend a rich sweetness to beef, and a malty depth of flavor. The darker the better, when it comes to beef. Some Belgian ales might also work nicely, but experiment and find a beer you with a nice flavor. In general, lighter pilsners and lagers are more appropriate for chicken or pork.
How much liquid you'll need will depend on the amount of meat you're braising, and the addition of extra vegetables. As a general rule of thumb, you'll want enough liquid to cover the vegetables at the bottom of the pot and come up just to the level of the meat. You're not boiling the meat, or stewing it, so you won't submerge it in the braising liquid. It won't take much, and you can always add additional water to the pot if you didn't have enough wine left in the bottle.

, Sounds fancy, but it's not. In French cuisine, braised beef and many other meat dishes will always start with a vegetable base of finely minced carrot, onion, and celery, called mirepoix, which is used to pair with the meat and enrich the sauce. After searing the meat, the mirepoix is added and browned briefly before adding the braising liquid to the pot.


For a proper braising, there needs to be something at the bottom of the pot other than the liquid, to give the sauce fragrance, substance, and character, as well as to keep it from drying out. When minced very small, the mirepoix will mostly disintegrate into the liquid over the course of the long cooking time, to flavor the sauce, though you could leave larger chunks to do more of a ""pot roast"" style braised beef.
Depending on the cut of meat, you might use around 2-3 carrots, 2-3 celery stalks, and a small white onion.

, Depending on what you want to do with the beef you braise, you might elect to make a one-pot meal with the addition of vegetables. In most braising, some variety of aromatic vegetable will always be used to keep the moisture consistent in the bottom of the pot, as well as to release other flavors and aromas. Cooking beef low and slow is a great opportunity to cook vegetables as well.


Other vegetables like potatoes, cabbage, peas, mushrooms, greens, leeks, or other root vegetables can be added to the pot later, about 45 minutes before the meat is done cooking. Some fruits, like apple or pear, can also pair nicely with braised beef, depending on the season. Use firm, slightly under-ripe fruit, if you want to experiment.Aromatic herbs like rosemary, sage, bay leaf, or thyme can kick your braised beef up several notches. If you've got access to an herb garden, or just want to buy some fresh herbs from the store, tie up a bundle of a few stalks in twine and add at the same time you add the braising liquid.

, Braising starts on the stove and moves into the oven, making it important that you start in a pot that's oven-safe. Enameled cast-iron pots are perfect for braising, featuring the heat-retention of cast iron and the hefty weight of a good baking dish.


Skillets aren't generally big enough to hold all the braising liquid, meat, and vegetables required for a good braising, while thinner sauce-pans won't hold the heat as effectively as cast iron. If you don't have a cast iron dutch oven, though, anything you can cover and put in the oven will do in a pinch.
If you don't have a oven-safe stew pot, but have a heavy-bottomed saucepan, it's perfectly fine to braise meat on the stove-top as well. Some cooks prefer the oven method because it more evenly-distributes heat throughout the meat, while others prefer the simplicity of braising on the stove. Both methods result in tender and delicious beef.

, Season the meat on all sides with an even coating of salt and pepper. Go easy if you're going to braise the meat in broth, which will also be seasoned. If you want to add other spices to the dish, wait to add them until after the braising liquid has been added. Don't worry about trimming off fat or connective tissue, which will be broken down during the cooking process, providing great flavor.


Some cooks like to dust the meat with a light coating of flour before browning it, while others choose not to. Flour can help to create a nice attractive crust on the meat during the browning, and it will work to thicken the sauce. Additionally, it helps to dry out the surface of the meat to promote browning. If you don't dust with flour, dry off the meat before you attempt to fry it. Damp beef won't brown.
Depending on the cut of meat you're using, you may want to trim up the beef into manageable pieces, or leave it whole to braise the entire roast. Either method is perfectly fine, and will only majorly affect the presentation of the dish after it's done.
In general, braised beef will be left whole, while ""stewed"" beef (which is submerged in liquid) will be cut into smaller chunks. The techniques are largely similar, so go with what you like best. If you'd like bite-sized chunks, go ahead and cut up your roast ahead of time. If you'd rather leave it whole and fork it apart later, that's fine too.

, Put your pot on the stove over a medium-high heat, coating the bottom with about two tablespoons of olive oil. When the oil starts to smoke, add your meat and let it brown on each side, until you've created a nice dark crust on the outside. Turn the meat periodically and be very careful not to scorch.









You need to brown meat over high heat to cook the outside, not the inside. You'll cook the meat through in the liquid, so the browning is just used to create that tasty outer-layer of crust, as well as to season the bottom of the pot with drippings and little burned-on bits. The inside should still be very pink after you've browned it. Remove the meat from the pot and set it aside.

, In the drippings and browned bits stuck at the bottom of the pan, add your finely-minced carrot, onion, and celery. Stir the vegetables around as they brown, taking care not to let them scorch.

, When your vegetable base is browned, add a small amount of braising liquid to deglaze the bottom of the pot. Use a wooden spoon to scrape up the stuff stuck to the bottom, which will help to flavor the sauce and the meat. Add enough liquid to cover the vegetables and bring it to a simmer.









The difference between stewing and braising is the amount of liquid you add to the pot. Although they're very similar processes, technically-speaking, braised beef requires only the smallest amount of liquid, enough to cover the vegetables and create a humid environment in which to cook the meat. If you add a bit too much, don't worry, it'll be just as good.

, Once you've got the braising liquid up to a gentle simmer, add the beef back into the pot, settled gently on top of the vegetable/liquid mixture. Cover the pot securely and put it in the oven.


If you want to braise on the stove, reduce the heat immediately to low and cover the pot securely. To keep things from drying out, it might be helpful to add a bit more liquid than you normally would, more like you would for a stewing, and to leave the cover on the pot as much as possible. Every time you remove it, the moisture will be released, causing it to get drier.
As the meat cooks the liquid should condense and intensify, but the pot shouldn't dry out because you have the lid on. As it condenses on the top of the pot, it'll drip back down on top of the meat, basting it and keeping everything moist. Because you're creating a little cooking climate in the pot, you shouldn't remove it and mess with it. Let the pot and the heat do the work.The braising liquid should not be boiling. If the lid of your pot is rattling because the bubbles are aggressive, turn the heat down some. Anywhere between 250 and 350 F is appropriate for braising. The lower the temp, the longer the cooking time.

, To make sure everything finishes cooking at roughly the same time, you should add vegetables to the equation later in the cooking process, depending on what you want to add.



Root vegetables like parsnips, turnips, carrots, potatoes, and beets can and probably should be added earlier in the cooking process. Add root vegetables to the pot when you return the meat, and cut into uniform bite-sized pieces.

Delicate vegetables like greens, mushrooms, beans or peas should be added quite near the end, no more than an hour before you remove the braised beef from the oven. These may be added whole.

Defrost any frozen vegetables you'd like to add before adding them to the braising pot. Adding frozen vegetables can bring down the temperature considerably, and they won't need to be cooked for very long anyway.

, Depending on the size and variety of the cut you're braising, it should cook between 2 and 4 hours to reach its most tender state, and reach an internal temperature of around 160 F. When the beef is done, it should literally fall apart with very little pressure from a fork.


As the meat cooks, moisture will be forced out, drying it out. When it reaches 160 F, it'll technically be ""done"" at this point, but it won't be as good as it can and should be for a proper braising. Since you've gone to all the trouble to braise it, really braise it. After a bit more time in the oven, the fibers will relax and reabsorb the gelatinized collagen, making the meat very tender.
You shouldn't need to worry about under- or overcooking a braised beef dish. Cooking it longer only makes it better, and there's almost no risk of over-cooking it. If you're in doubt, cook it longer. It's not a dish to rush.

, When the beef is done cooking, remove it from the braising liquid, set it on a plate or a carving board, and cover it with foil to retain the heat. Braised beef should rest for at least 10 or 15 minutes before you carve it.


You can carve braised beef however you wish to serve it, depending on the particular cut. Slices are appropriate for brisket, while short ribs will likely be left whole. Fork-pulling some roasts might be appropriate, as well, if you want more of a BBQ-style dish.
If you've added additional vegetables, you can remove them as well, if you want to reduce the liquid to create a sauce or gravy. Spoon into a serving bowl, cover, and set aside.

, After you've removed the beef, put the pot back on the stovetop over medium-high heat to reduce the amount of liquid by half, or until it reaches the consistency you desire. Season the sauce to taste with salt, pepper, and a dash of Worcestershire.


If you want to make gravy, you can also thicken the sauce by mixing a slurry of about a tablespoon of flour and a quarter-cup of sauce in a separate bowl. When the slurry is mixed thoroughly, with all the lumps whisked out, add it to your sauce slowly, whisking as you go. If you dusted the meat with flour before browning it, the sauce might thicken on its own by reduction. Cook it down some to check for the thickness before you worry about starting a slurry.
Other additional aromatics like ginger, lemongrass, grated citrus rind, or garlic can be added to the liquid as it reduces for the sauce.

, Most commonly, you'll see braised beef paired with the vegetables it was braised with, if you chose to include any, and a potato dish of some sort. Braised beef is excellent with the following side dishes:



mashed potatoes or mashed sweet potatoes

hash browns
sweet parsnips
turnips or ""neeps""
greens like mustard, collard, turnip, or beet


, A bit of chopped flat-leaf parsley, rosemary, or fresh herb of your choice can liven up the braised beef. Arrange on a platter, spooning over the reduced sauce or gravy you made from the leftover braising liquid.


In many parts of the world, braised beef is a common Sunday supper, especially in the cold winter and autumn months. After slowly simmering the meat in the oven, the whole house smells rich and warm.

, A German variation on a basic braised beef, sauerbraten involves marinating a browned round roast in a mixture of vinegar and aromatic spices for up to three days before adding sugar and braising the beef in the marinade.For the marinade, heat a cup of apple cider vinegar and red wine vinegar in a saucepan, with about two cups of water, over medium-high heat. To this, add one small chopped white onion and a half cup each of chopped carrot and celery. Toss in a teaspoon each of mustard seeds and whole clove, 2-3 bay leaves, and salt and pepper to taste. Simmer, covered, for about 10 minutes while you brown the roast. After about 10 minutes, turn it off and let it cool to room temperature.

Brown the roast in olive oil before removing and placing in a pot suitable for holding the meat and all the marinade. When the marinade has cooled slightly (you don't want it to cook the meat) pour it over the beef and let it sit in the refrigerator for about three days, turning it once a day to make sure the meat is equally submerged.

After three days, braise in the oven at 325 F for about four hours after adding about a third of a cup of sugar to the marinading liquid. After braising, crushed-up gingersnaps and raisins are commonly whisked into the juice to thicken and add sweetness to the sauce, which is then poured over the sauerbraten.

, While it has absolutely nothing to do with Switzerland, swiss steak involves the ""swishing"" process, by which one flattens fabric (in this case meat) with rollers or hammers. The tough meat is then braised in a rich sauce made from tomatoes, until fork-tender and delicious. Combined with mashed potatoes and fresh corn, there's nothing better than a properly cooked swiss steak.To prepare the meat, cut round roast along the grain to form steaks roughly one half inch thick. Dredge each steak in flour, then pound out with a meat tenderizer until the steak flattens by half. Dredge the steaks again in flour and brown them on the skillet, over medium-heat in your dutch oven, or other oven-ready pot, on both sides. When the steaks turn golden brown on both sides, remove them from the pot and set aside.

To create the sauce, fry a small white onion, chopped, two or three cloves of garlic, and two large celery stalks in your pot. Sauté until the the vegetables are browned slightly. To this, add a tablespoon of tomato paste and a can of diced tomato (or two medium fresh tomatoes, chopped), and about a cup of beef broth. Stir and bring to a simmer, adding some chopped oregano, Worcestershire sauce, and a tablespoon of lemon juice to the sauce.

Return the meat to the pot and braise in the oven for about an hour and a half, covered, at 325 F. The meat should be done when it's fork-tender.

, Served with crusty bread, sweet-sour carbonade flamande is a deceptively simple Flemish flavor bomb, and a great way to mix up a traditional pot roast or braised chuck roast.Start the process by cubing the beef into bite-sized chunks and browning them in the dutch oven. Remove them from the pot, then crisp up about 3 or 4 strips of chopped bacon, turning down the heat when the fat renders out into the skillet. To the pot, add a whole white onion, chopped, and slowly caramelize the onion adding about 2 tablespoons of butter to the mix.

Deglaze the pan with a bottle of Belgian ale, adding a cup of beef stock, and two tablespoons each of brown sugar and apple cider vinegar. Season the braising liquid with chopped tarragon, parsley, thyme, or whatever green herbs you prefer, and salt and paper to taste.

Return the meat to the pot, then cook on the stove over low heat, covered, for about two hours, until he beef is fork-tender. Some recipes call for the braised meat to be topped with slices of bread for the last bit of the cooking time, which is broken down and stirred into the sauce to thicken. Often, this dish is served beside Belgian fries, or french fries., The technique is easy and the flavor is classic French haute cuisine. It doesn't need to be complicated to be good.Brown cubed roast in bacon grease, then remove it and sauté the mirepoix. Stir in a tablespoon of tomato paste and add about 20 white pearl onions and a pound of white button mushrooms. Add salt and pepper to taste, while gently stirring the mushrooms and onions to coat. Deglaze the skillet with 2 or 3 cups of dry red wine, preferably Burgundy, and a cup of beef or chicken stock. Season with two bay leaves, and whole leaves of sage, rosemary, and oregano.

Return the meat to the pot and braise at 325 F for about 3 or 4 hours until the meat is fork-tender. If the sauce is a little thin, remove the meat and cook it over medium-high heat on the skillet to reduce and thicken. Serve with roast potatoes.

Let it rest.,
Serve.",How to BBQ Steak1," Preheat a charcoal or gas grill for high heat. If you can set the temperature of the grill, set it to a minimum temperature of 450 degrees Fahrenheit (230 degrees Celsius).If you are unable to set the temperature, carefully hold the back of your hand 4 inches (10 cm) from the grate. You should only be able to comfortably hold it there for one second or less once the grill is hot enough.;
, Brush the clean grill grate with enough vegetable oil to lightly coat the surface. Doing so will help prevent the meat from sticking as it cooks.


Note that the grill grate must also be clean before you oil it; otherwise, the steaks may still stick to the surface. If you didn't clean the grill the last time you used it, do so now by scrubbing the grate with a heavy-duty grill brush.

, Lightly brush both sides of the steak with vegetable oil, then sprinkle both with salt and pepper.


The steak should be room temperature before you work with it. Otherwise, the meat may cook unevenly and could become tough.
Wait until you're ready to start cooking before you add any salt. Since salt can draw moisture out of the meat, letting it sit for too long can cause the steak to become dry and tough.

, Transfer the steak to the grill, placing it over direct heat.


Ideally, you should hear the meat sizzle as soon as it hits the hot grill.
Keep some space in between the steaks and do not overcrowd the grill. Overcrowding can prevent the steaks from cooking evenly.

, Using long-handled pincher tongs, turn the steak after 1 to 3 minutes, or once the meat easily lifts away from the grate.


You should only turn the steak once as it cooks. If you turn it too often, it may not form the trademark barbecue ""crust,"" and may lose some of its juices as a result.
Use tongs instead of a barbecue fork. Forks will pierce the meat and cause its juices to run out.

, The remaining cooking time will vary depending on the thickness of the steak and how thoroughly you want it to be cooked, but most steaks will finish within 2 to 8 more minutes.


The best way to determine doneness is to check the internal temperature of the steak with a meat thermometer.

Rare: 120 to 125 degrees Fahrenheit (49 to 52 degrees Celsius)
Medium-Rare: 130 to 135 degrees Fahrenheit (54 to 5 degrees Celsius)
Medium: 140 to 145 degrees Fahrenheit (60 to 63 degrees Celsius)
Medium-Well: 150 to 155 degrees Fahrenheit (66 to 68 degrees Celsius)
Well-Done: 160 degrees Fahrenheit (71 degrees Celsius)


The texture of the meat can also indicate its level of doneness. Rare meat will be soft when pressed with the back of your tongs. Medium meat will be springy yet slightly firm. Well-done meat will be very firm., After the steak reaches your desired level of doneness, remove it from the grill and let it rest on your cutting board for roughly 5 minutes.


During this time, the juices will redistribute themselves more evenly throughout the meat. Cutting into the steak too early will cause you to lose these juices.
Loosely cover the steak with foil as it rests to prevent the loss of heat.

, At this point in the barbecuing process, the steak should be done and ready to enjoy.

Make sautéed grasshoppers.",How to Cook Grasshoppers," The easiest way to obtain grasshoppers is simply to catch them yourself. They are easiest to catch in the morning, when it's colder and they are lazier. You can simply grab them off the ground with your hands, if you're fast enough, or use a net to catch them. You can also create some of these more elaborate traps:


Dig a hole in the ground and place a Mason jar with some bait, such as oats, apples, or carrots, in it. Either place some soil around the jar or tip it on its side -- the next morning, you should find grasshoppers in the jar. Just place the lid over it and you've caught your grasshoppers! If you want 'em alive, poke some holes in the lid.Take a shoot of green willow that's about three feet long and flick it down lightly on the grasshopper. This should pin it in place.;
, Depending on where you live, it may be tricky to buy grasshoppers, but not impossible. Try Mexican markets first. Grasshoppers, known as chapulines in Mexico, are a popular dish in Oaxaca.

, Grasshoppers are delicious and safe to eat, but you have to cook them first. This will keep you safe and will kill any parasites that they might be carrying. Don't attempt to eat them raw or you may suffer health issues., The legs of grasshoppers aren't edible; although you won't be hurt from eating them, it's best to remove them before you begin to cook them. The same goes for the wings. Some say that freezing the grasshoppers for 10-15 minutes or boiling them for a few minutes makes the legs easier to pop off. This also has the benefit of killing them.


Some people also pull the head straight off, which removes the guts (including the stomach). This tends to remove certain kinds of parasites (and could reduce the risk of eating the grasshopper raw, but it's still better to cook it). You can then insert a stick into the cavity and cook it over a fire.

, Make sure to run them under cold water until they are clean and free of dirt. You can pat them down with a paper towel and then freeze or boil them, depending on the recipe.

, This is probably the easiest way to cook grasshoppers. Here's what you have to do to cook them:


Freeze your cleaned grasshoppers for an hour or two.
Spread them out on a paper towel on a cookie sheet.
Preheat your oven to 200°F (93°C) and cook the grasshoppers for 1-2 hours until they're nice and dry and crunchy.
Try to crush them in with a spoon a bit to test their level of crunchiness. It's up to you -- just make sure they don't get burned in the process.
If you like, you can cover them in just a bit of olive oil and season them with salt and pepper to taste.

, For this simple dish, here's all you have to do:


Melt 1/4 cup of butter in a frying pan.
Reduce the heat to medium low.
Sauté 6 cloves of garlic for 4-5 minutes, until golden brown.
Add 1 cup cleaned grasshoppers to the pan.
Sauté for 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally.

, This is a tasty and decadent dish that makes the perfect snack or side dish. Here's how you make it:


Sift 3/4 cups of flour, 1 tsp. of baking powder, and 1 tsp. of salt together in a bowl.
Add 3/4 cups of milk and beat the mixture until it's smooth.
Slightly beat one egg and add it to the mixture.
Take 1 cup of grasshoppers and dip each of them in the egg batter. Make sure that the wings, legs (and the heads, if you like) have been removed.
Fry oil in a frying pan.
Deep fry the grasshoppers in the pan until they're crunchy and golden brown.
Add salt and serve them.

, This is a creative dish that is not only delicious but has a beautiful presentation. Here's what you've got to do to make it:Make the marinade. To do this, mix together all of the ingredients except for the grasshoppers, the bell pepper, and the onion. Do this in a non-reactive baking dish.
Marinate the grasshoppers. Submerge them in the marinade and let them sit there for at least an hour. For best results, you can marinate them overnight.
Remove the grasshoppers from the marinade and pat them dry.
Make the skewers by placing the grasshoppers, bell pepper, and onion on them in an alternating pattern.
Brush your grill lightly with olive oil.
Cook each skewer 2–3 inches (5.1–7.6 cm) above the fire.
Turn them every 2-3 minutes and continue to baste them in olive oil if needed.
Cook for about 8-9 minutes, until crunchy and ready to eat.

, This is another easy and delicious dish. Just take of the wings and legs, clean the grasshoppers, and get ready to sautee them. Here's what you do:


Marinate the grasshopper in a mixture of lemon and lime juice for at least an hour.
Sauté the garlic, serrano chile, and diced onion in a pan filled with oil over medium heat.
Remove the garlic, onion, and chile, and sauté the grasshoppers in the remaining juice for around 8-9 minutes, or until they are crunchy and brown.
Serve. Squeeze some lemon or lime juice over the grasshoppers and enjoy them on their own or in tortillas or tacos.

Preheat the grill on high heat.,
Season the steaks.,
Place the steaks on the grill.,
Turn the steaks as needed.,
Cook to desired doneness.,
Let the meat rest.,
Serve.",How to BBQ Steak2," Switch the electric grill to high heat. Allow it to warm up for at least 5 minutes.The grill needs to be as hot as possible before you add the steaks. If you have a grill with a temperature dial, set it to a minimum temperature of 450 degrees Fahrenheit (230 degrees Celsius).

, Brush the liquid smoke over both sides of each steak, then sprinkle both sides with smoked paprika and smoked salt.


Liquid smoke is an all-natural product flavored with real barbecue smoke, making it a great way to add outdoor barbecue flavor to meat cooked indoors.To further enhance the smoky barbecue flavor, use smoked paprika and smoked salt instead of standard, non-smoky alternatives. Add these spices sparingly, though, to avoid over-seasoning the meat.
Also note that the steaks should be room temperature before you work with them, and you should season the steaks immediately before barbecuing them so that the salt will not have time to draw out any of the meat's inner juices.

, Place the seasoned steaks directly on the preheated grill.


Any type of electric indoor grill will work, but you'll need to alter the grilling technique slightly based on the grill style.

For single-sided open grills, simply lay the steaks flat.
For single-sided grills with a lid, lay the steaks flat and cover the grill with its lid.
For double-sided press grills, lay the steaks on the bottom grill plate and gently close the upper grill plate on top.



, After 1 to 3 minutes, use tongs to flip both steaks over to the other side.


Note that this is only necessary for single-sided grills. Do not flip the steaks when using a double-sided press grill.
Only flip the steaks once throughout the cooking process.
You can also rotate the steaks by 90 degrees (1/4 turn) if you want to create cross grill marks.

, Grill the steaks for another 2 to 9 minutes, depending on the level of doneness you wish to enjoy.


Single-sided open grills will take the greatest amount of time, single-sided closed grills will be somewhat quicker, and double-sided press grills will be the quickest.
Test the texture of the meat with your tongs. Rare and medium-rare steak will be very soft. Medium and medium-well steak will be springy with a little firmness. Well-done steaks are very firm.
You can also check for doneness by inserting a meat thermometer into the thickest part of the steak:

Rare: 120 to 125 degrees Fahrenheit (49 to 52 degrees Celsius)
Medium-Rare: 130 to 135 degrees Fahrenheit (54 to 5 degrees Celsius)
Medium: 140 to 145 degrees Fahrenheit (60 to 63 degrees Celsius)
Medium-Well: 150 to 155 degrees Fahrenheit (66 to 68 degrees Celsius)
Well-Done: 160 degrees Fahrenheit (71 degrees Celsius)



, Pull the finished steaks off the grill and allow them to rest on a separate plate for 5 minutes.


During this time, you may wish to loosely cover the steaks with aluminum foil to prevent them from becoming cold.
Letting the steaks rest will ensure an even distribution of juices throughout the meat.

, The steaks should be ready to enjoy, and they should have a taste similar to the taste of outdoor barbecue.

"
"
Preheat the oven to 500 degrees Fahrenheit (260 degrees Celsius).,
Season the steaks.,
Transfer the cast-iron pan to the stove.,
Sear the steaks on both sides.,
Place the pan back inside the oven.,
Cook until done.,
Let the steaks rest.,
Serve.",How to BBQ Steak3," Place a cast-iron skillet in the oven as it warms up.The initial cooking will be done on the stove, but placing the pan in the hot oven will allow it to become nice and hot before you even add the steaks.
You can use a standard cast-iron skillet for this, but for an even more authentic barbecue experience, opt for a cast-iron grill pan. The best grill pans have low sides, sharp grates, and a round shape., Brush the oil and liquid smoke over both sides of each steak. Season both sides with smoked salt and freshly ground black pepper, as well.


Ideally, the steaks should be at room temperature before you season them. Cold steaks may cook unevenly and could dry out.
Both the liquid smoke and smoked salt will give the meat a smoky flavor, thereby mimicking the taste of outdoor barbecue.

, Remove the pan from the oven and place it on the stove. Set the stove heat to high, and allow the pan to warm up for another 4 to 5 minutes.


Meanwhile, reduce the heat of the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (175 degrees Celsius).

, Place the steaks in the hot pan and let them cook for 2 to 4 minutes. After finishing the first side, flip the steaks over to the other side and cook for another 2 to 4 minutes.


The steaks are ready to flip once a golden-brown crust develops on the first side. Also note that the meat should release easily from the bottom of the pan.
Only flip the steaks once. Turning them too often will make it harder for the outside to crisp up.

, Switch off the stove and place the pan back into the hot oven.

, Allow the steaks to continue cooking until they reach your desired level of doneness. The exact amount of time will vary depending on the thickness of the steaks and the level of doneness you wish to reach, but the process may take another 8 to 15 minutes.Check the internal temperature using a meat thermometer to verify the level of doneness.

Rare: 120 to 125 degrees Fahrenheit (49 to 52 degrees Celsius)
Medium-Rare: 130 to 135 degrees Fahrenheit (54 to 5 degrees Celsius)
Medium: 140 to 145 degrees Fahrenheit (60 to 63 degrees Celsius)
Medium-Well: 150 to 155 degrees Fahrenheit (66 to 68 degrees Celsius)
Well-Done: 160 degrees Fahrenheit (71 degrees Celsius)



, Remove the finished steaks from the hot oven and take them out of the hot pan. Place the meat on a plate or platter, then allow it to rest for approximately 5 minutes.


The resting period allows the juices to redistribute throughout the meat. Cutting into the steak before it rests can cause these juices to escape, creating dry, chewy steak as a result.
If desired, you could loosely cover the steaks with aluminum foil to prevent them from losing too much heat. Do not leave them in the pan, though, since doing so would cause the meat to continue cooking.

, The steaks should be done and ready to enjoy. Moreover, you should notice a flavor similar to the taste of outdoor barbecue once you bite into the meat.

Know the bugs to avoid when searching for food.",How to Eat an Insect or Arachnid1," The best place to find an edible bug is a dark, damp spot like the underside of a fallen tree or rocks on the edge of a stream. While it requires a bit of trial and error, this is by far the easiest way to capture insects and arachnids for food. As long as you move quickly, you can catch plenty of edible insects, including:


crickets
pillbugs
larva
dragon and damselflies
beetles
termites
ants
centipedes.;
, Termites are the second-most eaten insect in the world, and for good reason. They are naturally defenseless, plentiful, and nutritious. They are also easy to find, making their home in any dead wood and eating until there is nothing left. Turn over logs and fallen trees and harvest as many of the small white bugs as you can.


In the drier climates of Africa and Asia, termites often form enormous mounds that are easy to break open and harvest., This is especially helpful when catching bugs over water, or low-flying bugs like butterflies and moths. Once you've surrounded the bug, you can close the two sticks together to trap the insect. For a bigger net, tie your shirt between the two poles, then sweep it across the surface of the water to round up the insects and grab them tightly.Moths, butterflies, and dragonflies are all viable sources of protein.

, If you run across an ant mound, you've hit the jackpot. Take a thin, straight stick and stab it into the top of the mound. You'll quickly notice the ants swarming around it, climbing and covering it after a few minutes. Once it's covered to your liking, removed the stick and wipe the ants off into a container.


The only ants to avoid are the bright red fire ants. The rest are edible, though most people find them sour and unpleasant when they are uncooked., Crickets, grasshoppers, moths, and butterflies are all much easier to catch if you can stun them first. A young tree sapling with a bushy, leafy top acts like a large flyswatter, knocking bugs out of the air and temporarily stunning them. Cut down a young tree or a long branch with a wide, leafy top, then use it in an open field or meadow to trap the insects before they can fly off., There is little reason to dig into an insect mound by hand, as it is dangerous and impractical. Instead, stab deeply into the mound and upturn it, causing the bugs to scatter. Any long, reasonably thick branch will work. Once you've cleared a space, you can quickly reach in and snag the precious food inside. You should also dig into damp, loose soil underneath fallen trees and use your stick to break apart rotting wood.


White and plump larva or maggots are nutritious, if unappealing, insects that will hardly move when disturbed. Search them out in damp soil or rotting wood.

, Both of these big arachnids are delicacies across the world and taste a bit like crab. The biggest hurdle when catching them is avoiding a sting, so use a long, thin stick or skewer to get them from a distance. Be sure to remove the stinger before eating and cooking.In general, you want to avoid any smaller arachnids, like spiders or scorpions, unless you have no other options. They have minimal nutritional value and are more likely to contain toxins.

, An old Japanese tradition, smoking out hives is difficult but rewarding. You can use a big, smoky fire to remove the dangerous adults and get to the larva inside. Build a normal fire, then create a lot of smoke with young or fresh wood, leaves, or branches and place it directly under the hive. After 1-2 hours, once you no longer see wasps entering and existing, remove the hive to harvest the rich larva inside.Adult bees and wasps are edible raw or cooked as well, as long as you remove the stingers first.

, Most bugs are edible, and even more are easily eaten when cooked properly. In the wilderness, however, it is better to be safe than sorry. Since there are so many insects available, it should not be difficult to avoid the following:


Disease-carrying bugs like ticks, mosquitoes, or flies.
Brightly colored bugs, specifically red, yellow, or orange insects.
Hairy or furry bugs, with the exception of tarantulas and bees.
Foul-smelling insects.
Bugs found near foul-smelling waters or animal carcasses, with the exception of maggots."

Skewer and roast bigger bugs over an open flame.",How to Eat an Insect or Arachnid2," While you usually can eat bugs raw without consequence, there is always the risk of parasites or diseases when eating raw insects. Furthermore, cooking insects and arachnids before eating almost always improves the flavor and texture, making them much easier to get down if you're squeamish. Depending on your equipment and scenario, you can:


Boil them for 1-3 minutes.
Fry them in oil for 2-3 minutes, or until crunchy.
Heat them over an open flame for 3-5 minutes.
Roast them on hot coals for 3-5 minutes.

, The simplest and safest way to serve insects in the wild, boiling for a few minutes will kill any possible parasites and toxins. Simply drop the bugs in boiling water for a few minutes, depending on size, and then remove and eat. Smaller bugs, like ants, only need a minute or less, while larger bugs like tarantulas and grasshoppers could use 2-3 minutes.


Drop in a ""test bug"" to see how long you should cook the insects if you are unsure.

, If you've got some cooking oil, they'll be even better, but it isn't necessary. Simply cook them for 2-3 minutes until they are crispy and easier to eat.

, Make sure that the leaves are still fresh and green so that they don't catch fire quickly. Simply roll up the insects into a homemade pouch and leave them over the heat for several minutes until crunchy. If possible, turn them after 1-2 minutes to cook evenly. In total, they shouldn't need more than 4-5 minutes to cook.If you don't have any cooking gear, this can be an effective way to cook smaller insects, like ants or termites. Create a small pouch with your leaves and dump the little bugs in, alive or dead. They will cook quickly in the extreme heat of the fire., This is likely the quickest and easiest way to cook up bigger bugs like moths, grasshoppers, and beetles. Simply use a long, thin stick to skewer the bugs, like marshmallows, and toast them over the fire for 3-4 minutes."

If you live in the country and are far from farms or neighbors, you might be okay. In general, however, it is best to order edible bugs online or from a specialty market.

, Cricket flour is quickly gaining popularity as a high-protein substitute for wheat. It is also a good way to incorporate bugs into your diet without having to look the bugs ""in the eyes"" while eating. In general, you still need traditional flours when baking, but you can swap out roughly ½ to ⅓ of the flour for cricket flour. You can buy it online, or make your own:


Freeze the crickets overnight to kill them.
Dry the crickets in a dehydrator or bake them in the oven at the lowest temperature until crispy.
Grind the crickets into a fine powder using a food processor., This Mexican dish (known as ""chapulines"") is served on its own as a snack or mixed into salads and dishes that need some extra crunch. Use a little bit of oil to crisp up the outside of the bug, then season with some salt, chili powder, and fresh-squeezed lime.


Chapulines are often seasoned and used in tacos, or served with eggs.
Grasshoppers are perhaps the most common insect you can cook, and can be served in a variety of ways., Roast the bugs at 350 degrees for 10-15 minutes, until crunchy. Some chefs simply add the bugs to their normal dishes, like salads and slaws. Others have gotten inventive, using the nutty flavor to their advantage in cookies and pies, where they can substitute for pecans or pistachios., Both bugs are full of meat and are easily prepared and eaten. Start by removing the stingers -- the back of the tail for the scorpion and the abdomen (the ""butt"") of the spider. Then singe off any hairs on the legs using a lighter or creme brulee butane torch. You can then deep-fry the bugs in hot oil, with or without a batter on the outside. Cook them for roughly 1-2 minutes, until crispy, then serve with salt and garlic powder., Slugs and snails can, and will, eat a variety of plants that are toxic to humans. These toxins stick around if not purged and will make you sick. If you're looking to up your escargot game, you need to fatten up the snails on cornmeal for a week before cooking. Place them in a container with 1-2 tablespoons of cornmeal, allowing them to eat for a week until they have flushed out the toxins.You may also use steel-cut oats, or other fine grains, as food. For snails, you may want to put in leaves and bark from plants you know are non-toxic.

Serve the ham.",How to Bake a Ham," Most hams that you buy at the grocery store have already been cooked or partially cooked, which means that you'll essentially be reheating the ham rather then cooking it from scratch. It is possible to buy raw ham (also known as fresh ham), but it is not common. Buying a precooked ham will save you a lot of cooking time, and many of them come pre-sliced and with a glaze provided.


Pork is a particularly risky kind of meat to undercook - more likely dangerous than undercooked beef and bigger and harder to cook through than chicken. Pre-slicing any meat can get pathogens on the outside into the inside where they are harder to cook. And cooked, sealed meat is semi-sterilized to last longer. So don't get a raw ham unless you are ready to prepare it carefully, including with a meat thermometer to ensure it is cooked through (recommendations vary from 140 to 160 degrees F). A cooked one need only be reheated to taste (and should not be overheated to avoid overcooking).
You can buy hams with the bone-in or the bone removed. Bone-in hams are slightly more flavorful and make a dramatic dinner table centerpiece for any special occasions. They can be a little harder to cut than hams with the bone removed, however many brands spiral-cut their bone-in hams in advance, to overcome this problem. Spiral-cut hams are very easy to serve, but may become drier during cooking.
In terms of weight, you can calculate the number of portions a ham will provide using the following quantities: For a bone-in ham, allow a minimum of 3/4 of a pound of weight per person; for a boneless ham, allow 1/4 pound of weight per person. This is because a bone-in ham provides less meat that a boneless one.The bone with little bits of meat on it can be reused to flavor and add bits of texture to a soup, but it has little substance and value compared to the same quantity of solid meat.


A sliced ham that looks like a whole ham is normally ""spiral sliced"" in a helical pattern perpendicular to the bone, most of the way to the narrow end, so the meat comes off in large thin sheets parallel to the cut end. A little finishing and recovery of final bits with a knife is still needed. Spiral slicing is very convenient, more precise than most amateurs can do, makes a nice presentation, and allows access to the interior of the ham for extra flavoring. But it can let the outer part of the meat dry, so wrapping for much of the cooking process is especially important. And, in letting some moisture out to the surface, it can hinder browning the outside and caramelizing a glaze: finish off cooking with high heat and a dense glaze for the best outer appearance, texture and flavor. Finally, handle and lift gently, as a mass, to reduce premature falling off the bone.
Always read the label accompanying the ham. This will help you to determine whether it is fresh or preserved and whether it has or has not been precooked. This information will help you to determine the proper cooking procedures for your ham.;
, Ham must be stored properly to prevent the growth of bacteria on the ham. You can keep your ham in refrigerator at a temperature of 40 °F (4 °C) or lower. Boneless ham can be stored in the refrigerator at this temperature for up to a week, while bone-in hams (such as the rump or shank portions) will keep for up to two weeks. If you're using raw ham, it will only last in the refrigerator for 3-5 days after the sell-by date.


If you are buying your ham well in advance of the date you intend to cook it, your best option would be to freeze it, making sure it is well-wrapped or vacuum packed. Uncooked ham will keep for up to 6 months in the freezer, while cooked ham will keep for two, before the freezing begins to affect the flavor and quality of the meat.Once you decide to thaw your meat, be sure to do so in a safe, correct manner. Ham should never be thawed at room temperature, on your kitchen counter-top, as the outer layers of meat will defrost and become a breeding ground for bacteria, while the center remains frozen.
To thaw frozen ham correctly, you can either place the ham on a dish in the refrigerator to thaw the ham slowly (4-7 hours depending on the size of the roast) or place the bag in a water-tight bag and submerge it in cold water for a faster defrost (approximately 30 minutes per pound of meat).,


Remove and discard any packaging from the ham. If the ham is precooked in a factory-sealed pouch, retain the flavorful liquid for basting and/or dressing: cut open the big side of the package facing up, lift out the ham, and pour out the liquid into a container. Set it aside in a refrigerator. Because it has sat in meat for days, best to heat it to cooking temperatures before consuming.
Optionally, score a non-presliced ham. (Cross-scoring will chip apart a presliced one.) then place it - fatty side up - on a chopping board. Score the ham with a sharp knife, making a diamond pattern. The slices should be about 1/4 to 1/2 an inch deep, with each parallel line about 1 1⁄2 inches (3.8 cm) apart.You should not cut into the meat itself when scoring, just into the layers of skin and fat. This will allow the flavors from the glazing to seep into the meat, while also producing a decorative effect.
Traditionally, a clove is inserted into the center of each diamond for flavor and decoration. Just make sure to remove the cloves before eating because they are hard and strongly flavored. If you find the clove flavor too strong, you can use bits of dried fig instead (these will caramelize deliciously onto the ham during baking). You can also dust on ground spices. With clove, a little goes a long way!
Some people prefer to trim away the extra layers of fat and skin before cooking the ham, but this is not necessary and roasted fat can add mouth-feel, flavor and appearance and reduce drying of the meat within. So better to leave the normal thin covering of fat.
Optionally, flavor the interior of the ham. Ham is tasty as-is, generally is cured with some salt, and may have been smoked. But sweet and spicy flavors throughout rather than just on the edge and seeping into the surface can add a lot. Spiral slicing adds an easy to way to get them in! Or, try a marinade injector syringe, but ham's dense texture reduces diffusion and shows punctures.

One tasty recipe is as follows: mix one cup honey, half a teaspoon cinnamon, and a quarter teaspoon of cloves in a mug or glass cup; microwave to a bubble (very hot and sticky; don't burn yourself) to extract and mix their flavors; and smear lightly between the spiral slices, rotating to get all sides (a silicone baking brush works well and is easy to clean thoroughly). A truly ""honey baked"" ham! Dessert baking spices tend to work well (check warehouse, discount and ethnic stores and sections for fair prices), as might extremely sour juices, preferably concentrated.

Do not put pineapple products that have not been cooked thoroughly to destroy their enzymes inside the ham. They will tenderize it into mush.



, Line the pan with aluminum foil first, as this will make the clean-up easier, as well as helping to catch any juice from the meat. Place the ham fat side up and leave uncovered. The fat from the top of the meat will melt and run down the sides of the ham, helping to baste it in the process.Some chefs recommend adding half a cup of white wine to the base of the pan before baking, to prevent the ham from sticking. You can also use water or juice if you don't want to use wine.
Alternatively, wrap the ham in aluminum foil to keep it moist and let retained vapor's heating condensation speed through most of the warming (or cooking) process. Set it cut end down in the middle of a long sheet of aluminum foil in a pan. Bend up the edges to form a trough, then join the ends over the top and bring the sides together. Put another piece over the top and sides first to cover the entire thing if needed. Wrap it around the in-oven or remote-reading meat thermometer (or punch that through) if you're using one.

, If it did, then prepare the glaze following the directions on the package if you like. Set aside for later.

, There are an endless amount of homemade glaze recipes out there - which one you choose depends on your personal preferences - whether you like your ham sweet and succulent or herby and slightly spiced! Some simple, yet delicious suggestions are outlined below. The key ingredient is sugar, which can caramelize to a crunch. Heat, such as a microwave's, will help mix it up with less water (careful!). A little corn syrup or honey can prevent excess crystallization; too much can make it gooey. To keep the glaze from running off under heat before it binds to the surface, add a teaspoon or so per cup of corn syrup, mixing it in cold, and finishing dissolution to a clear gel warm.



Make a mustard and brown sugar glaze: Mix equal amounts of honey mustard and brown sugar. 1/4 cup of each is a good measurement to go by, though this will vary depending on the size of the ham.

Make an orange and pear juice glaze: Mix 3/4 cup each of pear juice and apple juice for a sweet, fruity glaze.

Make a brown sugar and maple syrup or honey glaze: Mix equal amounts of brown sugar and honey or maple syrup. Use about a 3/4 cup of each, depending on the size of the ham.

Make a raspberry preserve glaze: Mix a cup of raspberry preserve with 1/2 a cup of light corn syrup, stirring until well combined. You could also substitute the raspberry for another flavor preserve, depending on your tastes - apricot, cherry and orange marmalade are all good options.

Make a honey thyme glaze: In a saucepan over a medium heat, combine 3 tablespoons of butter, 2 tablespoons of freshly chopped thyme, 1/4 cup of cider vinegar, 1/4 cup of honey, a tablespoon of brown sugar and a teaspoon of Worcestershire sauce. Stir constantly until the butter has melted and the sugar has dissolved, then remove from the heat., Regardless of which glaze you choose to use, separate a third of it and set the rest aside for now. Use a pastry brush to apply the glaze to the top of the ham, making sure to work the glaze in between the scored lines.


You will keep the ham moist during cooking by continually brushing the meat with the reserved glaze at 20 minute intervals. In this way, all of the glaze should be used up by the end of the cooking time.
Be wary with sugar-based glazes as the sugar may start to burn on the surface of the ham before the ham is fully cooked. Keep a close eye on the color - if it starts to turn dark brown or black, make a ""tent"" from aluminum foil to cover the ham while it finishes cooking.
Alternatively, just heat the ham wrapped up and brown and glaze it at the end. Flavoring the ham between spiral slices will do best for the inside, and this method requires little maintenance.

, Set the temperature to 350ºF (180ºC) if using a conventional electric or gas oven. Set to 325ºF (170ºC) if using a convection oven.


A lower temperature such as 275 degrees will reduce drying for similar interior warming time (the outside can't heat past boiling to conduct heat in faster, but will just let out more steam at higher heat) but is not conducive to browning and glazing.

, The amount of cooking time will depend on the size off the ham and whether it has been pre-cooked or not. Follow the guidelines below for cooking times:


Bake a partially- or fully-cooked preserved ham for 10 minutes per pound (0.5 kg) to reheat the ham completely through.
Bake a preserved ham that has not been precooked at all for 20 minutes per pound (0.5 kg).
Bake a fresh bone-in ham for 20 to 25 minutes per pound or a fresh boneless ham for 30 to 35 minutes per pound (0.5 kg).

, To add moisture and flavor to the ham, open the open door and baste the meat with additional glaze, along with any juices that have escaped.


A closely wrapped ham will not need basting and should not be opened prematurely.

, You can do this by inserting a meat thermometer into the ham which stays there during cooking, or by using an instant read thermometer once the ham is cooked. When the thermometer reads 160ºF Fahrenheit (71ºC), the ham is done.


When using a thermometer to test the temperature of a bone-in ham, make sure that the thermometer is not touching the bone, as this will affect the reading and give an inaccurate result.
Note that if a ham has been fully pre-cooked, it is okay to remove the meat from the oven once it reaches a lower temperature of between 110º to 120º F, as you are simply reheating it for eating., Take the ham in its pan out of the oven, or work quickly. Open up the aluminum foil on top. Increase the oven temperature to 450 °F (232 °C). Once the outside is not wet looking, which should only take a few minutes, brush or spoon the ham with a dense, sugary glaze. Watch through the oven door or open and check periodically for some caramelization. A little underdone is much better than a burnt surface.

, Let the ham rest, covered in aluminum foil, for at least 15 minutes before carving. This will allow the ham to finish cooking, while also letting the meat settle, making it easier to carve. (Do not pour pan drippings over the outside of a sugar glazed ham. They won't get in and will tend to wash off the glaze.)

, The pan drippings can be tasty on ham, but a denser sauce can be even better. Pork is very light for a heavy, greasy, floury sauce. Try combining the pan drippings, the liquid that came with a sealed precooked ham (if applicable), a half-teaspoon of cinnamon, a quarter-teaspoon of clove, a small can of pineapple juice, and a teaspoon of corn starch, stirred and heated to clarify the starch. This makes a lighter meaty-fruity sauce that won't run off entirely.

, Once the ham has finished resting, you can carve the ham, typically perpendicular to the bone, using a long sharp knife. If it's a bone-in ham, you should first cut around the bone to loosen the meat, then slice it thinly.


Do this off a fancy platter at the table for best presentation. The ham should be sideways or cut-side up on a heavy wire stand sold for this purpose.
Thin slices are best, to expose more tasty surface area and not emphasize ham's unusually dense texture.
A spiral sliced ham is so easy to cut even a child with a table knife can do it!
Alternatively, you can rest the meat on its side and cut a slice off the wide end to make a flat surface. Turn the ham so that it's sitting on this flat end and then cut long, thin slices down the length of the ham.Make sure to save the bone, which you can use to add great flavor to soups. If you won't use it immediately, wrap it in plastic to reduce desiccation.

, Place the ham on a serving plate and bring to the table for your guests to admire. Make sure to keep the leftovers for use in sandwiches, quiches, casseroles or whatever you like!


Leftover ham slices are tasty and different grilled, like thick-cut, low-fat bacon. Takes just a minute with a skillet before adding to cool lettuce, tomato, mustard, mayonnaise or other sandwich fixings or breakfast! Caramelization of a little sweet mixture added between spiral slices can make this even more delicious. Also a great way for initial serving to those who fundamentally dislike basic ham.

Sanitize your kitchen space.,
Examine each chitterling.,
Rinse and cut the chitterlings.,
Gather your basic ingredients.,
Bring your ingredients to a boil.,
Spice up your chitterlings.,
Clean and boil the chitterlings.,
Coat the chitterlings with batter.,
Fry the chitterlings.",How to Clean Chitterlings," You can find chitterlings at some supermarkets or purchase them directly from a butcher. Always buy about twice as many chitterlings than you want to end up with. Chitterlings shrink when boiled and cooked, so you'll end up with fewer chitterlings than you started with.You'll need to clean the chitterlings even if the kind you purchase say they've been pre-cleaned.;
, Children are at a higher risk for bacterial disease that can be spread by raw chitterlings. Minimize their risk of illness by having another person care for them while you clean the chitterlings.Avoid touching or holding your baby while handling the raw chitterlings to prevent spreading bacteria.
You should also take care to clean any baby bottles, kid food storage, or place mats that may come into contact with the chitterlings.

, To begin cleaning your chitterlings, place them in a large pot with fresh water. Bring the chitterlings to a boil over high heat. Boil the chitterlings for 5 minutes. Boiling the chitterlings kills bacteria in the chitterlings. Wash your hands immediately after handling the raw chitterlings.If you're using frozen chitterlings, thaw them before cleaning them.

, As the chitterlings boil, prepare a sanitizing mixture. In a large bucket, combine 1 tablespoon of bleach with 1 gallon of water. Dip a clean wash cloth in the sanitizer and wipe down everything in the kitchen that came into contact with the raw chitterlings.You can also pour some of the sanitizer into a clean spray bottle. Spray down kitchen surfaces and use a clean dry cloth the wipe the surfaces clean.

, Drain the boiled chitterlings into a large colander in your sink. Once the chitterlings are cool enough to handle, sort through each chitterling and look for foreign materials (like straw, skin,or hair), undigested food, and fecal matter. Throw away any of this debris.


Wear oven mitts and be careful when handling boiling water.

, Rinse the chitterlings with lots of cool water so that any debris is washed away. Do this for several minutes or until the chitterlings are completely clean. Cut or tear the chitterlings into large pieces.While you can cut the chitterlings to any size you'd like, most people cut them in 1/2"" to 1"" pieces.
Remember to sanitize your kitchen again after handling the raw chitterlings. Don't forget to wash the colander and your sink., Most chitterling recipes call for boiling chitterlings with water, vinegar, and onion for several hours. For a basic flavorful chitterling recipe, you'll need:10 pounds of cleaned chitterlings
1 medium to large onion, chopped or sliced
1 to 1 1/2 cups of white vinegar
A few tablespoons of ground pepper or lemon pepper
1/4 cup of fresh lemon juice
2 cloves of fresh garlic or a few dashes of garlic powder
Seasoning salt
A few dashes of soy sauce

, Put all of your ingredients in a large pot. You can use a soup pot or a large cast iron pot. Just make sure that it has a lid. Add enough water to cover the top of your chitterlings. Cover the pot and boil the chitterlings for three hours. Serve the chitterlings immediately or you can cover and refrigerate them to serve later.


Check the pot every once in a while and add more water if the chitterlings begin to dry out. They should always be covered with water.

, While the most basic chitterlings recipe is just water, onions, vinegar, and chitterlings, you can easily add unique flavors or ingredients to make your own personal chitterlings recipe. Consider adding some of the following ingredients before you boil the chitterlings:Red pepper flakes
Jalapeno peppers
Celery
Bell pepper
Bay leaf
Creole seasoning
One potato, whole or sliced

, Clean the chitterlings and cook the chitterlings by boiling them with an onion and seasonings. Cook the chitterlings until they're tender (about 2 hours). Rinse them under cold running water.You'll need to pre-cook your chitterlings before frying them. This will ensure they're safe to eat and tender before you fry them.

, Create a batter by beating 1 egg with 1 tablespoon of water in a shallow bowl. Place fine cracker crumbs in another shallow bowl. Dip each chitterling into the egg mixture. Lay the egg-coated chitterling in the cracker crumbs so it's completely coated.You can create dredging stations. On the counter next to the pot, set up the bowl with the egg mixture next to the bowl with the cracker crumbs.

, Heat several inches of oil in a large pot. Once the oil heats up to 370 degrees F, add several chitterlings to the oil. Fry the chitterlings until they're golden brown and crisp on the outside. Carefully remove the chitterlings from the oil and continue cooking the remaining chitterlings until they're all cooked and golden. Serve them immediately.Avoid cooking all of the chitterlings at once. This would lower the oil's temperature too quickly and the chitterlings wouldn't fry properly.

Know your cuts.,
Make time to brine or marinate.,
Prepare a dry rub.,
Know beforehand when to stop cooking.,
Store pork safely.",How to Cook Pork1," Generally, there are four basic parts of the pig that the most common cuts of meat come from (though many countries cut the meat differently and/or have their own names for particular cuts): the shoulder/hand, the loin, the belly/side and the leg/ham. The muscles surrounding the backbone are tender and lean (and usually more expensive!) because they aren't used as much by the pig as the muscles closer to the ground, which are tougher but more flavorful.Shoulder - Usually divided into the lower picnic shoulder and the upper Boston shoulder (also known as the Boston butt). These cuts need to be cooked with low heat and in gently simmering liquid (e.g. a slow cooker) in order to melt away the fat and connective tissue, but the result is tender and moist. Available as: boneless Boston shoulder roast, Boston shoulder roast, cubed pork for kebabs and stews, ground pork (the picnic).
Loin - This is where rib roasts, baby back ribs, tenderloin and the chops come from. Since these cuts are naturally tender, dry heat cooking methods (roasting, grilling, broiling, pan-frying and stir-frying) are best. Available as: blade roast, rib chop, loin chop, sirloin chop, sirloin roast, tenderloin.
Belly/side/spareribs - The spareribs can be grilled and then roasted, but the rest of this section is usually reserved for bacon. Available as: bacon, pancetta, spareribs.
Leg/ham - This cut is usually sold cured, cooked or smoked, but if you buy it fresh, you can glaze and score the rind and roast it (a popular option for holidays and special occasions). Available as: leg cutlet, smoked ham, top leg roast.
Other - If you're adventurous, there's a use for almost every part of the pig's body. You can boil the head for brawn (head cheese), stocks and soups, and fry or bake the ears for crunchy munching. Throw the hocks/trotters into long-cooked soups, stews and sauces to add body. The tail can also be eaten, as can the organs: pâté, small intestine sausages (chitterlings) and black pudding (blood filled digestive tract).;
, Since modern pigs are bred to be lean, the meat has less fat to keep it moist during cooking. Brining is a good solution for this, but it requires planning ahead. The meat sits in a mixture of salt and water and absorbs the water slowly through osmosis. You can also make a mouth-watering marinade for your pork by combining your favorite flavors and spices in an oil base, then letting the pork sit submerged in this mixture for several hours or overnight.


A general rule for marinades is to use about 1/4 cup of marinade per pound of pork or enough to cover the entire outside surface of the meat in a plastic refrigerator bag.
The bigger the cut, the more time it'll need to brine or marinate. Generally, cuts from the loin or belly region will need to marinate for several hours (up to 6 for large cuts). Shoulder roasts can take up to 24 hours or longer to fully marinate. Feel free to marinate your pork as long as want, however, make sure that you don't allow the pork to go bad by marinating for more than a day or two.

, Another popular way to flavor many types of meat is with a dry rub - a dry combination of salt, pepper, herbs, spices, and other (usually powdered or granulated) dry ingredients. The meat is coated with the dry rub either immediately before cooking or anywhere from a few hours to a day beforehand. Dry rubs don't help a piece of pork retain its moisture, but they do give it an intensely flavorful exterior, and, when expertly cooked, form a delicious ""crust.""


Common ingredients in dry rubs include salt, pepper (both red and black), powdered garlic and onion, ginger, rosemary, and, for a sweet, caramelized crust, white and/or brown sugar. Experiment with your favorite ingredients.
Generally, about 1/4 cup of dry rub is needed for each standard-sized cut of pork. If you're unsure, just make enough dry rub to completely cover the surface of each piece of meat.

, As with any meat, you want to cook long enough to kill any harmful micro-organisms, but not so long that you dry the meat out. The USDA recommends cooking pork to an internal temperature of 160 F (70 C) (use an instant-read meat thermometer in the center of the thickest part of the meat) but some cooks prefer to stop between 140 and 150 F to preserve juiciness, since the trichinosis parasite dies at 137 F.Remember to account for the fact that the internal temperature of bigger pieces keeps rising even after you take the meat off the heat. Don't let a good piece of meat ""overcook"" after you've finished cooking.
Pork cooked to 160 F (70 C) can sometimes remain pink in the center, depending on the cooking method or added ingredients. So don't assume that because it's pink, it's not safe to eat!

, When you buy raw pork, refrigerate it as quickly as possible to 40°F. If you don't cook it within 5 days, you must freeze it (0°F) or throw it away. Once you do cook it, eat it within two hours (or if the surrounding temperature is 90°F, within one hour), or store it in the fridge in shallow, covered containers for up to 4 days, or freeze it. For best quality, eat frozen pork within 3 months, and never refreeze partially defrosted pork. In general, though, thawing can dry out pork, so keep that in mind!

",How to Cook Spare Ribs," You may find the following types of rib:


Full slab of spare ribs. This cut is large, but contains a lot of extra bone, such as the rib tips and sternum. You will need to take into account that much of the weight you pay for will be thrown away because of the extra bones.
St. Louis rack. The butcher removes the rib tips and sternum portion, so that more of the cut you are buying is meaty. It is also more expensive.
Kansas City rack. The butcher removes rib tips, sternum and breast bone. This is the smallest rack and can be even more expensive per lb.;
, (453 g) of ribs per person. The bones mean that there is a lot less meat to go around than with other cuts of meat. Some people suggest 1.25 to 1.5 lbs. (566 to 680 g) per person.

, Most ribs are sold fresh, so it is better to wait to buy them until the day before you plan to cook them.

, They can season overnight.

, (20.7g) of smoked paprika, 2 tbsp.(16.2g) of ancho chile powder, 1.5 tbsp. (14g) of garlic powder, 1.5 tbsp. (10.8g) onion powder, 1 tbsp. (18g) salt and 1 tsp. (2.1g) cumin.

Heat your grill.,
Add your pork cuts to the grill when ready.,
Cook your pork on a colder region of the grill.,
Grill until the meat is done.,
Quickly sear the pork.,
Allow the meat to rest.,
Season and serve.",How to Cook Pork2," Grilling is a cooking method that uses direct, dry heat to heat meat on an array of closely-spaced metal bars called a grill. Grilling is a great choice for giving a mouthwatering crisp, seared crust to naturally-moist cuts of pork like chops or tenderloin. The most common types of grill are charcoal and gas grills. If you're using a charcoal grill (which takes time to reach cooking temperature), ignite your charcoal, then, as you're waiting for the charcoal to get an ash-covered, glowing appearance, portion out your pork cuts on a tray or platter so you'll be ready to immediately add them to the grill.


Gas grills reach ""ready"" temperature much more quickly than charcoal grills. However, they can give a slightly different flavor to the meat. Some people prefer the taste of charcoal grills, while others prefer the ease of gas grills.
Consider using natural hardwood or mesquite charcoal as opposed to the more-commonly used briquette form. Hardwood charcoal generally burns hotter and faster,which is handy for searing meat. Natural charcoal can also transfer some of its smoky, aromatic flavor to your meat as it cooks.
Particularly thick cuts of pork requires a longer, lower-temperature grilling process. In this case, conventional briquettes can be a better choice than hotter, quicker-burning hardwood charcoal.

, To prevent your meat from sticking to the grill, coat the bars of the grill with an oil that has a high smoke point (olive or grapeseed oil works well.) Do this by using a grill brush dipped in oil or by soaking a paper towel in oil, then pushing it across the grill with a pair of tongs or another long-handled tool. Then, place your pork cuts on the grill with tongs, arranging them so that they don't touch.


Avoid cross-contamination. Don't use any of the tools you use to place your pork on the grill to handle any other foods without washing them. Clean the container that held your uncooked pork cuts before using it for any other food. Don't allow uncooked pork to touch cooked pork.

, Contrary to popular belief, immediately searing a piece of meat does not ""seal in the moisture (or flavor.)"" In fact, rapidly seared pieces of meat are now believed to retain less moisture than pieces of meat that have been cooked more gradually.For charcoal grills, begin by arranging your pork around the edge of the grill, which is usually cooler than in the center. Gas grills should use a medium level of heat.


We will eventually sear the pork at the end of the grilling process. By waiting until the meat is already cooked to sear, we retain much of the meat's moisture.
Flip your pork cuts about once every minute or so. This ensures the meat is evenly-cooked. It will also help the meat to begin to develop an even crust.

, Keep the barbecue's lid closed while cooking to speed the cooking process. Thin cuts of pork will only need 4-5 minutes of cooking on hot grills, while larger pieces of meat will require longer, cooler cooking periods. ""Done"" pork should be uniformly firm to the touch with a browned outside, a whitish (not pink) interior, and juice that runs clear to brown (never red or pink.)


If you're unsure, use a meat thermometer. The USDA recommends an internal temperature of 160-170 degrees F (about 70 degrees C) for pork products. However, many prefer temperatures as low as 140 degrees C for juicier, rarer cuts of pork (see Method 1 for more information.)

, Before you remove your pork from the grill, give it a crispy, delicious crust. On charcoal grills, transfer the pork to the hottest part of the grill (usually the center). On gas grills, simply turn the heat to ""high."" Cook the pork this way for less than a minute on each side - you don't want to burn the meat or dry it out.


The chemical process that creates the flavorful seared crust is called the Maillard Reaction. Partially burning the outside of a piece of meat causes the meat's amino acids to react with sugars to form flavor compounds. In practice, this process simply means that a meat's seared crust tastes great!

, Remove done pieces of pork from the grill, placing them on a clean platter. Cover the meat with aluminum foil to keep it from cooling, then allow the meat to sit for about five to ten minutes. Use this rest time to put the finishing touches on any companion dishes (or to set your table.)


Allowing the meat to rest serves two purposes. First, most cuts of meat continue to cook even after they've been removed from the grill - your pork is no exception. If you're on the fence about whether your pork is done or not, giving it time to sit can often provide the extra ""push"" it needs to be definitively done. Second, it allows the pork to re-absorb some of the moisture lost during the cooking process. As a piece of meat cooks, it shrinks and ""tightens"" on a molecular level, squeezing moisture out of the meat.A few minutes of rest allows the meat to partially ""relax"" and retain more moisture.

, After the meat has rested and re-absorbed some of its moisture, it's ready to eat! Season gently with salt, pepper, or any other of your favorite spices. Serve with the bone in or with it removed.


Grilled pork goes great with starches like sweet potatoes or typical barbecue sides like coleslaw.

Bread your pork chops.,
Heat oil in a pan.,
Add your breaded pork chops to the pan.,
Cook the chops over medium-high heat until they're golden-brown.,
Remove the pork from the heat.,
Carefully dispose of excess oil.",How to Cook Pork3," Fried pork chops are a rich, delicious treat. Their golden-brown crust, a result of their being coated with a flavorful breading before frying, is as eye-catching as it is flavorful. To begin cooking this scrumptious dish, bread your pork chops (note - thin cut pork chops are preferable for their quick cooking time.) Completely coat each pork chop with flour, dust it off so that its coating is thin and even, then dip it in beaten eggs. Allow the egg to briefly drain off of your chop. Finally, toss your pork in a store-bought or prepared breading of your choice.


There are a variety of options when choosing your breading. Many supermarkets sell pre-packaged bread crumbs (Panko, etc.). You can use these by themselves or, for a custom flavor, season with your favorite spices, salt, and/or pepper. You can even make your own breading out of normal breadcrumbs.
The breading doesn't have to be the only source of flavor - dry seasonings like cayenne pepper and paprika can be also be added to the flour.

, For frying, it's best to add meat directly to a hot pan, not to add meat to a cold pan, then heat. Add one half cup of an oil with a high smoke point (like olive or grapeseed oil) to a frying pan or skillet. Swirl the pan to evenly coat the inside of the pan with oil. Turn the stove's burner to ""high"" and allow the oil to heat for a minute or two. Carefully add a tablespoon or two of butter to the hot oil - it will help give the pork chops a crispy brown crust.


The oil is hot enough when meat audibly sizzles when it touches it.

, Be careful - a hot oily pan can erupt with sizzling and crackling when meat is added. The sizzle sounds tremendously satisfying, but it's often accompanied by small splashes of hot oil. Use a pair of tongs to safely adjust your pork chops.

, The exact cooking time will differ based on the size and thickness of your pork chops. Thin-cut chops will only need a few minutes per side, while thick slices can require 5 minutes or more. Allow each side to develop a rich, deep golden brown color. Well-fried chops should be crispy on the outside while tender on the inside.


Normal rules for judging pork's doneness apply: use a fork and knife to check for meat that's white all the way through with clear to brown juices.

, As with other methods of cooking, pork will continue to cook after it's removed from the skillet. Move done pork chops to a plate lined with a paper towel (which will absorb excess oil, helping to prevent the pork chops from getting soggy.) Allow the pork to rest for several minutes, then serve and enjoy!


A cool, lightly-dressed salad compliments the hot crispiness of the pork chops perfectly.

, Don't pour fry oil down the drain - this can clog your sink. Instead, let your oil cool, then transfer it to a jar or plastic container. Keep your oil in the fridge, where it will solidify. Use your oil for future recipes or for a variety of other purposes that require grease.

Preheat your oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).,
Season your spareribs.,
Briefly brown your spareribs in a pan.,
In the same pan, sauté onions and garlic.,
Add a braising liquid to the pan.,
Place the spareribs in a cooking pan.,
Braise for about 2-3 hours.,
Remove and serve.",How to Cook Pork4," Braising is a long, slow cooking method that leaves meat so moist and tender that it's practically falling apart. Because of this, it's ideal for tougher cuts. In this recipe, we'll use a braising process to give some pork spareribs a juicy meat-falls-off-the-bone texture. As with all oven-based cooking methods, begin by pre-warming your oven.

, Pour one cup of flour into a dish and season with salt and pepper to taste. Turn the spareribs in the flour mixture, dusting them off to ensure no excess flour remains. The flour mixture will add a nice savory flavor to your meat and help it develop a brown crust in the next step.

, Heat a few tablespoons of oil in a skillet, then add your spareribs and sear over high heat for a few minutes. Don't cook your spareribs all the way through - just give them a crisp brown exterior. The interior of the meat will slowly cook in the oven over several hours while braising. When the spareribs are brown, set aside.


Your meat doesn't even have to appear visibly done when you take it out of the pan - as long as it has a crisp, brown exterior, it's ready to go into the oven.

, Adding vegetables to this dish will give the final product a complex, delicious flavor. Chop one medium sized onion and a few cloves of garlic into medium-sized bits, then sauté them until they're just translucent.

, Braising is a cooking process that partially resembles stewing. When we braise the meat, we'll cook it slowly in a soupy mixture - like a stew. Beef stock will be our base liquid - begin by adding two cups of beef stock to the pan. Modify this base with a few ounces of other liquid flavors - red wine vinegar, for instance is a good choice - and simmer in the pan to reduce the mixture, concentrating the flavor.


When it comes to flavoring your braising liquid, there's countless choices. Stout beer, red wine, and tomato puree all taste great. Powdered ingredients like paprika and garlic salt also work well. Don't be afraid to test your broth by tasting it. Generally, if it tastes good, so will your meat!

, Pour your beef stock mixture over the top of your spareribs, evenly coating them. Cover the pan with foil and transfer to a rack in the center of your oven.

, Every hour, turn your spareribs. Exact cooking times will vary. Luckily, braised meat will only dry out if it's left in the oven well past its done point. After an hour and a half, periodically test your ribs for doneness with a fork. The meat should be quite soft and easy to to pull apart. The inside may appear slightly stringy.

, Immediately transfer your moist, juicy spareribs to a plate and serve. If you desire, use leftover liquid from the cooking pan as a gravy, generously basting your spareribs.


This dish is a fantastic compliment to fluffy mashed potatoes, as the potatoes will absorb the liquid (and thus the flavor) that leaks from the spareribs.

Select your steak.,
Prepare your steak for cooking.,
Prepare your oven and pan.,
Lightly grease your broiler pan with cooking spray.,
Broil your steak.,
Determine whether or not your steak is done.,
Remove your steak from the oven and let it rest.,
Serve it up and enjoy!








",How to Broil Steak," At the grocery store or butcher's shop, choose a steak that is well-marbled (meaning there are several thin veins of fat running through the meat) and is a rich, red color (raw beef that is a brownish color is beginning to get old or has freezer burn).








Broiling will work best on medium-thickness cuts, so choose a steak that is less than an inch and a quarter thick. If your steak is too thick, the outside will burn before the inside warms through enough.
A good, inexpensive cut that will still give you tender, juicy steak (especially if marinated) is a flank steak. If you don't see any in the display case at the grocery store, feel free to ask the butcher if he has any in the back. Top sirloins will also give you great results if you're willing to spend a little more, and are easier to find at discount grocers like Walmart.;
, The way you prepare your steak depends on the type of cut you have selected, as well as your personal preference. You could simply season your steak with salt, pepper, or go heavy on the flavors with a rich marinade.









If your steak is a very high quality cut of beef (e.g., a tenderloin (fillet) or New York steak), a rub with coarse salt and pepper is all you need. The steak will have its own amazing flavor that won’t need the help of other seasonings. However, if seasoning is your thing, try add a dash of garlic or a hint of rosemary.
For tougher cuts, such as a round or flank steak, a marinade can help make it more flavorful and tender. Soak the beef for an hour or more in a sauce that contains a combination of acids (e.g., vinegar) and salt(or soy sauce). This will help break down the tough meat fibers and will infuse the steak with flavor. Place the steak in a shallow dish or bowl, cover it in the marinade, and cover the dish with a lid or plastic wrap.
If you choose to marinate your steak,you should do so in the fridge (40°F (4.5°C) or below) to prevent foodborne illness if you are marinating for more than 30 minutes. Let the steak rest on the counter for 20 to 30 minutes to get to room temperature just before cooking for best results.

, Once your steak is ready to cook, set it aside. Adjust your oven rack so that the top of the steak will be about 4 inches (10cm) from the broiler heating element. Then turn the oven on to ""broil"" and preheat at 350f.









If you don’t know where your broiler is, check both the bottom and the top of your oven. Most electric ovens have a broiler in their ‘ceiling’ but some older gas models have separate units under the main part of the stove that acts as their broiler.If you like your steak cooked past medium, a good trick is to let the steak come to room temp, then stick it in the freezer while the oven preheats. The 5-10 min in the freezer before hitting the oven allows the outside of the steak to cook a little slower, allowing you to cook the interior to well without overcooking the exterior of the steak.

, Broiler pans look like a cookie sheet, with an inset 'grill' top put on them that has slots on it for juices to drip down below to the cookie sheet. Place your steak on the broiler pan, allowing the excess marinade to drain. Do not use Pyrex or glass cookware for broiling. They cannot handle the high heat and will break.








Note that a broiler pan is best for broiling foods, but that you can also use a shallow baking dish (lined with foil for easier cleanup) or cast-iron pan if you don't have one. The downside to using a non-draining surface is that the fats that excrete off of your steak as it cooks will pool around its edges and possibly cause it to burn. To avoid this, try moving the steak to a different area of the pan with less fat as it cooks. Be careful--that grease is hot!


, Place your steak into the oven on the rack closest to the broiler. Cooking times will vary greatly based on the cut of steak, cooking altitude, type of oven you're using, and how hot the broiler runs; cooking times can range from 3 to 18 minutes. A good rule of thumb to go by is to watch it! If it looks ""done"" on one side, flip it over with tongs. Remember to always use oven mitts when reaching into the oven.









In general, the most common cooking time is four minutes on one side, and then four minutes on the other. Of course, as each cut of steak is different, it is always best to simply determine the cooking time for yourself.

, There are several tests you can do to figure out how ""done"" a steak is. Of course, your definition of ‘done’ might be barely cooked (ie. very rare.) while someone else’s definition might be cooked until it is bone dry. The easiest way to tell who done a steak is to cut into the thickest part of the steak and check the color. A rare steak will still be blood red and have red juices; a medium steak will be pink and have almost clear juices; a well-done steak will be brownish gray and have brown juices. Other methods include:









Check the edges. If you have a thicker steak, the color of the edges is often a good way to tell how done the middle is. When the edges change from red to pink to brown, the inside is probably moving from rare to medium rare to medium.
Test the ""fleshiness."" Pinch the flesh stretching between your thumb and forefinger--the muscled part, not just the skin--with your other thumb and forefinger. Can you feel how it's firm, but supple? How it gives under pressure, but bounces back? That's the way the middle of a medium-cooked steak feels. To test for this, prod the steak with your tongs or the flat edge of a knife (don't pierce it with a fork). Test to see if it ""wiggles"" or not. If it still feels too fleshy, give it another minute or two.Listen to it. When the outside of a steak goes from cooked to overcooked, the sound of the sizzling will become louder and sharper.

, Remove the broiler pan from the oven and test the steak once more for doneness. If it's cooked to your liking, don't be tempted to cut it up immediately! Letting a piece of meat ""rest"" for a few minutes before slicing it is the number one way to make sure it stays juicy. Wait until most of the steam from the steak has slowed and the juices stop running off--usually around 4 or 5 minutes--before digging in.









Of course, some people simply can’t wait--which is fine too! Digging in immediately won’t ruin the steak--but it may burn your mouth! Use caution.

, Breads, muffins, granola bars, and other grain-based baked goods are simple receptacles for a few chia seeds.


If added before baking, the seeds develop a toasted flavor and may settle into the batter or dough. If added afterwards, do so while the baked good is still warm to enable the seed to attach itself firmly to the product.
Cobblers and streusels can easily incorporate a small handful of chia seeds with little noticeable impact on flavor, even for sweet dishes.

, Yogurt and ice cream can benefit from the nutty flavor and added texture of chia seeds as a topping.


If you prefer fruit-based jams or syrups with yogurt or ice cream, try stirring chia seeds into the fruit topping to blend them instead of sprinkling the chia seeds as a separate topping.

, Chia seeds can be used like nuts or sunflower seeds in regular salads. They can also be mixed in with salad dressing just prior to serving.

Replace eggs or oil with chia seed gel.,
Use chia seeds as a thickener.,
Bind ingredients with chia seeds.,
Replace oats or pudding mixes with chia seeds.",How to Make Recipes With Chia Seeds2," Mixing a tablespoon of chia seeds with ¼ cup of water will provide about the equivalent of a single egg or quarter cup of oil for a recipe. Most recipes can tolerate about a 25% substitution of chia seeds for eggs or oil without a noticeable alteration in flavor.


This technique can also help stretch eggs for omelets and soufflés. Just prepare about a quarter of your egg needs by mixing in chia seeds and milk into the beaten eggs about 10 minutes before cooking them.

, Because chia seeds form a gel in liquid, they can be added to soups, stews, sauces, and marinades to help thicken the liquid in place of corn starch or flour.


Chia seeds can also be blended into juice smoothies to add the thicker texture normally provided by whole fruits or yogurt.
If you have accidentally added too much liquid to a recipe, including baked goods, adding chia seeds can thicken the dough by absorbing the excess liquid.

, Meatballs and meatloaf can be held together with chia seeds and a bit of water once mixed with the ground meat. Jellies, jams, and compotes can also benefit from the gel properties of chia seeds.

, Because chia seeds firm when mixed with liquid, ground seeds and flavorful liquids help form a gel that can give the consistency of porridge when hot or pudding when cold.


For dessert-like chia mixtures, mix the seeds with sweetened or flavored milks or juices. For breakfast-like chia mixtures, stir the seeds into hot milk or water and then flavor to your preferences with brown sugar, cinnamon, or other breakfast toppings.

Stir the seeds into the broth or sauce and monitor the consistency for about 15 minutes to determine if additional liquid is necessary. If so, consider adding the primary liquid base of the recipe (milk, broth, water, or juice, for instance).

, Because of the nutty flavor and texture, chia seeds can easily be added to sandwich spreads to get extra fiber and nutrients.

, Chia seeds can be added to traditional breading for chicken, pork, and even tofu to add a nutty, crunchy aspect to traditional breadcrumb or cereal-based breading. Chia seeds can also be used in batters for fish or vegetable tempura to add flavor to pan-fried, battered dishes.

, Traditional recipes with a base of rice, such as jambalaya or stuffed peppers, can easily tolerate chia seeds added after the rice has been cooked completely. The meals will benefit from the added nutrients of the chia seeds without altering flavor significantly.

, Homemade trail mix, nut clusters, and snack bags can easily incorporate chia seeds to improve nutrition and add to the nutty flavor of the original dish.

Alternatively, heat 1 cup (240 mL) water on low heat and remove from heat after one to three minutes. If the water begins to simmer or boil, remove from heat and let cool to slightly above room temperature before using.;
, While none of these ingredients are required to make guo tie, some recipes call for salt, vegetable oil, and/or egg.Stirring roughly 1/4 tsp (1 mL) salt (or a small pinch) into the water may add flavor. The other optional ingredients should be added to the flour instead, before you continue to the next step. Mix the flour with 1 tsp (5 mL) vegetable oil and/or 1 small egg to add flavor and help the dough stick together. Continue as usual, but be aware that the egg will add more liquid to the dough, so you will probably not end up using all your water in the next step.


If this is your first time making potstickers, you may wish to skip this step to keep things simple. If the wrappers fall apart or taste too bland, you may add one or more of these ingredients in your next attempt.

, Put 2 cups (480mL) all-purpose flour into a large bowl. Add the warm water a little at a time, stirring the ingredients together with chopsticks or a wooden mixing spoon. Stop adding water once the dough feels slightly sticky, and there is no more dry flour visible.


Depending on the brand of flour and the humidity in your kitchen, you may not need to use all of the water you prepared. Keep the extra water around during the next few steps in case the dough dries out.

, Once the dough becomes too sticky to stir, place the dough on a clean, lightly floured surface and knead the flour and water together. The dough should become smooth within a few minutes of kneading. Stop when the dough has no lumps and can be formed into a ball.


Add a light dusting of flour to the work surface or your hands if the dough sticks to them. Knead in more flour if the dough is too wet to work with.
If you see dry flour that isn't mixed into the dough, or if the dough won't stick together into a ball, add a little more warm water and knead it in.
Remember to wash and dry your hands thoroughly before you begin kneading.

, Wrap the dough in plastic wrap or place it in a small bowl and cover it with plastic wrap or a damp cloth. This will trap the moisture released by the dough and cause it to soften.Let the dough sit for at least 10 minutes, and preferably for half an hour.


To save time, make the filling while you wait. This step does not have to be precisely timed, so return to the dough once you are done making the filling.

, Return to the dough after it's had enough time to ""relax,"" or soften into an easily manipulated ball. Pull it apart into small pieces, each one using about 1/20th of the total dough. You may find it easier if you first divide the dough into four large pieces, then cut each of these large pieces into five smaller ones.


Alternatively, you may use your hand to roll out the entire ball of dough into a long log 1 inch (2.5 cm) thick. Cut this log into discs 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) wide., Sprinkle flour over a flat, clean counter or cutting board to prevent the dough from sticking. Use a rolling pin to flatten each piece of dough over this surface, creating circles about 3 inches (7.5 cm) across.Use smaller circles if the dough breaks apart or looks translucent, as the dumplings may fall apart if they are rolled too thin.


You can speed up the rolling process by using the heel of your palm to flatten each piece of dough into a roughly circular shape before you roll it out more thoroughly.
Filling the potstickers may be easier if you keep the center of the circle thick and the outside edges thin.

, After each circle is finished, sprinkle both sides generously with flour to prevent sticking, and add it to the stack of finished dough circles. Your dumpling wrappers are now complete.

, Cover wrappers with a damp paper towel to keep them moist as you work. Once you have made the wrappers, it is best to fill them immediately before they dry out. Store unused wrappers in the fridge if you will use them within a few days, or freeze them and use any time in the next few months., Finely chop the vegetables until you have 1 cup (240 mL). While you can use any hard, leafy, green vegetables, guo tie are traditionally made using Napa cabbage or bok choy. Both of these vegetables are sometimes sold under the name ""Chinese cabbage.""


If you are making vegetarian potstickers, chop 2 cups (480 mL) of vegetables instead.

, Toss the chopped cabbage in 1 tsp (5 mL) salt. Let sit five minutes while the salt draws out moisture, then drain the cabbage in a strainer or colander., To add a spicy flavor to the guo tie, peel fresh ginger and fresh garlic, then chop them finely until you have 1 tsp (5 mL) of each. Finally chop one or two stalks of green onion (scallions).

, Mix these vegetables in a large bowl containing ground or finely minced meat. In different areas of Asia, ground pork, beef, or shrimp are all commonly used, or a mixture of these.


Wash your hands in warm, soapy water after handling raw meat to reduce the risk of exposure to harmful bacteria. Clean any surfaces or utensils that came into contact with the meat in hot, soapy water once you are done using them.

, Mix in 2 tsp (10 mL) soy sauce, 2 tsp (20 mL) sesame oil or Chinese cooking wine, and 1/2 tsp (2.5 mL) pepper. There are many variations on this recipe, and you may decide to replace some seasonings or add your own. Other common options include 1/4 cup (60 mL) chicken stock or chicken broth, a dash of chili powder, or a dash of Chinese five spice powder.If you'd like to adjust the seasonings before you make the potstickers, take a small spoonful of filling and fry it in oil until it is browned through. Taste the filling and add more seasoning if necessary.

, Take one of your circular potsticker wrappings and place it on the palm of the hand you use least.

, Take approximately 1/2–1 tablespoon (7–15 mL) of filling using a spoon or chopsticks and place in the center of the potsticker wrapper. If the dough is thin or the circles of dough are small, use less filling.

, Fold the potsticker in half to make a half-moon shape, but do not press the edges completely together. Only press the center of the edges together, so the corners of the dumpling are still unattached.



Note: If you are using storebought dumpling wrappers, use wet fingers to dampen the edges until they are soft enough to press together.

, Grasp one layer of dough at the corner with your index finger and thumb, then fold it toward the center of the potsticker edge, where the two sides of the circle are pressed together.The soft dough should stretch into a classic potsticker pleat or wrinkle. Press the two layers of dough together at the fold to keep it in place.

, Using the same technique, grasp one layer of dough at the corner and fold it over toward the center edge. Press together with the opposite layer of the potsticker. Repeat this until there are three or four folds on each potsticker, and the potsticker is completely closed.

, Add cooking oil to a wok, flat skillet, or frying pan, just enough to cover the bottom of the pan in a thin layer. Heat over medium heat until the oil begins to shimmer, or when a small piece of vegetable or filling sizzles when placed in the oil.


Use a vegetable oil with a high smoking point, such as canola oil or peanut oil.

, Carefully drop the potstickers into the pan from a short distance above the oil. Arrange them with a heat-safe utensil so the dumplings are close together but do not touch each other.You will likely need to cook your potstickers in several batches. Do not pile potstickers on top of each other in the pan, or they may not cook properly.

, Cover the pan, reduce to low heat, and fry for a few minutes until the bottom of the potstickers are crisp and golden-brown. Depending on the temperature of the pan, this could take anywhere from two to seven minutes.You may lift the lid to check on the potstickers' progress.


Remove from heat immediately if you smell burning. Use a heat-safe utensil to unstick the potstickers from the pan, and continue after one or two minutes.

, Once one side of the potstickers are brown, lift the lid and pour 1–3 tablespoons (15–45 mL) water onto the pan, just enough to cover the base of the pan with a shallow layer.


Pour the water while rapidly moving in a circular motion around the edge of the pan. This distributes the water evenly and prevents one part of the pan from cooling down too quickly. This also reduces splatter from hot oil and water coming into contact.

, Cover the pan again and cook on moderate or low heat for 4-5 minutes. Add more water if it boils away before the potstickers are done cooking. Note that you do not need to flip the potstickers at any point in this process; it is intentional that they are only crisp on one side.


Remove a potsticker and cut it open to check that it is done. The filling inside should be browned and fully cooked.

, Remove the potstickers from the pan and cook additional batches if necessary. Once all the potstickers are cooked, serve them with a sauce of your choice:


Any dark vinegar can be used alone or mixed with an equal amount of soy sauce and a dash of sesame oil.
Mix vinegar with sherry or dry wine and sweet soy sauce for a sweeter dipping sauce.
Black pepper and sliced ginger add a sophisticated flavor, and can be provided with or without a dipping sauce."

Come up with your own variations.",How to Make Papaya Salad," To get started, you should lay out all the aromatic ingredients you will be using to flavor the salad. This includes the dried shrimp, garlic, peanuts, yardlong beans (French green beans can be used instead) and chili peppers. Som tam is traditionally made by grinding or “bruising” the dry ingredients in a mortar and pestle before incorporating them into the fresh fruits and vegetables that make up the salad.Look for less common ingredients like dried shrimp and Thai fish sauce at your local Asian supermarket.;
, Rather than chopping or pureeing the dry ingredients, they should be crushed to get the proper flavor and consistency. The best way to do this is with a mortar and pestle. If you don’t own or have access to one, you can simply place the items in a large mixing bowl and mash them with the bottom of a broad spoon.Because they’re so hard, the peanuts are the one exception and may need to be chopped if you’re not using a mortar and pestle.
Authentic som tam is often made entirely in the same mortar.

, Take the dry ingredients and grind them with the pestle or spoon until they are soft but intact. The purpose of this process is not to completely break down the ingredients but to unlock their pungent flavors while reducing them to an edible size and texture. For best results, crush the shrimp, garlic, beans, peanuts and chilies individually.Try not to crush the dry components until they’re too fine. A coarse, pulpy texture is what you’re after.
If you want to save time, or you’d prefer a more even consistency, you can pulse the dry ingredients a few times in a food processor until they’re the right size.

, Once they’ve been lightly ground, set the dry ingredients aside in a separate bowl. It’s best to keep them separated from the papaya and other vegetables until it’s time to toss them together. This will ensure that the finished salad is fresh and crisp and retain the distinct notes of each of its ingredients.

The flavors of the aromatics will begin to mingle as they rest.

, The papaya used for som tam needs to be green (picked just before it’s ripe) and cut into matchstick-sized shreds. When you’re doing your shopping, look for green papaya that has already been shredded. This will save you a lot of prep time and shouldn’t have much of an effect on the freshness of the flavor, since unripe papaya is so dry. If you don’t have any luck finding it pre-shredded, you can take the time to julienne it yourself or use a Kiwi shredder.Look over the papaya closely before you buy it. It should be a deep green color on the outside and be firm to the touch, with very little give.
If you’re using fresh, whole papaya, it will need to be seeded before it’s shredded.
You can also shred the papaya with an ordinary kitchen grater, although the pieces may be slightly smaller and thinner., Cut the tomatoes into halves or quarters. Shred or julienne the carrots. Dice the scallions. Chop the Thai basil and cilantro or slice them into fine strips. Bean sprouts can be added whole or cut into smaller pieces. Combine these with the papaya shreds and mix it all together by hand.The papaya should make up the bulk of the salad, with the rest of the vegetables there to supplement the flavor and texture.

, Put the lime juice, palm sugar, fish sauce and salt into a separate bowl and whisk them together until the mixture forms a thin liquid. Taste the dressing to make sure it’s right. In a well-made som tam, all flavors should be represented equally: sweet, salty, tart, zesty and bitter.Add the fish sauce to taste. It has a very unique flavor profile that works best when balanced by other flavors, and can easily become overpowering if you use too much.

, Add the crushed dry ingredients to the papaya, carrots, scallions, bean sprouts and herbs. Drizzle the dressing over the top. Toss until all the components are evenly distributed throughout the salad and coated with the dressing. If you desire, top with extra crushed peanuts, cilantro or basil and enjoy!Papaya salad refrigerates well and will stay fresh for up to 3 days, though the acids in the dressing may cause it to soften up somewhat.
This recipe makes between 3-4 servings.

, Papaya can be hard to find in most places, especially unripe, the way it needs to be for som tam. If you have trouble finding papaya, simply swap it out for kohlrabi, cabbage mix, daikon radish or cucumber. Any of these mild root vegetables will have the right crunchy texture, and when shredded or julienned will be perfect for soaking up the tangy dressing.When substituting other vegetables for papaya, make sure you buy them before they’re fully ripe so that they’ll be firm.
Mild melons like cantaloupe can also work as a tasty replacement.

, If you’re a vegan, or just find fish sauce to be particularly unpalatable, just add a little extra salt to the dressing instead. A little white vinegar can also do the trick, and will provide the liquid you need to blend the dressing. The main purpose of the fish sauce is impart a salty, pungent flavor, so it’s easy to achieve the same effect without having to work with an ingredient you can’t stomach.Other salty condiments like soy sauce are not recommended, as they’ll throw off the flavors of the salad.

, Palm sugar is the go-to sweetener for most Southeast Asian and Malaysian cuisine, but it’s not available everywhere, and it might taste a bit strange to those who aren’t used to it. Luckily, light brown sugar makes a perfect replacement. It’s sweet and just a bit earthy, and it will dissolve and thicken well in the lime juice.Play around with the amount of sugar that goes into the dressing if you want to offset the spice of the chilies.

, Since the components of som tam are prepared individually and then assembled, it’s an easy recipe to customize. Adjust the amounts of herbs and aromatics to taste, or substitute some of your other favorite vegetables instead. You might choose to crank up the heat from the chilies, or leave them out altogether. The choices are nearly endless!

, Place the baking sheet with the chicken in the oven. Wait 20-25 minutes, until the chicken is done and looks slightly brown on top, then remove the tray., Wait for the chicken to cool, around five minutes. Then use two forks to pull apart the chicken. Pull the chicken into small strips, then set the chicken aside as you prepare the other ingredients.You can also use your fingers instead of the forks to give you more control over the size and shape of the strips.

, Stack the five tortillas on top of one another and use a sharp knife to cut them into strips. Cut the strips to about an inch long and half an inch wide., Spread the tortilla strips on a baking sheet and drizzle them with olive oil. Toss the tortilla strips so that they are all evenly coated. Then sprinkle them with salt and spread them out so that they aren’t overlapping., Bake the tortilla strips in the oven, either along with the chicken or separately, for 15-18 minutes until the strips are crisp and lightly golden brown, then set aside.You can also buy tortilla chips from the grocery store if you’d prefer.

, After you have finished cooking the chicken and tortilla strips, move on to preparing the other ingredients. Dice the onion, garlic and bell peppers into small cubes., Heat one tablespoon of olive oil over medium heat. When the oil is hot, drop in the onions, garlic and bell peppers. Stir to mix and combine the vegetables., Stir in the remaining ½ teaspoon of cumin, ½ teaspoon of chili powder, ¼ teaspoon of garlic powder and ¼ teaspoon of salt. Then add the shredded chicken and stir until the chicken and the vegetables are mixed., Pour in the tomatoes, chicken stock, tomato paste, water and black beans. Stir until all ingredients are mixed, then bring the soup to a boil.

, After the soup has boiled, reduce the heat to low and let it simmer uncovered for 45 minutes., After the soup has simmered for 45 minutes, mix three tablespoons of cornmeal into a small amount of water, adding water and stirring until the mixture has reached a paste-like consistency. Then pour the mixture into the soup and stir.Adding cornmeal makes the soup a little thicker and also adds the subtle flavor of corn.

, After you have added the cornmeal, let the soup simmer for another 30 minutes. This will make the soup more flavorful and less watery, and also will cook the vegetables to the ideal state., While the soup is simmering, prepare the toppings for your soup. Cut the red onion and avocado into small chunks, and break the cilantro leaves from the stem., After the soup has simmered for thirty minutes, turn off the heat and let it sit for 15-20 minutes. This lets the flavors fully integrate and soak into the chicken and vegetables., Add the tortilla strips fifteen minutes before serving if you prefer softer strips that have absorbed the flavor of the soup, or right before serving if you prefer them to be crunchy. Then add the onion, avocado, and cilantro, along with a dollop of sour cream on top. Serve and enjoy!


You can also add cheddar cheese to the soup for an extra kick of flavor. Feel free to experiment and add whatever toppings you’d like.

3/4 cup (130 g) of chopped red bell pepper
3/4 cup (130 g) of chopped green bell pepper;
, Heat a large sauce pot or Dutch oven over medium heat and add 1 tablespoon of olive oil. When the oil shimmers, add 1 pound (450 g) of lean ground beef. Cook the beef and break it up with a spoon as it cooks. Once it's brown and cooked to 160 degrees F (71 C), scoop it out of the pan and set it aside. Drain the grease from the pan if there's more than a tablespoon.For an even leaner soup, consider substituting ground turkey breast for the beef. This will also cut out some of the grease that ends up in the soup.

Garnish the soup with cheddar, mozzarella or fresh herbs just before serving it.You can use any type of rice for stuffed pepper soup. Consider using Jasmine, long-grain white, brown, or wild.

, If you won't be around your house to simmer the soup or you'd just like a hands-off method, you can carefully pour the soup into a slow cooker instead of simmering it on the stove. Cover the slow cooker and cook the soup on low for 5 to 6 hours or on high for 3 hours. Add the cooked rice before you're ready to serve the soup.Wait to garnish the soup with any fresh herbs (like parsley) or cheese until right before you're ready to serve it.

Prep for broiling.,
Fill your bowls.,
Melt your cheese and then serve.",How to Top Tomato Soup3," You’re going to broil the cheese for each serving directly in its bowl with the soup already inside, so make your favorite tomato soup recipe beforehand. While that’s cooking, preheat your oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (177 degrees Celsius). Then line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and place your four serving bowls on top., Once your soup is cooked, divide it between four oven-safe bowls in equal portions. Next, lightly spread butter over one side of four separate slices of bread. Place each slice directly on top of the soup with the buttered side facing up. Divide 1 cup (113 g) of grated cheddar cheese into quarters and then top each slice with one quarter.Because the bread is placed directly on the soup, buy a full loaf and slice it yourself, nice and thick, so it doesn’t weaken in the liquid. Pre-sliced sandwich bread may be too thin and will probably end up dissolving in the soup.

, Place the baking sheet in your preheated oven. Set a timer for 15 minutes. Once it goes off, check the cheese. If it has browned and started to bubble, it’s good to go. If not, give it another five minutes and check again. Once it’s done, give it a minute or two to cool off before serving.To deepen the color for a more golden brown, transfer the baking sheet from the oven to under the broiler for another five minutes.
Warn guests that the bowls were in the oven and will be extremely hot to the touch.

Serve and enjoy your delicious vegetable soup.",How to Make Vegetable Soup," Use cold water to rinse all the vegetables you will be using.For vegetables with thick skin like potatoes and carrots, use a vegetable brush to scrub them. Place the vegetables on a towel to dry.;
, Use a sharp standard chef knife for dicing, chopping, and slicing.Place the potatoes and celery on a stable cutting board, then cut them into cubed shapes. To do this, make slices all the way across the vegetable that are about ¾ of an inch apart; then, turn the slices and repeat.


This will create square dices.
The dices do not have to be perfect, but they should all be roughly the same size.
The smaller the dices are, the faster the potatoes and celery will cook.

, The ends of green beans have a small string you should remove with a knife or kitchen scissors.Then, chop them into smaller pieces that are about 1 inch (3 cm). Use a measuring cup to make sure there is at least 1 cup of chopped green beans. Snap peas or thin asparagus stalks are good substitutes for green beans.

, You can peel the carrots if you want before slicing, but this is not necessary. Cut off both ends of the carrot.Now, you can slice the carrots into half lengthwise (down the center).After this is complete, dice the carrot crosswise into small pieces no more than ½ an inch thick.


You can try heirloom carrots instead of regular orange ones. They are easy to find and add a colorful burst of flavor to vegetable soup.
Buy baby carrots if want to spend less time chopping. You can throw baby carrots in the soup whole.
Winter squashes like pumpkin can be substituted for carrots, since they have the same texture when cooked.

, If you’re using fresh garlic, you will need to peel 2-3 cloves to mince. Remove every layer of skin from the cloves, then crush the cloves with the side of your knife.This will make the cloves flat and easier to chop. Roughly chop the garlic, then gather the garlic into a pile, and chop once again.


Continue chopping the garlic until it is entirely in small pieces.
Many people like their food with lots of garlic, so you can use more than three cloves.
Garlic is also sold already minced.

, Use a measuring cup to set aside 1 cup of corn kernels. Frozen or canned corn kernels will work for this soup. Substitute peas for corn if you wish.

, For a vegetable soup that does not use broth, add 4-6 cups of water into a large pan, and simmer all the ingredients for 45 minutes to 1 hour, using a very low heat.Add all the vegetables, garlic, and spices at the same time.


The pan needs to be large enough to include the 4 cups of vegetable stock, so choose a heavy-bottomed stockpot.Do not boil the water; this may cause the vegetables to burn.
Stir the soup occasionally.
When all of the vegetables are soft, the soup is ready to be served.

, Heat the olive oil until it begins to slightly bubble.


Lower heat will make the process go very slowly, and higher heat will cause the oil to burn.
If you don't have olive oil, coconut oil, palm oil, avocado oil, or butter is also acceptable.

, Continue to cook these for about 8 minutes over low heat. They will begin to simmer and will become fragrant. Stir them occasionally, about once every minute.

, This includes the green beans, celery, corn, and any other vegetables you will include in the soup. Sauté the vegetables over low heat for another 5 minutes. You will know the vegetables are well-cooked when they become soft and fragrant; you never want the vegetables to turn dark brown.


Stir the vegetables occasionally with a long wooden or metal stirring stick. Twice every minute should suffice.
If your vegetables start to get very hot and sizzle constantly, this means they are frying. Turn the heat down if this happens.

Be careful because it's a lot easier to add spices to a soup than it is to take them out.
If you would like to season the soup further, you can add more spices or seasonings, such as dry or fresh oregano, thyme, or parsley.
Dried Italian seasoning blends or poultry seasoning are good additions as well.
Spices like cayenne and red pepper flakes will make the soup spicy.

, Carefully ladle the soup into bowls—remember, the soup will be very hot.

Serve the stew.",How to Make Shortcut Crock Pot Beef Stew," Lay it on a cutting board and use a sharp knife to cut it it into bite-sized chunks.If you're low on time, here are some shortcuts you can try:










Buy the beef pre-cut. Many butchers or grocery stores sell it in convenient bite-sized pieces for you. Look for ""stew beef.""

Use frozen beef. Plan ahead for next time you want to make beef stew by buying extra stew meat, chopping it up, and freezing it. That way next time you want to make it, all you have to do is throw the meat in the pot - frozen and all.;
, Wash, peel and chop the onions, carrots and potatoes. Chop the celery, too. This is easily the most time-consuming part (effort-wise) of making beef stew, so here are a few shortcuts that'll save you time when you only have a few minutes to spare:










Use pre-cut veggies. You can often find pre-cut veggies intended for use in vegetable soups and stews at the grocery.

Use frozen veggies. A bag of chopped carrots, a bag of chopped potatoes, and a bag of chopped onions, and you're done!

Use vegetable soup. If you're extremely short on time, you can simply get 2 cans of vegetable soup and add them to the meat. It won't taste as fresh, but it'll be quick.

, Peel and mince the garlic and measure out the salt, pepper, paprika, and lay out the bay leaves.If you don't have time for this extra preparation, use these tricks:










Use a spice mix. Instead of measuring out all the spices separately, have a good spice mix on hand. You can use one intended for soups. Look for one that has a mixture of salt, pepper, paprika, garlic powder, oregano and other spices you like.

Use what you have on hand. Don't have paprika? Swap it out for oregano. Don't have black pepper? Use white pepper or cayenne. Try rosemary, thyme, sage or whatever you've got.

Use garlic powder instead of fresh garlic. Just measure out 1/2 teaspoon instead of mincing fresh garlic.

, You'll need a teaspoon of Worcestershire and a cup of beef broth. Looking for a shortcut? Try one of these:










Replace the Worcestershire with sherry or red wine if you don't have any on hand.

Replace the beef broth with chicken broth, vegetable broth or plain water. Don't worry, it will still turn out delicious.

, Throw the meat, vegetables, spices, Worcestershire sauce, and broth into the crock pot. Use a spoon to stir it all together.








, Depending on your crock pot, it will take between 7 and 8 hours to cook your stew. No need to open your crock pot or stir the stew while it's cooking. Just let the crock pot do it's magic!









However, if you know your Crock Pot tends to burn things, you should stir the stew every few hours.
If you want it to be ready sooner, cook it on high heat, and it should only take 5 to 6 hours. Make sure to stir once every hour, or it could burn!

, About 1/2 an hour before the stew is ready, open up the crock pot and measure out about 1/3 cup of the liquid. Mix it with the 2 tablespoons (29.6 ml) of flour so that the flour dissolves. Stir the flour mixture into the stew - it'll make the stew nice and thick. Put the lid back on and keep cooking the stew.








, Eat it plain or ladle it over rice or egg noodles. Garnish with fresh parsley if you like.

Strain the soup.,
Place in bowls and serve.",How to Make Parsley Soup," Fill a 6 quart (6 L) saucepan approximately ¾ full with cold water, and place it on the stove. Set the heat to high, and allow the water to come to a full boil.The pot will boil more quickly if you place a lid on it.;
, Once the water is boiling, place 1 pound (450 g) of fresh parsley in the pan. Allow the parsley to cook until the leaves become bright green and wilted. That should take approximately 30 seconds to 1 minute.Keep a careful eye on the parsley so you know when it’s done. If you cook it too long, you may dilute some of its flavor.

, When the parsley is finished cooking, transfer it immediately to a colander to drain it. Next, place it in a bowl of ice cold water. Let it sit for approximately 1 minute to stop the cooking process. Drain it in the colander a final time to remove the water.While you’re draining the cold water from the parsley, it’s a good idea to give the leaves a squeeze with a towel or spin them in a salad spinner to ensure that you get rid of any excess moisture.

, When the parsley is dry, gather all of the leaves in a pile. Use a sharp knife to give them a rough chop. Be careful not to press on the parsley too hard with the knife or you may bruise the leaves.There’s no need to remove the stems from the parsley. The stems actually have a nice, sharp flavor that works well in the soup, and because it’s eventually pureed, the stems won’t ruin the texture of the soup either., Place a 4 quart (4 L) saucepan on the stove, and add 3 tablespoons (43 g) of unsalted butter. Turn the heat to medium, and allow the butter to warm until it melts completely, which should take approximately 3 to 5 minutes.Cutting the butter in pieces before you place it in the pan can help it melt more quickly.
Make sure to stir the butter as it’s melting to ensure that it’s heating evenly.

, Once the butter is fully melted, mix in 2 cloves of garlic that have been minced, 1 large yellow onion that’s been thinly sliced, and kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste. Allow the mixture to cook on medium heat for approximately 6 minutes or until the onions are soft.Use a wooden spoon to stir the garlic and onions as you heat them to ensure that they cook evenly.
Avoid browning the onions; you just want them to be tender, not caramelized.

, When the onions are soft, mix 4 cups (950 ml) of chicken stock and 1 cup (240 ml) of heavy cream into the pan. Bring the mixture to a simmer over medium low heat for approximately 15 to 20 minutes or until it thickens slightly.Stir the mixture occasionally to ensure that it doesn’t scorch on the bottom.
If you want the soup to be vegetarian, you can substitute vegetable stock for the chicken stock.

, After the chicken stock, cream, onion, and garlic mixture has thickened a bit, add the cooked parsley to the pan, along with additional salt and pepper to taste. Let the mixture cook on medium for approximately 5 minutes or until it is heated through., Once the soup is warmed through, pour it from the pan into the pitcher of a blender. Add the juice from 1 lemon to the soup, and then puree the mixture until it is smooth.If you have a stick blender, you can puree the soup directly in the saucepan.

, To ensure that the soup is as smooth as you’d like it, place a fine mesh sieve over the saucepan and strain it. Use a spoon to press the soup through to get rid of any lumps.If the soup has cooled at all during the pureeing and straining, you can return it to the stove and heat it on low again

, When you’re happy with how smooth the soup is, give it a taste to see if you want to add any more salt and pepper. Next, pour the soup into bowls and serve.If you want to add a little spice to the soup, garnish it with freshly grated horseradish.

Collect and cut your vegetables.,
Soften aromatic vegetable and tender greens in oil.,
Add and cook the remaining veggies until they brown.,
Season your vegetables.,
Insert your broth to the mix.,
Lid the pot and simmer the veggies and broth.,
Sample the soup and round out its seasoning.",How to Make Leftover Vegetable Soup1," Almost any kind of vegetable can be used to make a soup. So long as you enjoy the flavor of the veggie you choose, it should make a tasty soup. You’ll need at least 1 lb (.45 kg) of veggies cut into chunks, but you can use as much as 2 lbs (.91 kg). Be sure to rinse and clean your veggies under cool water before cutting them. Feel free to mix and match veggies, too.In some cases, like with turnips or cabbage, you may need to soften the natural bitterness of the vegetable or its aroma. This can be done by adding cream, yogurt, white beans, or lemon to the soup.
Some common veggies used in soups include things like sweet potatoes, zucchini, squash, turnips, tomatoes, celery, mushrooms, leeks, cabbage, and kale.
Veggies that are a little firmer in consistency, like butternut squash, will take much longer to cook down than tender greens.;
, In a Dutch oven or soup pot with a lid, heat your olive oil on your stove top over medium heat. Cook aromatic and tender vegetables, like leeks, garlic, onions, and so on in the oil for about 5 minutes. Stir these regularly with a wooden spoon or similar utensil.


The time it takes to cook these veggies may vary. Generally, you should cook them until they become soft and emit a fragrant smell., At this point, add starchier, firmer consistency vegetables, like carrots, cauliflower, butternut squash, and so on. Cook these in the oil with your aromatic and tender veggies until they begin to brown at the edges., Add salt, pepper, cumin, chili powder, and smoked paprika to the mix. This is especially important if you use a low sodium broth. Failing to season enough could result in a bland outcome for your soup. Stir in the seasonings thoroughly.Adjust the seasonings to suit your personal taste. If you like a lighter flavored soup, you may want to halve amount of salt, pepper, and herbs and spices you use to season the vegetables.

, Once you’ve seasoned your veggies, you’re ready to add the broth. Increase the heat after doing so to bring the liquid to a simmer. At this point, feel free to add some fresh herbs to enhance the flavor of your soup., Once the mixture reaches a simmer, decrease the heat to the low setting. Put the lid on your Dutch oven or soup pot, and allow this to cook for roughly 30 minutes. To maintain the consistency of the veggies, remove the soup from the heat after 30 minutes of cooking.


When using a soup pot, allow a small gap between the lid and the pot so steam can escape.
If you prefer your soup to have very soft veggies, or if you like your soup to be more of a puree, allow the mixture to cook until the veggies begin to disintegrate., Take your wooden spoon, or a similar kitchen utensil, and try some of your soup. Be careful when doing so, as it’ll likely be hot. If your soup tastes a little bland, add a little vinegar or lemon juice.


Especially if this is your first time making a vegetable soup, you may find that it needs more salt or pepper. At this point, freely add these seasonings until you achieve your preferred taste.
In some cases, you may have added too much salt. When this happens, thin out mixture by adding more broth or dairy, like milk or cream."

Use a chicken carcass to make broth for your soup.,
Transform leftover curry into a vegetable soup.,
Make a veggie soup in tomato base.",How to Make Leftover Vegetable Soup2," A full roasted chicken can be bought from most grocery stores and is an excellent meal for the family. When you’ve removed most of the meat from the chicken, add the bones and skin to a pot or Dutch oven. Then:Cover the chicken carcass with water.
Insert your veggies to the mix.
Simmer the mixture for 4 hours with the lid partially covering the pot.
Remove the bones with a slotted spoon and strain the broth through a sieve to ensure the soup has a smooth consistency. Enjoy your soup., You may have leftover curry from eating out, or you may have made curry previously and have some extra on hand. Blend this with a can of coconut milk and simmer your veggies in it until they are soft. This mix will make an aromatic, tasty soup.


Depending on your tastes and the amount of curry you have, you’ll likely have to adjust the amount of coconut milk you add to suit your preferences. Add the coconut milk a little at a time and taste it to discern whether you need more., If you don’t have a chicken carcass or curry, canned tomatoes and vegetable stock can form the base of your soup. Prepare your veggies in oil as you would normally for a broth based soup. When sautéing the veggies in the oil:


Add about 2.6 lbs (1200 g) of canned plum tomatoes (roughly 3 cans worth).
Add in 2 cups (500 ml) of vegetable stock and 1 tsp (5 ml) of sugar.
Simmer the ingredients for about 10 minutes or until the tomatoes begin to dissolve.
Mix in ½ cup (118 ml) of cream, adjust the seasoning of the soup to taste, and enjoy."

Use soup in place of water to soften ingredients.,
Create a light version of alfredo sauce.,
Flavor mashed potatoes with leftover soup.,
Substitute oil for veggie soup in stir fries and sautés.,
Finished.

",How to Make Leftover Vegetable Soup3," Leftover soup works well in place of water when you need to soften ingredients like grains, rice, quinoa, and so on. This will naturally add more flavor to the ingredients and also impart a rich, smooth consistency.


Use leftover soup to make risotto. The thicker consistency of soup will result in a delicious creaminess in the risotto., Generally, alfredo sauce uses heavy cream. This thickens up the sauce, but can make pasta dishes somewhat heavy. Substitute 2% milk or nut milk for the heavy cream, and cook the sauce with a healthy splash of leftover soup broth and spices to make a lighter sauce.


To add a dash of flavor to your sauce, you may want to add some Parmesan cheese and a little bit of butter to it., Your leftover veggie soup can not only enrich the flavor of mashed potatoes, it can also add nutritional value. Mix in the soup and the veggies a little at time to the potatoes after they’ve been mashed. Continue adding soup until you reach the desired consistency and taste.Adding too much soup to the mix can make your potatoes runny. If this happens to you, simply mash another potato and use it to thicken the mixture.

, This is a great way of reducing the oiliness of many stir fries and sautés. Only use a small amount of soup when substituting it for oil, as many kinds of food (especially vegetables) release water when being stir fried or sautéed.


This is also a great way of making a vegetable stir fry more palatable for individuals who dislike veggies. The soup will add its flavor to the veggies, improving their taste.,"

Pumpkin, fennel, apple, butternut squash, yam, tomato and sweet potato are also good bases if your cupboard is lacking in carrots.
Don't like onions? Use leeks instead!;
, Cover and bring to a boil.


Vegetables take different times to fully cook through, obviously. Since it's all getting pureed later it's less of a deal, but you may want to start with your starchier veggies first. Carrots, potatoes, and similar dense veggies are going to take longer than, say, kale or spinach. Leafier veggies can be put in a bit later if it's something you'd like to be conscious of.

, When your fork easily slides into the body of the carrot, you know it's done.

, You're separating them now to get the solids alone -- you'll need the broth in a second.

, Pulse several times, then blend until pureed. Add broth as you go if the soup you are blending starts to thicken. Strain the resulting soup if you get celery strings or pieces that you don't want in your final soup.


Do not fill the blender more than halfway. Do this in batches, if necessary. Cover with a lid and kitchen towel, just to be safe.

Cayenne, cinnamon, clove, cumin, garlic, nutmeg, paprika, and thyme all work swimmingly.

If you'd like, you can keep the saucepan covered to keep the liquid nice and hot., The longer you purée it, the smoother your soup will become. If it is too thick, you can add more cooking water. You may not end up using all of the cooking water.

, How many batches you make will depend on the size of your blender or food processor; most will require only two batches. Pour each batch you complete into the other saucepan.


Use caution when opening the blender. The built up heat and pressure may cause splattering. It would be a good idea to open the lid a crack first.

, You will need about ½ to 1 teaspoon of salt and 1 to 2 tablespoons (15 to 30 grams) of butter. Once you have added in the salt and butter, give the mixture another quick pulse to combine.

, Stir well, being sure everything is coated in the olive oil. And if you need a bit more olive oil, no one's going to tell on you!


By the way, you peeled and sliced your carrots, right? That outer stuff (you know, the part that lived in dirt) isn't what you're going for here. But they're gonna get puréed later, so it's not like they have to be pretty. Just chop 'em up into finger-width pieces.

, Keep an eye on the onions especially -- if they're overcooking, turn the heat down a notch.


Sometimes carrots get a little bitter inexplicably when cooked. If that's the case (give 'er a taste test), add in a tablespoon of brown sugar, honey, or maple syrup to offset it.

, The rice is, of course, optional. You could also substitute potatoes for the rice -- or just not worry about either. Whatever you choose, cover and simmer for 20 minutes.


Make sure to add the liquid before or immediately after adding the rice. Otherwise it'll burn!
Want to get a little Asian up in here? You can use coconut milk as a bit of the liquid, too!

, The hand blender is super easy to use--you literally just place it in your pot and go. Then when you're done, rinse it off and you're good to go. But if this need was unforeseen, a food processor or even blender will work, too.


If you didn't purée it in the pan, take it back to the pan and reheat.

Other good garnishes? Nuts, bacon, grated cheese, dill and mint. And don't forget the bread and butter!

Saute the potatoes.,
Add the garlic and onions.,
Add the broth and beans.,
Add the cabbage and spices.",How to Make Cabbage Soup2," Place the olive oil in a large stockpot and heat it up for a minute or two over medium-high heat. Add the chopped potatoes and the salt, and stir them to coat with olive oil. Cook the potatoes until they are soft, which should take about 10 minutes.








Don't overcook the potatoes, since they'll keep cooking with the rest of the soup ingredients.
You can wait and add the salt later if you'd like, but adding it now will allow it to blend more evenly with the natural taste of the potato. Adding it later, however, will make it easier to adjust the final taste of the soup (simply add it when adjusting the seasonings toward the end of the recipe).

, Place them in the pot with the potatoes and stir. Keep cooking the mixture until the onions turn translucent, which should only take three to five minutes.









Stir frequently to prevent the garlic and onions from burning. If either one burns, it could ruin the taste of the potatoes, even if you remove the burnt garlic or onion from the pan.

, Pour the broth into the pot, then add the beans. Stir the mixture with a long-handled spoon. Bring the broth to a boil over medium-high heat, then reduce it to low so that the broth is at a simmer.








, Stir well after adding them to the soup. Cook the soup for 30 minutes, or until the cabbage is tender. Taste and add more salt and pepper as desires.

, Put the garlic in the pot with the vegetables and continue cooking the mixture until the garlic becomes fragrant, about 2 minutes.









Garlic can burn very quickly, so it's important to stir it constantly and keep a close eye on it as it browns.

, Place the stock and tomatoes in the pot and bring the soup to a boil, then reduce to a simmer (low to medium-low heat). Stir constantly so no vegetables stick to the bottom of the pot.

Alternatively, cook the ham in the same pot as the peas. This is faster, but adds less meaty flavor. There's also some risk of overcooking the peas to mush, as the meat can take 1–2 hours to become tender (falling off the bone).

, If you aren't using ham, boost the peas in some other way. Garlic and peppers add strong flavor, while tomatoes have a good, meaty texture.Use vegetable stock in place of all or part of the water, perhaps with a splash of wine (red or white). Try additional herbs such as rosemary and thyme.

Acidic ingredients such as tomatoes and wine can make the peas take longer to soften.These are most likely fine in small amounts, but you can add them late in the cooking process if you want to be safe.

, Bring 8 cups (1.9 L) water to a boil, preferably in a thick-bottomed pot to prevent burning. Add the peas and bring to a boil again. Stir frequently to prevent burning and sticking to the bottom.

If you simmered the ham, add the peas to the same pot, or substitute ham stock for some or all of the water.
If you didn't prepare the ham in advance, add it directly to the same pot of water.

, Stir occasionally to make sure the peas don't burn.

, Heat oil in a large frying pan until it shimmers. Add onions and cook until softened and glossy but not browned, 3-5 minutes. Add the rest of the vegetables, the bay leaf, and any other herbs you're using. Sauté another 5 minutes. This will add more flavor to the soup.

, Recently purchased split peas may be ready in 45–60 minutes, depending on how mushy you like them. If they've been in storage for a while, they may take up to 90 minutes or even 2 hours. Aim to add the vegetables about 30 minutes before the peas are finished. (When in doubt, add them 20 minutes after the peas started simmering.)


Add the bay leaf and other herbs immediately, plus a pinch of salt. Despite kitchen rumors, the salt will not lengthen the cooking time.You don't need the salt if cooking the peas with a ham.
If you like soft, mushy vegetables, add them immediately.

, When the peas have begun to fall apart slightly but still have 30 minutes of cooking left, remove the ham bone or hock. Allow it to cool enough to handle it. Cut off any remaining meat, cube it, and return it to the soup. Discard the bone.


If you plan on blending the soup, leave the ham out until you're done blending.

, If you're serious about having a smooth soup, you can use a blender or hand mixer to puree the soup. Remove the bay leaf before you do. Skip this step for a thick, chunky soup.

If transferring to a standing blender, only blend small amounts at a time. Hot soup can easily blow the lid off the blender., Sea salt or Kosher salt gives a lighter salt flavor, but any salt is fine., Remove the bay leaf before serving. Serve with fresh bread, cornbread, or biscuits to make a simple winter meal or side dish. Sprinkle with grated carrot or croutons for extra flavor and crunch."

Bring a large pot of water to a boil.,
Cut an ""x"" shape into the tomatoes.,

Peel the tomatoes.,
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.








,

Toss the vegetables with oil.,
Place the vegetables on a baking sheet.,
Roast the vegetables for 30 minutes.,
Transfer the roasted vegetables into a large stockpot.,
Add the stock.,
Season the soup and let it simmer.,
Puree the soup.,
Serve the soup.",How to Make Tomato Soup," Fill the pot about halfway with water, then place it on a burner over high heat and allow it to come to a full boil.






;
, Use a sharp knife to cut an ""x"" on the tops or bottoms of the tomatoes. It's not necessary to cut too deep - just pierce the skin. This will make it easy to peel off the skin after the tomatoes have been blanched.









, Drop a few tomatoes into the boiling water. Let them blanch for about 30 seconds. Remove the tomatoes and place them on a cutting board to cool. Repeat with the remaining tomatoes.









Don't leave the tomatoes in the water too long. Blanching loosens their skins, but leaving them in the pot for more than 30 seconds will cause them to actually start cooking, which will make them lose their flavor.
Be careful when removing the tomatoes from the boiling water. The best tools to use are tongs or a large slotted spoon.


, Take a cooled tomato and insert your finger under the skin where you cut the ""x."" Pull on the skin to peel it away in large strips. Continue until all the skin has been removed. Repeat with the remaining tomatoes, and discard the skin.








,, Cut up the peeled tomatoes, the bell pepper, and the onion. There's no need to make the slices even or bite-sized, since they will be pureed at a later stage.








, Place the cut vegetables into a large bowl. Add the garlic and the sprigs of thyme. Pour the oil over the vegetables and use two large spoons to toss the ingredients together until all of the vegetables are coated in a thin layer of oil.








, Spread them evenly so that each piece is touching the baking sheet, which will ensure that they each caramelize a bit. Arrange the thyme sprigs evenly around the vegetables.









, Place the baking sheet in the oven and let the vegetables cook. The tomatoes will release a fair amount of juice, which you might hear boiling over the rim of the baking sheet and sizzling in the oven. Let the vegetables keep cooking until the onions are slightly brown on top.








, Use a spatula to help you scoop the tomatoes, peppers, onions, garlic and thyme into the pot. Transfer all the juices, too.








, Pour the quart of chicken or vegetable stock over the vegetables. If you like thicker tomato soup, you can scale back the stock by 1/2 cup. For thinner soup, add 1/2 cup water to the stock.









, Taste the soup and add a pinch of salt and pepper. Place the pot on a burner and turn the heat to medium. Let the flavors simmer together for 30 minutes. Taste the soup again and adjust the seasonings if necessary.








, Working in small batches, transfer the soup to a blender. Puree it until it's smooth in consistency. Pour the pureed soup into a separate container, then puree another batch. Continue until the entire pot of soup has been pureed, then transfer it back into the soup pot so you can keep it warm.









If you like chunks of tomatoes in your soup, reserve half the soup and puree the rest. Combine the unblended soup with the pureed soup in the original soup pot.
If you have a stick blender, you may find it easier to puree the soup using that rather than transferring it to a standard blender.

, Ladle the soup into serving bowls. If desired, garnish it with a dollop of sour cream, a sprinkle of croutons or cheddar cheese, or simply eat it plain.

Serve with garnishes of your choice.",How to Make Corn Soup," Sweet corn soup is made with corn at the height of its ripeness in the summer. Take an ear of fresh corn and pull the leaves down to reveal the silk. Use your fingers to pull all the leaves and silk from the corn. Chop off the bottom knob with a sharp butcher knife.









Look for fresh corn at your grocery store or farmer's market in the summer months. Corn grown locally will have the best flavor, since it doesn't have to travel far.
This recipe tastes best with fresh corn, but you can use canned or frozen corn if you don't have fresh corn on hand. Make sure you use corn preserved without sugar or other additives, which could affect the flavor of the soup.;
, Use a cheese grater with large holes to grate the kernels from the cobs into a big bowl. Keep grating all sides of the corn until you've collected all of the fresh, sweet kernels. To get the remaining juices, use the blunt side of the knife to scrape down the corn cobs. Neglecting this last step will mean missing out on a lot of each piece's flavor.








, A sharp white onion will provide a nice contrast to the sweetness of the corn. Place the onion on a cutting board and use a sharp knife to slice it from root to tip. Peel the skin from both halves. Lay the halves flat-side down on the cutting board. Make a series of parallel cuts in one direction, then turn the onion half 90 degrees and slice in the other direction.









Experiment with red onion, yellow onion and shallots to bring out different flavors in the corn.
If you wish to omit the onion, you can use celery in its place.

, Place it in a large Dutch oven or soup pot over medium high heat and heat the butter until it's melted and beginning to sizzle.








, Put the corn and onions together in the pot with the butter. Give them a stir, and cook for about 5 minutes, until the onions turn translucent. Do not overcook the onions and corn - if they start to turn brown, reduce the heat immediately. Browning the corn will give its sweet flavor a sharp edge.








, Pour it over the onions and corn, and turn up the heat so that the mixture comes to a boil. Then reduce it to a simmer and cook for 15 minutes.









If you have homemade chicken or vegetable broth on hand, the flavor of your soup will be wonderfully enhanced. If not, choose a good-quality broth without a lot of preservatives.
Taste the soup after it has simmered for awhile. Have the flavors melded and enhanced one another? If not, allow it to cook for five minutes more.

, Carefully pour it into a blender and put the lid on. Don't fill the blender more than 1/2 way to the rim, or the hot soup may cause the lid to fly off and make a mess. Puree the soup until it's smooth, then pour it into a separate bowl or pot. Keep doing this in batches until all the soup has been pureed.








, Pour it through a fine-mesh strainer to get rid of the tiny corn skins and other solid bits. What's left will be a pure, silky, golden corn-flavored liquid.








, Add salt and pepper, taste the soup, and add more if necessary. At this point you can also add seasonings like flavored salt, dried thyme or cayenne pepper.








, Just before serving, swirl in the cream. You can heat the cream first if you don't want it to affect the soup's temperature. Be sure not to let it come to a boil.








, Corn soup is amazing with a variety of different garnishes. You can serve it plain, but try it with the following choices to liven things up:

Look for oil, water, and vinegar.,
Look for a short list of ingredients.,
Buy the healthiest vinaigrettes.",How to Pick a Low Calorie Salad Dressing1," These should be the three main ingredients in most healthy, low-calorie dressings. Accordingly, these should be the first three things listed on a bottle of store-bought dressing. All the way down the list, there shouldn’t be stuff you can’t easily pronounce. In fact, the shorter the list, the better.Vinegar and water are both calorie free. Olive oil is a common ingredient, and most of its fat content is especially healthy - namely, monounsaturated, omega-9 fatty acids. Extra virgin olive oil is especially good, while canola oil can be a decent base as well.
The rest of the ingredients in a healthy dressing should be things like herbs and spices.;
, Choosing a dressing with a short list of ingredients will help you to pick a healthier option. Look for dressings with less than 300mg sodium and less than 3g of total sugars per serving.Additives like caramel coloring will not add to the nutrition or mineral content, so you may choose to avoid these ingredients.

, Fortunately, there are a few go-to vinaigrettes that are commonly available. Go for the option with the lowest saturated fat, with either oil or vinegar listed as the first ingredient. Making your own is still healthier (and cheaper!), but if you prefer to purchase your dressing you'll likely have some decent options at a grocery store in your area.Newman’s Own Lite Italian, Ken’s Light Options Oil & Vinegar, and even Wish-Bone Light Italian all score well in the healthy scale for “light” dressings available at many U.S. grocery stores.
Good standard vinaigrette options that are readily available in the U.S. include Annie’s Organic Balsamic Vinaigrette, Newman’s Own Balsamic Vinaigrette, Lily’s Balsamic Vinaigrette, and Drew’s Classic Italian.

"
Avoid fat-free dressing.,
Skip the creamy stuff.,
Apply dressing in moderation.",How to Pick a Low Calorie Salad Dressing2," True, fats contain lots of calories. However, choosing a fat-free option is not the best way to cut calories from your salad dressing selection. This is because certain fats help your body get vitamins and other nutrients from the other ingredients of your salad. Further, fats slow down your digestion, and keep you from getting hungry again too quickly. Finally, fats contained in the right types of oil can positively contribute to your heart’s health.When manufacturers take out the fat, they may add sugar and salt to make up for the lost flavor.
Dressings labeled “fat free” are also often heavily processed and don’t contain much nutritional value. Further, they’ll wind up making you feel hungrier sooner than dressing with a bit of fat in it.
Generally, you do want to avoid saturated fats. Most importantly, opt for dressing that have less than 0.5 grams of saturated fat per serving. Unsaturated fats, on the other hand, are those with health benefits when eaten in moderation.

, Lots of people’s favorite dressings are also the biggest calorie culprits. Worse, these are the types of dressing that also contain saturated fats. Try to skip these dressing most of the time and only have them on special occasions.For the healthiest options, opt for vinaigrettes.

, This step can be especially challenging, but it’s important. Even if you find an especially healthy dressing option, drenching your salad will ultimately add unnecessary calories to your meal. Measure out a two tablespoon serving and stick to that amount.Dress your salad with just one tablespoon initially. After a few bites, you can add the other tablespoon for a flavor boost. You may be surprised by how much differently - and sometimes better - a salad tastes with less dressing!

Whip up a custom dressing.,
Make a basic vinaigrette.,
Blend yourself a tofu-based “creamy” dressing.",How to Pick a Low Calorie Salad Dressing3," Start with a 2-to-1 olive oil to red wine or cider vinegar as your base. Then add your favorites spices, or even a specialty ingredient, such as crushed up kalamata olives. Not only is the easiest and cheapest way to supply yourself with a low-cal dressing option, you can also craft a dressing with flavor of your own choosing, Vinaigrettes are great because they’re especially healthy, and go well on almost any salad. Make one to have on hand in your kitchen. Start with ½ cup of olive oil and a ¼ cup of either red wine vinegar or cider vinegar. Add 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) of Dijon mustard, 2 cloves of pressed garlic, 2 teaspoons of Worcestershire sauce, and 2-3 teaspoons of lemon juice. Finish with a bit of salt and pepper.Shake the ingredients altogether and store in a glass container with a tight, resealable lid.

, If you’re absolutely hooked on creamy dressings, consider making one at home. There is even a secret ingredient to help keep calories down while still getting some creaminess: silken tofu. Use it to make a dressing similar to “Green Goddess”, but with less fat and calories.Mix 6oz of lite, firm silken tofu, ¼ cup water, 1½ tablespoons cider vinegar, 2 tablespoons (29.6 ml) lemon juice, 2 teaspoons low-sodium soy sauce, 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) tahini, 2 chopped green onions (just the green parts), 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) of chopped parsley, a clove of garlic and a bit of salt and sesame oil in a blender. Simply blend until you get your desired consistency. This one is vegan, too!
If you’re feeling especially indulgent, you can also make healthier versions of ranch or caesar dressings at home by using low-fat yogurt, as opposed to mayo or some of the other unhealthy ingredients commonly used in creamy dressings.

, Once you’ve mashed the avocado, add 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of lime juice to the bowl. Use the fork to stir the juice into the avocado until they are well blended.Adding the lime juice helps keep the avocado from browning because the acid in the juice helps lower the avocado’s pH.

, After you’ve combined the avocado and lime juice, add half a small onion that’s been chopped, 8 grape tomatoes that have been sliced in half, and the diced chicken to the bowl. Use the fork to toss all of the ingredients together so they’re lightly coated with the avocado mixture.If there are other vegetables that you’d like to add to the salad, such as chopped celery, mix them in with onion and tomatoes.

You will need to whisk for a minute or two until the sugar is fully dissolved by the liquid ingredients.
For this particular recipe, seasoned rice wine vinegar is the recommended vinegar option. If this is not available, however, you can substitute it with plain rice vinegar, white wine vinegar, or apple cider vinegar. If you have nothing but plain white vinegar, you can use that as well, but you should substitute it in proportions of three parts vinegar to one part water.;
, Taste test the dressing with a clean spoon and add more seasonings as needed.


Mind the consistency as you make alterations. An added dash of salt or pepper will not make much difference, but if you add much more lemon juice, vinegar, sugar, or mayo, the consistency might become thicker or thinner than it should be.

, For this dressing, it is recommended that you wait at least 1 hour before serving it with coleslaw so that there is adequate time for everything to reach the right temperature.

, Whisk together the honey, vegetable oil, rice vinegar, soy sauce, sesame oil, peanut butter, salt, hot sauce, ginger, and garlic in a large bowl.


The sticky, thick honey and peanut butter will be the last things to dissolve. In particular, once the peanut butter is dissolved, you can take that as an indication that the dressing is ready.
Since some of the ingredients are fairly thick and sticky, you may have difficulty using a whisk to combine them. If this happens, you can switch the whisk out for a mixing spoon.

, Taste test the dressing using a clean spoon and make minor adjustments to the seasonings to meet with your preferences.


As a general rule, avoid changing the amount of ""staple"" ingredients used, such as honey, oil, vinegar, or peanut butter. The ""seasoning"" ingredients can be altered more easily, though.

Finished.

",How to Make Bok Choy Slaw," There are several different varieties of bok choy, but all feature dark green, ruffled leaves and hearty white stalks. For your slaw, you’ll want to use the entire head. Cut the cabbage into bite-sized sections to make it more manageable in the finished slaw. Place the prepped bok choy into a large mixing bowl as you go.Green bok choy, such as baby or Shanghai bok choy, are typically more tender and therefore better suited for uncooked dishes.Bok choy grows in the ground, so it tends to be dirty. Wash the heads thoroughly to rinse away any dirt or sediment before cutting them.;
, Run the carrots through a grater or mandoline to reduce them to a consistent size. This recipe calls for ½ cup, or about two whole large carrots. Add the carrots directly to the bok choy in the mixing bowl.To produce a uniform appearance and consistency, the carrots should be roughly matchstick-size.

, Slice the pepper in half vertically, then work from one edge, making ¼ inch slices. If needed, cut these slices into one inch pieces to keep the slaw ingredients a uniform size. A hint of red pepper will lend an earthy, slightly bitter note to the mild cabbage and carrot mixture. These will go into the mixing bowl as well.Remove the stem and seeds from the red pepper prior to slicing.
You can also try preparing the red pepper using a fine dicer.

, Scallions are a type of tangy, aromatic onion and can be used to introduce a savory element to the slaw. Use a delicate stroke of your knife to slice the scallions as paper-thin as possible. You only need a handful to round out the flavors provided by the other vegetables.Use the green part of the scallions, and trim and discard the white, bulbous ends.

, Grind up one quarter raw ginger root or mince a few sprigs of cilantro. Cut the herbs very fine—this will both unlock more of their natural essence and cause them to distribute more evenly throughout the slaw. Fresh herbs are used to create added dimension that will highlight the flavor of the bok choy and make the finished dish more complex.Use a moderate amount of herbs so as not to overpower the main vegetable ingredients.

, Start with ¼ cup soy sauce, then add ¼ cup coarse grain brown mustard, ⅓ cup sugar, and 2 tablespoons rice vinegar. Stir the ingredients together lightly.If the dressing comes out too salty, stir in a few ounces of cold water to dilute it.
For a brighter, more pungent twist, finish with a squeeze of fresh lime juice, a splash of ponzu or a couple drops of cilantro oil.

, As you begin pouring in the sesame oil, use a wire whisk to beat the dressing vigorously. This will create what is called an emulsion, which will allow the oil to blend with the vinegar and other liquid ingredients. Emulsified vinaigrettes won’t separate before they’re used to dress a slaw or salad, which can save you some frustration.If you’re at your wits end trying to get the ingredients to blend properly, a blender can be a big help., Drizzle the dressing a little at a time, covering as much of the bok choy, carrots, red pepper and scallions as you can. Use all of the dressing for a spicier, more flavorful slaw, or only use a portion to preserve the tender crunch of the raw veggies.Sample the dressing before adding it to the slaw to make sure it’s just right.
You may have to whisk the dressing again to reintegrate the oil and vinegar if you don’t dress the slaw right away.

, Use a pair of salad tongs or simply mix by hand. Continue tossing until the vegetables are thoroughly coated. Let the slaw sit for 20-30 minutes before dishing it out, or refrigerate it overnight and serve it chilled.Resting the slaw before serving will give the flavors more of a chance to mingle.
Don’t allow the slaw to sit out at room temperature for longer than about half an hour. The longer it sits, the more likely it is to become soggy and limp., Because of its versatility as an ingredient, bok choy will be at home in any number of adventurous recipes. It makes a perfect mate for a horseradish and bleu cheese-crusted fillet, an artisan sandwich loaded with aged meats and cheeses or a light dim sum lunch. For a quick and easy dinner, put the slaw together in advance and bring it out when it comes time to serve dinner.
Play around with new ways to serve bok choy slaw with or alongside your favorite recipes.

, Pair a lightly chilled slaw with piri piri chicken, chipotle-marinated pork chops or traditional Pad Thai full of hot chilis and take a few bites between blazing mouthfuls. The cold temperature and refreshing crispness will act as a balm when your tongue and lips are on fire.


Try adding one or two tablespoons of mayonnaise to the slaw dressing. Mayo will give the slaw a creamier consistency and help extinguish the burn of persistent spices., If you’re a spicy food lover, you can kick your bok choy slaw up a notch by working ⅓ cup of sriracha or sambal into the dressing. Turn a fiery slaw into a bed for grilled chicken or sweet glazed salmon. Garnish with fresno pepper rings or red pepper flakes and have a glass of water handy!Use an extra teaspoon of sugar to cut the saltiness of the extra spice.
Spicy slaws are best served at room temperature.

",How to Make Hot and Sour Slaw," Add 3 tablespoons (45 ml) of soy sauce and 2 ½ tablespoons (37 ½ ml) of black vinegar to a small bowl. Use a whisk to stir the ingredients together until they’re completely mixed.If you have celiac disease or a gluten-sensitivity, be sure to choose a soy sauce that is labeled “gluten-free.” Some contain wheat or other sweeteners and flavorings that contain gluten.
You can usually find black vinegar at Chinese grocery stores or from online retailers.
You can substitute Worcestershire sauce for the black vinegar if you prefer.;
, When the soy sauce and black vinegar are fully mixed, add 2 tablespoons (25 g) of sugar to the bowl. Whisk the mixture until the sugar is fully incorporated., After the sugar is mixed into the dressing, add ½ teaspoon (3 g) of salt. Use the whisk to mix the dressing until the salt is completely blended in.You can adjust the amount of salt to taste.

, For the slaw, you’ll need 1 small head of Chinese cabbage. Use a sharp knife to cut off the bottom of the cabbage. With clean hands, peel away the stalks to free them from the head.You can substitute a Napa cabbage for the Chinese cabbage if you prefer.

, Once all of the cabbage stalks are removed from the head, it’s important to trim them. Cut off the leafy tip ends of the stalks with your knife and throw them away.If you notice any brown or wilted stalks as you’re trimming them, discard those as well.

, After you’ve trimmed the stalks, run them under cold water to rinse them well. Next, spin them in a salad spinner several times to remove the excess moisture.If you don’t have a salad spinner, put the cabbage stalks in a colander and shake them well to drain the water.
You can also drain the cabbage stalks by patting them thoroughly with paper towel or a clean kitchen towel.

, Once the cabbage is rinsed and drained, use the knife to cut it into ½-inch (1.27-cm) wide julienne strips. When you’re finished cutting, separate the shredded cabbage into thicker stem portions and thinner leafy sections.The thicker stem pieces of the cabbage take longer to stir fry than the leafy pieces, so it’s important to separate them so you can add them to your pan first.

, Add 1 teaspoon (5 ml) of canola oil and 1 teaspoon (5 ml) of toasted sesame oil to a wok or large skillet. Turn the burner to high, and heat the oils for approximately 3 to 5 minutes, or until they are hot and start to shimmer.You can substitute vegetable or olive oil for the canola oil if you prefer.
Toasted sesame oil has a very distinctive flavor so it’s hard to substitute for it. If you can’t find any, though, peanut oil is usually the best option., When the oils are hot, add 1 teaspoon (2 g) of crushed red pepper and 2 ½ tablespoons (8 g) of minced fresh ginger to the pan. Stir them with a wooden spoon, and allow them to cook for 15 seconds.If you’d like your slaw to be especially hot, you can increase the amount of crushed red pepper that you add.

, After you’ve cooked the crushed red pepper and fresh ginger briefly, add 1 diced red bell pepper to the pan and allow it to cook 30 seconds, stirring frequently. Next, pour 1 ½ tablespoons (22 ½ ml) of rice wine into the mixture, and stir fry it for another 30 seconds.You can substitute sake for the rice wine if you prefer.

, Once you’ve allowed the diced red pepper and rice wine to stir fry for a minute, add the stem pieces of the cabbage and 1 ½ cups (75 g) of grated carrots to the pan. Toss the ingredients lightly with the wooden spoon, and allow the mixture to cook for 1 minute.You can also mix in one 8-ounce (227 g) can of bamboo shoots that have been drained and thinly sliced if you like.

, After you’ve stir fried the stem sections of the cabbage and carrots briefly, add the leafy pieces of cabbage to the pan. Use the wooden spoon to toss the leafy sections into the mixture, and then pour the dressing mixture over the slaw. Stir the slaw well to coat it, and allow it to cook for another 30 seconds., When you’re finished stir frying the slaw, use the spoon to place it in a serving dish or bowl. You can serve it hot, room temperature, or cold. Refrigerate any leftover slaw.The hot and sour slaw is an ideal side for grilled meats, such as pork or chicken.

Use a vegetable peeler to thoroughly remove all of the potato skin. Once they are all peeled, chop them into chunks. They don't need to be perfectly or uniformly chopped, but just make sure the pieces are big enough to eat in one bite – or about 1/2 inch (12.7 mm) thick., Fill a pot about half way with water and bring it to a boil. The pot should be large enough to fit all of the potatoes with a couple of inches of space at the top to spare. Once the water is boiling, add the potato pieces. Continue to boil until they are tender, which should take about seven to eight minutes. Keep checking on them regularly, because it's crucial that they do not get too soft. You want them to become tender, but not fall apart. You do not want to wind up with mashed potatoes., Place your eggs in a pot and cover them with cold water. They should be completely submerged, with water about an inch above them. Turn your stovetop to medium-high heat.

Once it's completely chopped, go over the pieces with your knife again to dice them up even smaller. You don't want to have too large of onion chunks in your potato salad. Cut the celery stalks into similarly sized pieces., Remove the eggs and potatoes from the refrigerator and make sure they have completely cooled. Pour the chopped eggs into the potatoes, and then add your chopped celery and onion. Stir these ingredients together., Make sure that you stir everything so that all of the potato is completely coated. These wet ingredients give the Southern potato salad it's creaminess, so it's important not to skimp on these!Choosing between mayonnaise and Miracle Whip is a personal preference. Miracle Whip has a sweeter, spicier flavor than mayonnaise., Give your potato salad a taste test, and decide how much salt and pepper you want to add. Remember to only add a bit at a time. It's always possible to add more. Once everything is stirred completely, sprinkle the paprika on top. The paprika completes the potato salad, both in taste and appearance. Keep your potato salad in the refrigerator until you're ready to serve it. This recipe makes about six servings.If your potato salad stays in the refrigerator without being warmed, it should last about 3-4 days. If your potato salad warms up – for example, if it sits out at a barbecue – leftovers should not be kept in the refrigerator any more than a day."

Whisk together two cups mayonnaise and one cup buttermilk until smooth.,
Toss in your spices, adjusting to your personal taste.,
Whisk the entire mixture well.,
Refrigerate for 2-3 hours before serving for the best flavor.",How to Make Ranch Dressing1," This is the creamy base of your dressing. If you don't feel like using mayonnaise, you can also use 2 cups plain, whole-fat yogurt instead, leading to a slightly healthier ranch dressing. For a ""best of both worlds,"" use half sour cream and half plain yogurt.


Make sure you shake the buttermilk well before adding it.
If you don't have any buttermilk, whole milk will work as well. You can add the juice from 1/2 a lemon to get the sour, buttermilk taste without the buttermilk.;
, The blend of flavors and spices you add are up to you, but the basics are usually pretty standard across the board. You can't go wrong with:


3/4 Teaspoon each of salt, onion salt, and dried parsley
1/4 Teaspoon garlic salt
1/8 Teaspoon each of pepper, dill weed, and thyme

, Whip up the mixture to your desired consistency, making sure that the spices are well distributed throughout the dressing.


You can also mix the whole dressing in a seal-able jar, then shake to evenly mix up the dressing., You can serve the ranch immediately if you want, but it will always be better if you give the flavors time to mix and blend.


This dressing will last about a week in the fridge. It should be kept cold whenever it is not being eaten."

Make your own mayonnaise with an immersion blender for the freshest, tastiest ranch.,
Use a mixture of sour cream and mayonnaise instead of straight mayo.,
Expand across your spice rack to develop new ranch flavors.,
Top the final dressing with freshly chopped parsley and chives.,
Vary the amount of buttermilk, or other liquids, to thin the dressing out.",How to Make Ranch Dressing2," Feeling like the best ranch around? Grab a tall glass jar and your immersion blender and get to work. To make you own mayo:


Crack 1 room-temperature egg into the bottom of the jar
Add 1 cup flavorful oil, usually avocado oil (olive will work also, but may have a stronger taste)
Work your immersion blender into the mixture until you have a whipped, creamy texture.
Continue making ranch like normal., There are a lot of different ways to create that creamy base, and you should play around with the options you like best. Chefs all have their favorite ratios, and you should try out:


6 tablespoons sour cream, 4-5 tablespoons mayo, 1 cup buttermilk1/2 cup sour cream, 1 cup mayo, 1/2 - 1 cup buttermilk1 cup whole milk, 1-1/2 cup sour cream, 1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lemon juice

, While the basics of garlic, salt, pepper, and herbs will do, many chefs want a bit more variety when cooking. Some other spices to consider include:


Smoked paprika
Cayenne (for a little spicy kick)
Oregano
Mustard powder
MSG, also sold as ""powdered Umami""
Finely grated Parmesan cheese

, You can add them with the dry ingredients for a stronger flavor, or just top the dressing with these aromatic herbs. Finally chopped fresh greens will give a refreshing burst of flavor to the dressing., If you like a lighter, thinner ranch dressing, add a little more liquid in. This can be buttermilk, plain milk, or even a touch of water. For the adventurous chef, you could even try out a few more flavorful additions:


White Vinegar, giving a bitter, tangy edge to the dressing
Worcestershire Sauce, with a bit of bite
Tabasco Sauce, to add some heat to the mix."
"
Start with a dairy-free mayonnaise or make your own.,
Add in your medley of herbs and spices.,
Add 2-4 teaspoons of freshly squeezed lemon.,
Thin to your desired consistency with coconut milk.,
Mix and chill for 2-3 hours to blend the flavors.",How to Make Ranch Dressing3," As illustrated above, a simple homemade mayo is easy if you have an immersion blender. Simply blend a room-temperature egg with 1 cup of oil (usually avocado) in a tall, thin jar. That said, you can also buy dairy-free mayo in most stores since most mayo is usually dairy-free!

, This is going to be similar to a traditional ranch dressing, but you should still feel free to adjust and play with the ratios however you see fit.


1 Tsp Dill and/or Thyme
1/4 tsp each mustard powder and ground garlic
2 tsp dried parsley
Salt and pepper, to taste (1/4-1/2 teaspoon each), This will account for the light, tangy sourness of the buttermilk. Start with just 2 teaspoons, then add more to taste as you keep mixing.

, You can't use milk or buttermilk, and water will dilute the taste too much. Coconut milk has a light sweetness to it that will mix will with the sour lemon and any spices you added, creating a delicious and well-balanced dressing.For a thicker dressing, use coconut cream instead of coconut milk.

, Again, you don't have to chill it before eating, but it will be much better if you do. Remember, as well, that there is a raw egg in this dressing. While it will not be dangerous to eat, the dressing will go bad within a week and should be kept refrigerated whenever you're not eating it."

Store the gribiche dressing.",How to Make Gribiche Dressing," Get out two eggs and put them into a small saucepan. Cover the eggs with cold water and turn the heat on to medium-high. Once the water boils, turn off the heat and put the lid on the pot. Let the eggs stay in the pan for 12 minutes. They'll finish cooking and then you can drain the water.If you'd like to save time, you could purchase eggs that have already been hard-boiled and peeled.;
, Once the hard-boiled eggs have cooled to room temperature, peel them and discard the shells. Rinse the eggs and slice them in half, so you can separate the yolks and whites.It's important to have the eggs at room temperature. This will help the dressing emulsify (blend together) easier.

, Place the egg yolks in a small mesh sieve over a large prep bowl. Use a spoon to press the yolks through the sieve, so they become light and fluffy. Set this aside while you prepare the rest of the dressing ingredients.If you don't have a mesh sieve, you can just combine the egg yolks with a fork although the yolks may still be a little lumpy.

, Place the egg whites on a cutting board and chop them into fine pieces. If you'd like a chunkier dressing, you can keep the pieces larger. Set the bowl of chopped egg whites aside., Sprinkle salt and fresh ground pepper into the bowl with the sieved egg yolks. Add one teaspoon of Dijon mustard and one teaspoon of white wine vinegar. Use a whisk to combine the egg yolk mixture until it's smooth.You can use your favorite vinegar for a slightly different flavor.

, Moisten a kitchen towel and wrap it around the base of your bowl, so the bowl is steady. Slowly pour in 1 cup (236 ml) of sunflower or canola oil while you constantly whisk the dressing. The dressing will start to thicken as it emulsifies.If you add the oil too quickly, it will separate and float to the top.

, Set the dressing base aside while you chop the seasonings. Chop a few capers, cornichons, and chervil. You could also use your favorite herbs (like parsley or tarragon). Add the chopped egg whites into the dressing. Stir in these seasonings and adjust the gribiche dressing according to your taste:2 teaspoons lemon juice
1 tablespoon capers
1 tablespoon chopped chervil
1 tablespoon chopped gherkin

, Gribiche dressing is traditionally served with cold meats. This means you can prepare the meat in advance, so it has a chance to chill or you can use leftover cuts of meat. Meats that go well with gribiche dressing include:Leg of lamb
Roasted chicken
Rare roast beef
Turkey breast

, You can dollop the gribiche dressing over cold or hot vegetables. Or set the gribiche dressing on the side, so guests can help themselves. Gribiche works especially well with roasted asparagus and potatoes.For example, serve gribiche dressing with crispy potatoes or potato salad. You could also drizzle it over roasted carrots or turnips.
Keep in mind that gribiche dressing is usually too overpowering for delicate vegetables or greens (like salads).

, Since gribiche dressing is similar to tartar sauce, it tastes great with seafood. You could serve it with crispy fish or a roasted fillet. Set it out when you serve crab cakes or boiled shrimp.

Use your favorite seafood. For example, you can try salmon, halibut, or flounder.

, Try to use the gribiche dressing right after you've made it. If you need to store it or you have leftover dressing, place the dressing in an airtight container. Refrigerate the gribiche dressing for up to a day.

Gradually whisk in the oil.,
Add the cheese and pepper.,
Serve.",How to Make Caesar Salad Dressing1," Using a sharp knife, chop up the anchovy fillets and garlic cloves. Mash the two together with the flat side of the blade, then sprinkle the mixture with salt.A small can of anchovy fillets should contain all you need. Get the anchovies packed in oil, then drain well before using them for this dressing.
If you don't wish to use anchovy fillets, you could 2 tsp (10 ml) of prepared anchovy paste instead.;
, Place the mashed anchovy mixture in a medium bowl. Add the egg yolk, lemon juice, and mustard, whisking well to combine.


Only use egg yolks from pasteurized eggs. There's no heat involved in this recipe, so the yolks won't be cooked.

, Pour a thin stream of olive oil into the mixture, whisking simultaneously. Continue whisking until the dressing becomes thick and glossy.


The ingredients should be fully emulsified, forming a consistently thick dressing.If you are unable to pour and whisk simultaneously, add the oil 1 Tbsp (15 ml) at a time and whisk well after each addition. Adding the oil too quickly can make it difficult to blend into the rest of the ingredients.

, Sprinkle the Parmesan cheese and ground black pepper into the dressing. Whisk to combine.


If desired, you could also add more salt and lemon juice during this step. Perform a taste test and adjust the seasonings as needed.

, Drizzle the room temperature dressing over a prepared Caesar salad. Alternatively, chill it in your refrigerator for several hours and serve the dressing cold.


You can prepare this dressing 24 hours in advance, but it's best to save and use homemade Caesar dressing within one or two days. Keep it in an airtight container in your refrigerator and whisk slightly before serving.

Pour the olive oil into the blender.,

Serve.",How to Make Caesar Salad Dressing2," Place the minced garlic, Dijon mustard, white vinegar, and salt in a blender or food processor. Pulse to combine.Continue until the ingredients are thoroughly mixed. You should still see pieces of minced garlic in the mixture; you do not need to blend them down into a smooth paste.
Note that you should use fresh minced garlic, not dried. If you choose to use whole cloves, smash and mince four cloves before adding them to the blender.

, Add the mayonnaise to the blender. Process for several seconds, or until a thick paste forms.


The mayonnaise acts as a replacement for the egg yolk found in more conventional Caesar dressing recipes. Mayonnaise contains egg, so it can add the same sort of thickness and richness to the dressing while minimizing the risk of food poisoning.

, Continue blending the dressing on low speed. Pour a thin, steady stream of olive oil into the dressing through the top opening, and blend until combined.


Once everything combines into a thick, even dressing, scrape down the sides of the blender with a spatula. Stir the dressing to mix in these scrapings.

, Pause the blender. Add the anchovy paste, lemon juice, Worcestershire sauce, Parmesan cheese, and black pepper. Pulse for several more seconds, or until combined.


Alternatively, you could stir these ingredients into the dressing instead of pulsing them in with the blender.
If desired, you may omit the anchovy paste. The Worcestershire sauce in this recipe will still give the dressing its characteristic deep, salty flavor, but adding the anchovy paste will further emphasize that particular flavor profile.
Taste the dressing at this stage and adjust the seasonings as desired., Toss the finished dressing into a prepared Caesar salad. You can serve it at room temperature or slightly chilled.


Ideally, you should use the dressing within one or two days. Store it in the refrigerator in an airtight container, then whisk well before serving.

Give your friends a lesson on how to eat crawfish.",How to Eat a Crawfish2," Plan to host it in your backyard, a park or another outside area. Crawfish boils are traditionally fun outdoor parties. To set up for the party, you will need the following:


An outdoor eating area
A 60 gallon (227.1 L) pot
A large metal strainer with a handle
Outdoor cooking facilities, such as an outdoor cooking burner

, Depending on the size of the party you're having, you'll need 20 to 30 pounds of crawfish. Plan on ordering 2-3 pounds per person. Most of the weight will be in the parts of the crawfish that are discarded.


If you're in the US South, crawfish is seasonally available in seafood and grocery stores, in addition to crawfish trucks.
Other states, such as California, have locally-harvested crawfish. Check with your local fishmonger.
Crawfish can also be purchased online.
Live crawfish should be kept cool and away from light and heat until they're ready to boil.

, This process is also called purging the crawfish. Place them in a large bucket and fill it with clean water. Use a paddle to stir them around for a few minutes. Rinse them and put them in another clean container.


Don't let live crawfish sit in water for too long, as they will drown.
Some people add a box of salt to the water to help purge the crawfish.
Dead crawfish will float to the top, and should be discarded.

, Fill it halfway with water and bring it to a boil. Stir in the following ingredients:


The juice of 8 lemons, and the lemon peels.
1 pound crawfish boil seasoning.

, Throw in the following ingredients and allow them to boil for ten minutes:


8 onions, peeled and sliced in half
10 pounds new potatoes
20 ears of corn, shucked and cut in half
5 heads of garlic, split in half

, Place the crawfish in a wire basket with a handle, or a strainer, and lower it into the water. Let the mixture boil for five more minutes. Turn the burner off and cover the pot. Allow the crawfish to sit and cook for another 30 minutes. Remove the lid and take the strainer full of crawfish out of the pot. Allow them to drain.

, Spread newspapers over picnic tables or other outdoor tables you have set up. Dump the vegetables directly onto the table, then dump the crawfish on top. Allow your guests to serve themselves on paper plates.


Provide extra spices, butter, and other condiments if desired.
If you would rather not serve the boil in the traditional Cajun style, scoop the vegetables and crawfish directly onto plates.

, Since many people may be new to the experience, give a demonstration on how to twist off and suck the head, peel the shell from the tail, and eat the delectable meat.

Start by sorting through your oysters and selecting the ones which are tightly closed.,
Give the oysters a quick wash before serving them.

,
Hold the oyster down with a cloth against a flat surface.

,
Use an oyster knife with a hand guard, and insert the tip of the knife into the small hole at the hinge of the oyster shell.,
Angle the knife upwards as you push it in, so that you cut the abductor muscle which holds the oyster onto the top shell.,
Serve the oysters immediately on a bed of crushed ice.

,
Pick the oyster shell up, keeping it flat so as not to spill the juices.,
Tip the shell up and let the oyster and its juices slide into your mouth.

",How to Eat Oysters," Discard any oysters which have opened, as these are dead and are no longer suitable for eating.;
,,, Wiggle the knife and push it all the way inside the shell to break the hinge.

, Remove the top shell, keeping the bottom shell flat to conserve the oyster juices. Then cut the abductor muscle holding the oyster onto the bottom shell so that it is lying loose on the shell, ready for serving.

,, Hold it so that the smooth edge of the shell is facing towards you.

Hold the shell in one hand (usually the dominate hand).,
Pull the meat out with a fork.,
Prepare the first bite.,
Take care of the empty shell.,
Finish your meal.",How to Eat Mussels1," Mussels are typically served in a skillet type frying pan, in a bowl with broth, or in seafood pasta. Lift one mussel from your dish and grip it from the base with the open side of the shell facing outward.;
, With your free hand, gently pry the tender flesh from the open shell. You will notice that the meat is still partially attached to the shell, so you may need to use your fork to scrape around the bottom of the meat to remove it from the shell.


Poke at the meat gently and pull it from the shell slowly. Take care not to accidentally stab your hand with the fork.

, If your dish comes with broth, transfer the meat from your fork to a spoon and dip it into your broth. If your dish is served with a seafood pasta, use your fork to gather a bite of noodles. Eat your mussel in one bite.


Your mussels might come without broth or pasta, in which case you will probably be given a rinse bowl for your fingers. If a rinse bowl is present, it is perfectly acceptable to eat with your fingers.
If your dish is served with broth, you can also spear your mussel with your fork and enjoy it with a separate spoonful or broth.

, Typically you will be served a seperate bowl or plate for distended shells. If you are not given a seperate plate or bowl, place your empty shells back onto your plate or bowl. Never plate discarded shells in a communal plate if sharing.


Generally, when eating mussels in the United States, it is considered proper etiquette to discard the shell and continue to use your fork to pry out the additional mussels.

, If eating mussels with broth, you can spoon the broth into your mouth or use a piece of bread to soak some of it up for a delicious bite. Take care to dip one piece of bread a time (you can even spear it with your fork) to avoid double dipping.


If enjoying seafood pasta, alternate between bites of mussels and bites of pasta.
Consume your mussels one at a time until your meal is finished.

Eat straight from the shell.,
Break your first shell in half and use it as a spoon.,
Use your empty shell as tweezers.,
Remove all your muscle from the shell before eating any of them.",How to Eat Mussels2," Anywhere besides a formal dinner, it is acceptable to pick up the shell and fill it with a little bit of the broth and then suck the mussel and broth directly from the shell, although you may still want to loosen it with a fork first.


When your mussels arrive, there will likely be a small amount of meat juice inside the shell, which can be quite enjoyable. Sucking your mussel from the shell allows you to easily enjoy the juices.

, While not generally considered polite in American fine dining restaurants, in other countries, like France, it is commonplace to use your empty mussel shell as a tool to pry out subsequent meat from the other shells.Use one half as a spoon and insert it into your next mussel to scoop out the meat.

, Grip the back of your first discarded shell with the open side facing out. Use your fingers to gently apply pressure to the top and bottom of the shell. This way, you can open and close the shell with your fingers and use it to pick up other shells.

, While this is often considered unusual, it is acceptable in most places to pry out all of your mussels at the beginning of your meal and enjoy them all at once.


Particularly if your mussels come in a booth or soup, this may provide ease in eating.

Season with salt and pepper.,
Season the inside of the trout.,
Loosely fold the foil.,
Bake 10 to 15 minutes.,
Serve warm.",How to Cook Trout1," Meanwhile, cut four sheets of heavy-duty aluminum foil.

The pieces of aluminum foil should be cut into squares that are 3 inches (7.6 cm) longer than the length of your rainbow trout.
If you only have light aluminum foil, cut eight sheets. Double up the sheets to create four thicker squares.;
, Coat the dull side of each aluminum foil square with a small amount of olive oil.

The foil should not be dripping wet, but there should be enough oil to make the surface evenly slick.

, Center each trout on a separate sheet of foil.

Place the trout skin-side down.
Consider leaving the head or tail on while cooking. This reduces the amount of skin that breaks, which allows the flavor of the rainbow trout to come out stronger.Note that most rainbow trout purchased in a store will be butterflied open. This is actually preferable for this recipe, but you can still prepare the recipe without butterflied trout.

, Sprinkle each trout with salt and pepper, to taste.

If you need a rough guideline on how much salt and pepper to use, try a total of 1/2 tsp (2.5 ml) salt and 1/4 tsp (1.25 ml) pepper, evenly spread over all four pieces of fish.

, Open each piece of trout so that they lie flat. Place two sprigs of tarragon or dill in the middle of each fish along with two slices of lemon. Fold the two sides together again.

You could also use 4 sprigs of rosemary instead of the dill or tarragon.
If the trout is not butterflied, you can lay the herbs and lemon slices on top of the fish instead of sandwiching them in the middle.
Drizzle each fish with 1/2 tsp (2.5 ml) of olive oil.

, Grab the edges of the foil and fold them over the fish, crimping them together tightly to form a packet.

Make sure that the trout is centered in the middle of the square before folding the square up.
Place the packets on a baking sheet.

, When done, the flesh of the trout should be opaque. It should also flake easily when pierced with a fork.

Check on packet after 10 minutes. Continue cooking an additional 5 minutes if still undercooked.

, Remove the finished fish packets from the oven and transfer each to a plate. Cut across the top and remove the fish from the packet before eating.

Open the packet carefully to prevent yourself from getting burned by the steam.
Pour the juices from the packet over the fish on your plate.

Cook the shark until its meat is opaque.",How to Cook Shark," Fresh shark flesh will give slightly when pressed with a finger. Purchase shark meat with moist, translucent flesh. It should never be flaky.;
, Cover the shark meat in buttermilk or lemon juice for at least 30 minutes. This will eliminate the smell of ammonia, which comes from the shark losing all of its blood after it is caught.

, Trim off any dark meat from the shark with a paring knife before cooking it. Keep the skin on it, however. The skin will help the shark to retain its moisture while it is cooking.

, The inside of the shark meat should still be moist. For best taste, do not overcook the shark.


Bake the shark by placing it in a baking dish, or wrapping the meat in foil and placing it on a baking sheet. Season it with salt and pepper and rub it with butter or oil before baking. Cook the shark at 450 degrees Fahrenheit (230 degrees Celsius). Cook the shark for 10 minutes per 1 inch (2.5 cm) of thickness.
Grill shark by cooking it directly on the grill rack, and brushing it with oil or butter and salt and pepper, as well as any desired marinades. Grill for 6 to 8 minutes.

Choose a baking sheet with a shallow rim.
Note that steelhead trout are generally quite large, so you should use a large baking sheet instead of a small one.

, Add the butter to a saucepan or small skillet and heat it over medium heat until it melts and begins to sizzle., Add the shallots first, cooking them for 3 minutes until softened. Afterward, add the minced garlic and 1 tsp (5 ml) of grated zest from the lemon. Cook for an additional minute.

If using pre-minced garlic, use roughly 1 tsp (5 ml). You could also use 1/4 tsp (1.25 ml) garlic powder.
Use a hand grater or box grater to produce the lemon zest.

, Remove the pan from the heat and let cool slightly. Squeeze the juice from one half of the lemon into the pan and stir to blend it in., Place the fish on the prepared baking sheet and sprinkle it with a little salt and pepper.

If you are uncertain about how much salt and pepper to start with, try 1/4 tsp (1.25 ml) salt and 1/8 tsp (0.625 ml) pepper.
If the fish is too large to fit across the length of the baking sheet, turn it and let it lay across the sheet diagonally.
Note that steelhead trout has a taste somewhat comparable to salmon, and the two are often used as substitutes for one another. Steelhead trout tends to be slightly thinner, though, so it requires a shorter cooking time than salmon.

, Spoon the flavored butter mixture over the trout, coating it evenly and completely., Use half of your minced dill to season the fish before it cooks.

If you do not have fresh dill, you can use 1 tsp (5 ml) dried dill for every 1 Tbsp (15 ml) fresh dill you might otherwise use.

, Cook the trout in the preheated oven until it flakes apart easily with a fork.

Do not turn or flip the fish as it cooks.
Do not cover the baking sheet.
A thin fillet will cook in 12 minutes, but thicker fillets may take longer.

, Use several spatulas to carefully slide the trout off the baking sheet and onto a serving platter. Squeeze the remaining lemon juice over the fish and sprinkle it with the remaining dill.

If desired, you could also cut the fish into multiple pieces before sliding it off.

Pan-frying is a popular way to cook lake trout. Other common cooking methods include smoking and grilling. Lake trout can be baked, as well, but that method is not quite as typical for lake trout.

, Mix these five ingredients in a shallow bowl or dish until thoroughly combined.

For a smokier taste, you could used bacon-flavored crackers instead of standard saltine crackers.
For a less potent garlic taste, reduce the amount of garlic salt to 1/4 tsp (1.25 ml).

, Beat the eggs and milk in another shallow bowl with a whisk.

In order to serve as an effective egg wash, the eggs and milk must be combined well.
The sides of the dish must be high enough to prevent the egg wash from dripping out. The bowl should have a wide mouth, though, so that it is easy enough for you to dunk the fish in it.

,

Hold the fillet over the bowl of egg wash for 30 seconds or so. Let the excess egg drip off.
If the fillets feel slimy or sticky, rinse them in cold water and pat dry with clean paper towels before dunking them in the egg wash.

, After coating all sides of the lake trout in egg, roll the fish in the crumb mixture to coat all sides.

Each fillet must be rolled in the crumb mixture gently. Otherwise, it could break apart.
Lightly shake each fillet over the bowl of crumbs once you coat it. The excess crumbs should fall off.

, Place the trout fillets in the hot oil and turn the heat up to medium-high. Fry until crispy and opaque on all sides.

Turn the fish once during the cooking process using a spatula. The fish must be flipped carefully in order to prevent it from flaking apart.
Once done, the fish should flake apart easily with a fork. The flesh should also be easy to remove from the bones, if you started with fillets that still have bones in them.

, Remove the trout from the frying pan and transfer to a serving plate.

If desired, serve with lemon slices, chives, and parsley.

Heat the oil.,
Add the butter.,
Season the fish with salt and pepper.,
Cook the trout for 4 to 6 minutes.,
Serve warm.",How to Cook Trout4," Pour the oil into a large skillet and warm it up using medium heat.

Canola oil works well, but you can also use sunflower oil or safflower oil. All three are good choices because they contribute very little additional taste and have a high smoke point.
Give the oil 1 or 2 minutes to become hot before pressing forward.

, After the oil becomes notably glossy, add the butter to the pan. Once it begins to sizzle, stir it into the hot oil already coating the pan.

Let the butter melt completely before moving to the next step.
You could also use margarine instead of butter, but butter will have a richer taste.

, Sprinkle a small amount of salt and pepper over both sides of each fish. A little will go a long way.

Brook trout has a slightly more delicate flavor than other types of trout, so many prefer to cook the trout in a way that brings out the flavor of the fish without adding many competing flavors. For that reason, you should avoid using too many herbs or spices when seasoning brook trout.
Use brook trout that has been cleaned, dried, and boned. You can remove the heads and tails or keep them on. Additionally, you can keep the scales and skin on, since the skin can be crispy and flavorful, especially when pan-fried.

, Once the trout turns light brown on the bottom side, carefully turn it over with a spatula and continue cooking on the other side.

Each side should only cook for 2 to 3 minutes.
Test the fish for doneness by flaking it with a fork. If the trout flakes apart easily and is opaque inside, the fish is done.

, Transfer the fish to a plate. Split the fish in half and serve.

Stick a fork into the area where the dorsal fin is. Lift and slide along the backbone area, splitting the fish apart and opening it up.
If you did not remove the bones before cooking the trout, splitting the fish open should reveal the bones. The bones should appear on one side and can be lifted out with your fingers.

Check the haddock.,
Serve the haddock while still hot.",How to Cook Smoked Haddock1," The size of the pan and the amount of milk will depend upon the quantity of fish you wish to cook at one time. The pan should be large enough to accommodate all of the filets with some room for your spatula, and there should be enough milk to just cover the filets.Alternatively, half heavy cream and half water may be used.
Do not use water alone, as it will pull the flavor out of the fish.;
, Grind fresh black pepper directly into the milk to give the haddock a little extra flavor boost. This is a good time to add other spices if desired. Other spices may include bay leaf, onion, garlic, parsley, or even dill.

, Do not boil the milk, but heat it to just before boiling. If the milk begins to boil over, remove it from the heat immediately until it settles. Once the milk has heated, reduce the heat to prevent boiling. , Place the fish in the nearly-boiling milk, arranging the fish filets around the pan and ensuring that they are covered in milk.

, Allow the fish to simmer in the milk for about 10 minutes on a medium heat. Alternatively, very small filets of fish may be cooked in milk that has been removed from the heat.To do this, remove the pan from the heat and cover it after the fish have been placed inside.

, When the fish are done, they will have become completely opaque, and the meat should flake apart easily. If the fish looks translucent or pieces do not come free with a gentle tug, cook the fish a bit longer.


Be sure to check the widest part of the largest fish filet for doneness. The tapered ends of smaller filets will be done more quickly than others.

, Poached smoked haddock, typically a British dish, is traditionally served with fresh baked bread and butter. The milk is strained off to use as a sauce, and the bread is used to mop up excess sauce off of your plate.


The haddock can also be flaked and used in other recipes such as fish pie or Kedgeree."

You can also add other seasonings if desired, such as a teaspoon of Old Bay seasoning or some dried herbs of your choice., Put your breadcrumbs onto a second plate and place this plate next to the bowl with the eggs in it. Then place the plate with the breadcrumbs on the other side of the egg bowl. You should now have an assembly line set up with flour, eggs, and breadcrumbs.


Try adding 1/3 of a cup of grated parmesan cheese to the breadcrumbs for some cheesy flavored Walleye fillets., Dip the Walleye fillets into the flour first. Make sure that the whole fillet is coated in flour. Then, shake the excess flour off of the fillet and back onto the flour plate.


Use a fork, gloves, or tongs to avoid getting the flour on your fingers.

, Next, take the floured fillet and dip it into the bowl that has the eggs in it. Make sure that you flip the fillet over so that both sides are covered in egg. Allow the excess egg to drip back into the bowl.

, Turn the fillet to ensure that it is completely covered in breadcrumbs. Place the fillet on a clean plate. Then, coat the rest of the fillets in the flour, egg, and breadcrumbs.

, Ensure that there is enough oil to cover the base of the pan. You can use olive oil, canola oil, butter, or just a non-stick cooking spray to coat the pan.


To ensure your oil is hot enough for frying, either drop a square piece of white bread into the oil and it should crisp up, or dip the handle end of a wooden spoon into the oil, and if it is hot enough, there will be bubbles around the base of the spoon.

The ingredients of a salad dressing determine its nutritional value as well as its fat and sugar content.",How to Choose Salad Dressing2," You should be looking for the following measurements on the side label of the salad dressing container.


Fat Content: At times the dressing's container may be marked as ""fat-free"" or ""low-fat"" at the front. These have very low fat content that can be considered negligible (46-97 KJ per serving) as part of your daily diet, although even fat-free dressings do frequently still contain a very small amount of fat. High-fat dressings contain fat content of 20 percent or higher with some going up to 75 percent. Although these are usually self-prepared dressings at home or restaurants, the salad dressings sold at grocery stores rarely have high fat content.
Sugar Level: Diabetics need to know the sugar quantity that the dressing contains per serving in order to maintain their blood glucose level. People trying to lose weight should also try to lower their sugar intake since the body can start to convert and store the sugar as fat. As a general preference, the salad dressing should have less than 15 percent sugars if you're trying to lose weight and less than 5 percent sugars if you are diabetic.
Sodium Quantity: High sodium intake can cause health problems such as high blood pressure, which is why most people want to buy a dressing with low sodium quantity. If you want to keep your sodium intake low, try to use a dressing with less than 1000 mg of sodium per serving.

Serve the haddock with sides.",How to Cook Smoked Haddock2," Bring your oven up to 350F/180C.

, You can use one large sheet for all of the filets or you may decide to use separate pieces of foil or parchment for each of the filets. Either way, the foil or parchment should be about twice the size of the filet(s) it will be covering.

, Place a small pad of butter on top of each fish, then top with desired spices. Spices may include pepper, lemon juice, parsley, bay leaf, dill, or chili powder. Most smoked haddock is salty, so salt is usually not suggested.

, After folding the covering over the fish, roll the edges together to encase the haddock. The fish should be sealed inside the packet.


If desired, you could place vegetables inside the packet for additional flavor, but be aware that many hard vegetables take longer to bake than the fish will, so they may not be suitable for eating unless cooked fully prior to adding them into the fish packet., Foil may be placed directly on the oven racks, or you may put the foil on top of a baking sheet and place the baking sheet in the oven. Parchment is usually less sturdy and may need to be placed on top of a baking sheet prior to placing in the oven.


If you have made one large packet of all of the fish filets, you may want to place the packet on a baking sheet to make it easier to handle without dropping.

, Leave the fish parcels in the oven for about 15-20 minutes, or until the fish is done. When the fish is cooked through, it will have become completely opaque, and the meat should flake apart easily. If the fish looks translucent or pieces do not come free with a gentle tug, cook the fish a bit longer.


Be sure to check the widest part of the largest fish filet for doneness. The tapered ends of smaller filets will be done more quickly than others.

, Any oil (or butter) that you have on hand is acceptable, but olive oil is one of the best choices for cooking fish. No need to measure; just drizzle a bit across the pan and allow it to heat up.

, While the pan is heating, prepare the fish for frying. There are two approaches to preparing the fish: it can be marinated in oil or it can be dredged in flour. Either approach includes adding herbs such as pepper, lemon juice, parsley, bay leaf, dill, or curry powder as well.


Marinate the fish in oil by drizzling olive oil on both sides of the fish, then sprinkling herbs on top. Rub both sides of the fish slightly to cover completely in the oil an herb mixture, and allow to rest for several minutes to set the flavors.Dredge the fish in flour and herb mixture, then shake any excess flour off of the fish., If the fish has skin on one side, begin by cooking with the skin side down. Allow the fish to cook for about 8 minutes, until it begins to crisp and brown.Be careful not to burn the fish. Cooking on medium heat, rather than medium-high heat, will help you avoid burning.

, Allow the other side of the fish to cook for several minutes, until it begins to crisp and brown. If the pan seems especially dry, you may want to add additional butter or oil when you flip the haddock over.The fish will likely not have to cook as long on the top (skinless) side, so keep an eye on it.

, When the fish are done, they will have become completely opaque, and the meat should flake apart easily. If the fish looks translucent or pieces do not come free with a gentle tug, cook the fish a bit longer.


Be sure to check the widest part of the largest fish filet for doneness. The tapered ends of smaller filets will be done more quickly than others.

, Keep the milk, but strain it to remove any chunks of seasoning or fish., In the same pan that the fish cooked in, melt some butter over medium high heat. Then add a bit of flour (roughly the same amount of flour and butter), and stir together well, allowing the butter and flour to cook for 2-4 minutes.

, Slowly pour the strained poaching milk into the flour and butter mixture, stirring well as you pour. Continue adding milk until the sauce is the desired thickness.You can adjust the thickness of the sauce by adding additional milk to thin or adding flour to thicken the sauce. Be aware that the sauce should thicken slightly as it cools as well.

, Stir about 1 tbsp of mustard into the sauce, stirring well to combine. Other spices, such as fresh tarragon, may be added at this time as well., The sauce should be piping hot, and will re-warm the potatoes and haddock. After pouring the sauce over the fish, the meal is complete, and should be served immediately.If you are concerned about the fish and the potatoes being cold, you could add them to the pan and toss them in the sauce over the heat, but be careful not to damage the fish filets (they will taste great, but may not look as pretty if they are broken up while tossing in the sauce).
You can top with a bit of parsley for a nice presentation.

, You may also want to add other vegetables to this method. You can place a bed of spinach between the potatoes and the haddock, or you can serve the haddock on a bed of peas in lieu of potatoes.


It is also common to place a poached egg on top of each haddock filet before pouring the sauce over the meal."

Flaked crab meat and chopped bacon slices mixed with bread stuffing.Wild rice, mushrooms, onions, and herbs.
An assortment of seasonal vegetables, such as chopped zucchini, tomatoes, and spinach., To stuff a Walleye fillet, you will need to slice it in half width-wise first. Place a scoop of stuffing onto one of these pieces. Then, take the other half of one of the fillets and cut that piece down the center to create a hole in the middle.


Place this piece over the stuffing so that it wraps around the edges and leaves the stuffing exposed at the top of the mound.
Drizzle a little melted butter or olive oil over the top of the fillets and sprinkle them with a pinch of salt and pepper, if desired.

Light the grill.,
Season or marinate the fish.,
Grill for 10-12 minutes.,
Serve the pike with your choice of side dishes.",How to Cook Pike2," After giving your grill a thorough brushing, fire it up to a high temperature (around 350°F, or 176°C). Give the racks time to heat up as you finish seasoning and preparing the pike. The hotter the grill, the better the pike will cook and the faster you'll have dinner on the table.To keep the fish from sticking, make sure your grill is as clean as possible and cook for a shorter amount of time on a high heat.You also have the option of using a grill pan, which will offer a more evenly-heated surface to get the pike consistently done throughout.

, Sprinkle a generous dash of dried dill, garlic salt or lemon pepper over the fillets, or brush on a thin coating of molasses and ground ancho chiles. Alternatively, you can marinate the pike beforehand for 3-4 hours in your favorite seafood marinade.Experiment with making your own dry rubs from a blend of ingredients like dehydrated garlic, paprika, brown sugar, coriander and anise.Drain excess marinade from the fillets before grilling. If they’re too wet, they may fall apart when exposed to the heat of the grill.

, Drape the fillets diagonally across the metal rack, concentrating them around the edges of the grill. Turn them once at the halfway point to make sure they cook evenly on both sides. Otherwise, leave them alone—handling them too much will make them more likely to break into pieces.A good general rule of thumb is to grill fish for approximately 10 minutes for every inch of thickness.If you’re using a grill pan, spread the fillets out to keep them separated.

, Grilled pike goes well with other health-conscious items like steamed broccoli, burgundy mushrooms or rice pilaf. Or you could choose a more basic presentation with sliced ripe tomatoes and corn on the cob and let the fish do most of the work. Either way, grilling is one of the most nutritious ways to serve a lean, protein-packed fish like pike.

Wrap the pike fillets in aluminum foil along with hearty veggies like asparagus or new potatoes before grilling to steam a complete meal in one fast and easy step.Throw together a mixed green salad or slaw comprised of fresh seasonal root veggies to provide the finishing touches.

Set the dredged fillets aside on a separate floured plate.For added flavor, season the flour mixture with spices like salt, pepper, parmesan cheese, garlic or onion powder.Batter for deep-fried pike can be made by combining about a cup of flour with the dairy ingredients and giving the fillets a preliminary dip in an egg wash., For pan-fried pike, pour in about a ⅔-1 cup of peanut or canola oil (160-240ml); for deep-fried fish, you’ll need to use as much as a quart in order to totally submerge the fillets. Heat the oil over medium-high heat until it begins to sizzle.Make sure that the pan you’re using is roomy enough to hold the oil and fish fillets without spilling or splattering.

, Depending on the size and thickness of the fillets you’re preparing, it may take a little more or less time to cook them to the perfect crispy finish. Your eyes will be the best judge here. When the fillets are done to your liking, use a pair of tongs to carefully remove them from the pan and set them aside on a layer of paper towels to soak up the excess oil.If you’re pan frying the fillets, don’t forget to turn them over so they cook evenly on both sides.Hot oil tends to cook fish very quickly. Be ready to take the pike out when the batter just begins to darken.

, French fries, hushpuppies, and coleslaw make a perfect match for the mild crunch of fried pike. Some lighter fare could also include slow-simmered green beans or potato salad. Dig in while it’s hot!Try serving fried pike with baked beans and toasted, buttered bread for a twist on classic fish and chips.Enjoy fried pike with savory tartar sauce or a splash of malt vinegar."

Whisk the dry ingredients to incorporate the cinnamon.Set the dry mixture aside while you make the wet dough mixture.

, Soften 1 cup (226 g) unsalted butter and put it into a large mixing bowl. Add 1/2 cup (100 g) brown sugar and 3/4 cup (175 g) granulated sugar. Beat the butter and sugars using a hand or stand mixer with a paddle attachment. Cream the mixture on medium speed for about 1 minute.The mixture should become lighter in color and a little fluffy.

, Add 1 egg to the bowl with the creamed butter and sugar along with 1 teaspoon of pure vanilla extract. Zest 1 lemon and add it to the mixture. Beat the egg, vanilla, and lemon zest into the mixture on low speed.You'll probably need to stop and scrape down the sides of the bowl to ensure that the zest and vanilla are completely mixed in.

, Slowly stir in the dry mixture on low speed, so it doesn't fly out of the mixing bowl. Keep stirring until the dry mixture is incorporated and the dough forms. It should start pulling away from the sides of the bowl. Pat the dough into a disk shape and wrap it in plastic wrap. Refrigerate the dough for 1 hour.Chilling the dough will make the cookies tender and flaky.

, Once the dough has chilled, turn the oven on to 350 degrees F (180 C). Get out a few rimmed baking sheets and spray them with cooking spray. Tear a few sheets of parchment paper and lay them on the baking sheets. Set these aside while you roll out the dough.You can remove the dough from the refrigerator at this point, so it softens a little. This will make it easier to roll out.

, Pour in 2 tablespoons of milk and use a fork to whisk the egg wash. Set the egg wash aside while you make the sweet topping.The egg wash will help the cinnamon sugar topping stick to the cookies and will give them a rich golden color.

, To make the sweet topping, get out a small prep bowl and measure out 1/4 cup (50 g) granulated sugar into it. Add 1 tablespoon of ground cinnamon and use a spoon to stir the topping. Set the sweet topping aside while you roll out the cookies.The cinnamon should be completely stirred into the sugar.

, Unwrap the dough and divide it into three pieces. Sprinkle a little flour on your work surface and place one of the pieces on it. Use a rolling pin to roll the piece into a rectangle that's 1/8th-inch (3 mm) thick. Take a knife or fluted pastry wheel and cut the dough into long rectangles that are 1 1/2 to 2-inches (3 to 5 cm) long. Repeat this with the two other pieces of dough.You can also use cookie cutters to just cut out shapes. Or you can cut the dough into squares instead of rectangles.

, Set all of the pastry rectangles on the prepared baking sheets. Leave 1/2-inch (12 mm) of space between the rectangles. Dip a pastry brush in the egg wash and brush the wash over each rectangle. Sprinkle them with the cinnamon sugar mixture.Sprinkle a lot of the sweet mixture over the pastry squares, since this will also help them crisp up.

, Put the baking sheets in the oven and cook the cookies for 10 to 12 minutes. They should turn dark brown. Remove the baking sheets from the oven and let the cookies cool for a few minutes on the sheet before you remove them to a wire rack. Let the cookies completely cool before serving or storing them.To help the cookies bake evenly, you may want to rotate the baking sheets halfway through the cooking time.
You can store the cookies for up to 2 weeks, if they're in an airtight container.

Stir to break down any remaining unmelted lumps. Be careful removing the bowl from the microwave—it will be hot.Melting the butter, as opposed to whipping it cold, will help make the finished cookie a little more crispy.You may also be able to do this in a large measuring cup for a fast and easy cleanup.;
, Add the white granulated sugar, brown sugar and a couple drops of vanilla extract to the melted butter, followed by one whole egg. Use a metal whisk to beat the butter, egg, sugar and vanilla until they take on a whipped, fluffy texture.It may be necessary to whisk quite vigorously to ensure that the sugar granules dissolve properly. Otherwise, your cookie make come out with a gritty texture.
An electric hand mixer can greatly simplify this task.

, Measure out the dry ingredients and stir them together lightly. Dump them in with the whipped dairy and whisk again for 1-2 minutes. As you continue mixing, the ingredients will begin to set up into a thick dough.Stir from the bottom, turning the dough over on itself as you mix.

, Pour in a couple tablespoons (roughly 20 g) of semisweet baking chips (or more, if you’re a chocolate lover). Use a spatula to distribute the chips throughout the cookie dough. You should now have a little ball of batter that’s the perfect size for a single-serve cookie!If you’d rather wait to bake the cookies, place the dough in an airtight container or cover it in plastic wrap and stick it in the refrigerator until you need it. Use the cookie dough within 3-5 days to ensure that it stays fresh., Set the oven to convection and let it start heating up as you transfer the cookie dough into the ramekin. Make sure to space the racks so that taller ramekins will have plenty of room to rise without sticking.If you have access to one, you also have the option of using a toaster oven. Toaster ovens are the perfect size for baking ramekin cookies., Grease a 6 ounce oval ramekin with cooking spray. Scrape the cookie dough into the ramekin, using the spatula to push the dough to the edges and smoothing it on top. Leave about half an inch of space at the top of the container for the dough to rise as it bakes.No matter what type of ramekin you use, make sure you only fill it about ¾ of the way full to give the dough room to expand.
Store leftover dough, or use it to make more cookies!

, The ramekin will get extremely hot in the oven, and its small, oblong shape might make it hard to handle on its own. An extra baking sheet will make it easier to take the cookie out without accidentally burning yourself.The ramekin you use should be made from an oven-safe material such as metal or ceramic.
Arrange multiple ramekins near the center of the baking sheet, leaving a little room between each for heat to circulate.

, Slide the baking sheet onto the oven’s center rack, with the ramekin in the middle. Set a timer and watch the cookie closely as it bakes. When the top grows firm and turns a dark golden-brown color, the cookie is done!For gooey cookies with a hot molten center, bake for 12-15 minutes. For firmer cookies baked all the way through, drop the temperature to 325 degrees F (162°C) and increase the bake time by 2-5 minutes.Because of the thickness of ramekin cookies, they tend to have more of a cake-like consistency than thinner, crispier cookies.
Depending on the size of the ramekin you use, your cookie may need a little more or less time in the oven. Keep an eye on it and use your best judgment to decide when it’s ready.

, There's nothing better than a fresh-baked cookie straight out of the oven. The outer crust will provide a crisp first bite, while the chocolate chips inside will be gooey and decadent. Give the cookie a minute or two to cool, then dig in!


Reheat leftover cookies for a couple minutes in a conventional or toaster oven, or for about twenty seconds in the microwave.

, Plop a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream on top of the ramekin cookie and enjoy the two together. The combination of warm, chewy cookie and cold ice cream is a match made in heaven. Drizzle with chocolate syrup and top with whipped cream for an even more indulgent dessert.A deep ramekin makes the perfect vessel for holding cookies and ice cream together.

, Include half a tablespoon of walnuts when you’re folding the chocolate chips into the cookie dough. The little nibbles of walnut will give the cookie a pleasant crunch, while their sharp notes will help offset the sugary sweetness. The result is an extra chunky treat.Pulse whole walnuts in the food processor to reduce them to an edible size.
If you’re not a fan of walnuts, try it with pecans, macadamias or even pistachios., Use half the prescribed amount of chocolate chips and supplement them with caramel chips, then finish with a dash of coarse ground sea salt or kosher salt. You won’t believe how well the sweet and salty flavors go together, especially when paired with an ice cold glass of milk.Dust on a quarter teaspoon of fleur de sel prior to baking to give your cookie a seductively salty crust., Rather than limiting yourself to the semisweet morsels that the recipe calls for, make way for rich white or bitter dark chocolate chips. You could even mix-and-match your chocolates to take the flavor to a whole new level.Play around with other flavors of baking chips, as well, such as mint chocolate chips, peanut butter chips and butterscotch.
Substitute hard-shelled chocolate candies for traditional baking morsels."

Pour mixture over the hardened caramel and cover the pan tightly with foil.,
Preheat the oven to 350 °F (177 °C).,
Place the 9-inch pan into the larger pan and pour water into the large pan.,
Bake 40-45 minutes, or until flan is set.,
Allow flan to cool, then move it to the refrigerator.,
Invert the flan onto a serving plate with a lip.",How to Make Cheese Flan," Use a heavy-bottom saucepan, which will help distribute the heat evenly and prevent burning. Stir constantly until the water boils and the sugar begins to dissolve.Before it melts, the sugar may begin to clump in the pan. Just keep stirring and moving it around and it will liquify.You can also prepare the caramel in a microwave. Mix the sugar and water in a microwave-safe cup, then microwave on high for five minutes.The sugar may caramelize before five minutes, so check on the mixture after four minutes. Open the microwave when the mixture has reached a golden brown shade.;
, At this point, the sugar will begin to caramelize. While you don't want to stir it, you also don't want the sugar to burn. Lift the pan and swish it around occasionally, which will help the sugar caramelize evenly.This will take about 12-15 minutes.


Scrape any sugar crystals off the side of the pan using a pastry brush dipped in cold water.Remove the mixture from heat once it has reached the desired shade. It should be a deep golden brown or amber color.

, Once the mixture has reached the right shade, you want to immediately transfer it to the pan you plan to use to bake the flan.Pour the caramelized sugar onto the bottom of the pan and swirl it around or tilt the pan so that it coats the entire pan evenly.


Don't pour the mixture all in one spot--move it around as you pour so it's easier to coat the entire bottom of the baking pan.You must pour the caramelized sugar immediately after removing from the heat, otherwise it may harden before you can transfer it.
If you want to make mini-flan or single serving flan, try using 8 (7- to 8-oz) ramekins., The caramel should set fairly quickly, and it may continue to brown a little. Make sure it has hardened and cooled before you add the custard to the pan.

, You can mix your ingredients in a blender, food processor, in a bowl with a handheld mixer, or with the paddle attachment of a stand mixer. The most important thing is that the cream cheese is smooth and soft--you don't want any lumps in your flan.


If you like your flan firm, you may want to add more eggs. Different recipes call for different numbers of eggs--sometimes up to ten. Know that adding eggs will make a larger flan (and therefore will take longer to bake), and may need an additional tablespoon of vanilla.Using ingredients that are all at the same temperature will help keep your flan from getting lumpy., Continue to blend using your chosen method (stand mixer, blender, food processor), mixing until just smooth. If you want to add additional flavoring, mix it in with these ingredients.


Try not to over-blend or use a whisk attachment to blend the mixture, as this can incorporate air into the custard and result in air pockets.Melt 2 oz chocolate and let it cool, then add to the custard mix with orange zest.
Add ½ cup of guava paste to the mixture for guava and cheese flan.
Mix in ½ cup of coconut milk and 1 tablespoon of rum for a deliciously boozy dessert.

, Once the custard mixture is smooth, pour it into the 9-inch round pan on top of your hardened caramel. You can tap the bottom of the pan to bring any air bubbles to the surface so they can escape your flan.


The caramel may make a cracking sound when you pour in the custard mixture.This is nothing to worry about.
If you are concerned about lumps, pour the mixture through a fine mesh strainer before transferring to the pan.

, Make sure there is a rack in the center of the oven to ensure even baking.

, This is called a bain-marie, or water bath, which allows your custard to bake evenly and not burn.The water should reach about half-way up the side of the smaller pan.


Pull out the center oven rack and place the two pans on the rack before adding water. This way you won't slosh water out of the pan and onto your custard when you try to put it in the oven.The larger pan should have high sides to hold the water. Use a casserole dish or roasting pan, and try to avoid dutch ovens, which hold too much heat.Place a paper towel on the bottom of the large dish, then place the 9-inch round on top. The paper towel can keep the round from sliding around in the water.Use warm or hot water to speed up the baking process.

, It may take up to an hour to bake, depending on your oven and the number of eggs you use. Test for doneness by inserting a knife into the center of the flan. If it comes out clean, then the flan is done. If the knife has some custard on it, then continue to bake.You can also shake the pan a little to check if the flan is done. The custard will wobble or jiggle slightly, but it shouldn't undulate like a wave.Don't allow the flan to brown too much, or you can end up with a film on the final product., Remove the 9-inch pan from the bain-marie and place it on a wire rack to cool. Once the flan is cool to the touch, transfer the pan to the refrigerator for at least six hours.


You can also serve the flan warm, which may be preferable for the cream cheese flan. Allow it to cool for at least 15 minutes before attempting to serve warm.You can make flan up to two days ahead of your meal. You can serve chilled or allow the flan to sit at room temperature for about an hour., First run a knife along the edge of the pan, loosening the flan from the sides.Then flip the pan onto a serving dish and carefully lift the pan off the flan.


Make sure the serving dish has a rim or lip. The caramel will run off the top of the flan and may spill over the sides if you use a cake stand or platter with no rim.
Garnish with coconut flakes or lemon or lime zest if you wish.

Place the pot on the stove, and heat over medium-high to high heat until it comes to a boil., Once the water has come to a boil, add ¾ pound (341 g) of carrots that have been cut into 2-inch (5-cm) pieces to the water. Allow the carrots to cook until they are very tender, which should take approximately 45 minutes.If the pot looks like it’s going to boil over, lower the heat.

, When the carrots are finished cooking, remove the pot from the heat. Pour the carrots into a colander and shake well to remove the excess water.Be careful when draining the carrots. The water will be extremely hot, so it can burn your skin if it splashes on you.

, After the carrots are drained, return them to the pot. Place it back on the stove on medium, and allow them to heat for 1 to 2 minutes to get rid of any remaining moisture. Take the carrots off the heat, and set aside for the moment.Don’t overcook the carrots or they may become too dry. You just want to make sure that they aren’t overly wet.

, To ensure that the oven is hot enough to bake the crust, set the temperature to 400 degrees Fahrenheit (205 degrees Celsius) and allow it to preheat. Next, grease a 9-inch (23-cm) springform pan with butter to keep the cheesecake from sticking.Use can use nonstick cooking spray to grease the pan if you prefer.

, Add ⅔ cup (55 g) of finely ground graham cracker crumbs, ⅔ cup (55 g) of gingersnap cookie crumbs, ⅔ cup (70 g) of ground pecans, and ⅓ cup (67 g) of white sugar to a medium bowl. Toss the ingredients together well until they’re fully blended.If you prefer, you can use all graham cracker or all gingersnap crumbs for the crust.
You can substitute another nut for the pecans, such as walnuts.

, When the cookie crumb mixture is blended, add 4 tablespoons (57 g) of softened, unsalted butter to the bowl. Stir well until the mixture has a crumbly texture that sticks together when pressed.While the butter should be softened, don’t allow it to melt completely.

, After you’ve mixed the butter into the cookie crumb mixture, use clean hands to press the mixture into the bottom of the greased springform pan. Make sure to press the crust mixture 2-inches (5-cm) up the sides of the pan as well.Press the crust mixture into the pan in as even a layer as you can. Smooth any lumps or uneven areas so the crust will cook evenly.

, When the crust mixture is pressed into the pan, place it in the preheated oven. Allow the crust to bake for approximately 7 minutes, or until it is set., When the crust is finished baking, remove the pan from the oven and set aside. Lower the oven temperature to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (175 degrees Celsius) so it won’t be too hot when you’re ready to bake the cheesecake.While you want to lower the oven temperature, you should leave it on so it will be preheated when you place the prepared cheesecake inside.

, Add the cooked carrots to a food processor. Process the carrots for approximately 30 seconds or until they are smooth and pureed.While you’re processing the carrots, you may need to stop halfway through to scrape down the sides of the bowl with a spatula. Scrap down the sides of the bowl as many times as necessary to create a smooth mixture.

, After the carrots are pureed, add ½ cup (100 g) of packed brown sugar, 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of lemon juice, 1 teaspoon (2 g) of orange zest, 1 teaspoon (2 g) of minced, fresh ginger root, ¼ teaspoon (1 g) of ground cinnamon, ¼ teaspoon (1 g) of ground mace, and ½ teaspoon (1 g) of ground allspice to the food processor. Puree the mixture for another 30 seconds.For the best tasting cheesecake, use fresh lemon juice.
Stop the food processor and scrape down the sides of the bowl as necessary to ensure that the ingredients are fully combined.

, After you’ve mixed the carrots with the sugar and seasonings, let the mixture sit for 5 to 10 minutes. The carrot mixture should be cool when you mix in the cream cheese in the next step., Once the carrot mixture has cooled for several minutes, add 2 8-ounce (225 g) packages of cream cheese that have been diced and softened to the food processor. Puree the mixture for a minute until it is fully combined.Make sure to stop the food processor and scrape down the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula before processing it again to ensure that all of the cream cheese is incorporated.

, Once you’ve mixed the cream cheese into the filling, add 4 eggs to the food processor. However, add the eggs one at a time, processing each addition before adding the next.You can use egg substitute in place of the eggs if you prefer.

, After you’ve beaten the eggs into the cheesecake filling, carefully spread it over the prepared crust. Next, sprinkle the top of the cake with ¼ cup (30 g) of chopped pecans.If you prefer, you can substitute another nut for the pecans, such as walnuts.

, Once the cake is prepared, place it in the preheated oven. Allow it to bake for 50 to 60 minutes or until the center of the cake is just set.You can be sure that the cheesecake is finished baking by inserting a toothpick, knife, or cake tester into the center. If it comes out clean, the cheesecake is ready.

, When the cake is finished baking, remove the pan from the oven. Let the cake cool on wire for 10 minutes. Run a knife along the edges of the cake to help loosen it, and allow it cool for another hour.The cake is fairly fragile, so be careful when you’re running the knife around the edges.

, Once the cake is cool, cover the pan loosely with a piece of plastic wrap. Store it in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours before cutting the cake and serving it.You can prepare the cheesecake a day ahead and refrigerate it overnight if you like.
Cover any leftover cheesecake, and store it in the refrigerator. It should stay fresh for 5 to 6 days.

Taste the sauce once it’s made and adjust the seasoning with more salt if needed.;
, Though you can definitely use basic vanilla extract for this recipe, high quality vanilla extract makes a big difference in terms of taste.You can also make your own vanilla extract by infusing vanilla beans in an alcohol like vodka, brandy, or rum. It’s easy to do and you can refill the bottle endlessly without having to splurge., Table salt has a harsh taste that will be too strong for this sweet sauce. Any kind of sea salt, flaky or fine, is good. But for the best taste, use fleur de sel, which has a subtle salty flavor that pairs well with sweets., If you have an allergy to dairy, you can replace the regular butter and cream with goats’ milk butter and lactose-free cream. The sauce will turn out just as delicious., Place it on the stove and turn the stove to medium heat., Keep an eye on the butter as it melts so it doesn’t burn or brown.

, Use a flat whisk to whisk the ingredients together until they are well blended.

, Cook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.

, Add 2 teaspoons vanilla extract and the vanilla seeds, if using them. Whisk to combine.

, If you feel it still needs more salt, sprinkle in more sea salt until you reach a flavor that makes your mouth water with delight.


If you’re making the sauce for an adult crowd, add a shot of bourbon to the sauce to give it a little kick., The sauce will thicken a little as it cools, but it will remain soft enough that you can spoon it straight out of the fridge.


Butterscotch sauce is great over roasted pears, vanilla ice cream, and pound cake.Store the sauce in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 2 weeks.

Ladle on the palm sugar syrup.",How to Make Cendol," Cut the pandan leaves into small pieces to prepare them for blending. Place the pandan leaves in a blender with around 20 ounces (about 600 grams) of water. Blend at a high speed to infuse the water with the color and aroma of the pandan leaves. No large chunks or pieces of the leaves should remain.If you’re short on time or don’t want to go to the trouble of blending fresh pandan leaves, look for pandan extract at your local Asian supermarket.;
, Position a fine mesh strainer over a pot or saucepan on the stovetop. Pour the pandan leaf-infused water through the strainer to catch any leftover fibrous pieces. Stir the water in the pot to check for stray chunks or inconsistencies in texture.The water should be a rich grass green color once the pandan leaves have been blended in.

, Scoop 3-4 ounces (100g) of rice flour, 2 ounces of (50g) tapioca flour and half an ounce (10g) of mung bean flour into the pot with the pandan water. Stir the mixture together with a spoon until the flour is evenly distributed.Traditionally, cendol is made using mung bean flour and/or rice flour. Mung bean flour can be harder to find, but is easily substituted using ordinary rice flour alone.
A little tapioca flour can help thicken the jelly noodles and give them the right firm, chewy texture.

, Turn the stove on to a low heat. Allow the cendol ingredients to warm up, stirring occasionally. As it heats, the mixture will turn into a thick paste. Keep the heat low to prevent scorching the cendol mixture.Thickening the cendol mixture may take 10-15 minutes, possibly longer. The water has to slowly evaporate before the mixture can set up into a batter.

, In a separate saucepan, add the gula melaka, brown sugar and water. Add any remaining whole pandan leaves to infuse the syrup with their flavor, if you wish. For more authenticity and a more complex taste, add a splash of lye or alkaline water.Gula melaka is a product of southeast Asian origin. It is made by boiling and condensing the sap from the date, coconut or sago palm and using it as a sweetener.Gula melaka comes packaged as a solid block. Use a knife to shave away small sections of the gula melaka so that it will be easier to work with., Heat the gula melaka, brown sugar, water and pandan leaves at a medium temperature. The gula melaka and sugar will melt quickly, so keep an eye on the saucepan to make sure the mixture doesn’t burn. Stir the mixture as it cooks down.Supplementing the gula melaka with brown sugar will give the palm sugar syrup a rich caramel flavor while cutting down on the bitterness of the palm.
More pandan leaves are sometimes added to the palm sugar syrup as it cooks, but they are not required.

, Turn the stove top down to the lowest setting and let the palm sugar syrup mixture continue to simmer as you finish preparing the cendol. Break up any remaining lumps in the gula melaka or brown sugar. The longer the mixture simmers, the smoother consistency it will have and the better represented each of the flavors will be.The palm sugar syrup should have a similar consistency to warm maple syrup. If the syrup becomes too thick as it simmers, add more water slowly. By the time it’s finished simmering, it should be thin enough to easily pour over the cendol.

, Remove the saucepan from the heat and set it aside. Let the palm sugar syrup begin cooling. This part of the process can be done while you’re straining or chilling the cendol so that the syrup will still be warm once it’s time to serve.Don’t let the palm sugar syrup cool down too much. At room temperature, it will congeal and begin to harden. If this happens, simply add a splash of water and reheat it until it melts and thins out again, stirring frequently.

, Fill a bowl with cold water and ice cubes. Pour the thickened cendol mixture into a pasta strainer. Then, use a spoon or other implement with a broad, slightly curved surface to force the cendol through the holes in the strainer a little at a time. You may have to wet the spoon periodically to keep the cendol from sticking.The ice water will cause the cendol to become firm so that the noodles will hold their shape.
A potato ricer can also be used to more easily strain the cendol noodles., In a separate saucepan, bring 1-2 cups of coconut milk to a boil briefly. This will eliminate any bacteria if the milk is raw or untreated and can keep it from spoiling as quickly. Reduce the heat gradually and let the milk cool. Once it has returned to room temperature, place it in a smaller container and refrigerate it until it is to be added to the cendol.Simmer the coconut milk with pandan leaves, sugar and a pinch of sea salt and then chill it for a traditional style cendol.
It's always safest to boil coconut milk that has not been subjected to any pasteurization process., After the cendol noodles have had a few minutes to chill and set up, remove them from the cold water and scoop them into your serving dish of choice. Cendol is typically served as an iced drink or eaten from a bowl like ice cream.Use a couple large spoonfuls of cendol for each serving. The final dish should consist of roughly ⅓ cendol, ⅓ ice and/or sliced fruit and 1/3 coconut milk.

, Pour several ounces of coconut milk onto the cendol noodles. At this point, you can add ice, extra gula melaka sugar or various sliced fruits to suit your preference. Some popular traditional choices in Indonesia and Malaysia are jackfruit, red beans, toddy palm seeds and durian.Make sure you buy liquid, drinkable coconut milk rather than the thicker condensed variety.

, Lastly, drizzle a couple spoonfuls of the warm palm sugar syrup over the top of the cendol. Add shaved ice, or ice cubes if you’re having it as a drink. Cendol works perfectly as a light after-dinner dessert, a sweet appetizer to balance the heat of spicy cuisine or simply a refreshing beverage on a hot day.Use a small amount of palm sugar syrup and add more to taste. It will be very sweet, so you’ll likely only need a little.

You can line the baking sheet with nonstick aluminum foil instead of using cooking spray for a mess-free alternative.;
, Slice each kohlrabi bulb into 1/4-inch (6.35-mm) thick pieces and cut each of these pieces in half.

For this method, you only need the bulb of the kohlrabi and not the leaves. Use a sharp serrated knife to slice through the thick bulb more easily. A smooth knife is more likely to slip and, therefore, presents itself as more of a danger.

, In a large bowl, add together the olive oil, minced garlic, salt, and pepper, mixing well to combine.

If you do not have fresh garlic on hand, you could substitute 1/8 tsp (2/3 ml) of garlic powder.

, Toss the kohlrabi pieces into the seasoned olive oil, stirring well to coat each piece.

The garlic does not need to stick to each piece of kohlrabi, but it should still be distributed among the pieces fairly evenly. Break up any large clumps of garlic with your mixing spoon to prevent the garlic flavor from becoming too concentrated in one area.

, Spread the kohlrabi pieces out onto the baking sheet in a single, flat layer.

Choose the freshest beets.,
Remove the beet leaves.,
Trim the beets.,
Clean the beets.",How to Cook Beets1," If you want to choose the freshest, tastiest beets, then you should choose beets that are nice and firm. If they're spongy, that means they're older and won't taste as delicious. Fresh beets will also have dark green leafy tops; beets that are past their prime will have tops with a yellow coloring., Slice the leaves off using a sharp knife. The leaves should be sliced close to the tip of the beet, but not completely removed. Leave a small portion that is just big enough for you to hold. This will make it easier for you to slice the beets, if you decide to do that.


Consider saving your beet greens. The greens can be cooked separately and can be sautéed, roasted, or steamed as well. It won't take nearly as long to cook the greens as it would to cook the beets (just 4 minutes in a steamer will do for the greens), so you'll still have to separate them from the beet, even if you do plan on eating them.

, You can also trim off the long end of the beets. You won't need those for cooking and they can make the beets harder to handle. You can also do this after you're done cooking them.

, Wash them under running water, scrubbing them thoroughly with a vegetable brush until you no longer see any visible dirt. You can also just use your hands, but you have to be thorough about it.

You'll want to leave the skins on to keep the color. It will also be easier to remove the skin after you've steamed the beetroot., The water should be boiling. Place the lid over the steamer basket. No steam should escape.

, If you have large beetroot, consider cutting the quarters even smaller so they cook evenly and faster. Try 1/2 inch slices., Remove the lid and poke the beetroot with a fork or knife.

Let the kale continue to cook for 30 minutes or until it's tender.You can add extra stock or water if you'd like to serve a little of the aromatic liquid with the kale.
Taste the boiled kale and add salt and pepper to taste.

, Boiled kale goes well with a hearty bread or toast. Try rubbing a little garlic on a piece of rustic toast. Top the toast with a fried egg and place some of the boiled kale on top.You could also sprinkle toasted breadcrumbs on top of the boiled kale, if you're short on time and need a quick serving idea.

Heat oil in a saucepan.,
Add garlic, stock, and kale.,
Cook the kale for 5 minutes.,
Serve the sauteed kale.",How to Cook Kale3," Select a large heavy saucepan and heat it over medium-high heat. Add several tablespoons of olive oil the pan and let the oil heat until it starts shimmering.Ensure that your pan is large enough to hold all of the kale. If the pan is too small, the kale won't cook evenly or could take much longer to saute.

, Once the oil is shimmering, add a few cloves of minced garlic and let it cook for about 30 seconds. Turn the heat up to high and add 1/2 cup of chicken or vegetable stock. Stir in the kale so the mixture is combined.If you don't have any stock, you can use water. You may just need to add more seasoning to the sauteed kale.

, Cover the saucepan with a tight-fitting lid and cook the kale on high for 5 minutes. Take the lid off of the pot and keep cooking the kale for a few minutes until the stock or water evaporates. Season the kale to taste and serve it right away.You'll want to salt and pepper the kale. Sauteed kale also goes well with a few tablespoons of red wine vinegar.

, You can easily serve sauteed kale on its own as a side dish or include it in an entree. Stir sauteed kale into cooked pasta or soup to add instant flavor and nutrition. Consider substituting collard greens or chard with sauteed kale the next time you're planning a menu.


You could also saute apples and bacon to stir into the sauteed kale. Sprinkle the dish with pecans or walnuts and serve it while it's still warm.

Heat the oven and prepare your baking sheet.,
Wash and chop the kale.,
Season and bake the kale.,
Serve the roasted kale.",How to Cook Kale4," Turn the oven on to 375 degrees F (190 C). Select a large baking sheet with rimmed sides. The rimmed sides will keep the kale from sliding off as you transfer the sheet from the oven.


If you don't have a rimmed baking sheet, you could use a large roasting pan. Just take care not to overfill the pan or the kale with steam instead of roast.

, Wash the kale thoroughly to remove all dirt and grit. Pat the kale dry and tear or cut away the thick stems. Chop the kale into large pieces and dry them again with a clean kitchen towel or paper towel.To quickly dry the kale, try spinning it in a salad spinner until all the water is removed from the kale.

, Place the chopped kale pieces in a large mixing bowl. Drizzle the kale with one tablespoon of olive oil, one clove of garlic, and salt and pepper. Toss the seasonings together with the kale so the kale is completely covered. Spread the kale on the baking sheet and bake it for 15 to 20 minutes. You should stir it every five minutes, until the kale is crispy and a bit dark in color.The kale doesn't need to be arranged in a single layer on the baking sheet. As the kale roasts, it will shrink down in size.

, For the crispiest roasted kale, serve the kale right after you've removed it from the oven. Roasted kale works well as part of a cheese spread or crudité platter. For example, you could serve the roasted kale alongside pita chips and hummus or a veggie tray.


Roasted kale does not stay crispy for more than a day or two so try to eat the pieces quickly. If you must store them, place them in an airtight container for a few days.

Bring a large stockpot of water to boil.,
Add salt.,
Cook the broccolini for a few minutes.,
Drizzle with oil, lemon juice, and seasonings before serving.",How to Cook Broccolini2," Fill the stockpot roughly two-thirds full with water and heat the water on the stove over high heat., Sprinkle roughly 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of salt into the stockpot for every 4 qt (4 L) of water. Let boil for another minute or two so that the salt can dissolve.

By adding the salt after the water reaches a boil, you cut down on the total amount of time it takes the water to reach a boil. Salt water boils more slowly than regular water.

, Add the broccolini and cook for 2.5 to 5 minutes, depending on how tender you want the broccolini to be.Drain immediately by pouring the contents of the stockpot through a colander. If you allow the broccolini to stay in the hot water longer, it will continue to cook and may get mushy.
Cook for 2.5 minutes if you want the broccolini to be tender-crisp. If you want it to be a little softer without a crisp bite, cook for a full 5 minutes.

, Return the broccolini to the stockpot and add the olive oil, lemon juice, pepper, and garlic powder. Toss with tongs or a spatula and serve while still warm."

Use roughly 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of salt for every 4 qt (4 L) of water.

, Add the broccolini to the boiling water and cook for no longer than 2 minutes.

Drain immediately when done. Pour the broccolini through a colander or remove it from the stockpot with tongs.
If you drag your feet on this step and let the vegetable stay in the hot water for too long, it will continue to cook and may become too tender or mushy.

, Transfer the broccolini to a large bowl filled with ice cold water to stop the cooking process.

Leave the broccolini in the ice water for about 2 minutes. As a general rule, blanched vegetables should be left in ice water for as long as they were left in boiling water in order to put a full stop to the cooking process.

, As the broccolini sits in the ice water, heat the skillet of oil over medium-high heat for a couple of minutes, or until the oil becomes thinner and easier to coat over the pan., Transfer the broccolini from the ice water and directly into the hot oil in the skillet. Cook for 2 minutes, or until warm and beginning to caramelize on the tips.Do not be alarmed if the broccolini sizzles once you place it in the pan. The violent sizzle results when water clinging to the vegetable touches the hot oil. If you want to minimize this reaction, quickly drain the wet broccolini on paper towels before placing it in the skillet.

, Transfer the broccolini to a serving platter and drizzle with lemon juice. Sprinkle with pepper, garlic powder, and additional salt, if desired, and enjoy."

Make sure that you have a steamer basket that fits into the stockpot you use. The steamer basket should not come into direct contact with the water, even after the water reaches a boil.
If you do not have a steamer basket, you could use a metal colander, instead.

, After adding the broccolini, cover the stockpot and steamer basket and cook for about 5 to 7 minutes, or until the broccolini becomes tender.The stockpot needs to be covered for the duration of the cooking process. The steam produced by the boiling water is responsible for cooking the broccolini in this method, and as such, you need to let as much of it build up as possible.

, Transfer the broccolini to a serving platter and add olive oil. You can also sprinkle with lemon juice, salt, pepper, and garlic powder, if desired. Toss with tongs to coat well and enjoy."

You could also use a shallow baking dish instead of a baking sheet, but avoid roasting pans with tall sides.
Lining the pan with aluminum foil or parchment paper is not recommended. You can, however, coat the pan with nonstick cooking spray if you are running low on cooking oil.

, Keep the pieces in a single layer.

By arranging the broccolini in one layer, you ensure that the individual pieces cook as evenly as possible.

, Drizzle 2 to 3 Tbsp (30 to 45 ml) of olive oil over the broccolini and toss lightly with a spatula or tongs to coat evenly.

It is a good idea to toss the broccolini in oil before tossing it in any other seasonings. The oil provides and even coating for the other seasonings to stick to, making it easier for those seasonings to stick for the duration of the cooking process.

, If desired, sprinkle the lemon juice, garlic powder, and salt and pepper to taste over the broccolini on the baking sheet. Toss well once more to coat again., Roast the broccolini in the preheated oven, uncovered, for about 10 to 15 minutes.Stir the broccolini occasionally as it cooks to ensure that all sides and stems get evenly cooked.

Microwave until tender.,
Drain, season, and serve.",How to Cook Broccolini6," Arrange the broccolini in even layers.

If necessary or desired, you can cut the broccolini into smaller pieces. The smaller pieces can be easier to fit inside of a cramped microwaveable dish, so if you are having difficulty fitting the tall, skinny pieces in the dish, cutting them up is a viable option.

, Add 3/4 cup (190 ml) water, 2 Tbsp (30 ml) olive oil, and 2 Tbsp (30 ml) lemon juice to the broccolini. Stir well so that all the broccolini has been coated in the mixture.

Ideally, the broccolini should be mostly submerged under the liquid. If some of the broccolini is submerged but some is not, it may not cook evenly.

, Cover the dish with a microwave-safe lid or microwave-safe plastic wrap and cook, on high, for 5 minutes.

Pause the microwave halfway through to stir the broccolini in the dish. This is especially important if some of the pieces are submerged in liquid and others are not. This can be skipped, however, if all of the pieces are evenly submerged.

, Pour the contents of the dish through a colander to drain the water. Season with salt and pepper, to taste, and enjoy."

Preheat the oven to 400ºF (204ºC).,
Prepare your baking sheet.,
Wrap the beets in aluminum foil.,
Cook the beets in the oven for 50-60 minutes.,
Add water if the beets start to scorch.,
Test the beets for doneness.,
Let them cool.,
Peel the beets.,
Serve.",How to Cook Beets2,", Find a shallow baking sheet that is suitable for roasting your beets. Covering the baking sheet with aluminum foil is not necessary to prevent the beets from sticking, but beet juice may leak out, and a lining could make cleaning up easier when all is said and done.

, Make sure that the beets are still moist from being washed. If they have dried, rinse them once more to slightly moisten to exterior. Loosely wrap the foil around each beet. It does not need to be form fitting, but the foil should stay on without further assistance. You can wrap small beets together, but wrapping them individually works best.


If you want to skip this step, you can put oil on the beets instead to keep them from burning. Drizzle the beets in olive oil or vegetable oil (about 1 tablespoon of olive oil or 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil per pound of beets will do). Then, generously season them with salt and pepper to taste. You can also quarter them to make them finish cooking more quickly; quartered beets can be cooked for 45 minutes, instead of whole beets, which will take a bit longer.

, Place them on the prepared baking sheet and put them in the oven for roasting.

, Check the beets every 20 minutes as they cook. If they start looking dry or if you notice scorch marks on the bottom, gently pull the foil away from each beet and pour 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of water onto the beet. Return the foil to its previous position and continue roasting.

, The beets will be fully roasted when you can stick a fork into the center and slide it out without any resistance. This will mean that the beets are cooked through. At this point, you should remove them from the oven. The smaller beets will cook more quickly than the larger beets.

, Wait at least a few minutes for the beets to be cool enough to touch.

, When the beets are cool enough, peel the outer layer of skin. Hold each beet in a paper towel and gently rub the skin away with the edges of the towel. The skin of a fully roasted beet should peel away without any difficulty. You won't need a knife or another sharp object to do this. You can consider wearing gloves to avoid getting beet juice over your hands.

, You can enjoy these tasty roasted beets whole or hold on to the grip and slice them. These roasted beets can be enjoyed on their own or can be perfect for a salad.

Rotate the beets and microwave them for another 3-5 minutes.,
Cool the beets.,
Peel the skin.,
Serve.",How to Cook Beets3," Try using a 4 quart (4 liter) glass bowl. The bowl needs to be large enough so that the beets fit inside in a single layer. Do not stack the beets. You can put them in the bowl whole or you can even quarter them., Drizzle the water over the beets, wetting the tops and allowing it to run down the sides. Do not attempt to microwave the beets without water.

, Place a lid over the bowl or loosely cover the bowl with plastic wrap., Rotate the beets so that a new part of them is facing up to ensure that the are evenly cooked. Continue to microwave them until they feel tender when a fork is stuck inside.

, Allow the beets to cool in the microwave for one minute. Remove the beets from the microwave and cool for an additional four minutes, or until they feel cool enough to handle. Leaving them with the cover on can help steam them and cook them a bit further. This is better than overdoing it with the microwave, because microwaving the beets can make it harder to preserve their nutritional value., Gently rub the skin with a paper towel until it flakes off. If the skin does not flake off, use a vegetable peeler to gently peel the top layer of skin away. This may also mean that you should cook them for another minute so they become more tender.

, These microwaved beets are ready to be enjoyed on their own, in a salad, or in another recipe of your choice. You can enjoy them quartered, whole, or sliced.

Serve.",How to Cook Beets4," Use a vegetable peeler to remove the skin from the beets before cooking them., The strips should be about 3 inches (7.6 cm) long and 1/2 inch to 1 inch (1.3 to 2.5 cm) thick. Wider strips will be easier to fry without burning, but they may take a little longer to cook through.

, Put 1/4 cup (60 ml) cornstarch in a metal or dark bowl. Avoid plastic bowls, since the raw beet juice is more likely to stain plastic. Add the beet strips to the bowl and gently toss them in the cornstarch using a fork until they are lightly coated.

, You will need about 4 inches (10 cm) of oil. Attach an instant-read candy thermometer on the side of the pot and continue heating the oil until it reaches 340 degrees Fahrenheit (171 degrees Celsius).

, Cook the beets in batches, adding no more than a handful of the strips into the oil at a time. Fry the beets until they are crisp and lightly browned outside but tender inside, about three to five minutes.

, Use a heat-resistant slotted spoon to remove the beets and drain the oil by placing them on plates lined with paper towels. Allow the beets to cool before serving.

, Enjoy these beets on their own, in a salad, or even use them to make borscht, a traditional Ukrainian beet soup.

That's 175 degrees Celsius.
;
, The bread pieces (or breadcrumbs, crackers, or oatmeal) act as binders and make sure that you meatloaf hangs together well. To this end you want the bread pieces to be well torn up.









If you're using oatmeal, it is best to use a food processor to grind it up, so that it is in smaller bits, because that will act as a better binder. However, it isn't entirely necessary, so if you can't grind it, your meatloaf will still come out fine (just a bit more crumbly).


, It's best to do this so that if you get a little bit of shell in with the egg you can easily get rid of it. You'll then want to lightly beat the egg in preparation for adding it to the ground beef mixture.








, You want to mix these ingredients enough so that they are blended well, but not too much. Be gentle with the meat otherwise it will get tough and no one wants tough meatloaf.









, It's best to do this with your hands, since you'll need to shape the mixture into the meatloaf shape. Again, be gentle and only mix so much as you need to have everything nicely blended together.








, Instead of using a bread pan, it is best to use a cookie sheet without sides, so that the fat can run off from the meatloaf. If you do use a bread pan, you'll have a greasier meatloaf.









On the cookie sheet, form the meatloaf into the shape of a bread loaf (like you would if you were making it in the bread pan).


, The juices will run clear when the meat loaf is fully cooked.









, You'll want to let it cool for a bit beforehand (you can cover with a bit of tinfoil). This way the meatloaf will be much easier to cut and serve without crumbling everywhere.








, You can serve it with mashed potatoes, baked cauliflower, a nice fresh salad, anything you want.








, Try mixing in thin slices of potato, peppers, mushrooms, celery, beans, carrots, etc. You'll want to make sure that they are well sliced, by hand or in a food processor.








, You can either put cheese in the mixture of the meatloaf itself, or over the top. You can even spread the meatloaf mixture out flat on a non-stick surface and put cheese in the middle and roll the meatloaf around the cheese, so that you'll have a super cheesy inside to the meatloaf.









Try good old cheddar mixed with pepper jack cheese for a spicier flavor.
Blue cheese is great if you want a smokier taste.

, You'll want to let the meatloaf cook for at least 10 minutes before adding this on top. There are lots of different glazes you can make, from something as simple as brushing a little Worcester sauce over the top, to more complicated versions.









One version is to mix ketchup, Worcester sauce, honey, cumin seeds and a little tabasco together and brush over the top of the meatloaf. If you do this to a basic meatloaf it will give it a little more flare.

, Add fresh or dried herbs to the mixture, or add red pepper flakes, and garlic. Experiment with different herb and spice combinations to see what you like the best. Make it spicier with more peppers, or add a little fresh rosemary.








, You can try adding different kinds of meats to the ground beef for different flavors and fat content. Just replace that 1/2 pound of ground beef with whatever meat you want to try.









For a spicier version add some spicy sausage to the ground beef mixture.
Adding ground pork makes for a higher fat content and adds a nice, different taste to the meatloaf.

, To check if meat loaves are cooked, stick the meat thermometer into one loaf in the center of the dish. Watch the line until it stops moving. When the line stops at 165F, the loaves are done. If it doesn't go that high, bake loaves a little longer and test again with the thermometer. Use the pot holders to take the dish out of the oven-it will be hot and heavy. Use the pancake turner to carefully take loaves out of the dish.

Make the pie crust.,
Cut the butter or shortening into the flour.,
Mix cold water into the flour mixture.,
Use your hands to form the dough into a ball.,
Roll the crust.",How to Make Meat Pies1," Mix flour and salt into a large mixing bowl. Stir 1 1/4 cups flour and 1/4 tsp salt together in a large mixing bowl.;
, There are many different methods of cutting the butter into the flour, but all are equally effective with the right amount of elbow grease. Keep the butter at a cool temperature and begin by cutting large chunks. Keep cutting your chunks down until the butter is mixed in thoroughly. Aim to get small and uniform pea-sized chunks.


Use a food processor. The easiest way to cut the butter is to use a food processor, pulsing the flour mixture for a minute or two, until the butter is chopped up to the appropriate size.
Use a pastry cutter for butter or shortening. A pastry cutter is a great way of chopping up the butter in a good uniform mixture, quickly and without much effort. Roll the pastry cutter through the flour mixture, clearing out the butter from behind the tines after you make each pass around the bowl, if necessary. It shouldn't take more than a few minutes.
Use a fork or two knives. If you don't have a pastry cutter or a food processor, don't worry. You can cut up the butter with the flat side of a table fork, or use two knives to slice the butter in opposite directions, or even just use the end of a metal spatula.
Just use your fingers with shortening. Shortening won't be greatly affected by the heat from your hands or from the room temperature, making it easy to crumble using your fingers.

, Pouring cold water one tablespoon at a time into your flour will help you integrate the water gently, allowing the dough to form loosely. The mixture should just barely come together and form a loose ball, and shouldn't be damp or wet looking.


Be very gentle. The key to a flaky crust is to make sure you don't overwork the dough. If you overwork the dough, the crust will become tough and difficult to handle.
Your mixture will form soft lumps. These lumps should be moist enough that they will hold together if you gently press them between your fingers.

, Very gently, pull the flour into a ball and then split the ball into two equal portions. The recipe should make two portions, one will be the bottom of your pie, and the other will be the top cover.


It's usually a good idea to chill the dough in the refrigerator until you're ready to roll it out and bake with it. If you've already got the oven pre-heated and you're anxious to get started, putting it in the freezer can be a good way to get the temperature down quickly.
If you want to save the dough for a longer period of time, freeze it in a self-sealing freezer bag. When you're ready to use it, let it defrost in the fridge overnight and roll it out normally.

, On a lightly floured surface, flatten the dough with your hands and roll from the center to the edges with a rolling pin dusted with flour. Aim to form a circle about 12 inches in diameter.

Cook your meat.,
Discard the grease or fat.,
Add the vegetables and beef broth.,
Thicken your pie filling (optional).",How to Make Meat Pies2," In a large skillet over medium heat, add 2 cups ground beef and 1/2 cup chopped onions. Season with thyme, cloves, chopped garlic (if desired) and salt. Cook over medium heat, stirring to crumble the meat and mix in the spices, until the meat is evenly browned.If you'd like a more flavourful pie, you can also use a dash of cinnamon and nutmeg as seasoning.

, Once your meat is cooked through, use a wooden spoon or spatula to push your meat to one side of the pan and tilt the pan away, letting the grease pool on the other side. Spoon it grease out, or carefully tilt your pan over a grease safe container to dispose of it. Place your cooled grease into a sealed non-recyclable container and discard it into your regular trash can.Do not dump grease into the kitchen sink or toilet bowl or even use hot water to wash it down the drain. This allows grease to get into the sewage system or harden in your pipes.
Be careful whenever handling hot grease.

, Chop 1 potato into small pieces and add it to the skillet with 1 1/4 cup beef broth to start. Pour in 1 1/2 cup carrots and peas. The beef broth will keep your filling moist once the grease has been drained out.


You can peel your potato if desired.
If you want something different, try using a sweet potato instead.
You can also add more or less beef broth as needed, but don't let your filling get too soupy.

, You may need to thicken your filling if it gets too runny. This can be done in a number of ways. Here are some things to consider:Mix two tsp. of flour with 1/4 cup cold water or 1 tbsp. cornstarch with 1/4 cup cold water before stirring it into your mixture
Thicken with flour. For each cup of filling, use about 2 tbsp. of flour. Add the flour in increments of 1 tbsp. Add the flour slowly and stir in each addition. This will help prevent lumps from forming in your filling. Cook and stir for 1 additional minute until your sauce is thickened and bubbly.
Thicken with cornstarch. For each cup of sauce, use 1 tbsp. of cornstarch. Add the cornstarch in increments of 1 tbsp. and stir until thickened and bubbly. Add 2 minutes to your cooking time for cornstarch.

Avoid stretching the pastry.

, Trim to about 1/2 inch beyond the edge of the pie plate and fold the extra pastry under to create a thicker crust on the rim.

, To assemble your pie, slowly pour the filling into the pastry-lined pie dish. Level it off and don't overfill your dish.

, Roll out an additional circle of dough or pastry and carefully place it over your pie. Pinch the edges of the bottom layer and top layer of dough together and create the knuckle-like pie edge ridges. Trim off any excess using a sharp knife.

, Use a sharp knife to cut some vents into the top crust to allow the steam to escape when cooking.


Brush the top of your crust with egg or melted butter. This will help keep the crust moist and prevent cracking.

, Place your pie onto an oven rack in the center of your oven and cook for about 45 minutes or until the top of the pie is golden brown.When your pie comes out of the oven, it will be hot! Make sure to let it cool on the countertop before serving.

, Roll your pieces into about 8-inch flat circles. If your dough is very warm, it may be difficult to handle, cool it in the refrigerator for about 5-10 minutes if necessary.

, Evenly divide your filling into about 3/4 cup per individual pie and scoop it onto half of each dough circle. Carefully fold the dough over to cover the filling and use your fingers or a fork to press the edges together.

, Use a sharp knife to cut a few slits into the top of your pies. This allows steam to escape when baking and helps to prevent the pie from cracking or bursting in the oven.


Brush the top of your pockets with egg or melted butter to keep the top moist.

You can use your hands to do this as well, as long as you don't mind the texture of the meat.

, Roll the meat into small balls first, then gently flatten them with the palm of your hand until they are ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) thick.You will have enough meat to make about 12 small patties or 4 to 5 larger ones., There are two ways you can cook the meat patties, and it all depends on your personal preference. Broiling will give you dryer patties, while frying will give you oilier ones. Whichever method you choose, make sure that there is no pink left inside the patties when you are done.


To broil the patties: preheat your broiler first, then place the patties onto a baking sheet. Broil them for 8 to 10 minutes.To fry the patties: heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Fry smaller patties for 3 to 4 minutes turning once.

Set your oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (177 degrees Celsius), and allow it to fully heat.Make sure that you know how your oven alerts you that it’s preheated. It may beep or flash a light to let you know.;
, Tear 3 slices of whole wheat bread into several smaller pieces, so you can toss them into the bowl of a food processor. Pulse the food processor until the bread becomes fine crumbs, which should take 25 to 30 seconds.You may find it easier to make the breadcrumbs if the bread is slightly dried out before putting it in the food processor. Leave it out on the counter, uncovered, for several hours or overnight.
If you don’t have a food processor, you can turn your bread into crumbs in a blender. Just make sure to add the bread in small batches or it may become gummy.You can also use a knife to create breadcrumbs. Cut your bread slices into strips, and then gather the strips together to cut them into smaller crumb-like pieces.

, Spread the breadcrumbs out on a baking sheet in an even layer. Place the sheet in the preheated oven, and allow the crumbs to bake until they are golden brown, which should take approximately 10 to 12 minutes.This recipe will make approximately 1 cup of breadcrumbs. You’ll only need about half for the chicken, so store the remainder in an airtight container. They’ll keep in your pantry for a couple of weeks and in your refrigerator for about a month.
If you plan to prepare your chicken Parmesan right after you make the breadcrumbs, don’t turn the oven off when you remove the baking sheet from the oven.

, When you’re ready to prepare the chicken, you’ll need to adjust the oven temperature. Turn it up to 450 degrees Fahrenheit (230 degrees Celsius), so it will be hot enough to create a crispy coating for the chicken. Next, lightly spray a baking sheet with nonstick cooking spray.If you don’t want to use cooking spray, you can grease the baking sheet with olive oil in an oil mister.

, On a clean work surface, cut 3 8-ounce (227 g) boneless, skinless chicken breasts in half horizontally. That will create 6 cutlets for the chicken parmesan.Make sure to thoroughly wash your hands, cutting board, knife, and any other items that come into contact with the raw chicken to avoid spreading bacteria throughout your kitchen.

, Once the chicken is cut into smaller cutlets, season them with salt and fresh ground black pepper to taste. Be sure to flip the cutlets over so you can season both sides., In a shallow bowl, mix together ½ cup (63 g) of the breadcrumbs you made earlier, 3 tablespoons (15 g) of grated Parmesan cheese, ¼ teaspoon (1 g) of garlic powder, and ½ teaspoon (1 g) of Italian seasoning. Toss well to ensure that all of the ingredients are fully combined.You can adjust the seasonings in the breadcrumb mixture to suit your taste. For example, if you love garlic, you can increase the garlic powder. If you aren’t a fan of garlic, you can add less or omit it completely.

, Add 2 teaspoons (9.5 g) of unsalted butter that’s been melted and 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of olive oil to a small bowl. Stir well to ensure that they’re fully combined, and then use a pastry or basting brush to lightly brush both sides of the chicken cutlets with the mixture.If you don’t have a brush to coat the chicken cutlets, you can use a heavy-duty napkin, coffee filter, or piece of paper towel. Just make sure that the item you use isn’t so flimsy that it leaves bits of paper behind on the chicken., Once the chicken is covered with the butter and oil mixture, press the cutlets into the breadcrumb mixture. Make sure to coat both sides of the chicken, and shake off the excess., When the chicken is coated with the breadcrumb mixture, set the cutlets on the greased baking sheet. Use an oil mister to lightly mist the top of the chicken with olive oil.If you want to cut calories even further, you don’t have to mist the chicken with the oil. However, keep in mind that the finished chicken may not be as golden or crispy if you don’t.

, Place the baking sheet in the hot oven, and allow it to bake until the bottom is golden brown, which should take approximately 20 minutes. Remove the chicken from the oven to flip the cutlets over, and bake an additional 5 to 6 minutes until the other side is golden brown too.You should cook the chicken until the center is cooked through. You can check by slicing into one of the cutlets and taking a peek. The meat should be white, with no hint of pink.

, While the chicken is baking, pour 2 cups (546 g) of a store-bought marinara or tomato sauce into a large skillet. Heat on your stovetop on medium until the sauce is warmed through, which should take approximately 2 to 3 minutes.You can use homemade marinara or tomato sauce if you prefer.

, When the chicken is finished baking, add the cutlets to the sauce. Sprinkle 1 ½ tablespoons (11 g) of grated part-skim mozzarella cheese on each cutlet.While you may be tempted to use a fat-free mozzarella to save even more calories, it doesn’t melt very well. Use the part-skim mozzarella to cut calories from a full fat version while still having a nice melted layer of cheese on your chicken parmesan.

, Place the lid on your skillet, and allow the chicken parmesan to heat until the mozzarella melts, which should take approximately 2 to 3 minutes. Serve the chicken parmesan while it’s still hot.If you don’t have a lid for your skillet, you can cover it with a baking sheet or a piece of foil

Consider grinding the fat down further.,
Preheat an oven to 225 degrees Fahrenheit (107 degrees Celsius).,
Pour a little water into a Dutch oven.,
Add the fat.,
Place in the hot oven for several hours.,
Add a little water to a slow cooker.Pour the water directly into the bottom of the slow cooker, using 1/4 cup (60 ml) for every 4 qt (4 L) capacity or so.,
Place the fat inside.,
Set the slow cooker to low.,
Stir and continue rendering until done.,

Heat on medium, stirring often, until done.Remove the lid and give the fat a good stir.,
Let the lard cool.,
Remove any remaining chunks.,
Pour the lard into jars.,
Refrigerate the lard.,
Use as you would use any other solid cooking fat.",How to Make Lard," If you want to make the lard as healthy and beneficial as possible, you should purchase pork fat from a local farmer instead of a grocery store butcher.


You can usually find a local farmer who raises pigs by asking around at your nearest farmer's market.
You can also try small ""family run"" butchers or specialty markets.;
, There are three main types of pork fat, and each type produces lard that is best used for different purposes.


Back fat, also called fatback, comes from the back, shoulder, and rump of the pig and is located directly beneath the skin. It works well for sauteing and frying.
Belly fat is rich and layered with meat. Bacon is actually cured pork belly. Rendered belly fat can also become lard used for frying, however.
Leaf lard is fat located around the pig's kidneys. It is the cleanest fat and is the most suitable if you want to make lard used for pastries and baked goods.

, Use a very sharp knife to cut the fat into 1-inch (2.5-cm) strips. Cut across the strips crosswise to produce 1-inch (2.5-cm) cubes.


The pieces should be at least this small. The smaller they are, the easier it will be to render lard from them.
Cut away as much meat and skin from the fat as you dice it, as well.
Also note that it will be easiest to cut the fat if it has been chilled or partially frozen beforehand.

, To produce even more rendered lard, put the cubes of fat through a meat grinder and grind them down into even smaller pieces.


Alternatively, you could put the lard cubes into a food processor and slightly pulse them into shreds. Use no more than a handful at a time, however, since you could wear the motor out if you stress it with too much.
You could skip the cutting and grinding process completely by asking the farmer or butcher to grind the fat down before you take it home.

, The oven needs to be set to a low temperature to prevent the fat from burning as it renders., Fill the pot with about 1/4 inch (0.625 cm) of cool to warm water.


The water prevents the fat from browning too quickly at the start of the process. As the fat continues to cook, the water will evaporate, so it should not affect the quality of your lard.
Use a cast iron Dutch oven for best results. If you do not have one, another deep, oven-safe pot would also suffice.

, Place the chopped or ground fat in the pot. Spread the pieces out evenly to ensure even rendering.

, Stir the fat every 20 to 30 minutes or so. Remove the pot from the oven once the chunks stop giving off fat.


This process will usually take at least two hours. That amount of time will increase depending on the size of your pot and the amount of fat you choose to render.
It will likely be obvious once the fat has been rendered off. If you think the chunks look the same way they did 40 to 60 minutes earlier, you've probably gotten as much fat from them as possible.

,


The water prevents the fat from burning as it melts down. Since it will evaporate out, the water will not damage the quality of the lard.

, Lay the pieces of pork fat inside the slow cooker, arranging them in even layers.


You'll need more than one layer, but the layers should still be even so that the pork fat renders evenly.

, Place the lid on the slow cooker and set the machine to low. Let it run for a full hour without opening it

, After an hour, remove the lid and stir the fat. Continue rendering the fat with the lid off until done.After the first hour, you should check on the fat every 20 to 30 minutes to make sure that it is not burning. Stir each time you check it.
You may wish to ladle out some of the liquid fat throughout the process. Doing so can make it easier for the rest of the solid fat to melt down.
The fat is ready once the cracklings (crisp residue) begin sinking to the bottom of the slow cooker. These cracklings should still be soft, however, and not crispy.
The entire process will usually take two to eight hours, depending on the size of your slow cooker and the amount of fat being rendered.

, Arrange the pieces of pork fat in a large stockpot, keeping them in even layers.


The more even your layers are, the easier it will be to render the fat at an even pace and prevent any from burning.

, Pour roughly 1/4 cup (60 ml) of water over the fat inside the stockpot.


You only need a little water. The water can help prevent the fat from burning during the initial stages, and it will evaporate from the stockpot as the fat continues to heat up.

, Allow the fat to render for about 30 minutes without disturbing it.


The fat will only begin to partially melt during this time. The solid chunks will look more translucent, and some liquid will start to come off.

, Increase the heat to medium, then continue rendering the fat for another hour or so.


Keep a close eye on the fat to make sure that it does not burn.
You may want to remove and strain some of the rendered fat as it melts down. Doing so can help the rest of the fat melt down quicker.
The fat should be ready once the leftover cracklings start sinking and becoming crispy.

, Remove the lard from the heat source and allow it to cool to a lukewarm temperature.


It is very important that you wait until the lard has a chance to cool slightly before pouring it into glass jars. Hot lard can cause the glass to weaken, crack, or break.

, Ladle the rendered fat through a fine-mesh sieve to remove any solid pieces, leaving you with nothing but liquid lard.


Alternatively, pour the fat through a paper coffee filter wedged inside of a cone or funnel, or through a piece of cheesecloth draped inside a colander.
You can pour the lard into a separate bowl or directly into your intended storage containers.

, Transfer the filtered lard into glass jars, then tightly twist a lid onto each jar.


If the jars feel warm to the touch, let them sit out on your counter for another few hours until the sides feel cool. The idea is to make the temperature change as subtle as possible to prevent that glass from becoming damaged.

, You should store the lard in your refrigerator, keeping it there for as long as one month. In a cooled state, lard is soft but solid.


If you want to store the lard for as long as one year, place the jar of lard in your freezer, instead.

, You can use lard in the same way you would use butter or shortening.

If you want to use the lard in a recipe that usually calls for oil, you will need to melt it down into a liquid form.

Put the desired amount of macaroni and cheese in a microwave safe bowl.,
Add some milk.,
Cover the macaroni and cheese with plastic wrap.,
Heat the macaroni and cheese slowly on medium (50%) power.,
Add toppings, if desired, and enjoy!",How to Reheat Macaroni and Cheese1," Make sure your bowl is glass or microwave-safe plastic before proceeding.


Don't reheat more than you are going to use, as the more times you reheat it, the less appetizing your macaroni and cheese will become.;
, Pasta continues to absorb moisture after it is cooked, which means that the longer your macaroni and cheese sits, the dryer it will become.The secret to maintaining or reviving the original texture is to add a bit of milk when you reheat it. The amount needed will depend on your macaroni and cheese. Start by stirring in 1 tablespoon of milk per cup of macaroni and cheese. The milk will not fully incorporate until the macaroni is heated, so don't worry if it looks a bit wet at first.


You may also substitute half and half or cream for a richer texture and flavor.

, Leave one corner slightly open to release steam.If you do not feel comfortable using plastic wrap in the microwave, you can also put an inverted plate over the dish, but be sure to use an oven mitt when removing it, as the plate can become hot. It will also release hot steam that can burn you.

, This will reduce the likelihood that the cheese will break down and separate, resulting in oily macaroni and cheese. Set the timer for 1 minute for a single serving, or 90 seconds for a larger portion. When the timer goes off, stir the macaroni and cheese. Then continue to heat it in 30-60 second intervals until it reaches the desired temperature.


If your microwave does not have a turning carousel, heat your macaroni and cheese in 45 second intervals, and turn the bowl in between.

, Even the most carefully reheated macaroni and cheese can lose a bit of flavor. To perk yours up, try sprinkling on some parmesan cheese, salt and pepper, a bit of butter, or some garlic salt. For a bit more adventure, you might try adding ketchup, a dash of cayenne pepper, or even hot sauce. Bon appétit!"

Preheat the oven to 350º F (175º C).,
Place your macaroni and cheese in a shallow, oven-proof dish.,
Stir in some milk.,
Cover the baking dish with foil, and bake until heated through.,
For a nice topping, add some extra cheese on top.",How to Reheat Macaroni and Cheese2," The oven is usually the best way to heat up large quantities of macaroni and cheese, especially if you are reheating a leftover casserole.

, A glass baking dish is ideal., Add about 1 tablespoon of milk per 1 cup of macaroni and cheese. However, skip this step if you are reheating a mac and cheese casserole that has a crumb or crunchy topping.

, This should take 20-30 minutes.

, Add a layer of shredded cheese (cheddar works great!) to the top of your macaroni and cheese. After 20 minutes, remove the foil, and cook for an additional 10 minutes until the cheese topping is bubbly and brown.


For a bit of extra crunch, you could stir in 2-3 tablespoons of seasoned bread crumbs to the shredded cheese before sprinkling it on top.

"
Get out your double boiler (or improvise one).,
Place the desired amount of macaroni and cheese into the top of your double boiler, or into a saucepan.,
Add milk to the macaroni and cheese.,
Heat the macaroni and cheese over the boiling water bath, or in a saucepan on the burner over medium heat.,
Make adjustments to make up for lost flavor.",How to Reheat Macaroni and Cheese3," The best way to reheat macaroni and cheese and other creamy pasta dishes on the stove is in a double boiler, or bain-marie.A double boiler consists of a saucepan that stacks on top of another pan filled with water. The stacked pans are put on the heat, and the water in the bottom boils, releasing steam that gently heats the food in the top part of the pan.


If you do not have a double boiler, it is easy to make one. Find a metal or glass (preferably pyrex) mixing bowl that fits on top of your favorite saucepan. Add water to the pan, but not so much that it touches the bottom of the bowl. Add your food to the bowl, and place the pan with the bowl on top on the burner over medium heat.If a double boiler is not an option, use a regular saucepan; just be careful not to scorch your macaroni and cheese!

, Only reheat the amount you want to eat. The quality will definitely suffer after a second reheating.

, This helps restore the moisture of the sauce, and the original creamy texture. Begin by stirring in about a tablespoon of milk per cup of macaroni and cheese. You may add more milk as the macaroni and cheese heats if it begins to look dry or sticky.


Adding a half a tablespoon of butter to the macaroni and cheese will improve the taste and texture even more.
You may also substitute half and half, or even cream for the milk for a richer texture.

, Keep a close eye on your pan and stir frequently until the macaroni and cheese reaches the desired temperature and texture. Depending on your stove, this could take 3 to 10 minutes.


Be patient and try not to overheat your macaroni and cheese, or you run the risk of it separating and becoming oily.
If the macaroni looks dry as it heats, stir in some additional milk, one tablespoon at a time.

, Even the most lovingly reheated macaroni and cheese can lose a bit of flavor. Consider stirring in an ounce of additional shredded cheese or a few teaspoons of grated parmesan as it reheats. You might also add some garlic powder or a tiny pinch of cayenne pepper to give it a little extra zing.

Pour the egg, Parmesan, and bread crumbs in and mix thoroughly with your hands.,
Roll the meat into 1-inch (2.5 cm) balls.,
Fry the meatballs on the stovetop over medium heat until browned on all sides.,
Alternatively, bake meatballs for 20-30 min at 350F (175C), turning once or twice.",How to Make Spaghetti With Meatballs1," Use a fork to beat the eggs, as if you were about to scramble them. Then add some salt and get to work seasoning to your heart's content. You can either make up your own seasoning or use one of the following mixes:


1 tablespoon (15ml) of your favorite bottle of ""Italian"" seasoning. Note -- check if it already has salt in it before adding separately.
1/2 teaspoon (7ml) oregano, garlic and onion powder, cracked red pepper, rosemary, and/or thyme
1 packet powdered onion or mushroom soup mix.
1 Adobo chili mixture or spice packet, with salt.;
, Classically, meatballs are made from hamburger meat. But mixing things up, like the lovely Italian trio of beef, lamb, and veal, will lead to spectacular meatballs with little extra work.

, Plunge your hands in and really squeeze to mix everything up. If you're squeamish, a stiff spatula or wooden spoon will work as well. Just make sure that everything is evenly blended and you have a wet, seasoned pile of meat when done.


If desired, add the small diced onion here as well. Onion, when cooked, is a savory-sweet complement to the meat.
Once it looks well mixed, you can stop. Extra mixing isn't helpful, and the more you mix the meat, the tougher it gets., You can make any size you want, but 1"" balls tend to brown nicely on the outside while cooking quickly enough on the inside. Grab a small pinch of meat and roll it between your palms to get nice round meatballs.


If you make larger meatballs, you may need to cook them a little longer, lowering the heat to prevent burning.
Smaller balls can dry out if cooked too long. They must hit high heat, brown, and then come off quickly before over-cooking.., Use a little bit of oil and rotate the meatballs every few minutes until browned and cooked. If the outsides are done, but the insides are still soft, lower the heat and let them cook for an extra 2-3 minutes. For the best meatballs, let them cook in a 1/2"" (1-2 cm) of red sauce after they've browned -- they'll soak up some of the flavor and liquid to stay tender.


A slow-cooker filled with sauce and meatballs can accomplish the same thing for beautifully rich, slow-cooked meatballs. To make them, add the sauce and meatballs to the cooker and cook on low heat for 6-8 hours., Roasted meatballs bring out a rich, crisp flavor and texture, and create far less mess than stovetop cooking. Your biggest worry in the oven is drying out -- be sure to check the smaller balls regularly and take them out as soon as they are cooked all the way through.


Once they are just about finished, crank the heat to high or put them in the broiler for 1 minute to get a wonderful brown crust on the tops."

Chop an onion and several cloves of garlic.,
Put a saucepan over medium heat and add 2 tablespoons (30 ml) olive oil.,
Add the onions, garlic, and a pinch of salt and stir.,
Cook until the onion is soft and translucent.,
Deglaze the pan with a cup of red wine, letting it cook until most of the liquid is gone.,
Add a can of whole or crushed tomatoes, with juices, and bring to a boil.,
Season with salt, pepper, and fresh basil and turn the heat to low.,
Blend the sauce with a hand mixer, blender, or food processor.,
Let the sauce simmer, tasting regularly and adding water if it gets too thick, until serving.",How to Make Spaghetti With Meatballs2," To cut an onion effectively, cut it in half from pole to pole (following the lines of the onion). Place the cut side on the cutting board, then cut the onion horizontally in half, with your knife parallel to the cutting board. From here, simply cut along the ""grain,"" following the lines on the outside of the onion, then cut perpendicular to these cuts to get small onion squares. The garlic can be left whole or finely chopped.


Whole garlic will have a sharper, slightly spicy flavor. Chopped garlic will take on a slight nutty sweetness as it cooks.

, You can also use a tablespoon of butter and one of oil, as well, for a slightly richer sauce.

, Salt brings out moisture immediately to help the ingredients cook perfectly, but it works best if added right with the cold ingredients. Stir well.If the garlic is finely chopped, wait a minute to add it. The small pieces will cook, and burn, much faster than the onion will.

, Translucent means that the onion is just starting to become see-through. You'll notice the centers becoming slightly clear and the white leaving the onion. This is your sign to move on. It usually takes 3-5 minutes to occur after the onions hit the hot pan.

, You can use a bottle of wine from the house or a bottle of cooking wine. If you can't use either, broth or stock works too, and even a splash of cool water is good. Once the liquid hits the pan, use your wooden spoon to scrape up any bits that stuck to the bottom of the pan from the onions so that their flavors meld into your sauce. There should only be a bit of liquid left in the pan before you move on.


Even if you don't use wine, deglaze the pan quickly before moving on to get these bottom bits. Let the liquid mostly dissolve before proceeding.

, Add a pinch of salt to the tomatoes and stir them around, using the back of a wooden spoon to smash and smush any whole tomato, releasing more of those juices. Let them heat up until boiling and bubbling.


If you want to use fresh tomatoes, you must blanch and peel them in advance. Put 7-10 Roma tomatoes in boiling water until the skin loosens (1 minute), then immediately drop them in a bath of ice water. You can then easily pull the skins off, saving the juices and cooking like normal from here out., Great cooks know to keep sampling the sauce as it cooks, adding pinches of seasoning here and there to get the perfect sauce. You can also consider a 1/2 cup (4 oz) of vegetable or chicken stock, which will add a nice subtle blend of spices and flavors.Some common spices to add include:


Handful of fresh basil (note that smaller leaves tend to have the most flavor)
1-2 Bay leaves
Oregano, Rosemary, and/or Thyme
Ground black or crushed red pepper
Fresh parsley., If you want the chunky, traditional sauce, leave it as it is. But most people want something with a little smoother consistency and texture, and blending is the best way to go. If you have a stick mixer, this is often the easiest way to do it, as the sauce never has to leave the pan. However, it is just as easy to pour the sauce into your blender or food processor, puree everything, and then pour it back in the pan to keep cooking.

, The longer a sauce can cook slowly, with only a few heat bubbles breaking the surface, the better it will be. It will thicken as it cooks as well, so keep an eye on it to make sure it stays creamy and liquidy. If it turns too thick, pour in a ladle full of pasta water (if cooking pasta with the dish) and stir. Starchy water will help the sauce bind itself to the pasta when you serve it.A splash of water, water with 1 tablespoon tomato paste, or a bit of chicken/vegetable broth can all be used to thin a sauce that is too thick.Don't worry if you over-thin out a sauce -- it will thicken again as it heats up.

"
"
Cook your spaghetti according to the instructions on the package.,
Save some of the pasta water to thin the sauce.,
Throw some of your cooked pasta in a small pan with sauce and meatballs.,
Heat the pasta, sauce, and meatballs together for 1-2 minutes, adding a splash of pasta water.,
Plate and serve immediately with some grated cheese.",How to Make Spaghetti With Meatballs3," Boil a large pot of water, salting it generously as it heats up to bring out the best taste of the pasta. Many Italian chefs insist that the water should almost taste like the ocean-- almost 4 tablespoons (60 ml). Remove when ""al dente:"" still firm, but without any crunch., Remember -- starchy pasta water is one of the best ways to thin up a sauce right before serving. Use a ladle to remove some of the starchy water and set aside before draining the water from the pasta.

, Restaurants always ""finish"" the pasta and sauce together instead of simply ladling them into the same bowl. This ensures that everything melds and blends together instead of having a plate of plain spaghetti on top of a puddle of sauce., Add 1-2 tablespoons of pasta water along with the sauce to thin it out slightly. Furthermore, starchy water helps the sauce stay bound to the pasta instead of polling at the bottom.

, If the meatballs were roasted separately, you can add one more on top as well for an attractive, centerpiece dish. After marrying the flavors in the pan, serve everything right out of the pan.

"
"
Try baking the meatballs directly in the red sauce for a moist, perfectly flavored dish.,
Brown the outside of the meatballs and then freeze them if you need to cook ahead.,
Use ground turkey or chicken meat for lower-fat meatballs.,
Add a can of tomato paste before deglazing the pan for a richer, deeper colored sauce.,
Add 1 chopped stalk of celery and one large chopped carrot with the onion for a more nuanced base.,
Try adding some roasted red pepper for new flavor.",How to Make Spaghetti With Meatballs4," Once the meatballs are formed, cook them on the stovetop at high heat just until the edges brown. Meanwhile, heat the oven to 400° F (205° C). Dump the half-cooked balls into a shallow baking dish and smother them with your tomato sauce, then cover everything with cheese, such as mozzarella, Romano, or Parmesan. You can then back the whole pan for 15-20 minutes.This is also a great way to keep the meatballs hot if you still need to cook spaghetti.

, Don't just freeze the raw meat. Instead, cook the meatballs in a skillet until the outsides are brown, then cool and freeze. When ready to eat them, heat them up for 20 minutes or so in 1/2 of sauce to finish cooking them and thaw them up naturally, leading to almost no loss of texture and flavor., White meatballs, those made with white meat, aren't typical in spaghetti and meatballs, but that doesn't mean they aren't delicious. Because they have less fat, they are naturally a little less rich, and will have a harder time bonding together. Add an extra 2 tablespoons (4 ml) of bread crumbs to compensate.


White meatballs, in particular, go well with fresh herbs like rosemary, oregano, and thyme.

, Tomato paste has a strongly concentrated tomato flavor, which will seep into the onions as they cook. Be sure to deglaze the pan quickly afterwards, thinning the paste and preventing burning.


If the sauce is a bit too strong due to the paste, add a tablespoon of sugar to balance it out and give the sauce a light sweetness.

, Both celery and carrots get sweet when cooked, bringing an earthy richness to the sauce closer to a bolognese than a classic marinara sauce. Add them at the same time as the onion, and make sure they're chopped to about the same size, as well.


This is a great way to sneak some vegetables into a kid's sauce, as well. Once they are blended up, they will have no idea it is in there., Simply add the roasted pepper after the onion is almost done cooking up, then blend it up with the rest of the sauce. Roasted peppers are sweet but savory, with a wonderful smokiness that goes well in the sauce. Add some crushed red pepper and cayenne for a spicy arrabbiata sauce, as well.

Get a big pot.,
Pour your preferred amount of water into the pot.,
Boil the water.,
Add the ramen once the water is at a full boil.,
Stir well.,
Wait.,
Add the flavor packet.,
Stir well.",How to Make Ramen Noodles1," This should be large enough to put the entire, ramen into without having to break it (but you can also break it if that is your preference). It should also be small enough so that some water will completely cover the ramen noodles, and have a bit of water over it. Some people like to eat ramen wet instead of completely drained, so if that's the case, you can be more generous with the water.






;
, If in doubt, try 2 cups, but if you want more, that'll work, too. You can substitute some other liquid for the water, such as soy sauce, or broth, but water will work as well.








, On most stoves, you should just turn the knob as high as it can go, and wait for the water to boil. If, during the cooking process, the pan starts to bubble over the top, just turn it down. Next time you make ramen, do not turn the stove on as high as it can go.









So long as the water is bubbling, its temperature is at the boiling point and it is circulating. A furious boil adds little and risks a boil-over, so feel free to turn down the heat a bit once boiling commences.

, Use a fork to push the block under the water if it is floating on the top. You can chose to break the block into chunks before adding it, if you prefer shorter, less slurp-able noodles, but it is a personal thing.








, If you want to even out the cooking process and speed it up by keeping uncooked stragglers from the surface, help stir apart the noodles.








, Three minutes is the normal cooking time, it may take longer, though. When the noodles are starting to turn slightly yellow, they are done. At this point, the ramen should be completely broken apart, and, when you put your fork in the water, a few noodles attach themselves to your fork.









The ramen is ready to eat when it is flexible. If it cooks a few minutes longer, it will become softer, fatter, and translucent. You may prefer it this way.

, Note that there is a very large amount of sodium in the small packet- if you have health problems, it would be better to add less, or none at all.








, At this point, you can do one of two things: you can pour the entire pot of ramen, including all of the liquid, into a bowl, and have a soup, or drain the water, and just eat the ramen.








"
"
Put your uncooked noodles into a microwave safe bowl, and pour the seasoning on top of the noodles.








,
Add 2 cups of water, and do your best to dissolve the seasoning in the water.








,
Carefully put your bowl in the microwave and cook on high for 3-4 minutes.",How to Make Ramen Noodles2,",,









If you broke up the noodles before cooking them, they should be done. Otherwise, you may want to let it sit and absorb for a while. even though it's not as good, it's a bit easier for those who can't stand and stir it while it's on the stove.

Another way of making ramen noodles is to use the hot water from a coffee maker or espresso maker.",How to Make Ramen Noodles3," This works great if you live in a college dorm that doesn't allow microwaves in each room.

Before cooking it, place it in a colander and rinse it under cool water at the sink to remove any dusty starch.You can substitute any type of rice that you like. Both white and brown will work, as well as long, medium, or short grain.;
, To cook the rice, you’ll need 2 cups (473 ml) of water. Pour it into a medium saucepan and place it on the stove. Heat it on high until the water comes to a boil, which should take 5 to 7 minutes.For 1 cup (225 g) of uncooked rice, a 2-quart (1.8 l) saucepan is usually a good size.

, Once the water comes to a boil, add the rice to the pan. Stir it in, and allow the mixture to return to a gentle simmer.You may also want to add ½ teaspoon (3 g) of salt to the water when you mix in the rice.

, After the mixture has come to a gentle simmer, place the lid on the pan. Reduce the heat to low, and allow the rice to cook until it is done. Begin checking on it after 18 minutes -- the rice is done when it is firm but no longer crunchy.Be sure to leave the lid on the pan while the rice is cooking so the steam doesn’t escape.
It’s okay if the rice is slightly sticky, but it shouldn’t be gummy when it’s finished cooking.
If there’s still liquid in the pan when the rice is finished cooking, tilt the pan over the skin to drain the remaining water.

, Once the oil is melted and the wok is hot, pour the beaten eggs into it. Allow the egg to cook, swiveling the wok so the runny portion is constantly moving until it sets. Next, flip the egg over, and let it cook on the other side for a minute.If you prefer, you can simply scramble the eggs in the wok by scraping them around with a wooden spoon. That way, you won’t have to chop the eggs up in the next step.

, When the eggs are finished cooking, transfer them from the wok to a plate. Use a knife to chop the egg into small, bite-size pieces.Use a wooden spoon to move the veggies around as they stir fry to ensure that they cook evenly.

, Once the carrots are tender, add the chopped pork loin to the wok. Let the mixture cook for 3 to 4 minutes, or until it is very hot and sizzling.Just as before, make sure you stir the pork and veggie mixture in the wok so it cooks evenly.

, When the pork and veggie mixture is hot, transfer it to the plate with the cooked egg. Set the plate aside for the moment., After you’ve removed the pork and veggie mixture, add 4 tablespoons (57 g) of butter and another 2 tablespoons (26 g) of coconut oil to the wok. Allow them to heat for a minute.If there’s still some coconut oil in the wok, you may not need to add as much as 2 tablespoons (26 g).

, When the butter and coconut have melted, add the cooked rice to the work. Mix in 1 teaspoon (6 g) of salt and ½ teaspoon (1 g) of black pepper to season it as well.If you like, you can also add a pinch of five spice powder to the rice.

, After you’ve seasoned the rice in the work, stir in 2 tablespoons (18 g) of toasted sesame seeds. Allow the mixture to cook for 2 to 3 minutes or until the rice is hot and sizzling.You can add more sesame seeds if you want a stronger sesame taste for your fried rice.

, Once the rice is hot and sizzling, add the egg, pork, carrots, onions, bean sprouts, peas, green onions, and ¼ cup (59 ml) of soy sauce. Stir well until all of the mixture is well blended.You can use whatever soy sauce you like. Both light and dark work well for the rice.

Serve immediately.",How to Make Kimchi Fried Rice," Cook White Rice the day before you want to make kimchi fried rice. Use short grain Korean rice if possible, also called sticky rice or Japanese rice. Short grain rice is more authentic and has a different texture than regular long grain rice. You can find short grain rice at most Asian markets and some grocery stores.If you can’t find short grain rice, use Jasmine rice or regular white rice.
If you are cooking short grain rice, soak the rice for 30 minutes before cooking it. Soaking the rice helps it to cook evenly and have a better texture.After you’ve soaked your short grain rice, use a 1:1 ratio of rice to water instead of the usual 1:2 ratio. The rice already absorbed some water from soaking, so the normal 1:2 ratio would be using too much water.;
, Kimchi fried rice is best made with chilled rice, since rice fries better when it’s cool and dry rather than hot and sticky. Stick your cooked rice in the fridge overnight to cool it and dry it out.


If you don’t want to prepare the rice the night before, cook the rice, then spread it in a thin layer on a baking sheet and place it in front of a fan. The fan will help to cool and dry the rice.

, Place a small skillet over medium heat. Pour a tablespoon of cooking oil into the skillet, swirling it to coat the bottom of the pan., When the oil has heated, crack an egg into the middle of the skillet. The egg should begin to fry once it hits the pan. Let the egg sit and fry without touching it.If you are preparing the dish for several people, make one egg for each serving.

, Let the egg fry until its edges are browned and the yolk has just barely set. Then use a spatula to carefully lift up the egg and transfer it to a plate.Make sure not to tilt the egg as you take it out of the skillet or else the yolk could run.

, Dice the quarter of the yellow onion into half-inch pieces. Finely dice the garlic clove, and cut the green section of the scallion into small rounds. Discard the white section of the scallion. Then chop the kimchi into ¼ inch (.63 cm) pieces using a sharp knife, Turn up the heat to medium high, then place a wok over the heat. Pour in the rest of the oil to the skillet and swirl to coat the bottom., Once the oil has heated, drop in the onion and garlic into the wok. Heat until the onion and garlic are aromatic, about thirty seconds., After the onion and garlic become aromatic, add the kimchi. Stir the onion, garlic and kimchi together to mix. Then pour in the rice and mix until everything is combined.

, Pour in the kimchi juice, soy sauce and sesame oil, drizzling them evenly over the contents of the wok. Then sprinkle in a pinch of salt and pepper, and add the scallions., Use a large spoon to stir the ingredients together in the wok. Keep the ingredients frying for about five minutes until the rice is warmed through and is beginning to brown., Some prefer their rice spicier than others. Taste a small forkful of the kimchi fried rice and see if it is flavorful enough for you. If you prefer it spicier, either add more kimchi juice or add a few teaspoons of gochujang chili paste, a classic Korean condiment often used to add flavor and spice.You can also use Korean chili powder, diced hot pepper, crushed red pepper flakes, sriracha, or your preferred brand of hot sauce.
Also add more salt or pepper to taste.

, After you have adjusted your recipe, dish your fried rice onto a plate. There should be enough rice for two large servings or three regular sized servings.

, Use a spatula to transfer the fried egg on top of the fried rice. Again, be sure not to tilt the egg or it may run. If you have prepared more than one plate, put an egg on top of each serving.Some prefer to cut the egg using a fork and knife and scramble the pieces into the rice before eating. Others like to keep the egg intact. Do whatever you wish.

, Adding slivered nori and sesame seeds is a traditional way to garnish kimchi fried rice. Nori, or dried seaweed, adds a distinctive savory flavor, while sesame seeds add texture and nuttiness to rice.These garnishes are not necessary if you are already happy with the flavor of the fried rice.

, Kimchi fried rice is best when served hot. The texture of the rice and the egg are much better when served right after cooking, when you have finished garnishing.


If the rice gets cold, heat it up again in the skillet on the stovetop rather than heating in the microwave. The microwave can change the texture of the rice and make it mushy.

Note that sesame oil is common in South Indian cooking, making it a great choice for tomato rice. Any vegetable-based cooking oil will suffice, though.;
, Add the cumin, cinnamon, whole cloves, curry leaves, and green chillies to the hot oil. Cook, stirring constantly, until the seasonings begin to sputter and pop.The seasoning base should heat up very quickly, so you'll need to watch it closely. Letting it cook for too long could cause this base to become burnt, which may result in a bitter flavor.

, Toss the chopped onion and minced garlic into the other seasonings. Cook, stirring frequently, for another 2 to 3 minutes.


You can vary the amount of onion used, but aim for 1/2 to 1-1/2 cups (125 to 375 ml) of chopped onion if you wish to maintain an authentic flavor.
The onions should become translucent and notably soft during this time, and the garlic should deepen and color and release a stronger aroma.

, Add the chopped tomatoes to the pan, followed by the chilli powder (or sambar powder), turmeric powder, and salt. Switch the heat to medium-high and cook, uncovered, for another 4 to 5 minutes.


Note that the exact amount of tomatoes can vary slightly according to personal taste, but try to add at least 1-1/2 to 2 cups (375 to 500 ml). You can either remove or retain the seeds; both options work, but including some of the seeds will result in a thicker gravy.
Firm tomatoes are ideal since the skins won't peel as much when cooked. Alternatively, you can blanch and peel the tomatoes before adding them to avoid the skins altogether.
Continue cooking the tomato mixture at a steady simmer until the tomatoes become mushy.

, Pour the water into pan and stir to combine. Cover the pan and reduce the heat to medium, then cook for another 5 to 7 minutes.The flavors should mix together during this step, and the ingredients should break down into a thick gravy. You can taste this gravy before continuing and adjust the seasonings accordingly. If it seems too sour, mix in 1 to 2 tsp (5 to 10 ml) of sugar and simmer an additional 2 minutes.

, Once the gravy thickens, reduce the heat to low and add the cooked rice to the pan. Carefully mix the rice into the gravy until it appears thoroughly saturated.The rice should already be cooked before you add it to the dish. Leftover rice works well, but freshly cooked rice will also suffice as long as it isn't mushy or sticky when you add it.
Also note that basmati rice is ideal, but any type of white or brown rice can be used if basmati rice isn't available.
Add the rice in three equal portions, mixing after each addition. Make sure that there is enough gravy to coat the rice. If you have more rice than gravy, don't add all of the rice.
Stir the rice into the gravy carefully to avoid breaking apart any of the grains. If the grains break, the resulting dish may seem mushy and unappealing.

, Cover the pan and allow the tomato rice to heat through for another 3 to 5 minutes. The rice should be hot and moist.


You can skip this step if the rice has been freshly cooked and is still hot, but following it regardless will allow the flavors to sink further into the grains of rice.

, Open the lid and add the ghee to prepared tomato rice. Stir well until the ghee melts and spreads throughout the dish.


The ghee is only optional. It can enhance the flavor of the dish, but if you don't have it or if you follow a vegan or dairy-free diet, you can choose to omit it.

, Switch off the heat and serve the tomato rice while it's still hot.


Tomato rice can be enjoyed on its own, but it's typically garnished with cilantro leaves and served alongside other dishes. Common accompaniments include papads, potato chips, raita, curds, vendakka curry and spicy pickles.

",How to Pop Wild Rice," The pan that you use does not have to be large or deep. Wild rice should only be popped in small quantities to prevent overcooking. All the pan needs to have is enough space to spread out a layer of rice and oil. A standard frying pan or saute pan will do.;
, Vegetable oil, with a high smoking point, works well for quickly popping the rice without affecting the flavor. Add ½ to 1 inch (12.7-25.4 mm) of your oil to the pan or otherwise enough to lightly coat the bottom of the pan..Other oil can easily be substituted in for vegetable oil.
Different oils have different costs, fat contents, and heating temperatures. For example, vegetable oil smokes at 450 degrees F (237 C), which reduces your risk of getting the oil too hot.

, No matter what oil you’re using, you want to get it heated but not smoking. Turn the oil up to high heat, letting the oil go until it is boiling. If it starts to smoke, reduce the heat.


You can use a fryer thermometer to test the temperature.

, To make sure the oil is ready to use, drop a single grain of rice into the oil. If the rice sizzles and then pops, you’ll know you are ready to cook a larger batch. Remove the rice using a spoon or other cooking implement., The amount of rice you add to the hot oil should, at most, only be enough to coat the bottom of the pan. A tablespoon to ¼ cup (59.15 mL) at a time is enough. If the rice forms more than one layer, quickly scoop out some of the rice.


The rice will expand as you cook it. You’ll need to be able to see this so you know to remove the rice.

, Soon the rice will start to make a sound. This is the rice expanding, which signifies that it’s ready to be removed. The pop will not be as loud as popcorn, but you will be able to hear it if you left the pan uncovered. You’ll also see the grains grow larger until they split open.

, At the first sign of the rice popping, get the pan away from high heat so that the rice doesn’t burn. Lift the pan up or reduce the heat to medium-high or lower. The rice should stay in the pan so that the rest of the grains continue to pop., Whether you remove the pan from heat or lower the heat, use your wrist to shake up the rice. Move the pan back and forth to keep the popped grains from burning. After about 30 seconds or when the popping has slowed, it is time to remove the rice from the pan.

, Using a strainer is optional and it is possible to eat the rice right after popping it. Putting it in a strainer removes excess cooking oil while allowing you to transfer the rice to another container.The rice can also be popped in a wire strainer lowered into the oil.

, If you wish to remove more oil, paper towels will absorb oil left on the rice. The easiest way to do this is to line a kitchen bowl with paper towels. Use the strainer to transfer the rice to the bowl. Leave the rice for several minutes or until you’re done making batches of rice., Popped wild rice can be eaten as a simple, quick snack. Simply sprinkle a little salt until the taste is to your liking.

The drain water will initially look cloudy. Continue to rinse the rice until the water runs clear.

, Place the rice in your rice cooker and cover it with water. Add the salt, pepper, and olive oil and stir to combine.


Check the rice package to determine how much water to add. In most cases, you should add 1-1/2 cups (375 ml) of water when working with 1 cup (250 ml) of uncooked rice, but this can vary depending on the exact type of rice used.

, Use a paring knife to cut a crisscross slit into the bottom of the tomato. You only need to cut through the skin; cutting into the flesh is not necessary.You can remove the stem during this time, too, but doing so isn't necessary. If you leave the stem intact now, you'll need to remove it after the tomato rice is done cooking.

, Sit the tomato in the center of the rice, bottom-side facing up.


Note that the tomato should not be completely submerged beneath the water.

, If desired, add cooked meat and soft raw vegetables to the rice cooker. Sprinkle these ingredients directly into the rice and around the tomato.You can choose different additions based on your personal preferences, but you must make sure that the ingredients you choose will cook through in the amount of time it takes to cook the rice.
For meat, ham and chicken both work well, but both should be pre-cooked and cut into strips.
Frozen peas and blanched, chopped broccoli are good vegetable options. Soft vegetables can usually be added raw, but hard vegetables must be lightly cooked beforehand.

, Close the rice cooker and switch it onto the appropriate setting. Allow the rice to cook through.


The exact setting will vary depending on the rice cooker manufacturer and model. Many rice cookers have separate settings for white and brown rice, in which case, you should choose the correct setting based on the type of rice you decide to use.

, Once the rice is finished cooking, open the rice cooker and use a rice paddle to mash the tomato into the grains.


If you haven't already removed the stem of the tomato, do so before mashing it into pieces.
Mix the mashed tomatoes well, making sure that it and the other add-ins are evenly distributed throughout the rice.

, Enjoy the tomato rice immediately. If desired, you can sprinkle each serving with some shredded cheese before digging into it.


Other possible garnishes include cooked egg, freshly chopped tomatoes, and freshly chopped parsley leaves.

So, if you use a cup of dried white rice you should use two cups of liquid. One cup of dried rice is plenty to serve two people. If you're serving more people than that you should increase the amount of rice and water accordingly. Make sure the pan is big enough to accommodate the amount of rice and liquid you are using.


While the style of pan you use does not matter too much, you will want to use one which has a tight-fitting lid.;
, Put a tablespoon of olive, peanut, or other oil into the pan. Add in more if you are making a large amount of rice.

, Turn the burner on medium and heat the oil slightly, then add your rice to the pan. Stir it to make sure all the rice is well coated with oil. At this point, the rice will have a translucent look to it.


Cook or fry the rice in the oil just a bit longer if you want a drier, crispier rice.

, After a minute or so it will turn from translucent to a hard white color.

, Add your water and give it a slight stir to make sure all the rice is in the water. Then stir occasionally until the water comes to a boil.

, Turn the heat down extra low when the rice comes to a boil. The dial should go as low as you can go on a gas burner and then put a lid on the rice.

, Let it simmer, without removing the lid, for 15-20 minutes. Any longer than this and you're risking burning the bottom of the rice. Make sure you don't remove the lid! This point is very important because this is the ""steaming"" step.

, Turn the burner off completely after simmering. Set the pan aside with the lid on. It can sit like this until you are ready to use it, but let it continue to steam for at least 30 minutes.

, Enjoy your steamed rice!

, A rice cooker will always make a superior cooked rice. Invest in one if you plan on eating rice often. It will make your life much easier.

, Different rices work better in different dishes. Depending on what you want to use the rice for, you might want to change which rice you buy. Different rices will be drier or stickier, have different flavors, or have more or fewer nutrients.


For example, basmati makes a dry final product, but jasmine will be a lot stickier. This is because of starch content.

, Wash rice before you cook it, if you don't want it to be too sticky. This will remove some of the starch and improve the final texture.

, Soaking your rice in warm water before you cook it will greatly improve the texture of the final product. Cover the rice in warm water and allow it to soak.

, Long grain rices need about 1 1/2 cups of water to every cup of rice. Brown rice will need at least 2 cups of water and likely more, but short grained white rice will need less than the standard to get it perfect the first time. You should always adjust the water once you see how a new rice cooks up.

, Before you close up the lid for your rice to steam, add in some spices to give it a little flavor, and then give it a stir. Good spice options include a slight sprinkling of celery salt, garlic powder, curry powder, or furikake.

Know what to expect from these recipes.,
Consider some substitutes.",How to Make Sticky Rice Using Regular Rice1," There is no real substitute for sticky rice; it is a type of rice (like brown rice) and not a dish (like fried rice). The flavor and texture of these recipes will be different because you are using regular rice. Also, be aware that even if you cook regular rice so that it becomes mushier or stickier, it still may not be sticky enough for nigiri-style sushi., Are you looking to make sticky rice out of regular rice because you cannot find it in a store?

After bringing the water and seasonings to a boil, bring the temperature down to low.,
Cover the mixture when the boiling has calmed.,
Leave the lid on for at least 15 minutes.,
When at least 15 minutes have passed, you are now allowed to check on your rice.,
Don't ignore the last sentence of the box's instructions: Let stand for 5 minutes before serving.",How to Make Rice‐a‐Roni," Many people bring it down to medium, or medium-low, but when the instructions say low, they really do mean low. Anything higher will cause the mixture to bubble over and the rice will burn onto the bottom of the pan.;
, Once you set the heat to low, the boiling should subside within a minute or two. After that happens, covered the pan or pot completely. Many people are used to leaving the lid a little lopsided to let steam come out, but this is the opposite of what you need to do here. You need steam to build up within the pot, and if the temperature is low, you won't have to worry about the mixture overflowing.

, Opening the lid to check on the rice, or to stir it, can seem harmless enough...but what it really does is let out all the steam that was faithfully cooking your rice. Resist the temptation to check the rice. Trust the forces of cooking nature. If the heat is low, it will not burn. Promise.

, You may find that it is softer, now, than it has been in past Rice-a-Roni cooking adventures. It probably has a little more to go, though, so after a brief stir, put that lid back on tightly and check the rice only every ten minutes.

, When the rice is finished cooking, it will probably be a little on the mushy side. Leave the lid off, remove the pot from heat, and let it sit for a full 5 minutes, and perhaps more. This give the rice a chance to dry out and tighten up, as well as letting it cool. A little bit of fluffing with a fork can help this process along.

Cover the beans with 2 inches (5 cm) of cool, clean water. Before rinsing the dried beans, spread them out on a baking sheet or towel to sort through them. Discard any shriveled or broken beans and any other debris you might come across.Rinse the beans under cold, running water in a colander.;
, To remove indigestible sugars from the beans, it’s important to allow them to soak. For the best results, let them sit in the water for 8 hours or overnight at room temperature.If your kitchen is extremely hot, place the beans in the refrigerator while they’re soaking to keep them from fermenting., After the beans have soaked for several hours, transfer them to a colander and drain well. Make sure to shake out all of the excess water, so the beans don’t get mushy. Set the beans aside while you work on the other ingredients., In a large pot, heat 3 tablespoons (39 g) of bacon grease on medium high heat for 1 to 2 minutes. Next, add ¼ cup (50 g) of chopped ham to the pot, and allow it to cook for 1 minute, stirring regularly.You can replace the ham with bacon if you prefer.
You can collect bacon fat any time you fry up some bacon. Pour the fat and grease that’s left in the pan in a jar and store it in your refrigerator. The fat will solidify, but you can just scoop out a few tablespoons when you need them., After you’ve cooked the ham briefly, add 1 ½ cups (240 g) of chopped yellow onions, ¾ cup (80 g) of chopped celery, and ¾ cup (112 g) of chopped green bell peppers to the pot. Sprinkle ½ teaspoon (3 g) of salt, ½ teaspoon (3 g) of freshly ground black pepper, and a pinch of cayenne pepper to season. Allow the mixture to cook for about 4 minutes, or until the vegetables are soft.You can substitute 1 tablespoon or so of Creole or Cajun seasoning for the salt, pepper, and cayenne pepper to taste.

, When the vegetables are soft, mix in 3 bay leaves, 2 tablespoons (8 g) of chopped fresh parsley, 2 tablespoons (8 g) of fresh thyme, ½ pound (227 g) of smoked sausage that’s been split in half lengthwise and cut into 1-inch pieces, and 1 pound (454 g) of smoked ham hocks. Cook the mixture on medium high until the sausage and ham hocks brown, which should take approximately 4 minutes.Stir the pot while you’re heating the mixture to ensure that the meats cook evenly.

, When the sausage and ham hocks are browned, add 3 tablespoons (45 g) of chopped garlic. Stir the mixture in the pot well, and allow it to cook for approximately 1 minute or until the garlic is lightly browned.If you don’t have fresh garlic, you can substitute 1 teaspoon of garlic powder.

, After you’ve cooked the garlic with the mixture, add the beans and 10 cups (2.4 L) chicken stock to the pot, and mix well. Allow the mixture to come to a full boil.If you don’t have chicken stock on hand, you can substitute water.

, Once the pot comes to a boil, turn the heat down to medium low. Leave the pot uncovered and allow it to simmer until the beans become tender and begin to thicken up, which usually takes approximately 2 hours.Make sure to stir the beans periodically while they’re simmering to ensure that they cook evenly.
If the beans get too thick or dry, add more stock or water. Only add ¼ cup (59 ml) at a time, though, so you don’t make the mixture too thin.

, When the beans have simmered for a couple of hours, remove the pot from the burner. Use the back of a heavy spoon to mash approximately ¼ of the beans against the side of the pot.After mashing some of the beans, stir them into the rest of the mixture to incorporate them.

, Return the pot to the heat, and cook them on medium low for another 15 to 20 minutes, or until the mixture thickens and becomes creamy.Since this step takes a bit of time to simmer, this is a good time to start your pot of rice.

, Rice often has dusty starch on the outside of the grains, so you should rinse it before cooking. Take 1 cup (225 g) of uncooked white rice, and rinse it in a strainer or colander until cool running water. Rinse the grains until the water is no longer completely cloudy.You can use medium or long grain rice for the recipe depending on your preference.

, Add 2 cups (237 ml) of water to 2 quart (1.8 L) saucepan, and place it on the stove. Heat the water on high until it comes to a full boil, which should take approximately 3 to 5 minutes.The ratio of rice to water for most types of rice is 1:2, so you should have 2 cups of water for every 1 cup of uncooked rice.

, Once the water comes to a boil, pour the rinsed rice into the pot. Mix in ½ teaspoon (3 g) of salt to season the rice. Make sure to stir well so that the salt is fully mixed into the water.You can also add 1 tablespoon (14 g) of butter to the rice and water to add extra flavor.

, Place the lid on the sauce pan, and turn down the heat to low. Allow the rice to cook until it is tender and no longer crunchy. It should take approximately 18 minutes.Start checking on the rice after 15 minutes so you don't overcook it. It's all right if the rice is slightly sticky, but it shouldn't be gummy.
Most of the water should be absorbed, but if there's any excess in the pan, make sure to drain it off.

, When the rice is tender, remove the pan from the stove and allow it to stand for approximately 5 minutes with the lid on to steam a little longer. Then take a fork and rake it through the rice to fluff it gently., When the beans are thick and creamy, take the pot off the heat again. Remove the bay leaves from the mixture, and then pour the beans over cooked white rice to serve.Garnish the red beans and rice with ¼ cup (58 g) of chopped green onions.

Cover the beans with water.,
Let soak overnight.,
Dump the water and rinse the beans again.",How to Make Pinto Beans1," Pour the beans into a colander and rinse them with running water. Remove any debris that you spot before transferring the beans to a large pot or bowl


You only need to rinse the beans for 30 to 60 seconds. The main purpose of this rinse is to stir up and loosen any major pieces of debris.
Debris usually appears in the form of small stones. You do not have to examine the beans too carefully during this process, especially if you purchased them from a trusted source, but you should keep your eyes open for anything that looks out of place.;
, Fill the bowl of beans with plenty of water


It is essential that you use a large bowl so that the beans have plenty of room to expand.
As a general rule, you should cover the 1 lb (450 g) of pinto beans with at least 8 cups (2 l) of water.

, Cover the beans to prevent further debris from getting into the water and let sit overnight in a cool, dark area.


You can use a refrigerator, but a secluded corner of the kitchen counter will work just as well if not better.
Soaking the beans softens them, thereby creating a shorter cooking time while preserving as many nutrients as possible. The process also helps clean them and removes indigestible, gas-creating sugars known as oligosaccharides

, Pour the beans through a colander and rinse with running water to remove any traces of dirt or oligosaccharides.


The dirt and oligosaccharides will have seeped into the water the beans soaked in, making it unsuitable for use as a cooking liquid. Rinsing the beans also makes them cleaner and safer to eat.
If you plan on reusing the pot you soaked the beans in to cook the beans, give the pot a quick rinse, as well.

To cut the cooking time down by 15 to 30 minutes, add 1/2 tsp (2.5 ml) of baking soda to the cooking water. Stir gently to dissolve it

, Cook the beans on medium-high heat long enough for the water to begin boiling. Reduce the heat to medium or medium-low so that the water just barely simmers. Cover and cook for 30 minutes

, Give the ingredients a slight mix to incorporate them into the beans. Then, cover and simmer the beans for another 45 to 60 minutes


You could also use 1/4 cup (60 ml) of bacon grease instead of the margarine.
If you were to add bacon or salt pork, you would add it now and do so in place of the margarine.
The red pepper is only optional, but it does add a hint of kick and flavor to otherwise plain beans.
For best results, add the salt during this second round of cooking rather than during the first round. Adding the salt too early could toughen the beans.

, Use a fork to test one bean, checking to see if it is tender and cooked through. If so, they are ready to serve.

Slow cooking the beans is less traditional, but it will result in beans that are more tender and creamier.
The red pepper is only optional, but adding it does provide the pinto beans with a nice kick.
If desired, you could also add margarine to beans for a touch of added creaminess, but the pinto beans will end up being creamy even without the margarine.
You can grease the slow cooker with butter or cooking spray before cooking the beans to make your clean-up easier later on. Similarly, you could also use specially-designed slow cooker liners to prevent the pinto beans from sticking.

, The beans should cook for 7 to 9 hours


Do not open the slow cooker as the beans cook. If you do, valuable steam will escape and you may need to add an additional 30 minutes onto the cooking time.
The total time largely depends on the size and age of the pinto beans you use.
When done, the beans should appear tender but they should not be falling apart. You can test your beans after the 7-hour mark with a fork to determine how tender they are.

, After the beans finish cooking, turn the slow cooker off and let the beans sit until they can absorb more of the liquid.

, Pinto beans are often prepared with some form of pork. Add the bacon or pork to the beans when you would otherwise add margarine or seasonings

Similarly, cut 1/4 lb (115 g) of salt ham into 1-inch (2.5-cm) cubes or strips and add the pork to 1 lb (450 g) of simmering pinto beans.
Pinto beans prepared with pork products are often prepared with chopped onion, as well. Chop up 1/2 to 1 full onion per 1 lb (450 g) of pinto beans.

, You can get creative with your beans. Instead of using plain salt and pepper, try a ""pinto bean seasoning"" blend or some of your favorite seasonings.

",How to Make Chinese Fried Rice," Before cooking your rice, it’s a good idea to rinse it in a strainer. That will remove any dust, starch, or other debris that might be on the surface of the rice. Place the rice in a strainer, and rinse it with cold water.If you’re short on time, you can skip rinsing the rice. Be aware that you may wind up with stickier cooked rice if you don’t, though.;
, In a small to medium pot, add water in a 1:2 rice to water ratio. For this recipe, you’ll need to add 2 cups (473 mL) of water to the pot. Place the pot on the stove on high heat and bring it to a boil.Keep in mind that rice expands when it cooks so be sure your pot is large enough. A 2-quart (2.5 L) pot is usually large enough for 1 cup (195 g) of uncooked rice.

, Once the water comes to a boil, pour 1 cup (195) of medium-grain white or brown rice and ½ teaspoon (2.84 g) salt into the pot. Lower the heat to medium low to bring the pot back to a gentle simmer.1 cup of uncooked rice should produce approximately 3 cups of cooked rice.
In addition to the salt, you can also flavor your rice with butter. Mix in 1 tablespoon (approximately 14 g) butter if you desire.

, After the pot comes back to a gentle simmer, turn the burner’s heat down to low. Place the lid on the pot, and allow the rice to cook for at least 18 minutes. At that point, start checking on the rice. It's ready when it is firm but tender or no longer crunchy. Your rice may be slightly sticky when it’s finished cooking, but it shouldn’t be gummy.Brown rice takes longer to cook, so begin checking it after it’s cooked for approximately 30 minutes.
Don’t take the lid off the pot before the 18- or 30-minute mark, depending on what type of rice you’re cooking. You’ll allow steam to escape, which can actually lengthen the cooking time.
If there’s still water in the pot when the rice is finished, drain the excess into the sink.

, When you’re sure that the rice is done, turn off the burner and let it to sit in the pot with the lid still on for 2 to 3 minutes. That will allow the rice to steam for a few more minutes to ensure that it’s finished cooking., You want your rice to be slightly dry when you fry it, so spread the cooked rice out in a single layer on tray, cookie sheet, or other large pan. Set the pan beneath a table fan for approximately 1 hour to help dry out the rice.If you don’t have a table fan, consider cooking the rice the morning of or the night before you plan to make the fried rice.

, Traditionally, fried rice is made in a wok, so that's the best option when you’re frying the dish at home. Set the pan on the stove, and turn the heat to medium to preheat it for approximately five minutes.If you don’t have a wok, a large skillet or frying pan can work for frying your rice too.

, When the pan is heated, pour 2 tablespoons (approximately 30 mL) of a neutral oil, such as canola or grapeseed, in it. Turn the pan slowly to ensure that the oil evenly coats the bottom.Neutral oils are those that don't have a strong taste on their own, so they won't add any extra flavor to your dish. In addition to canola and grapeseed, corn, peanut, and safflower are others to consider.

, Add 1 small white onion that’s been chopped, 1 cup (150 g) frozen peas and carrots that have been defrosted, 1 teaspoon (5 g) finely chopped ginger, and 1 teaspoon (5 g) finely chopped garlic to the pan. Turn the heat up to medium high, and fry the vegetables until they are tender. It should take approximately 10 minutes.You can add any type of vegetable to the fried rice that you like. Some options you may want to consider include chopped cabbage, chopped French beans, chopped bell peppers, chopped mushrooms, chopped water chestnuts, or chopped green onions.

, When the vegetables have finished cooking, use a spatula to push them to one side of the pan. Next, pour 2 eggs that have been lightly beaten into the pan. Scramble them with the spatula, and once they’ve set up, mix them into the vegetables.If you prefer, you can use an egg substitute in place of the eggs.

, Once the eggs are cooked and mixed with the vegetables, add in the 3 cups of cooked rice. Pour 2 to 3 tablespoons (30 to 44 mL) of soy sauce, depending on your personal taste, on top of the rice.Next, mix in 1 tablespoon (15 mL) of sesame oil, and stir all of the ingredients together until well combined.In place of the soy sauce, you can use fish sauce or oyster sauce.
You can also add in some cooked chicken or steak that’s been cut into strips or chopped if you want to make a meal out the rice.
It's a good idea to taste the rice after you mix in the soy sauce and sesame oil. If necessary, add salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste.

, Continue stirring the mixture in the pan as it cooks on medium heat. Fry the rice until all of the ingredients are fully heated through, which should take approximately 5 minutes.If it seems like the rice is starting to scorch, lower the heat.
Add a few additional drops of oil to the pan if the rice mixture is sticking to it.
You may want to garnish the finished rice with chopped green onions.

, Using a medium sauce pot or the microwave, heat up all of your broth on medium high heat. It does not need to be boiling, just hot to the touch.


If you add cold broth to your rice you greatly lower the temperature of the pan, effectively halting cooking and preventing the rice from absorbing the liquid., The mushrooms should look slightly wilted, and they will have sucked up the liquid in the skillet. For a slightly healthier risotto you can skip the butter. Herbs to add include 1 teaspoon of the following (if using fresh, instead of dried, herbs, double the amounts).


Thyme
Sage
Rosemary
Basil
Cracked red pepper.

, Once the butter has melted, add the rice and stir so that it is coated with the oil and butter. Cook for 1 minute, until the edges of the rice begin to appear clear. This is also known as ""toasting"" the rice. You want to do this before adding any liquid.


Cooking the rice without liquid hardens the starch on the outside, preventing it from sticking together later.You can also use baldo or carnaroli rice for a creamier texture.

, Add the white wine and stir into the rice. Cook together until almost all of the wine is evaporated or absorbed into the rice. Don't worry, the final dish will not be alcoholic -- most of the alcohol will burn off.


Wine ""deglazes"" the skillet, removing tasty bits of caramelized vegetables from the pan and adding them to the rice.
Move on once all of the wine is absorbed.

, Once the wine is absorbed, use a ladle to add the first cup of broth to the rice mixture. Resist the urge to add more than one cup -- you need to take it slow to get the best risotto you can.


Too much liquid, too quickly, will lead to mushy, unappetizing rice. Take it slow -- the patience will pay off., You cannot stir risotto enough. Though you can leave the pan briefly if you need, the more you stir the risotto the better the texture and flavor will be when you are done.

, Once most of the broth has been absorbed by the rice, add another cup. You'll know when it is absorbed, as there are no more puddles or visible liquid.

, The rice should be slightly firm and creamy, but never mushy. Depending on the amount and quality of rice, you may need 1 cup more or less. After about half the broth is added, taste it regularly to get your desired consistency.If your rice is still hard but you are out of broth, add a little water or milk and continue stirring.

, Add any salt and pepper you desire and garnish on top with Parmesan cheese or truffle oil.

, Make sure the cream of mushroom is hot before adding it, and add the cream of mushroom last to make sure the rice cooks properly.

, Red wine imparts a somewhat richer flavor on the risotto, and it often pairs well with the earthy, nutty flavor of mushrooms. Try to use a dry red wine like a Pinot noir or Chianti, or better yet use Sherry or Marsala -- two wines commonly used for cooking.

, Cook your meat and vegetables separately and add them to the risotto with your last cup of broth. You can use anything you would like, but some some combinations to try include:


Beef/Steak cubes, red wine, and goat cheese.
Brussel sprouts, carrots, and celery, all cooked until soft.
Shallots, porcini mushroom, and green onions.

Cook the meat thoroughly so that it's completely browned and broken up. It will take about 5 minutes for it to reach the food safety temperature of 160 degrees F (70 C). Drain off any grease and keep the meat in the skillet.You can also use a combination of meats. Ask your butcher if they offer a ground meatloaf mixture which usually includes a variety of meats.;
, Stir in 2 cloves of minced garlic, 1/4 of a teaspoon of red pepper flakes, ground pepper to taste, and about 1/2 a teaspoon of salt. Cook the seasoned meat over medium-high heat for about 30 seconds. You should just be able to smell the garlic.Get the lasagna noodles, marinara sauce, and water ready to add to the skillet while the seasonings cook quickly. You don't want to burn the garlic.

, Break up 6 ounces (170 g) of lasagna noodles into 2-inch pieces and add them to the seasoned meat. Pour 26 ounces (737 g) of marina sauce and 2 cups (470 ml) of water over the noodles and seasoned meat. The noodles should be completely submerged by sauce and water.The water is important because it hydrates the uncooked noodles. The noodles will also become a little soft from the marina sauce.

, Cover the skillet with a lid and bring the lasagna to a simmer. Let it keep bubbling for about 20 minutes and turn the heat up or down to keep it simmering. Take the lid off and stir it frequently. This will keep the lasagna from sticking and will ensure that the noodles cook evenly.The noodles should be tender when the lasagna is finished cooking.

, Turn off the heat and carefully move the lasagna off the burner. Stir in 1/4 cup (25 g) of shredded mozzarella cheese, 1/8 cup (12 g) of grated parmesan cheese, salt, and pepper to taste.

8 ounces (226 g) of mozzarella, shredded

, Heat a large and deep 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat. Add 2 tablespoons of olive oil. Once the oil is hot, add your chopped vegetables and 1/2 teaspoon of salt. Saute the vegetables for 6 minutes and stir them frequently to prevent them from sticking.The onion should become translucent while the zucchini and red pepper soften.

, Open and add one 28-ounce (800 g) can of crushed tomatoes to the skillet. Stir the tomatoes into the other vegetables until they're combined. Break up 6 ounces (170 g) of no-boil lasagna noodles into thirds and add them to the skillet. Push them into the vegetable sauce so they're covered.It's alright if some of the broken noodles are poking out from the sauce a little. You'll stir the lasagna as it cooks, so those noodles will become covered and soft.

, Cover the skillet with a lid and cook it over low heat for 15 minutes. Take the lid off and stir it a few times. Once the noodles are almost soft, scatter 1 cup (250 g) of the part-skim ricotta cheese and 8 ounces (226 g) of the shredded mozzarella over the lasagna. Cover the lasagna and finish cooking it for another 10 minutes.To garnish the lasagna, you can sprinkle it with ground black pepper and 1 cup (25 g) of torn fresh basil.

",How to Make Gluten‐Free Vegan Lasagna," The principle ingredient of gluten-free lasagna is the actual pasta itself. Take some time to shop around for a gluten-free pasta that you like.


Since pasta is generally made from wheat, you’ll have to look for rice, buckwheat, or quinoa based pastas.
Look online.
Browse your local health food stores.
Cook and sample pastas before you commit to using them in your lasagna.
Think about swapping eggplant or zucchini slices for pasta. This offers a low carb, healthy alternative to gluten-free pasta.;
, One of the most important parts of a tasty lasagna is the cheese. However, vegan cheeses are notoriously hard to come by in some regions.


Daiya cheeses are readily available in major grocery retailers or box stores.
Follow Your Heart cheeses are also readily available.
Nut-based cheese is a good alternative, especially if you want a ricotta-like cheese to include in your lasagna.
Avoid Field Roast cheese, as it contains wheat.
Check all labels to make sure they are free of wheat, barley, or rye., Sauce is one of the easiest things to choose for your gluten-free vegan lasagna, as most sauces are gluten-free.


To be safe, look for sauces that are labeled “gluten-free.”
Scour the ingredients to make sure there aren’t strange additives or any form of wheat.
The simpler the ingredients, the better.
Try making your own tomato sauce. To do this, you can start by scratch with canned or jarred tomatoes, or use tomato paste and add desired spices, oils, and other ingredients.
Substitute sauce for crushed tomatoes.
Depending on the size of your lasagna and other ingredients, you may need 28 to 42 ounces (8/10ths to 1 1/4 liter) of sauce., You can also choose to add a variety of vegetables to your lasagna. Depending on your taste, vegetables can greatly enhance your lasagna. Some popular vegetables you may want to consider include:


Garlic, add as desired.
2 zucchinis.
1 large onion.
12 to 16 ounces (1/3 to 1/2 liter) of mushrooms.
1 or 2 carrots., After you’ve gathered your ingredients, set them out and begin chopping your vegetables. Take your time and make sure to cut them up evenly. In addition, make sure to cut them into pieces small enough to cook quickly and to eat easily.


Try cutting your vegetables up into quarter inch to half inch cubes. If you want, you can slice or dice them even smaller.
Mix your vegetables and then divide them into two or three portions – depending on how many layers you want to include in your lasagna., Cook as much pasta as you think you’ll need to cover your lasagna. Depending on the size of the dish you’re using, you may need to use a substantial amount of pasta.


Consider using two 16 ounce (1/2 liter) boxes of pasta. This will make 16 servings.
Turn your water up to high and wait for it to boil.
Salt the water.
Add lasagna to the water and let it cook until tender. Depending on the type of pasta you use, the time may vary. See the box for more details.
Allow your lasagna to drain appropriately., Your first step in preparing the lasagna is to spread your sauce into the bottom of the pan or dish. Based on your ingredients or tastes, the amount of sauce you spread may vary.


The typical amount of sauce you should start with will vary from between a quarter inch and a half inch (2/3rds to 1 and 1/3rd centimeter)
If you prefer a lot of sauce, make sure you add more here., After putting down a layer of sauce, you’ll want to dump in your choice of vegetables. Ultimately, the amount of vegetables you put in is dependent on your own taste.


Depending on the amount of vegetables you add, you may need to pour more sauce. You don’t want your lasagna to be too dry.
Make sure to mix your vegetables up before pouring them in.
Divide your vegetables up into at least two portions – since you will have at least two layers of vegetables and sauce.
If you want, pour a little sauce on top of the vegetables.
Add nut cheese (or substitute vegan ricotta) here, if you want., After pouring your sauce and vegetables, place your pasta over the sauce and vegetable layer.


Carefully pick up your lasagna and place it systematically.
Feel free to leave gaps or cover the dish completely.
Don’t start your layer with noodles. Sauce should come first.
Avoid letting your pasta clump up., After placing your pasta, sprinkle cheese over it. The cheese is important as it adds flavor and is the final part of each layer of your lasagna.


Use a cup of cheese per layer, unless you want to use more.
Spread your cheese evenly.
Feel free to add as much cheese as you want.
You may also consider adding extra cheese to your sauce, or adding cheese under your pasta., After sprinkling your cheese on top, you’ll need to repeat the previous steps. This will depend, however, on how many layers you want your lasagna to have.


Typically, people make lasagna with two or three layers of sauce (1/4th of an inch each or 2/3rds of a centimeter) and filling and two or three layers of pasta.
Add a cup of cheese on the top of each layer.
Make sure your dish is deep enough (about 4 inches or 10 centimeters) for everything you want to include., After you prepare your lasagna, you need to preheat your oven to the appropriate temperature. The temperature will depend on a variety of factors:


In most cases, you can preheat to about 375 degrees Fahrenheit or 190 degrees Celsius.
Temperature may vary based on the thickness of the lasagna. If you decide to go with a deeper lasagna, you may need to increase the temperature and/or time., Place your lasagna in the oven carefully, making sure you don’t mess up the layers or disturb the cheese or other ingredients.


Cover your lasagna with foil.
Make sure your oven is set to 375 degrees Fahrenheit or 190 degrees Celsius.
Set a timer for 30 minutes – if you made more than 2 or 3 layers, add five minutes.
Monitor the lasagna throughout the make sure it is not burning.
Place the lasagna in the middle rack of your oven – equal distance from the top or bottom heating elements., When your timer goes off, take your lasagna out of the oven. It is important to do so at the right time, otherwise your pasta will be overcooked and your vegetables may become mushy. In addition, your cheese may burn.


Stick a cooking thermometer in the middle of the lasagna to verify it is at least 150 degrees Fahrenheit or 65 degrees Celsius inside.
Look to see if your top layer of pasta and cheese is golden brown.
Carefully remove the lasagna, as to not mix up the layers.
Let the lasagna sit for 10 to 15 minutes before serving.,"

Keep things organized by separating your ingredients into individual bowls on your counter space.
If you are making a meat lasagna, try minced beef, chicken, or pork mixed with a little bit of bacon and seasoned with herbs. Make sure your meat is fully cooked before layering it into your lasagna.
For vegetarian lasagna, try mushrooms, sliced zucchini, and fresh spinach.;
, You can use no-boil or regular lasagna noodles. You must precook standard, dry lasagna noodles to soften them before you layer them into your lasagna, while no-boil noodles cook during the baking process.


Choose your noodles based on preference and how much time you have. If you don't have a lot of experience making lasagna, you can make a lasagna a lot more quickly with no-boil noodles.

, For the layering effect of your lasagna to work, you'll need a deep, wide dish. You can use either a glass or metal dish. Pick the dish that is deepest and wide enough for the size of the lasagna you need to make.A deep dish will require longer to cook than a shallow one.
Glass is a poor conductor of heat, but it also distributes heat more evenly. Using a glass dish will help your lasagna cook more evenly and stay warm if you need to wait for someone to get home before serving dinner.
Metals, especially aluminum, are generally better at conducting heat. They heat up quickly, but also can lose the heat quickly once removed from the oven. Using a metal dish may crisp the edges and bottom of your lasagna more than a glass dish would. Also, because metal dishes lose heat quickly, you won't want to wait too long before serving., If you are using no-boil noodles, remove them from the package and place them with the rest of your ingredients. If you are using regular noodles, follow package directions for cooking time, and drain thoroughly. Allow them to cool for a few minutes. They can be very hot to handle while assembling the lasagna. Running cold water over them helps this along, but be sure not to let the noodles sit too long after cooling, as they will stick together.


If you're using a smaller pan than the recipe calls for or are only making half the recipe, you can cut the cooked noodles to fit. You can also carefully break the no-boil noodles to fit the shape of your dish.
Tuck the ends of your noodles into the pan before baking, as any that extend over the edges may burn or dry out and become hard and brittle.
For easier serving and a golden edge, lightly buttering your glass or metal baking dishes before assembly. If using a nonstick surface, butter may be unnecessary.

, Start with a small amount of sauce at the bottom of your dish to keep your lasagna moist and prevent the bottom layer of pasta from sticking to the pan.Take a sheet of your boiled and strained regular noodles or no-boil noodles and lay them out flat at the base of your dish, overlapping them slightly. The goal is to get the entire bottom of the dish covered in a layer of noodles.


Remember, you can cut or break your noodles to fit the size and shape of your pan if necessary.
If using no-boil noodles, you may want to break them to fit instead of overlapping them, as the overlapped parts can get hard while baking.

, Your filling will vary depending on the recipe. Follow your recipe guidelines to create your filling and spread it over your base layer of noodles. Spread about 1/3 of your filling onto the base noodles.


Don’t let your layers get too thick! This can cause your lasagna to fall apart when serving and eating.

, Follow your recipe guidelines to create your cheese mixture and cover the surface area of your dish with a thin layer of cheese. Use enough cheese so you can cover the previous layer.


If your recipe calls for a ricotta mixture and separate layer of mozzarella, put down the ricotta first and follow it with the mozzarella., Use a spoon to drizzle sauce over your cheese until covered. Depending on the size of your dish, you may need to use more or less sauce.


Take care not to use too much sauce; this could create a runny lasagna.
When using no-boil noodles, use slightly more sauce. No-boil noodles will absorb more moisture to cook.

, Once you have laid down the second sauce layer, place another layer of noodles on top, followed by your filling, cheese, and another layer of sauce. The number of layers your lasagna has will vary by recipe and size of your dish. Use your entire filling mixture.


Make sure to leave about four noodles, or as many you would need to cover the top of your lasagna.
Leave a little bit of extra cheese to sprinkle on top.

, Finish your lasagna by placing four noodles on the top, one crosswise and three lengthwise. You may need to use more or less depending on the size of your dish. Sprinkle your remaining cheese on top. This will cook to make a nice brown surface. Sprinkles of sweet paprika make a delicious final addition.


If you are using no-boil noodles or prefer a more sauce on your lasagna, you can add a thin layer of sauce to the top.

, If you'd like, you can cover your lasagna dish with aluminum foil and place it in the freezer for up to three months and still bake beautifully.Make sure to let your frozen lasagna completely defrost before baking it, otherwise you may have to increase the cooking time.
Remove frozen lasagna from the freezer the night before you plan to bake it and let it thaw in the refrigerator overnight. It's better to cool your lasagna slightly frozen than to let it thaw on the countertop.

, Red sauces, with and without meat are the more popular and traditional sauces to use with lasagna, but you can also create delicious Alfredo lasagna.

, For an interesting and innovative twist, swap out the ricotta for cottage cheese. You can also use slices of mozzarella instead of grated. Sprinkle in some Parmesan cheese too!

, This can create truly exciting lasagna as you can pick and use your favorite ravioli. Try a mushroom, meat, cheese, or vegetarian ravioli for a delicious twist on a classic dish.

, This is a great way to enjoy lasagna if you are on a low carb diet or need to eat gluten free. Use slices of zucchini instead of noodles; you will be eating healthy without even realizing it.

, If you’re looking for a recipe to absolutely impress the pants off someone, try a classy seafood lasagna. Load your lasagna with crab, shrimp, and scallops.


Red sauces can easily overpower the delicate flavors of most seafood. Make your seafood lasagna with a creamy white sauce instead.
This recipe is very easy to assemble in advance; giving you more time to enjoy the company you are sharing it with.
For truly special occasions, try adding lobster to the mix at the same time you add the crab.

, Make use of any leftover chicken or steak in your fridge from last night’s dinner; don't be afraid to mince it up for lasagna! If you have some tomatoes or onions that need to be used, dice them and toss them in your sauce.


Be careful of adding additional ingredients. You may have to adjust your cooking time.
Precooked ingredients will usually be fine, as they're just getting reheated as part of the lasagna but if you're introducing fresh ingredients, such as slices of zucchini or shredded carrot, be sure that the fresh food will cook in time.
Chop items into small pieces if you're unsure.

Make a freezer-friendly lasagna recipe.,
Assemble the lasagna in a dish that can be frozen.,
Decide whether to bake it first.,
Bring the lasagna to room temperature.,
Cover the lasagna with freezer-safe plastic wrap.,
Freeze the lasagna.",How to Freeze Lasagna1," Some ingredients taste better than others when they're reheated after being frozen. Most lasagna recipes that call for fresh ingredients will be just fine after freezing, whether you freeze them unbaked or baked. However, if the recipe uses items that have already been frozen and thawed once, it's best not to freeze and thaw them twice. This increases the chance that the food could be contaminated by bacteria.


For example, don't plan on freezing lasagna made with sausage or ground beef that was previously frozen. Instead, use fresh meat or leave it out completely.
Food that is frozen and thawed more than once also suffers when it comes to flavor and texture. Choosing a recipe that calls for fresh ingredients will result in the best-tasting lasagna.
If your favorite lasagna recipe calls for a frozen ingredient, the final dish usually won't be too affected by substituting the fresh version instead. For example, instead of using frozen mushrooms, just use fresh. In most cases you will have needed to thaw them anyway.;
, Look for a ""freezer-proof"" label or be certain that the dish can be frozen as well as used for baking. Most glass or ceramic casserole dishes are fine for this purpose.


Avoid using an aluminum pan for long-term storage of lasagna. The food might end up picking up a tinny taste.
If you don't have a dish that can be used to both bake and freeze lasagna, you can bake it one dish and freeze it in a freezer-safe food storage container.

, Lasagna that has been baked before freezing will still taste great after it has been reheated. Lasagna that has been assembled and frozen before baking is delicious, too. Use whichever method is most convenient for you, since the final texture and taste of the dish won't be too affected either way.


You might decide to freeze pre-baked lasagna if you have leftovers after making a big batch.
If you'd rather freeze it before baking, consider making two lasagnas next time you're having lasagna for dinner. You can bake one and freeze the other to eat later.

, If you want to freeze baked lasagna, it's necessary to make sure it has cooled entirely before you freeze it. Otherwise, the texture of the dish won't be as pleasant when it's time to eat it. After making the lasagna, set it aside for one hour to cool. You can also place it into the refrigerator to chill. Before placing it in the fridge, cover the lasagna with two layers of plastic wrap and one layer of kitchen foil.

, Don't use aluminum foil, since it might affect the taste of the lasagna. Cover it with several layers of plastic wrap to keep it fresh in the freezer. You may want to wrap the plastic around the entire dish, rather than just over the top. That way, you can make sure there are no gaps in the wrap where air could get in and cause freezer burn.


Consider cutting the lasagna into individual portions and freezing them in bags. This way you won't have to reheat the entire thing if you only need a meal for one or two people. Cut the lasagna into serving sized-portions after it has chilled. This will help the pieces hold together better instead of falling apart. Put each piece in its own freezer-safe storage bag.
No matter what, make sure it is double wrapped to prevent the lasagna from drying out.

, Label it and place it in the freezer. It can be frozen for up to three months, whether it has a meat or vegetable filling.

Thaw it overnight.,
Preheat the oven to 180ºC/350ºF.,
Ready the lasagna for baking.,
Bake the lasagna.,
Serve the lasagna.",How to Freeze Lasagna2," The night before you intend to have the lasagna for dinner, thaw it overnight. If you try to bake it while it's still partially frozen, it will cook unevenly and the taste and texture will be affected. It will also be more difficult to determine whether it's done or not. You can thaw either the entire lasagna or portions in the refrigerator overnight.

, This is the standard cooking temperature for lasagna. No matter what recipe you used, this is a good temperature for baking your lasagna to perfection.

, Unwrap all of the plastic wrap, and cover the baking dish with aluminum foil. This will keep the top from getting too brown while the rest of the lasagna cooks. If you're cooking an individual portion of lasagna, take the piece you want to bake out of its storage bag and place it on a suitable baking dish, then cover with foil.

, Put it in the oven and cook it half an hour to 40 minutes, or until heated through. You may need to test a small piece from the center to make sure it isn't still cold in the middle. During the last 10 minutes of baking, you can remove the foil to allow the heat to reach the top if you want a brown, crispy crust on your lasagna.


If you're just reheating an individual piece of lasagna, you can do it in the microwave instead of in the oven. Place it on a microwave-safe dish and microwave on high for 2 - 3 minutes, or until it's hot and bubbly. Do not use aluminum foil in the microwave.

, Since it has been in the freezer for awhile, you might want to freshen it up by sprinkling some chipped basil or oregano on top.

When the water is boiling, add the pasta, and stir immediately so the pasta doesn’t stick to the bottom of the pan. Wait for the water to return to a boil, and then cook the pasta for eight to 10 minutes.The pasta is ready when it is al dente, which means cooked through and chewy but still firm.
When the pasta is ready, transfer it to a colander to drain the water.;
, Melt the butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Whisk in the flour to make a roux, and cook it for two minutes. Stir in the milk and cook the mixture for another two minutes. When the sauce thickens, remove it from the heat and stir in the cheese.Continue stirring the mixture until the cheese melts.
A roux is a sauce made from flour cooked with a fat, and it’s used to thicken other sauces.

, Return the macaroni to the pot you cooked it in. Pour the cheese onto the macaroni, and season the mixture with salt and pepper. Gently stir the mixture to coat the macaroni with the cheese sauce.

You can use any cheese you like in this recipe, including white cheddar, mozzarella, Velveeta, and more.To help bring out the flavor of the cheese, add a pinch of nutmeg to the dish as well.
Mac and cheese typically only calls for 8 cups (800 g) of grated cheese, but because the mac and cheese balls are going to be cooked twice, it’s important to start with an extra cheesy sauce., Grease a large, shallow baking dish with a light layer of butter or cooking spray. Transfer the mac and cheese to the dish. Cover the pasta with a sheet of plastic wrap and transfer the dish to the refrigerator. Chill the mac and cheese for at least two hours.If you decide the mac and cheese looks too good to pass up, you can serve it warm and garnished with extra cheese!

, Use a cookie scoop, ice cream scoop, or large spoon to scoop the mac and cheese into 1.5-inch (3.8-cm) balls. Use your hands to compact each ball slightly and round it out. Transfer the balls to a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.The homemade recipe made enough mac and cheese to make about 36 balls of this size.

, Transfer the baking sheet to the freezer and let the balls chill for at least two hours. This will help the balls stay together when you fry them. If you have time, you can let the balls freeze overnight., Fill a Dutch oven or heavy-bottomed skillet with at least 2 inches of oil. Heat the oil over medium heat. You want to fry the mac and cheese balls in oil that’s between 350 and 375 F (171 and 191 C). This is the ideal temperature to form a crunchy crust on the outside while also cooking the balls through evenly.Good oils for frying include peanut, canola, and vegetable.
You can also use a deep fryer to make these mac and cheese balls.

, Sprinkle the flour onto a large plate. One at a time, roll each mac and cheese ball in the flour to coat it. Dip the ball into the egg to coat it with egg, and then roll it through the breadcrumbs. Return the ball to the baking sheet. Repeat with each mac and cheese ball until they're all breaded.

You can use any breadcrumbs you like for the balls, but some favorites include panko and seasoned breadcrumbs. You can also use cornmeal if you prefer, or a mixture of cornmeal and breadcrumbs., Transfer the balls to the hot oil using tongs or a spatula. Be careful not to squeeze the balls too hard, or they may fall apart. You will probably have to fry them in multiple batches. Fry the balls for three to four minutes, until they're golden brown and crispy.Cook as many balls at a time as you can without crowding them in the skillet.
After each batch, add more oil if necessary and wait for the oil to return to the right temperature.

, When the balls are golden brown, remove them from the oil with tongs or a spatula. Transfer the cooked balls to a plate lined with paper towels. The towels will absorb excess oil. Let the balls rest for about five minutes before serving to give them time to cool., Pasta dishes always pair well with fresh herbs, and the same is true with deep fried mac and cheese balls. When the balls are still warm, sprinkle them with some chopped fresh herbs or spices, such as:Garlic powder
Onion powder
Chives
Thyme
Oregano
Parsley

, Nothing goes better with macaroni and cheese than more cheese, and grated Parmigiano-Reggiano or another variety is a great way to finish fried mac and cheese balls.Sprinkle the grated cheese on top when the balls are still warm. That way, the cheese will melt on the balls and won’t fall off when you take a bite.

You can garnish the balls with fresh herbs and cheese. Sprinkle the herbs first, followed by the cheese, so that the cheese melts into the herbs.

, Fried mac and cheese balls are a great party food because they're single-serving finger foods. To help guests keep their hands clean, stick a toothpick into each fried ball when it’s still warm and let the balls cool to room temperature before serving., There are a number of different sauces that you can serve mac and cheese balls with, such as a marinara sauce, like the type restaurants often serve with fried mozzarella sticks.You can also get creative and serve the balls with other sauces, such as:

Gather all of your ingredients.,
Bring 4-6 quarts of water to a boil in a large pot.,
Stir in the macaroni after the water reaches a boil.,
Place the strainer in the sink and pour the pasta and water into it.,
In a separate, large saucepan, heat oil and butter over medium heat.,
Slowly add the milk to the mixture, and continue to stir.,
Stir in the shredded cheese, one half a cup at a time.,
Season the sauce to taste.,
Pour the sauce over the cooked macaroni.,
Serve.",How to Make Macaroni and Cheese1," To make this tasty macaroni and cheese dish on the stove, you'll need dry elbow macaroni, salt, vegetable oil, butter, flour, milk, and shredded cheddar cheese.


;
, The water should be at least 3–4 inches (7.6–10.2 cm) below the rim of the pot. Set the stove burner to medium-high for best results. Add a pinch of salt to the water. You need plenty of water in the pot to give the macaroni enough room to cook and expand. If you don't have enough water, the macaroni will get lumped together and won't cook nearly as well.




, Pour in the macaroni and stir it around to keep it from sticking. Cook the pasta for about 8 minutes, or until it's ""al dente"" -- that is, tender, but still chewy, and definitely not mushy. Try a piece with a fork (carefully) in order to see if it's ready before turning off the stove. Stir every 1-2 minutes to desired taste or until tender. Just make sure to check the instructions on the box of pasta you are using, because some types of pasta take longer to cook than others.




, Once all the water has drained, return the macaroni to the pot and set it on an oven mitt or the stove top (just make sure the burner beneath it is turned off!) to let it cool.




, When the butter has melted into the oil, add flour and mix it well with a whisk (a fork or slotted spoon will also work). Continue to gently stir this mixture for about three minutes, or until it's smooth and begins to turn light brown. This is the beginning of the sauce you will use over the cooked macaroni. You can also begin to make the sauce while the noodles are cooking to save time.




, You can also use a fork or a slotted spoon. Let this mixture cook for a few minutes, stirring it frequently, until it reaches a low boil (bubbles reach the surface, but don't break immediately) and starts to thicken. Make sure you have fully incorporated the ingredients in the mixture.




, Continue stirring until all the cheese has melted.




, Carefully taste the sauce, putting it on a spoon and waiting for it to cool down a bit before you try it. Then, add salt, pepper, nutmeg, or any other spices you'd like to use until the sauce is perfectly delicious. Stir the sauce more to fully add the seasonings to it.




, Gently stir until the macaroni is completely coated in sauce.




, Enjoy this tasty dish on its own, with a healthy salad, or with a piece of chicken or another protein of your choice. You can also add some meat, such as chicken or pancetta, to the macaroni to add another layer to this delicious meal. Macaroni and cheese is pretty hearty, so you won't have to put too much else on your plate!

Reduce by cooking at a low boil or simmer.,
Add some cornstarch to the spaghetti sauce.,
Make a Roux and add it to the sauce.,
Try adding breadcrumbs.,
Add mashed potatoes.,
Finish cooking the spaghetti in the sauce itself.",How to Thicken Spaghetti Sauce1," Reduction is the most natural and easy way to thicken a spaghetti sauce. Here's how you do it:


Bring your tomato sauce to a boil and slightly reduce the heat, allowing it to simmer uncovered to the desired consistency. Stir the sauce often to prevent burning. This will encourage the evaporation of extra water, thickening the sauce.
This method does not change the taste of the sauce, but can take more time, depending on how much water you want to evaporate.;
, The cornstarch mixture has no flavor, so it will not change the taste, but it may change the consistency of the sauce by giving it a silky sheen.


Use equal parts water and cornstarch, mix, then add it to the sauce. Only pour in a small amount at first. Cornstarch is a powerful thickening agent, so you might need less than a teaspoon for a large pot of spaghetti sauce.

, Melting butter and adding flour makes a roux. They used in French cooking as a thickening agent. In fact, a roux is the reason that the creamy alfredo sauce is as thick as it is!


After making the roux and adding bit by bit to the spaghetti sauce, you should cook the sauce for at least 30 minutes longer or you will be able to taste the grainy flour texture. You can also cook the roux before adding to the spaghetti, thus removing the mealy flour texture.
Even with the additional cooking, the roux can change the flavor of your sauce, albeit subtly.

, Breadcrumbs, like roux, is a nice thickening agent because it's primarily flour. Although you may be able to taste the addition of breadcrumbs slightly, they are pretty much vectors for the sauce; you'll definitely notice the thickness more than you'll notice the flavor., Peel, boil, and mash potatoes, adding butter and milk or cream if desired, and stir them into the sauce. The flavour may become very slightly sweeter, but the main effect is the thicker sauce. It will also be much more filling., Prepare the spaghetti until it's slightly underdone (south still of al-dente). Drain the spaghetti thoroughly so that no water remains and add the spaghetti into the pan with the sauce. Finish cooking the spaghetti one or two minutes in the sauce itself. The starch from the spaghetti will help thicken the sauce, and you'll be sure that the spaghetti is well-coated with sauce."

Traditional Italian cooks have been known to add shredded carrots to sauce, but it must be allowed to cook until the carrots are soft and mushy. This also helps reduce the acidity of the sauce.
You can puree and sauté onions and peppers to thicken the sauce, but this will change the flavor.
Try also shredding up various mushrooms into small pieces and adding them for extra thickness and a delicious umami flavor.
Finely shredded eggplant also works like a charm! Be sure to remove the tough outer skin before shredding.

, The meat and tomato flavors are blended best when allowed to cook in the spaghetti sauce for a longer period.

Try a few variations.",How to Make Spaghetti Sauce from Fresh Tomatoes," Spaghetti sauce from fresh tomatoes is one of the easiest and most delicious toppings for a pasta dish. This recipe will take you a total of about 45 minutes to make. The prep work will take 20 minutes and the cook time is 25 minutes. It will yield 2 1/2 to 3 cups (1,134 to 1,361 grams) of sauce.Each serving of sauce is about ½ cup (118 milliliters).
This recipe will create 5 to 6 servings.;
, Rinse each tomato individually to remove any dirt. Once clean, score each one. To “score” means to cut a small “X” into the stem end of the tomato with a sharp knife. This will make their skins very easy to pull off after blanching them.Your “X” doesn’t have to be perfect, just slice the basic shape into the tomato’s end.


Blanching is when you place vegetables into boiling water for a few minutes and then run very cold water over them.Be sure to use the ripest tomatoes for best results.

, Once the water is boiling, drop several of the tomatoes into the pot. Leave them to boil for 2 to 3 minutes. When you see the skins beginning to fall off, use tongs to carefully pull the tomatoes out. Place a strainer or colander in your sink and begin to transfer the blanched tomatoes into it.You will probably have to blanch the tomatoes in batches.
Run very cold water over the ones in the colander while you finish blanching the rest.
Along with making the skins easy to remove, blanching will also preserve the texture and color of the tomatoes., Run cold water over the blanched tomatoes until they can be safely handled. Use a small, sharp knife to remove the skins. They should come off very easily. Discard the skins. Cut the skinless tomatoes in half, then use the knife to cut out the core.Use your fingers to dig out most of the remaining seeds and discard them.
Dice the tomatoes into large chunks.

, Finely chop the onion and mince the garlic. Put 4 tablespoons (60 milliliters) of extra virgin olive oil in a large saucepan. Heat the oil over medium heat until it begins to sizzle. Transfer the onion into the saucepan and cook for several minutes until it gets tender. Stir it often. You’ll know it’s ready when the onion is soft and looks slightly translucent.Add the minced garlic to the saucepan. Stir frequently.
Sauté for about 60 seconds or until the garlic becomes fragrant.

, Carefully add the diced, skinless tomatoes to the pan. Add a dash of sea salt and freshly ground black paper (to taste). Mince the basil and add half of it to the pan.Reserve the other half of the fresh basil for the end of the recipe.
Stir the sauce well to make sure the basil properly mixes into the sauce.

, Once everything is added to the pot, reduce the heat to low. Allow the sauce to simmer uncovered for about 20 minutes. To simmer means to cook food at just below the boiling point.


You'll know it’s simmering when you see a couple of small bubbles breaking the surface every 1 to 2 seconds.Adjust the heat up or down as necessary to maintain the simmer.

, It will be fairly chunky and should appear to be a vibrantly red hue. If you prefer your sauce to be slightly thicker, continue to simmer it for another 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. The longer a sauce simmers, the thicker it becomes.When your sauce has reached your preferred consistency, stir the rest of the minced basil into the sauce.
Remove the sauce from heat.

, Bring a pot of water to a boil and place the pasta of your choice in it to cook. Any kind of pasta will go well with this sauce – fettuccine, tagliatelle and spaghetti noodles are the most traditional options. Since all pastas differ in cook time, check the packaging of yours and follow the directions until the noodles are tender.


Once the pasta noodles are done, remove the pot from heat.
Drain the noodles well before plating them.

, Carefully place a serving of pasta onto each plate. Use a large spoon or ladle to pour about ½ cup (118 milliliters) of the tomato sauce over each serving. Serve the dish with grated Parmesan or Pecorino Romano cheese.


Garnish the plates with fresh basil leaves and/or lightly toasted pine nuts (optional).
Thick, crusty garlic bread and a well-tossed Caesar salad would both compliment this dish (optional).

, Consider substituting the pasta noodles with wheat pasta or gluten-free pasta. Add a few more fresh herbs to the sauce, such as rosemary and thyme, or use a small amount of additional fresh herbs to garnish each plate. You can easily add additional veggies to your sauce; mushrooms are very popular. Simply add them in right after you sauté the onions and garlic. Meatballs are another favorite addition to this sauce. Beef, pork, chicken and turkey are all great candidates for meatballs.


Start by making your favorite version and then brown the meatballs. Put together the sauce and allow it to simmer for about 20 minutes. Add the browned meatballs to the sauce and simmer for an additional 30 minutes.For vegans, try substituting the cheese with nutritional yeast. Simply sprinkle a small amount on top of the noodles and sauce right before you serve the pasta. The yeast will add a cheesy richness to the dish.
This tomato sauce would also work well on homemade pizzas or as a tasty dipping sauce for bread sticks.

If you're going to put the macaroni and cheese in the oven to bake, you can remove the pasta from the water when it's slightly undercooked. It will cook a little more in the oven, and if it's perfectly cooked when it goes in, it might come out too soft.

, Melt the butter over medium-low heat, then stir in the flour with a wire whisk (this is called a roux). Turn the burner down a bit and let the roux bubble a few minutes (make sure the butter does not burn). Continue to stir to cook the flour a bit, but don't let it brown. Stir in the warm milk all at once, stirring vigorously with the whisk to smooth out any lumps. Whisk in the mustard and cayenne if you are using them and let the sauce bubble gently for about 2 minutes.


This is just one of the many cheese sauces you can make. For variation, try other cheese sauces like Make Mexican White Cheese Sauce.
White sauce (also referred to as bechamel) can also be made in the microwave.

, Sprinkle the chicken with salt and pepper, to taste. You can also add other seasonings that you may want.

, Turn the stove on low heat. The low heat is to prevent the oil from getting too hot and start popping.


Make sure to heat the olive oil until it is less thick and flows easily. This ensures that it is hot enough to cook the chicken.
If the oil starts popping, it's because it is too hot when you add the chicken. Immediately take the chicken off of the stove and lower the heat. Put the chicken back on once the oil has had a chance to cool down a bit.

Prepare your baking or pizza stone.,
Bake the pizza.,
Serve.",How to Make a Macaroni and Cheese Pizza," Fill water in a pot and place it on a stove top to boil. Once it has boiled, pour the elbows into the boiling water and have it boil until soft. Most pastas take about 10-11 minutes to be soft but check on the package directions to be sure, they usually give the exact time there. Once the elbows are fully boiled place a colander in the sink and drain all the pasta. Be careful, it will be hot! Set aside.


Shake the colander around to dry the pasta off. You may need to even toss it as well.;
, Preheat your stove top to medium heat. In a large saucepan melt the butter until it has fully melted. To help it melt use a wooden spoon or fork to move the butter around the heat. Once the butter has melted and starts to bubble pour in the flour and stir with a whisk. The mixture will look like a watery, brown liquid which is normal.


If your mixture is beginning to thicken you may have added too much flour or very little butter. The mixture should be watery like a liquid.

, Once the flour has dissolved well in the melted butter slowly pour the milk and cream. Continue to stir with a whisk until the liquid is white.

, The most important and crucial ingredient of all for this macaroni recipe, cheese! Pour the shredded cheddar cheese 1/2 cup at a time. Putting all the cheese at once makes big chunks in your cheese sauce which no one would like at all! Once you have poured all the cheese stir continuously until the sauce is a bright yellow.

, Slowly pour all the sauce on the macaroni and scrape any remaining sauce with a rubber spatula. Stir all around until the macaroni really looks like macaroni and cheese, yellow and bright.

, If the crust was still in the package, remove it and place it on your cooking space. Use a pastry brush to gently cover the olive oil all over the crust. Make sure to cover up the whole crust carefully. The olive oil helps the pizza get a more greasy and buttery taste so it's important to add it all over.

, Pour all the macaroni and cheese on the pre-made crust. Scrape any remaining macaroni to get every last bit. Gently lather the macaroni on the pizza with a wooden spoon. Be sure the whole crust has enough macaroni because if it does not each slice may not get enough macaroni.

, Use your hands to slowly sprinkle 1/2 cup of any desired shredded cheese all over the pizza. While any cheese can work, cheddar is the best since it gives this pizza a nice kick. This is the fun part of making the pizza because when the cheese melts in the oven it'll come out gooey when you slice it. Yum!

, For qualified baking, place the pizza on a pizza or baking stone so it can bake well. Pizza stones can withstand high temperatures so you won't have to worry a lot about it like other baking pans. Plus you can easily slice your pizza without scratching the bottom or surface. That's why most restaurants and professional chefs bake their pizzas on pizza stones or baking stones. They may be pricy but they last for a long time and are worth it.

, Have the pizza bake in the oven until the crust is golden and the cheese has melted. The macaroni may also look a bit crisped. All ovens vary but it will most likely take about ten to twelve minutes of baking.

, Once the pizza has fully baked, have it cool until warm enough to eat. Cut using a pizza cutter and place one slice on a serving plate.

Enjoy with bread and salad.",How to Make Pasta With Alfredo Sauce From a Jar," The average serving size is 2 ounces of pasta per person. That's about half a handful of dried fettuccine noodles, or half a cup of dried macaroni. Decide how much pasta you want to cook and measure it out from the box.


If you find it easier to cook the whole box, that's fine, too. You can always eat leftovers later.
The type of pasta you choose is completely up to you. Fettuccine noodles, which are like wide, flat spaghetti noodles, are commonly paired with Alfredo sauce. However, any type of pasta will taste great, so feel free to use whatever you have on hand.;
, When it comes to making pasta, it doesn't matter how much water you use; you just need enough to submerge the pasta. Err on the safe side and fill the pot about 3/4 full to make sure you have enough. You want it to come to a full, rolling boil before you add the pasta.


If you want, you can salt the water to help flavor the pasta. Add a few shakes of salt from your salt shaker. You can also add salt later, after the pasta has cooked, or just enjoy the saltiness of the Alfredo sauce.

, Drop the dried pasta into the water, and it will immediately begin cooking.

, Different types of pasta require different cooking times. In general, it should take eight to ten minutes to finish cooking your pasta. Most people enjoy their pasta ""al dente,"" which means it still has a bit of bite to it, rather than being completely mushy.You can check to see if the pasta is ready by using a fork to pull out a piece and tasting it. If you like the texture, remove it from heat.
Or smack a piece of pasta against the wall or another surface. If it sticks, it's ready.

, Turn off the heat and place the pasta on a different burner so it stops cooking.

, You'll need the same number of sauce servings as pasta servings. For example, if you made enough pasta for two people, heat enough sauce for two people. Check the nutrition label on the sauce jar to find out how much sauce is in one serving; it should be about 1/4 to 1/2 cup per person.

, The pot you use needs to be large enough to fit both the Alfredo sauce and the pasta, so choose accordingly.

, Place the pan on a burner, turn the burner to medium, and let the sauce begin to heat. Stir it occasionally using a spatula or spoon to keep it from scorching on the bottom. It should take about five minutes to heat. Taste the sauce to see if it's hot before going to the next step.

, Lift the pasta from the pasta pot to the Alfredo pan to mix them together. You can use tongs or a pronged pasta spoon to do the job. Keep going until all of the pasta has been moved from the pot to the pan with the sauce.

, This will give the pasta and the sauce time to combine and take on a nice texture. After three minutes are up, remove the pan from heat.

, You could also pour it into a bowl and have everyone serve themselves.

, Grated parmesan cheese and chopped parsley taste wonderful with pasta and Alfredo sauce. Add as many toppings as you want, or just eat it plain. Season with additional salt and pepper to taste.

, Make your pasta dish into a complete meal by serving it with some garlic bread and a salad on the side.

Use a whisk to mix the flour and butter together thoroughly. Once it’s mixed and has turned a golden color, dump in the minced garlic that you’ve prepped.

Measure elbow macaroni using measuring cups or a food scale.,
Measure penne pasta using measuring cups or a food scale.,
Measure ribbed lasagna using a food scale or individual pieces.",How to Measure Dry Pasta1," You can either read directly from the recipe or pasta sauce bottle, or if you are making pasta sauce from scratch, figure out how many people you will feed with your sauce.


A single serving of pasta is generally regarded as 2 oz. (57 g) of cooked pasta for a first course or side dish.A serving can be raised 3 to 4 oz. (85 to 113 g) if it is the only course. Occasionally a serving is approximated as 1/2 cup (114 g) of pasta; however, this depends upon the shape of the pasta.
One serving = 2 oz.; two servings = 4 oz.; four servings = 8 oz.; six servings = 12 oz.; eight servings = 16 oz.;
, Place a bunch of spaghetti between your thumb and forefinger. 1 serving of pasta, or 2 oz. (57 g), will be equivalent to a bunch of pasta between your fingers with a diameter of 7/8 inch (24.26 mm).This is the diameter of a United States quarter.


Two servings = 1.75 inches; four servings = 3.5 inches; six servings = 5.25 inches; eight servings = 7 inches.
Spaghetti, linguine, and other long pastas can be measured using a pasta measure. A pasta measure is a tool that is available at kitchen supply stores, in pasta-making kits, and online.You place the long pasta in various loops to measure a serving of the pasta.

, If using a food scale, place the pasta in the cup attached to the scale and measure 57 g. If using measuring cups, a single 2 oz. (57 g) serving is 1/2 cup of dried pasta.


Two servings = 1 cup; four servings = 2 cups; six servings = 3 cups; eight servings = 4 cups.

, If you are using measuring cups, a single 2 oz. (57 g) serving is 3/4 cup of dried pasta.


Two servings = 1 1/2 cups; four servings = 3 cups; six servings = 4 1/2 cups; eight servings = 6 cups.

, A 2 oz. (57 g) serving of lasagna is approximately 2 pieces of dry lasagna sheets.It is typically best to use about four layers of noodles when making a lasagna. The typical baking dish used to make lasagna is either 8x8 inches or 10x8 inches. With four layers of lasagna noodles, an 8x8 pan of lasagna will typically feed four people, while a 10x8 pan will usually serve six.

Know what constitutes an egg noodle.,
Measure egg noodles using measuring cups or a food scale.,
Know that extra wide egg noodles might be slightly different.",How to Measure Dry Pasta2," Most pasta contains egg, but to be considered an egg noodle, it must contain at least 5.5 percent egg solids., When measuring egg noodles using measuring cups, 2 oz. (56 g) of egg noodles is approximately 1 1/4 cup of egg noodles and also 1 1/4 cup of cooked noodles.


Unlike macaroni pastas, egg noodles measured in measuring cups are typically the same both dry and cooked.

, Typically, for extra wide egg noodles, a 2 oz. serving equals 1 1/4 cups of dry egg noodles, which will yield approximately 1 1/2 cups of cooked noodles.

Place the cooked pasta in an airtight container.,
Add some butter or olive oil to the pasta.,
Refrigerate the pasta.,
Store pasta sauce separately.",How to Store Leftover Pasta1," The container you use should have a lid or other type of secure closure to keep air from getting in. When exposed to air, the moisture in cooked pasta can become a breeding ground for bacteria and mold. Make sure the container is fully sealed before putting the pasta away.If you’re storing your pasta in a Ziploc bag, squeeze as much air out of the bag as you can before sealing and stashing it.
Make sure to refrigerate leftover pasta within two hours of preparing it to keep it from going bad prematurely.;
, A little oil or butter will keep the cooked pasta from clumping and sticking as it dries out. Stir the oil or butter into the pasta until its coated lightly and evenly. This will make it much easier to reheat later on.1-2 teaspoons should do for an average serving size. The pasta only needs to be lightly coated.
Toss freshly-made pasta with flour immediately prior to refrigerating., Cooked, unsauced pasta will usually stay fresh in the refrigerator for 3-5 days. After that, the pasta will begin to lose its flavor and can even mold if left for too long. Store the pasta away from other foods that may transfer unwanted odors.Find a place for your leftovers on the top or middle shelf where they’ll be in plain sight. Otherwise, you may forget about them.
You can reheat refrigerated pasta by dunking it in a pot of boiling water for 20-30 seconds.

, If you’ve made a sauce to serve with the pasta, it should go in a different container. Most pasta sauces will keep for about a week when properly sealed and refrigerated. However, tomato-based sauces tend to last longer than cream sauces due to their acidity.If you’re unsure whether the sauce is still good after 6-7 days, take a whiff and use your best judgment.
Reheat leftover pasta sauce on the stovetop when serving it a second time.
Cream sauces can be difficult to reheat on their own, as the fat and dairy components have a tendency to separate when refrigerated after cooking."

",How to Make Veg Noodles," Popular recipes use Chinese noodles and carrots, bell pepper, and onion to make veg noodles, but these key ingredients can be changed.Almost any veggie can be used in this recipe.Pick a few of your favorite veggies to serve with the noodles.
Popular combinations include mushrooms, onion, and zucchini; carrot, red bell pepper, and potatoes; or even green bell pepper, green onions, and baby corns.
Only use 3-4 types of vegetables.
Whole wheat noodles are a healthy alternative to regular Chinese noodles.
Garlic and ginger are also commonly added to veg noodles, but depending on your preference, you may choose to avoid these strong flavors.
Some people also enjoy adding chili sauce or powder to veg noodles. This will make them spicy.;
, It’s easy to lose track of spices in the pantry, so before you go to the store, check for salt, pepper, coriander, and masala powder. These are the key to the flavor of veg noodles, and you most likely have a few of them already.


Make sure you also have soy sauce and cooking oil; if not, you will need to purchase these as well.

, This will help prevent multiple trips to the store. Include every item.


one package of Chinese noodles
1 medium carrot
1 small to medium green bell pepper
1 small white onion
2 garlic cloves
½ inch ginger
soy sauce
coriander
masala powder
oil (any kind)
salt and pepper
chili sauce or powder

, Most popular grocery chains have an ethnic food aisle, but some may not. This aisle will have the Chinese noodles you need along with the masala powder and coriander.

, Your package of noodles will say specifically how much water is required, but 4 quarts is average.Add a pinch of salt.Leaving the lid on the pot will make the water boil faster.

, Note that this time will vary, so check the box of noodles for instructions. In general, once the noodles are soft and pliable, they are done.


Keep an eye on the noodles. If the water begins to overflow, turn the heat down.
Stir the noodles occasionally if they are sticking together.
Remove the lid if the water is boiling very rapidly.

, Rinse them with cold water to avoid sticking, and set the noodles aside.

, Roots like carrots and potatoes will need to be scrubbed, while mushrooms will need to be rinsed thoroughly. Make sure every veggie is clean and free of dirt.

, This mostly applies to onions since they have layers of skin, but some people like to peel their carrots and potatoes as well.

, You don’t need to chop the veggies perfectly, but smaller pieces will cook faster.


Chop the garlic and ginger, too. Unlike the veggies, these ingredients must be chopped very finely. Eating big chunks of garlic and ginger can be off-putting.
Use a sharp knife. A dull knife makes chopping veggies more difficult.
Use a large cutting board.

, Once the oil starts to bubble, add the garlic and ginger. Let these cook for a minute or so before adding all the vegetables.


Stir often so the veggies are fried evenly.
After 5-7 minutes, taste the vegetables to make sure they are cooked. If not, keep frying them.
When they are done, turn the heat down to low.

, Move the noodles from the colander to the frying pan, then add 2 tablespoons of soy sauce. Stir the pan over low to medium heat for about 5 minutes.

, Add salt, pepper, coriander, masala powder, and any other spice you desire, like chili powder.


About 1 teaspoon of each spice is average, but you may like the dish more salty, spicy, or bland.
Stir the dish after every spice is added. This will help coat the veggies evenly.
Taste the dish frequently. Use a fork to try a tiny portion of the dish; when the spices taste good, you’re done cooking.

Transfer leftovers to an airtight container.,
Stick the pasta in the refrigerator.,
Use within 2-3 days.,
Warm up sauced pasta in the oven.",How to Store Leftover Pasta2," Pasta that has already been mixed together with sauce will still keep just fine. Pour the sauced pasta into a Tupperware container or large Ziploc bag and seal it up. Make sure there’s as little air in the container as possible before closing it, as contamination will speed up the growth of mold.Let hot pasta cool to just above room temperature before transferring it to a separate storage container.Storing the pasta and sauce together can greatly simplify your storage situation if you don’t have a lot of space to work with.

, Make room for the pasta on one of the upper shelves. The cool conditions will keep it fresh for a few days. Remember not to bury your leftovers behind other items, or your could forget about them until they go bad.


It may help to label your leftover pasta with the item name and refrigeration date.

, In most causes, sauced pasta will keep for up to 3 days, but it will be better if consumed within a day or two. The longer the pasta sits, the more it will absorb the flavor of sauce. Eventually, this can make the pasta mushy and overpower its more subtle notes.If you’re not sure whether you’ll be reheating the refrigerated pasta within this time frame, you may be better off freezing it instead.
Pasta can actually be even better leftover, after the individual flavors have had more of a chance to mingle., A microwave can heat leftover pasta unevenly and deaden its flavor. For better results, scrape the refrigerated pasta into a baking dish and place it in the oven for about 20 minutes at 350 degrees F (176 degrees C). Make sure the pasta is heated throughout, then remove it from the oven and let it cool before enjoying.Covering the baking dish with aluminum foil will help lock in moisture as the pasta cooks so that it doesn’t come out too dry.
You could also reheat sauced pasta on the cooktop over low heat, stirring frequently.

"
"
Place the uneaten pasta in a large freezer bag.,
Store the pasta in the freezer.,
Thaw the pasta in the refrigerator before reheating.",How to Store Leftover Pasta3," One advantage of pasta is that it freezes well, whether it’s been combined with sauce or not. Make sure to press all excess air out of the bag before sealing it.The thin material of plastic freezer bags makes them better for freezing than thicker containers.
Drizzle the past with oil or butter before freezing it. The added fat will come in handy during the reheating process, serving to break up frozen clumps.

, Once it’s frozen, the leftover pasta will be preserved for three months or longer. However, you should aim to eat the leftover pasta within one to two months for optimum freshness and flavor. When left frozen for too long, high water content foods like cooked pasta can become freezer burned, which will ruin the flavor and make it difficult to reheat properly.Mark frozen leftovers with the date so you’ll remember to use them before they expire.

, Rather than attempting to thaw the frozen pasta at room temperature, transition it to the refrigerator. This will allow it to reach a mild temperature much more gradually, preserving the flavor and texture. The pasta can then be heated in boiling water and combined with sauce, while sauced pasta can be reheated in the oven.The pasta will likely require a few hours in the refrigerator to thaw completely.
Pasta that has been thawed in the refrigerator will usually be edible for another 3-4 days."

Put a large pot of water on the stove to boil and add 1/2 tbsp. (8 ml) of salt to the pot. You'll need about 6 quarts (5.5 L) of water to cook 1 lb. (0.45 kg) of angel hair pasta. Once the water has come to a boil add the angel hair pasta and stir. Begin timing the angel hair pasta once the water boils, and turn the heat down so the water simmers.

Drain the noodles and run immediately under cold water.",How to Make Udon1," If you're using a blend of flours, lightly whisk them together to break up clumps and ensure it is all well-mixed. Sifting makes sure all the flour blends into your dough without unappetizing bits of uncooked flour.
, This ensures that the salt is evenly distributed. If you have a kitchen thermometer, the water wants to be roughly 110F -- warm but not too hot to touch., Using a scooping motion, start combining the flour and water until you have a mixture resembling wet sand -- it should only take a minute or so. You want to almost toss the water in the dough instead of pressing or beating it in., Once the water is incorporated the first time, add half of the remaining water and mix. When done, add whatever water remains, mixing until the dough starts to form strands and holds a vague shape.Mixing in the water and flour can also be done with a stand mixer. Simply use the dough hook attachment and mix at medium speed for five minutes. Start after adding the first half of water, adding the rest slowly as the machine runs

, Squeeze all of the air out of the bag, seal it, and then wrap it in a towel -- you're reaching the fun part! Udon, traditionally, is kneaded by foot, as this allows you to get much more pressure on the dough to get a chewy final texture., Rotate and turn as you do, ensuring you're really working the dough evenly. Keep stepping until the dough expands to take up the whole bag.

If you want to knead by hand, know that you'll need to knead for 10-15 minutes to get the right texture for these springy noodles. They need vigorous work to stretch the gluten that gives you the necessary chewiness., Knead the dough again until flat, then take it out, fold it up, and do it all again. You should knead the dough with your feet a total of three times., Put it in a warm, dry place to sit and relax. This stage takes all of the gluten you beat into a tough, gummy pulp and lets it relax into a more chewable and delicious final texture., The thickness is up to you, and the thickness of this dough rectangle will be the thickness of your final noodles. Use a rolling pin and a lightly floured surface to make a nice, neat rectangle., This is just like you did with the kneading. When done, you should have a long, thick slab of three-layered dough.

Don't press the layers into each other. Simply fold them on top of one another

, Simply start cutting on one end of the dough rectangle, leaving the noodles as thick as you'd like. Most restaurants aim for about a 1/4"" or less, but you can cut them to your heart's desire., Before putting them in the water, unfold the noodles from their rolled up form.As soon as the noodles hit the pot, use chopsticks or a spoon to ensure they don't clump and sit together. Add a dash of salt and boil until the noodles start floating to the top and have a tender, chewy texture., This has a two-fold effect: it stops the noodles from continuing to cook in the hot water trapped inside, and it removes the unappealing coating of slimy starch that forms around the noodles. Give them a good, cold rinse for 2-3 minutes, and you're ready to serve.When rinsing the noodles, use your hands to give them a light toss, removing excess starch."

Japanese-style curry, There is a lot of chatter about tapioca flour among online chefs, with many recipes swearing by it and just as many saying it's unnecessary. IF you make a lot of udon noodles, give it a try. The flour has a slight sweetness and no gluten in it, meaning the noodles are a bit lighter and less chewy., This will lead to a slower relaxation stage, but it also means you can prepare the noodles in advance and wait until the next day to heat them. The following afternoon, simply remove the dough ball and flatten it, cutting the noodles and cooking like normal.

Note, if the noodles are still cold, they may take an additional minute to cook. It will not, however, be much longer, so stay near the pot.

, Place the cut noodles on a baking sheet and put it in the freezer. Once the dough is hard and frozen, put the noodles in a zip-lock bag and squeeze the air out. These noodles will now last for a few months. When ready to cook them, simply toss them directly into the hot water and cook like normal.

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit (190 degrees Celsius).Meanwhile, prepare a 13-inch by 9-inch (33-cm by 23-cm) baking dish by coating the bottom and sides with nonstick cooking spray.,
Simmer the water.,
Add the fresh tuna, lemon, and thyme.,
Poach for 10 minutes.,
Boil the water.,
Cook the pasta until firm.,
Drain.,
Melt the butter.,
Cook the onion.,
Add the flour.,

Mix the bread crumbs and oil.,
Top the tuna pasta bake.,
Bake for 25 minutes.,
Serve hot.",How to Make Tuna Pasta Bake1,"


Ideally, you should begin preheating the oven before poaching the tuna, boiling the pasta, or preparing the sauce. Doing so will ensure that the oven is ready for the tuna pasta bake by the time your other ingredients are finished.;
, Fill a medium stockpot halfway with water, then set the pan on the stove over medium-high heat. Allow the water to reach a simmer.


Once bubbles and steam begin to appear, you can continue to the next step. You do not need to wait for the water to reach a full boil.
Note that the poaching step is only necessary if you decide to work with fresh tuna steaks. If you use canned tuna, simply open the cans, drain the water or oil, and set the tuna aside until needed.

, Place the tuna steaks, lemon half, and thyme in the simmering water. Reduce the heat to medium or medium-low, keeping the water at a gentle simmer.


You can cook the tuna without the addition of lemon and thyme, but these seasonings will give the tuna more flavor and add more dimension to the finished tuna noodle bake.

, Cook the tuna, uncovered, at a gentle simmer for about 10 minutes or until it flakes easily with a fork.When the tuna is ready, remove it from the water and gently flake it apart with two forks. Set the flaked tuna aside until later. Discard the water, lemon, and thyme.

, Fill a separate saucepan with roughly 4 qt (4 L) of cold water. Set the pan on the stove over medium-high heat, and bring the water to a boil.


If desired, you can add a little salt to the water after it reaches a boil, but doing so is not strictly necessary.

, Add the pasta to the boiling water and cook it for 2 minutes less than the recommended time marked on the box.


Since the pasta will continue to cook while the dish bakes, you should not boil it to completion during this step.
You can use nearly any type of short pasta for this recipe, but cooking times will vary depending on the type you choose. While you should always follow the package guidelines, the following cook times are typically accurate:Egg noodles, regular: 8 minutes
Egg noodles, extra-wide: 10 minutes
Elbow macaroni: 8 minutes
Farfalle: 13 minutes
Penne: 9 minutes
Rigatoni: 12 minutes
Rotini: 8 minutes
Shells, medium: 9 minutes
Wagon wheels: 10 minutes
Ziti: 14 minutes



, When the pasta is ready, drain the water. Set the pasta aside, keeping it warm until the recipe calls for it again.

, Place the butter in a medium saucepan. Set the pan on the stove over medium-high heat, and melt the butter completely.


As the butter melts, tilt the pan so that it evenly coats the entire bottom.

, Toss the chopped onions into the melted butter. Cook the onions, stirring frequently, for about 5 minutes.


When ready, the onions should be wilted, translucent, and more fragrant.

, Sprinkle the flour over the butter and onion mixture. Whisk the flour into the mixture until it soaks up all the butter and becomes thoroughly moist.


Continue cooking the flour for an additional 1 minute, whisking constantly. This additional cook time is necessary to destroy the bitter taste of raw flour.

, Slowly pour the milk into the pan, whisking it into the roux (the butter and flour mixture) as you add it.After adding all the milk, reduce the heat to medium and continue cooking the sauce mixture for another 4 minutes or so, whisking continuously. When ready, the sauce should be notably thick.

, Remove the saucepan from the heat. Sprinkle the salt and black pepper into the sauce, then grate three-quarters of the cheddar cheese directly into the sauce.


Mix well to combine. The residual heat of the sauce should melt most of the cheese.
Cover the saucepan and keep the sauce warm until you're ready to use it again. Ideally, the sauce should be the last component you prepare before putting the entire bake together.

, Thoroughly and evenly stir together the prepared tuna, pasta, sauce, and vegetables in a large bowl. Immediately pour the combined ingredients into the prepared baking dish.


The mixture will be thick, so you should use the back of the mixing spoon to spread it evenly into the pan.

, In a small bowl, mix together the unseasoned bread crumbs and the olive oil. Continue stirring until the crumbs have completely soaked up the oil.

, Grate the remaining cheddar cheese over the top of the tuna bake, then sprinkle the freshly chopped parsley over it. Cover everything with the moistened bread crumbs.


Leave the baking dish uncovered. The cheese and breadcrumbs need to be exposed to the direct heat of the oven.

, Place the filled baking dish in the preheated oven. Cook the tuna pasta bake for approximately 25 minutes, or until the top turns golden brown and the edges begin to bubble.


To prevent the bake from burning, check through the window of the oven door every 5 minutes or so, starting at the 20-minute mark. It might be done in as few as 20 minutes or as many as 35 minutes.

, Remove the tuna pasta bake from the oven and let it rest for roughly 5 minutes. Serve the dish while it's still hot.

Set the saucepan on the stove over medium-high heat, and let it reach a rolling boil.


If desired, you can lightly salt the water once it reaches a boil. Doing so can draw more flavor out of the pasta, but it's not strictly necessary.

, Add the dry pasta to the boiling water. Cook it for 1 to 2 minutes less than the time indicated on the box, then remove it from the heat and drain away the water.


The pasta will continue cooking as you bake it, so you shouldn't cook it to full tenderness during this step. Ideally, it should seem firm or ""al dente"" at the completion of this step.
Use short, medium-sized pasta for this dish. The exact cooking time will vary based on the specific type of pasta used. Following the package guidelines will typically produce the best results, but you can use the following cook times as a guideline:Egg noodles, regular: 8 minutes
Egg noodles, extra-wide: 10 minutes

, In a large bowl, mix together the drained tuna, prepared pasta, cream of mushroom soup, milk, and vegetables. Transfer this mixture into the prepared baking dish.


Sprinkle the mixture with the shredded cheddar cheese.
Do not cover the top of the baking dish with foil. Allow the cheese to remain exposed to the direct heat of the oven.

, Place the tuna pasta bake in the preheated oven. Cook it until the cheese begins to brown and the sides begin to bubble.

, As the dish bakes, mix together the bread crumbs and melted butter (or oil) in a small bowl.


Continue mixing until the bread crumbs completely soak up the fat.

, Temporarily remove the tuna pasta bake from the oven. Evenly sprinkle the moist bread crumbs over the top of the dish, then return it to the oven for another 5 minutes.Keep the baking dish uncovered, and cook the bake until the bread crumbs turn golden brown.

, Remove the tuna pasta bake from the oven. Let it rest for about 5 minutes before serving.

Pick longer, thinner sweet potatoes.,
Avoid overripe potatoes.,
Prepare within the next three weeks at most.,
Skin your potatoes.,
Spiralize your sweet potatoes.,
Saute them in a skillet.,
Roast them instead, if desired.,
Try a spinach-cashew cream.,
Make a sauce with roasted red pepper and extra sweet potato.,
Microwave a peanut sauce.",How to Make Sweet Potato Noodles," Sweet potatoes come in varied shapes and sizes. For noodles, however, favor longer, thinner ones that are relatively uniform in thickness from end to end. As a model, pick those that most closely resemble zucchinis.The more uniform your sweet potato is in thickness, the more uniform your noodles will be.;
, Expect the flesh of these to be more brittle. This means that it’s more likely to break apart, so steer clear of them in order to avoid noodles that snap in two. Discard any sweet potatoes that:Have dark spots on the skin.Have any growths developing on the skin.
Feel soft to the touch.
Leak moisture and/or feel damp.

, Remember: you don't want to use overripe sweet potatoes for this, so for the best results, make your noodles right after purchase. Otherwise, expect them to last between three to five weeks when stored in the pantry. So err on the side of caution and make your noodles within the next three weeks.If needed, you can store them in the fridge to make them last longer. Refrigeration should make them last between two and three months.

, If you’ve ever handled a sweet potato before, you probably know that the flesh is pretty hardy. Expect the skin to be pretty darn tough on its own, too, which can make them turning into noodles tougher. Make life easier and skin each one with a potato peeler.Even though you’re peeling them, wash each one under cold running water before you start. The blade of your peeler can transfer dirt and chemicals to the flesh if you don’t., First, choose between your spiralizer’s noodle blade (which will make noodles similar in shape to spaghetti) or its spiral blade (which will make curly noodles).Refer to your make and model’s instructions on how to properly attach your blade and operate the machine, since these vary. Generally speaking though, you prop the sweet potato lengthwise between the blade and the handle, then crank the handle to force the potato through the blade.Expect sweet potatoes to require applying more pressure than other vegetables do.If needed, slice off both ends to the potato before you start so they’re both flat.
If you don’t have a spiralizer, you can shred them with a julienne peeler instead., Coat the bottom of a large skillet with olive oil. Turn the heat to medium-high. Once the oil heats up, place your noodles in the pan. Stir them around in the oil to coat them, and/or use a pair of tongs to toss them. Stir or toss frequently as you cook. For crisper noodles, remove after five minutes. For softer ones, saute them for ten minutes., Preheat your oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit (219 degrees Celsius). Spray a roasting pan with cooking oil. Spread your noodles in the pan and mist them with your cooking spray. Place the pan in the oven and roast for 10 to 12 minutes., First, place your cashews in a bowl, cover them with water, and let them sit for a couple hours or more (the longer they soak, the softer they’ll get). Drain them in a strainer and then place them in a food processor or blender. Pulse to chop them up a bit, then add your salt, garlic, and ¾ cup of water. Blend until it smoothes to an evenly creamy texture. Then:Season with salt, pepper, and herbs to taste.
Place your spinach in the skillet after you remove your cooked noodles.
Add your cream to the skillet once the spinach wilts.
Add water if needed to thin the cream if it sticks to the pan.
Stir everything up, top your noodles, and drizzle with olive oil if desired.

, In addition to the sweet potatoes that you’re using for your noodles, pick up an extra one or reserve 1 cup’s worth (210 g). Chop it into chunks and steam 1 cup's worth. Roast your red pepper. Place those in a blender or food processor. Add your milk, basil, garlic, and salt. Blend until the texture turns creamy.Be aware that the combined steam from your potatoes and peppers can force the lid to your blender out of position. Either wait for them to cool off or hold the lid in place as you blend.
Once the noodles cook, pour the sauce into the skillet. Stir or toss to coat them evenly. Then cover and cook for another two minutes before serving.

, Add your peanut butter to a microwave-safe bowl. Microwave for about half a minute, or until it melts. Remove from microwave and add your water, soy sauce, sesame oil, rice vinegar, garlic, ginger, and lime juice. Whisk until they are evenly mixed. Pour the sauce over the noodles in the skillet once they’ve cooked, then stir or toss until they’re evenly coated."

Purchase the right buckwheat for soba noodles -- not all of them are created equally.,
Weigh out your flours, whenever possible, and mix in a large bowl.,
Sift the flour to remove any lumps.,
Add the warm water slowly, blending into the dough with your fingers.,
Knead until you have a crumbly, loose dough, adjusting as needed.,
Knead the dough on a floured counter until smooth, about 5-7 minutes.,
Mold the dough into a flat-bottomed peak.,
Press the peak straight down with your palm to form a 1/2"" (1.3cm) dough disc.,
Dust your rolling surface and rolling pin with more flour.,
Roll the dough, starting from the center and working out, into a thin rectangle.,
Sprinkle flour over half of the dough.,
Fold the unfloured dough half on top of the floured half.,
Flour the bottom half of the dough and fold it over two more times.,
Slice the dough vertically with even, methodical cuts.,
Immediately toss the noodles with a pinch more flour.,
Cook the noodles that day or freeze for three months.",How to Make Soba1," Whenever possible, go to an Asian market and look for Soba Koh buckwheat, which is specially milled for soba noodles (try Cold Mountain or Anson Mills brands, which are designed for soba). You never want whole-grain flour. Soba buckwheat is milled incredibly slowly for extra-fine grains., Flour compresses unevenly, meaning two cups of flour could have different quantities if one is more compact than the other. Weighing out your flour avoids this problem, and in a recipe as precise and fine as soba noodles this kind of perfection is necessary., You want the flour to be as light, airy, and fine as possible when mixing. You can sift the flours either separately or together, after measuring. If you don't have a sifter, a fork or whisk will do as well., Toss and massage the flours into the water until it forms a crumbly, muddy texture. It should smell fragrant, like sesame seeds, as the water blends in.

The flour will also start to turn slightly gray -- this is a good thing!, If it feels a little dry and powdery, add 1 tablespoon of water and keep kneading. If it's sticking to you and feels too wet, sprinkle in a bit more buckwheat flour. Knowing exactly when the dough is ready takes some experience, but trust yourself. As long as you keep the adjustments small, a tablespoon or less at a time, you'll be fine.

Humidity will affect this stage of the recipe. If it is humid out you'll likely need to add a bit more flour. If the air is dry, add a touch more water., Spread a little buckwheat or tapioca flour on the counter and knead until the dough is smooth. When you're done, it will hold it's shape without cracking as you knead it. It is a very dense dough, so you'll want it about waist height so you can put your body weight into the dough. For a refresher on kneading:

Fold about 1/3 of the dough ball on top of itself.
Press the heel of your hand into the fold, driving down into the dough.
Rotate the dough ball a quarter turn.
Repeat., You want to make a mini mountain on your countertop. Working from the outside in, from a peak with the dough about 6"" (15cm) tall., The bottom should be smooth, and the top will likely have some pleats and ridges. There should be a small bump of dough in the center.

Alternatively, skip the peak. Instead, pull up an inch of dough from the outside of the dough and fold it into the center of the dough. Repeat 8 times so that your dough resemble a chrysanthemum, with pleats meeting in the middle. While harder, this is a more traditional method., This ensures that the dough doesn't stick and rip as you roll it out. You can use the same surface you kneaded on, but make sure that it is still floured. You should be able to cut on this surface, as well., For restaurant quality noodles, aim for 1/18"" (10-15 millimeters) thickness. For beginners, a little thicker is fine, but try to keep it as thin as you can. Use more flour as necessary to prevent sticking as you roll.

To get perfectly square corners, pull at the edges and then press them lightly with the rolling pin to get straight line
The exact rectangle dimensions are unimportant, but know that the vertical length of you rectangle is going to be the final length of your noodles., Start with two horizontal halves, one on the right and one on the left. Sprinkle tapioca or buckwheat flour over the right half. Be generous, a nice dusting over the entire half of dough., You're making layers to cut through, as cutting identical noodles on the large flat dough would be impossible. The flour prevents the dough from sticking to itself as you work., Just repeat the last steps two more times, this time vertically. Flour the bottom half of the dough, then fold the top half on top. Then flour the bottom half of this smaller rectangle and fold the top over again.

For the last fold, you can also flour the entire thing, since you have a relatively small area to work with.As you get better, aim for a nice, perfect rectangle at this stage. It takes practice, but that's the point of mastering soba.

, You want the cut to be about the same thickness of as the dough, and all the cuts to be even. Use a pastry scraper, ruler, or other clean straight edge as a guide for your knife as you cut, ensuring clean, straight slices., To prevent the noodles from sticking, sprinkle in some more flour and use your hands to toss the noodles so that they have a light dusting of flour on them., Soba noodles are meant to be cooked and eaten the same day they are made, as they are a fresh noodle that will dry out if left for too long. That said, they can be frozen in a large plastic bag for up to three months. Simply thaw them out slightly before cooking."

Make sure a strainer is ready to remove the noodles as soon as the minute is up., Pour the hot noodles into your strainer and then run them under the sink using cold water. This stage removes the starchy, gummy coating that forms on the outside of the noodles as they cook. Use your hands to gently lift and toss the soba so that it all rinses off.

If the noodles feel like they may break, run the water over the back of your hand instead of directly onto the soba., This final step completely halts cooking and firms up the noodles, which are meant to be served cold., Soba noodles are meant to be served fresh, either cold or left to slightly warm towards room temperature. They are excellent with a little soy sauce or sesame oil, or paired with a dashi."

Add the cheese to your sauce and meat.,
Boil the rigatoni noodles until slightly under cooked.,
Sauce your pan.,
Layer your noodles in a pan.,
Cover your noodles with your meat/sauce mixture.,
Bake at 350 °F (177 °C) until the cheese melts.,
Garnish your rigatoni.,
Allow to cool and serve.",How to Make Rigatoni," First, you'll want to coat your saucepan with a thin layer of olive oil to prevent your sausage from sticking to the pan. After greasing your pan with oil, turn your stove top to a medium heat and add the sausage. Depending on the kind of sausage you've bought, you may need to cut your sausage into slices first. Cook the sausage until the meat is browned.


The time it takes to cook your sausage will depend on the kind of heat you are using (gas or electric), the heat setting you have the burner turned to, and the thickness of your sausage. Generally, it will take you 5 - 7 minutes before the sausage is cooked.
Ground beef can be used in place of sausage. For a healthy helping of meat with your noodles, use 1 lb ( .45 kg) of ground round and prepare it in the same fashion as the sausage.You may want to add vegetables, like onions or green peppers, to your rigatoni to make a healthier meal. These can generally be added and cooked in the olive oil before the meat is added. Cook on a medium heat for about 5 minutes. When your vegetables are lightly browned, add your meat.;
, While the meat is cooking, you should notice grease form in the bottom of your pan. This is a byproduct of cooking your meat and is completely normal. You should, however, drain your grease from it to prevent your rigatoni from becoming too greasy.


Since grease can build up in your pipes and create blockages, you shouldn't pour your grease down your sink drain. You can pour your grease into an old coffee tin and use it for other recipes or dispose of the coffee tin in the garbage when you are finished., If you're using a thicker sauce, you may need to use a spoon to scoop your sauce from its container to join your meat, but you could also pour the sauce straight into your pan. In many cases, you'll be adding a whole can of sauce to your meat, though you should follow sauce label directions for best results.You may want an extra saucy rigatoni, in which case you should add more sauce to the mix. If you prefer a less saucy option, add ½ - ¾ a container of sauce instead.

, You'll want to use about ¾ of both your provolone and mozzarella cheese in your sauce/meat mixture. Stir in the cheese with the sauce and meat to add a cheesy consistency throughout. Allow this to cook for 5 - 7 minutes on medium heat, then remove the saucepan from the heat and allow it to cool for a few minutes., In a suitable pot, bring water to a boil and add your noodles. Subtract a few minutes from the cooking time indicated on the box, and cook it until the noodles are only slightly rigid. Generally, you'll have to cook your pasta for about 10 minutes.


You'll want your noodles a little under cooked because the noodles will continue to cook in your sauce when you bake your rigatoni in the oven. Cooking your noodles fully before baking might cause your noodles to be mushy and over-soft.You may notice that some pasta boxes direct you to add salt to the water. This will add flavor to your pasta as it cooks., This will help your sauce to infuse the entire dish so that the bottom noodles don't come out dry and sauceless. Use a spoon to spread a thin layer of sauce along the bottom of your baking pan. Usually, this will only take 2 spoonfuls of sauce., You'll want to use a pan a few inches (5 - 7 cm) deep so that your baked rigatoni doesn't overflow while cooking. A 9 x 13-inch (23 x 33 cm) pan would work well for this. Add your under cooked noodles to the pan.An oven safe casserole dish works as an excellent replacement for metal baking dishes. If you have no metal pans suitable for your baked rigatoni, use a casserole dish instead.
If you are making a large quantity of rigatoni, you may want to use a larger pan. The noodles should sit in the pan so there is a small space between the noodles and the lip of the pan.

, Position the saucepan over your noodle filled baking dish and either pour or scoop the mixture onto the pasta. The mixture should form an even layer over the noodles, and you may need to use a spoon to evenly distribute the mixture.


Once your noodles are covered, you can sprinkle your remaining cheese atop it. This will create a cheesy top layer in your rigatoni after it bakes., Depending on your oven and other factors, like the heat of the day, the time it takes for your rigatoni to cook may vary. Because of this, you should keep an eye on your pasta as it bakes. Generally, it will take about 25 minutes before the dish is ready.You can remove your noodles early from the oven if you like your cheese stringy and melty. If you prefer your cheese brown and encrusted, you may want to add a few minutes to the bake time.

, Some eye appealing color added to your rigatoni dish can give your food a gourmet appearance. This can be done easily by sprinkling parsley flakes over the noodles after it comes out of the oven. You could also wedge a stem of parsley between the noodles and the side of your dish.You may also want to add some seasoning to your rigatoni to give it a stronger flavor. You might add garlic salt, pepper, a dash of Italian seasoning, or whatever else you think might add flavor to your baked rigatoni., The middle parts of your rigatoni can be especially hot, so you should give your pasta at least 10 to 15 minutes to cool before attempting to eat. A large serving spoon, slotted spoon, or spatula can work well for serving your rigatoni.

Season the mixture with salt and pepper.,
Beat another egg with some water.,
Lay out some wonton wrappers and brush them with the egg wash. To begin making the ravioli, set out 8 to 10 wonton wrappers on the counter or cutting board in front of you.,
Add some of the filling to the center of the wrappers.,
Place wonton wrappers on top of the first and seal the edges.,
Transfer the ravioli to a baking sheet and repeat the process.,
Bring a pot of water to a boil.,
Lower the heat and add the ravioli.,
Poach the ravioli for a few minutes.,
Remove the ravioli from the water to drain.,
Top the ravioli with sauce and serve.",How to Make Ravioli with Wonton Wrappers," Add 24 ounces (680 g) of whole milk ricotta and 3 cups (300 g) of freshly grated parmesan cheese to a large bowl. Mix them together until they are fully combined.A simple cheese filling is the most common option for raviolis. However, you can use whatever filling you like for your wonton wrapper raviolis.
You can add herbs and spices to the cheese filling, such as basil, thyme, sage, or nutmeg.
Meats, such as sausage, chicken, prosciutto, and pancetta, can make tasty ravioli fillings. You may also opt for a seafood filling, such as crab or lobster.
Vegetables and greens, such as mushrooms, butternut squash, pumpkin, spinach, and broccoli rabe, work well as ravioli fillings too.
You can substitute other cheeses, such as mascarpone or gorgonzola, for the ravioli filling.;
, After you’ve mixed the cheeses together, add 2 eggs to the bowl. Stir the eggs into the cheese until they are fully incorporated.You can use egg substitute in place of the eggs if you prefer.

, Once the eggs are mixed into the cheese filling, add some salt and pepper to taste to the bowl. Mix well to ensure that the filling is properly seasoned.You can add other seasonings to the filling if you like. Crushed red pepper or Italian seasoning are some options to consider.

, To make the egg wash to seal the wonton wrapper raviolis, add 1 egg to a small bowl. Mix in 1 teaspoon (5 ml) of water and beat the mixture together until it is fully combined. Set aside for the moment., Dip a pastry brush in the egg wash you prepared, and brush it along all the edges of the wrappers.It’s best to work with only a small number of the wrappers at time. If you set out half of the wrappers at once, they may dry out by the time you are finished assembling them.

, After you’ve applied the egg wash to the edges, place approximately 1 tablespoon (15 g) of the filling in the center of each wrapper. Make sure to keep the filling away from the edges of the wrapper, so it doesn’t leak out during cooking.Don’t overfill the ravioli. They may burst during cooking, so the filling seeps out.

, When the filling is in place in the center of the wrappers, set another wonton wrapper on top of all the others that you’ve laid out. Use a finger to press down along the edges and seal the ravioli with the egg wash.After you’ve pressed the edges of the wrappers together, lift the raviolis from the counter and pinch them together again to ensure that they’re sealed.
For a more decorative look, you can use a fork to crimp along the edges of the ravioli.
You can leave the ravioli as they are in their square shape, or use a medium cookie cutter in a fun shape, such as a heart or star, to cut them out.
If you prefer, you can use 1 wonton wrapper for each ravioli instead of pressing two together. Place the filling in the center, and fold one corner to the other to form a triangle shape to seal.

, When the ravioli are sealed, place them face down on a baking sheet that’s lined with parchment paper. Repeat the assembling process with the remaining wonton wrappers.Be sure to lay a piece of parchment paper or plastic wrap between the ravioli if you have multiple layers of them. That will keep them from sticking together.
If you don’t plan to cook the ravioli right away, you can wrap the entire baking sheet with plastic wrap and refrigerate them for up to 2 days.

, To cook the ravioli, fill a large pot approximately ⅔’s full with water. Place the pot on the stove, and heat on high until the water comes to a full boil.Add a pinch or two of salt to the water before you bring it to a boil. That will help season the ravioli as they cook.

, After the water has come to a boil, lower the heat to medium to bring it to a simmer. Stir the water to create a whirlpool effect, and carefully drop 10 to 12 raviolis one by one into the pot., Once the raviolis are in the water, allow them to cook for 2 to 3 minutes. You’ll know that they’re done when they puff slightly and float to the top of the pot.If you’ve added a raw poultry or fish filling to the ravioli, make sure that the center is opaque to verify that they’re done cooking.

, When the ravioli are finished cooking, use a slotted spoon to lift them out of the water. Place them in a colander and shake well to ensure that they’re fully drained. Set them aside for the moment, and repeat the process with the remaining ravioli., When you’re finished cooking all of the ravioli, divide them between several dishes. Add your favorite sauce to the top of the ravioli and serve.A basic tomato or marinara sauce works well with cheese ravioli, but any sauce, such as alfredo, arrabiata, vodka, or bolognese, will work well.

, When the butter has melted, add 2 ¼ pounds (1 kg) of fresh pumpkin that’s been peeled and cut into 1-inch (2.5-cm) cubes and 4 teaspoons (13 g) of chopped shallot to the pan. Cook the mixture until the pumpkin is tender, which should take 7 to 10 minutes.Make sure to stir the pumpkin as you saute it to ensure that it cooks evenly.

, Once the pumpkin is tender, add 2 teaspoons (2 g) of minced fresh sage, ¾ teaspoon (½ g) of minced fresh thyme, ¼ teaspoon (1 g) of salt, and ¼ teaspoon (½ g) of pepper to the pan. Stir well to ensure that the ingredients are fully mixed.You can adjust the amount of salt and pepper to taste.

, After you’ve mixed in the herbs and seasonings, carefully transfer the mixture to a food processor. Process the mixture until it’s smooth.You can also use a blender to puree the pumpkin mixture.

, When the pumpkin mixture is pureed, pour it back into the saute pan. Add ⅔ cup (158 ml) of heavy whipping cream and a small bay leaf, and stir well until the ingredients are fully incorporated., After you’ve mixed the cream and bay leaf into the pumpkin puree, turn the heat up to medium-high. Allow the mixture to come to a boil, which should take approximately 5 to 10 minutes.Be sure to stir the mixture constantly as you bring it to a boil so it doesn’t stick to the pan.

, Once the mixture has come to a boil, lower the heat to medium low. Allow the mixture to simmer for 15 to 20 minutes, or until it thickens.You don’t need to cover the pan while the mixture simmers.

, When the mixture has thickened, take the pan off the stove. Fish the bay leaf out of the pan and discard. Let the mixture cool for 15 to 20 while you prefer the pasta sheets., When you’re ready to prepare the pasta sheets for the ravioli, separate the dough into four portions. Place one piece on a lightly floured surface, and roll the dough out with a rolling pin until it is approximately ⅛-inch (3-mm) thick.Leave the other pieces of dough covered or in the plastic bag while you roll out the first portion so they won’t dry out.
If you don’t have a rolling pin, you can use a wine bottle, thermos, or other heavy, cylindrical object to roll out the dough.

, Once the dough is rolled out, place rounded teaspoons (6 to 7 g) of the filling on one half of the pasta sheet. Make sure to set them approximately 1-inch (2.5-cm) apart., Dip a pastry brush into an egg that’s been lightly beaten and apply it to the edges of the pasta sheet surrounding the filling mounds. Fold the other half of the sheet over the side with the filling and press along the edges to seal it.If you prefer, you can use water to help seal the raviolis closed.
Press out any air bubbles as you seal the pasta sheet together.
If you don’t have a pastry brush, fold a piece of parchment paper into a strip and use it to apply the egg to the edge of the pasta sheet.

, When the edges of the pasta sheet are sealed together, use a ravioli cutter to cut the pasta into even squares with the mounds of filling in the center. The squares should be about 2.5-inches (6-cm) large.If you don’t have a ravioli cutter, you can use a knife or a square or round cookie cutter to create the raviolis.

, Once you’re finishing cutting out the raviolis from the first sheet of pasta, roll out, fill, and cut another piece of the dough. Continue the process until you’ve used up all of the dough.You can cook the ravioli right away, or refrigerate them until you are ready. Cook them within 1 to 2 days.
You can also place the ravioli in a plastic zipper bag and freeze them. They should keep for up to a month.

, When you’re ready to cook the ravioli, fill a large pot approximately ⅔’s full with water. Place it on the stove on high heat, and allow it to come to a full boil.You may want to add a pinch or two of salt to season the water before you bring to a boil.

, Once the water has come to a boil, place the ravioli in the pot. Allow them to cook for 3 to 5 minutes, or until they begin to float up to the top of the pot., When the ravioli are finished boiling, pour them into a colander or lift them out of the water with a slotted spoon to drain them. Place several ravioli into each bowl, and top with your favorite sauce to serve.You can use whatever sauce you like with the pumpkin ravioli, but butter sage, gorgonzola, and brown butter sauces are all delicious options.

Fill a large pot with 1 gallon (3.79 liters) of water and two tablespoons of salt and bring it to a boil.,
Add the pasta and let it cook for the time specified on the package.,
Drain the water from the pasta and rinse it under cold water.,
Consider tossing the pasta with part of your dressing while it is still warm.,
Leave the pasta in the refrigerator for one hour.",How to Make Pasta Salad1," You want the pasta to be well-seasoned, since you don't be relying on fancy sauces to flavor it.

, Most pastas will need 9 to 12 minutes to cook. You do not want the pasta to be overcooked or it will fall apart when you toss it with the rest of your ingredients. Also, the pasta will soak up the dressing the longer it sits; if you overcook it, it will become soggy later on.


Pasta with lots of shapes, nooks, and crannies are the best for pasta salads, becuase they can hold more dressing and small ingredients. Consider any of the following: fusilli, farfalle, rotini, and penne., Hold a large strainer or colander over a sink and dump the pasta into it. Once the water is gone, run cold water over the pasta for a few seconds. Shake and jiggle the strainer/colander so until there is no water left. Rinsing the pasta with cold water will halt the cooking process and prevent it from overheating.


On the other hand, rinsing the pasta will get rid of all that extra salty flavor. Consider tossing the pasta with some olive oil instead, and spreading it on a large baking sheet so that it can cool off., This will allow the pasta to absorb the flavors better. Take about two thirds of your dressing, and toss it with your pasta while it is still warm. Set the rest of the dressing aside for later., This will allow it to cool down. You don't want to use warm pasta for pasta salads.

Remove the noodles from the package.,
Put the noodles into a microwave safe bowl and cover with water.,
Microwave your ramen for between three and five minutes.,
Let the noodles sit for about three minutes after the microwave stops.,
Mix in the flavor packet.",How to Make Ramen Noodles in the Microwave1," Some Ramen enthusiasts like to break up the noodles while the bag is still sealed, making shorter soup-like noodles that are easier to eat with a spoon, while others choose to leave the noodles in a block to slurp traditional-style. It's up to you how you want to eat them.






;
, Typically, you'll need somewhere between 1 and 2 cups of water, depending on the size of the bowl you're using and the amount of broth you want in the soup.









To prevent splattering in the microwave, it's also a good idea to cover with a lid, or with a simple piece of paper towel to avoid making a mess. The noodles will sometimes float in the bowl, but that's nothing to worry about. They'll cook just fine.
Make sure your bowl is safe to microwave for several minutes. Plastic containers and styrofoam are controversial to some consumers, because of concerns about BPA and other toxins being leeched into the food during microwaving., Place your noodles in the microwave, set the timer, and start nuking. The exact cooking time may vary, since microwaves all behave somewhat differently.









To help the noodles cook evenly, and check to make sure they're not over-stewing (which can result in over-done and yucky noodles without any bite), stop the microwave about half-way through the cooking time and stir them with a fork. If you want the noodles to remain in a brick, just press on them a little, or flip the brick over to keep it whole.

, Don't take them out right away! Many are the burned tongues of the over-anxious ramen eater. Just let it sit for three minutes in the closed microwave, and you'll keep your fingers and your mouth safe, letting them finish in peace and cool down to a less-than-nuclear temperature.









If you must take the noodles out immediately use oven mitts or some other heat protection and be careful. Fortunately, this is a perfect time to add the flavor packet, while the water's nice and hot.

, It's go time. Stir noodles with a spoon or fork until flavoring dissolves, then pour your cooked Ramen into another bowl, if you want, and commence the deliciousness.









Alternatively, some Ramen eaters like to add the flavoring before the noodles cook. This is usually easier if you're cooking them over the stove, though it's still possible in the microwave. If you like the flavor to cook with the noodles some (it's a good way to get the noodles more tasty), put the noodles and the flavoring packet in the bowl first, then add the water on top to try to dissolve it some.

Boil some water.,
Prepare your ramen.,
Pour in boiling water.,
Let it sit and cook.,
Stir and enjoy.",How to Make Instant Noodles1," Add two or three cups (.5-.7 liters) of water to a kettle or saucepan. Place the kettle or saucepan over your stove on medium-high heat. Let the water heat for five to ten minutes until the water comes to an active boil.


Water is boiling when large bubbles of water are rising to the surface.An active boil has many large bubbles rising.
Some kettles have a “whistling” feature. When the kettle whistles, your water is done boiling.
You can also boil water in the microwave if necessary. However, the water can become superheated and explode out of the cup, causing severe burns.;
, First, pull the lid of the ramen cup back halfway. Remove any seasoning packets. Next, open the packet and add the seasoning to the ramen. If you’re worried about lumps in the seasoning, shake the cup from side to side to help spread the seasoning around.


Some packages of ramen come with an extra spice pack. If you don’t like spicy food, don’t add this package.

, Once the water has boiled and your ramen cup has been prepared, pour the water into the cup. Add enough water to reach the “fill” line on the inside of the cup.


Most ramen cups have a “fill” line. If yours doesn’t, fill the cup about 1 inch (2.5 centimeters) from the top.

, Once the water has been added, press the lid back into place. Usually, the ramen should sit undisturbed for three minutes.However, some brands of instant noodles require a longer or shorter cooking time. Check the back of the package for these cooking times.


To secure the lid into place, fold the foil tab around the lip of the cup. If this doesn’t work, place a saucer or other small dish over the lid to hold it down.

, After the three minutes are up, peel off the lid of the noodle cup. Use chopsticks or a fork to stir the noodles and break them apart. If the noodles are steaming, let the cup sit open for a minute or two. This will help the noodles cool down enough to be eaten.


You can eat the noodles with chopsticks or a fork.
Season additionally to taste, if desired.

Put the noodles in a separate bowl.,
Pour boiling water over the noodles or into the noodle cup.",How to Make Ramen Noodles in the Microwave2," Another easy way to make ramen in the microwave is to boil water separately and add it to the noodles, letting them steep. If you like your noodles slightly more firm, this is an excellent way to cook them in the microwave.









Depending on how much broth you want, anywhere between 1 and 1/3 cup and 2 cups is fine. Less will boil faster, but you want to make sure you have enough to make as much broth as you want.

, Because of the way microwaves agitate water atoms, you won't see the water boiling consistently and steaming heavily like you will when you boil water on the stove. Sometimes, it hardly looks hot at all. Aim for a few runs of 2 or 3 minutes through the microwave, stirring quickly in between.









When you're confident the water is hot, pull it out carefully with gloves or an oven mit.

, While the water is microwaving, remove the noodles from the package and put them in a separate bowl. You can add the seasoning packet now if you want to, or save it until after the noodles cook some.








, When you've got your water hot, pour it over the noodles, cover the bowl with a paper towel, plate, or lid, and let the noodles sit for between 3 and 5 minutes, until the noodles are soft and delicious. Then enjoy!









The instructions on the Cup 'O Noodles or Instant Lunch are somewhat vague in regard to the microwave. While the jury's somewhat silent on how dangerous it really is to microwave Styrofoam, it's probably better to heat the water separately and add it to the cup afterward, rather than risking making melted plastic for lunch.

Let no one tell you how to eat your Ramen noodles. Instead of tossing in that little package of meat-flavoring, cook up the noodles and flavor the soup yourself. With some basic condiments you can get for cheap at most grocery stores, you can customize your Ramen into a delicious restaurant-quality meal.Try flavoring your broth with any combination of the following ingredients, after you remove it from the microwave:









miso paste
Hoisin sauce
rice vinegar
lemon/lime juice
Sriracha or red chili paste
soy sauce
honey
green onions
basil

, Adding a bit of spinach, fresh chopped Thai basil leaves, or other vegetables to your Ramen can up the flavor and the health content. It's a simple way to hot-rod your Ramen.










Before you cook the noodles, consider adding celery, finely chopped carrot, garlic, or onions to the soup. Frozen peas work perfectly to add texture, as well as any other pre-cooked frozen vegetable you've got in the freezer.

After you cook the noodles, add greens, or top with chopped herbs of any kind. Basil and cilantro are especially delicious, but why not toss in some rosemary and a tablespoon of half-and-half to chicken-flavored ramen? It's a savory treat that smells like Thanksgiving and changes the dish completely.

, A common addition to Ramen is the incredible edible itself, the egg. While it's somewhat difficult to do the egg-drop method of cooking eggs in the broth itself, you can still use the microwave to cook an egg right in the broth, or simply chop hard-boiled eggs and put them on top.









If you want to crack an egg into the soup to add density and flavor, remove the noodles after cooking them and crack the egg in. Stir it vigorously with a fork or a chopstick, and return to the microwave for another minute or so. The hot water should temper the egg itself, but you can return it briefly to make sure.

, Toss out the flavor packet and make your own Thai-style peanut noodles from a package of Ramen, all with stuff you've probably already got in your kitchen.









In a bowl, mix 1 heaping tablespoon of salty peanut butter, preferably an all-natural variety. TO that, mix in a sprinkling of brown sugar, a teaspoon of soy sauce, and Sriracha or hot sauce to taste. If you've got any ginger, it's also good to add in, or grate.
When you take the noodles out of the microwave, pour off most of the hot water, leaving some to mix into the sauce. Pour the noodles into the bowl with the sauce and stir them around vigorously. Top with chopped cilantro and carrot. It's delicious.

Serve the noodles.",How to Make Instant Noodles2," Choose a saucepan that holds 2-3 quarts (1.9-2.8 liters) of water. Next, add 2 ½ cups (600 mililiters) of water to the saucepan. Place it on your stove over medium-high heat and allow it to come to a boil.The pan should be large enough that it can easily hold the water but small enough so that the noodles can be submerged.

, Carefully open the noodle package and remove the seasoning packet. Open the seasoning packet and add it to the boiling water. Stir it with long chopsticks or a spoon to completely incorporate it into the water.


Be careful not to splash yourself with boiling water while stirring.

, Carefully place the noodles into the boiling water. Once the noodles are in the water, use a pair of long chopsticks to push them further into the water a few times. This will help cook the noodles that are sticking out of the water.


For long noodles, place the whole brick of dried noodles into the water.
For medium-sized noodles, break the brick into a few chunks before adding the pieces to the boiling water.
For hundreds of tiny noodles, crush the brick of noodles in the package before pouring it into the boiling water., Let the noodles boil for three to four minutes. Once the noodles soften, begin stirring them slowly with long chopsticks or a large spoon. When the noodles start to break apart, begin looking for the signs of a cooked noodle:


The noodles will change from a chalky white color to a semi-translucent yellow color.
The noodles will easily separate from one another and spread across the pan.
When you lift a noodle out of the pan, it will be springy and curly.

Add a slice of American cheese.,
Replace the seasoning packet with broth.",How to Make Instant Noodles3," This addition only works if you’re cooking a package of ramen on the stove. Once the noodles are almost done cooking, crack a raw egg into the middle of the saucepan.


For egg-drop soup, slowly stir the raw egg into the noodles. The egg will cook into tiny pieces and incorporate into the noodles.
If you like whole eggs, don’t stir the noodles. Instead, cover the saucepan with a lid and let the egg cook for about thirty seconds to a minute., There are a variety of condiments that can be added to instant noodles to improve the flavor. These condiments can be added before or after cooking the ramen. Use these condiments in addition to the seasoning packet or as a replacement for the seasoning packet. For example:


Add a tablespoon of miso paste to your ramen to give it a smooth, meaty broth.
To make a spicy Asian-inspired ramen, stir in 1 teaspoon of Korean chili seasoning, 1 teaspoon of soy sauce, 1 teaspoon of rice vinegar, ½ teaspoon sesame oil, and ½ teaspoon honey.Add half a tablespoon of peanut butter to your ramen and stir it vigorously to create a Thai-inspired noodle dish., There are many vegetables that can be added to your noodles. Vegetables that cook quickly can be added just before serving the noodles. Other vegetables that cook more slowly will need to blanched in advance.


Vegetables that cook quickly include baby spinach, thinly-sliced cabbage, and baby bok choySlow-cooking vegetables include broccoli, carrots, and peas.
Any frozen vegetables need to be thawed in advance.

, Once the ramen is ready to serve, place a square of American cheese onto the surface of the soup. The cheese will melt into the broth and create a smooth, cheesy sauce. If you want a thick, mac-and-cheese broth for your noodles, add two to three slices of American cheese.After the cheese melts, stir it well to incorporate it into the broth.

, The seasoning packets in instant noodle dishes are usually a combination of powdered bouillon, sodium, and freeze-dried herbs. If you’re concerned about the levels of sodium in your ramen or if you prefer the taste of homemade broth, you can replace the seasoning packet with vegetable or meat broth.


Instead of boiling 2 ½ cups (600 mililiters) of water, boil the same amount of broth to cook the noodles.
You can make your own vegetable, beef, or chicken broth at home or buy some from your grocery store.

Begin by adding two whole eggs in their shells, to a medium sized pot. Add enough water to cover the eggs by 1 inch (2.54 cm), and heat them on medium heat until the water reaches a boil., Once the water reaches a boil, take the pot of eggs off the stovetop. Let the eggs sit uncovered for seven minutes, then take the eggs out of the water using tongs or a large spoon and place them in a bowl of ice water.Only keep the eggs in the water for 7 minutes. If you leave them in longer, the eggs will become hardboiled as opposed to soft boiled. Soft boiled eggs are better in ramen because they have somewhat runny yolks, which add to the flavor of the broth.

, In a medium sized saucepan, add the 4 cups (946.36 ml) of chicken broth and 1 ½ teaspoons (7.39 ml) soy sauce. Heat on medium heat until the mixture reaches a boil., Once the broth reaches a boil, drop the two chicken breasts in the broth and cook for 8-10 minutes until the chicken is fully cooked.

",How to Make Healthy Ramen3," If you really enjoy the taste of your favorite instant ramen but want to cut the fat and MSG, you can easily doctor the way you make it to make it healthier. Begin by adding 1 ½ cups (354.88 ml) water and ½ of the package of instant ramen flavor powder to a pot. Place the pot on the stove over medium-high heat and bring the mixture to a boil., Once the broth begins to boil, add the instant ramen noodles and reduce the heat to medium. Then cook the noodles for 2 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the noodles are partially cooked., Once the ramen noodles have cooked for 2 minutes, pour the pot of noodles and broth into a colander to drain the noodles. Then wipe the residual oil out from the pot.You will only use ½ of the packet of ramen seasoning to cut the MSG and fat from the ramen. Cooking the noodles with some of the ramen seasoning infuses them with flavor, but you should drain the broth from the noodles because you will only use ½ of the flavoring to make the ramen.

, In the same pot you used to cook the ramen noodles, add 1 ¼ cups (295.73 ml) of water, the rest of the ramen powder and the ramen flakes from the packet over high heat., Crack the egg into a small bowl and beat it lightly with a fork. Once the ramen starts to boil, use a whisk to stir the broth around in a circle. Once the broth gains circular momentum, slowly pour the egg into the broth.Adding the egg into swirling water poaches the egg. The circular motion of the broth allows the egg white to envelope the yolk and start to slowly cook.
The cooked egg will still have a runny yolk when cut into, which will enrich the broth of the soup and add extra flavor and thickness.

, Once you add the egg and see it starting to cook and solidify, add in the partially cooked ramen noodles. Cook another two minutes or so until the noodles are done., After the noodles have finished cooking, add in hot chili oil, soy sauce, miso paste or your favorite flavorings to taste. Then divide the ramen between bowls, making sure each serving gets an egg, garnish with chopped green onion, and serve while hot.


Using only ½ of the ramen flavoring cuts back on fat and MSG. Add flavors as you see fit if you feel the ramen isn't flavorful enough.
Hot chili oil is a traditional addition to ramen, and adds spiciness and flavor. Soy sauce adds a darker taste to ramen that gives the soup more depth, while miso paste gives it a nuanced, slightly salty flavor.
Once you break the poached egg, the yolk will run into the broth to add flavor as well.

",How to Cook Ramen Noodles2," If the sauce or condiment is very salty, it might be a good idea to use less of the seasoning in the packet. This will help keep the ramen from turning out too salty. Listed below are some tasty options that you could try:Fish sauce
Japanese curry powder
Ponzu
Miso paste
Thai curry paste

, This is a great option if fish sauce and curry powder or paste aren't your thing. Here are some ideas to get you started:Citrus juices, such as a squeeze of lemon or lime. Add these just before serving.
Oils such as: animal fat, chili oil, or sesame oil.
Spices such as: chili flakes, coriander seeds, or white pepper. You will need to remove the seeds prior to serving, however.

, You can add delicate and quick cooking vegetables just before serving the ramen. You can also add sturdier, long cooking vegetables to the noodles as you cook them. Here are some more tasty options:For quick cooking vegetables, try: baby spinach, bean sprouts, scallions, or watercress.
For long cooking vegetables, try: broccoli, snap peas, snow peas, or shredded carrots.
No fresh vegetables? Try frozen ones instead! Be sure to thaw them under running hot water for about 30 seconds first.

, Ramen is full of sodium, starch, and fat, which isn't very healthy. You can make your meal a little more nutritious with an egg, which is packed with protein. Soft boiled and hard boiled eggs sliced in half are the most popular, but you can use other types as well. Here are some options for you to try:Hard boil an egg in cold water. Peel it, slice it in half, then add it on top of the ramen, just before serving.
Soft boil an egg after the water has already started to boil. Cook it for 3 to 7 minutes, then peel it, slice it in half, then add it to the ramen just before serving.
Try an egg-drop instead. After the noodles and broth have cooked, give them a stir. Pour a lightly-beaten egg into the pot while the broth and noodles are still moving.
Poach an egg right on top of the noodles. Let the egg boil for 30 seconds. Turn off the stove, cover the pot with a lid, and wait 30 more seconds.Add a fried egg on top. You will need to fry the egg and cook the ramen separately. Slide the fried egg right on top of the ramen before you serve it.

, Thinly sliced meats are the most popular, but you can also use chicken breast, flank steak, or pork tenderloin. Cook them in the broth while the noodles are simmering in their own pot. Take the meat out of the broth, add the noodles, then drop the meat back on top.Keep the meat to a minimum. You want to focus on the ramen noodles and broth itself.Thinly sliced pork belly or shoulder are the most popular and authentic., For most of these, you will need to go to a supermarket specializing in Asian produce. You might also be able to find some of these in the Asian foods section of your local supermarket. Here are some tasty options for you to try:Fish cakes
Sliced daikon, lotus root, or shitake mushrooms
Shredded nori
Menma-fermented bamboo shoots.

Mix well with clean hands to ensure that the seasoning is evenly distributed throughout the meat.You can add other seasonings to the meatballs if you like. Grated parmesan cheese, garlic powder, and Italian seasoning are all good options.
If you prefer a vegetarian version, you can omit the meatballs.
If don’t want to make your own meatballs, you can use frozen meatballs -- just make sure to use a mini size. Defrost the meatballs according to the package instructions., Once the meat is seasoned, use clean hands to roll it into small balls. Aim for meatballs that are approximately ¾-inch (1.9-cm) large.It’s important to keep the meatballs small because the pasta used in the dish is small. Use the size of the meatballs in store-bought spaghettios as a guide.

, After you’ve formed all of the meatballs, add them to the sauce. Stir the mixture well to distribute the meatballs, and reduce the heat to medium. Cook the meatballs until they are cooked through, which should take 6 to 8 minutes., Fill a large stockpot with at least 4 quarts (3.8 l) of water. Place the pot on the stove, and add a generous amount of salt to the water. Turn the heat to high, and cover the pot to bring it to a full boil.Depending on your stove, it should take approximately 5 to 10 minutes for the water to come to a boil.

, When the water is boiling, add ¾ pound (340 g) of anelletti pasta to the pot. Keep the heat on high to return the water to a boil, and cook the pasta until it is tender but still firm, which should take approximately 8 to 12 minutes.Anelletti is a small ring-shaped pasta. You can also use ditalini pasta, which is a small tube-shaped pasta.
Leave the pot uncovered while the pasta is cooking.

, When the pasta is al dente, remove the pot from the stove. Immediately pour the pasta into a colander in the sink to drain it. Shake the colander well to ensure that the excess water is removed.Don’t rinse the pasta after you’ve drained it. The starch on its surface will help the sauce stick to it.

, Once the pasta is drained, add it to the sauce and meatballs. Next, mix in ¾ cup (75 g) of freshly grated parmesan cheese. Toss the contents of the pan well to ensure that the pasta, sauce, and meatballs are well mixed.You may want to taste the pasta at this point to see if the seasoning is right. Add salt and pepper if necessary.

, When the pasta, sauce, and meatballs are fully mixed, divide the mixture between 4 bowls. You may want to sprinkle a little more grated parmesan over the bowls before serving."
