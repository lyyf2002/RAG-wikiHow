Secure the lid over the towel to keep it in place., With the lid on the slow cooker, turn it to low. Allow the sauce to cook for 8 hours or until it’s thick and warmed through.If you want the sauce to be ready more quickly, cook it on high for 4 to 5 hours.

, When the sauce is finished cooking, take the bay leaves out of it. Next, give the sauce a taste. Season with salt and black pepper to taste.If the sauce has any bitterness, you can mix in 1 tablespoon (12 ½ g) of brown sugar to balance the flavors.

, When you’re happy with the taste of the sauce, ladle it over the hot pasta of your choice. While it’s called a spaghetti sauce, you can also use it with spaghettini, angel hair, capellini, linguine, penne, rigatoni, or ziti.The sauce also works well with stuffed pasta, such as ravioli or tortellini.

Use a nonstick dish if you have one available, since rice tends to stick to the bottom of the pan.
If you don't have a nonstick dish, oil the bottom of a glass or metal baking dish.

, Use the back of a wooden spoon to press the rice flat into the dish. You could also use a spatula or a piece of oiled waxed paper.








, Use a knife to score the rice diagonally in one direction, then score it again diagonally in the other direction. This creates the classic diamond shape that Sri Lankans use to serve milk rice.








, After the rice has cooled a stiffened a bit, use the knife to cut it into diamond shapes. Lift the rice from the pan using a spatula and place it on a plate for serving.









You can make the dish taste more milky by drizzling the top with more coconut milk after scoring it.

Soak the rice for 20 minutes.,
Toast the seasonings in oil.,
Brown the onion slices.,
Drain the rice and add it to the pan.,
Add water and salt.,
Simmer, covered, for 15 minutes.,
Let the rice sit in the pan.,
Fluff and serve.",How to Make Indian Rice1," Put the dry rice in a large mixing bowl. Run warm water in the sink, then add enough warm water to the bowl to cover the rice. The precise amount isn't important. Set aside for 20 minutes.


This softens the rice for a slightly quicker cook time and draws the starch out for a better texture.
While you wait for the rice to soak, you can save time by preparing the rest of your ingredients (e.g., chopping your onion, measuring your spices, etc.) and proceeding through the next few steps.;
, Heat the oil in a large, steep-sided saucepan or pot over medium heat. When the oil is hot (drops of water in the pan should sizzle instantly), add the cinnamon stick, cardamom pods, cloves, and cumin seed. Let these ingredients cook for about a minute as you stir them frequently.


""Toasting"" these ingredients will help release their flavor for a tastier, more aromatic final product. Your goal isn't to char or fry these ingredients, so stir often.

, Add the chopped onion to the pan. Stir to combine with the seasonings. Let the onion sautee in the pan, stirring about every minute or so. Cook the ingredients together for about 10 minutes.


The onion is ready when it reaches a pleasant brownish color with crisp, semi-blackened edges. It should be soft to bite into and shouldn't have the bitter ""bite"" of a raw onion. The time it takes to get to this stage can vary depending on your stove, so keep an eye on your pan.

, Once the excess water has been removed from the rice, stir it in with the other ingredients. The rice will still be damp and will sizzle when it is added. Stir frequently to prevent burning or sticking. Continue like this for a few minutes to ""toast"" the rice.


To drain rice, you will want to use a fine mesh colander or strainer. Don't use the sort of colander you'd use for pasta — the rice will fall through the holes.In a pinch, you can even use a clean coffee filter.
The rice may turn an opaque white color as it toasts. This is normal. You don't want it to turn brown, however. This is a sign that it is burning.

, After a few minutes of toasting the rice, pour the water into the pan along with a few pinches of salt. Increase the heat slightly to bring the water to a boil.

, Stir the ingredients in the water a few times to combine, then cover the pan with a lid to keep the heat in. Reduce the heat to bring the water to a gentle simmer. Let the rice cook undisturbed for about 15 minutes or until it reaches your preferred texture (see below).


As the rice simmers, it will gradually absorb the water and grow softer. Basmati rice is generally best when it is fairly soft and fluffy, which usually takes about 15 minutes. However, if you like it firmer or softer, you may want to stop the cooking process a few minutes on either side of this.

, Turn off the heat. Let the rice sit undisturbed for about five minutes. The rice will continue to cook and absorb some of the moisture.


At this point, most (or all) of the water should be gone from the pan. If the rice is still firm or crunchy, it's not done yet. Add a little extra water to the pan (if none remains) and simmer for another 10 minutes. After this, let the rice sit for five minutes as normal.

, When rice finishes cooking, it settles to the bottom of the pan, taking the shape of the container. Stir the rice up with a fork. This is referred to as ""fluffing"" the rice. It will give the rice more volume and allow any inner moisture to evaporate more easily.About a minute after fluffing, the rice is ready to serve. Scoop portions onto serving plates. It should cling to itself somewhat, so it can be eaten with a fork or spoon.

"

Toast the rice in a pan.,
Add the ingredients to a slow cooker.,
Simmer for 4-5 hours or until soft.,
Alternatively, use a pressure cooker.,
Stir and serve.",How to Make Indian Rice2," Pour a teaspoon or two of oil into a wide, steep-rimmed pan. Warm over medium heat for a few minutes until hot (a drop of water should immediately start to ""dance"" and sizzle). Pour the dry rice into the pan and stir to coat with oil. Spread the rice out into a single layer. Let the rice cook for about 10 minutes this way, stirring frequently.


As the rice toasts, it should gain an opaque white color — it will look almost pearly.If it starts to turn brown or black, you're using too much heat or not stirring enough.
This technique brings out the naturally nutty flavor of good basmati rice and improves its texture. You should be able to smell the former as the rice cooks., Remove the toasting rice from the heat. Pour the rice into a slow cooker (e.g., crock pot, etc.), then add the lentils, broth, bouillon, chopped onion, and seasonings. Stir a few times to combine.


If you like your rice somewhat spicy, at this point, you can try adding a dash of cayenne pepper or a generous pinch or red pepper flakes to give the mixture some heat. Paprika is another good choice for its easy flavor.

, The convenient thing about this recipe is that it doesn't require much work from you. Simply set the slow cooker to medium heat and let the ingredients cook for several hours.


Different cookers will cook the meal at different rates. After about an hour and a half, you can carefully remove the lid and test the rice and lentils for texture. Both should be soft and smooth. If either has a stiff or crunchy texture, let the mixture cook for another forty minutes before trying again.

, Though they aren't as common as they once were in the US, pressure cookers are commonly used in Indian cooking. They are cheap, easy to use, and work similarly to slow cookers. The most important thing to remember when using a pressure cooker is that they work much faster than slow cookers and that you must allow the high-pressure steam to dissipate before removing the lid. See below for instructions:


Add the ingredients to the pressure cooker.
If you have an electric pressure cooker, set it to high pressure. If you have a stovetop pressure cooker, set it over high heat on the stove. When the meter indicates it has reached high pressure, reduce the heat to low.
Let the mixture cook for 6 minutes at high pressure.
Turn off the heat and let the cooker sit for 10 minutes. The contents will continue to cook. After this, release the rest of the pressure with the valve and remove the lid.

, When they are finished cooking, stir the rice and lentils — they may have settled while cooking. You can drain off any excess moisture or leave the rice in it for a soup/broth like dish. Spoon onto plates or bowls and enjoy.

Serve as a side to curry.,
Use as a ""bed"" for meat or vegetable entrees.,
Add toasted nuts and raisins.,
Stir in meat and/or vegetables for biryani.",How to Make Indian Rice3," Indian rice is great on its own, but it's even better when it's incorporated into a complimentary dish. One easy example is curry, a spicy stew-like dish that is usually associated with India. Serve it in its own bowl with the rice on the side or spoon it over the rice and let the rice soak up the juices — it's up to you.


See our Indian curry recipe for a dish that pairs perfectly with Indian rice.

, Another great use for Indian rice is as a starchy side to protein-rich dishes (like meat and dairy) or vegetables. Try laying the main dish over a generous bed of rice so you get a little of each in every bite.


A delicious, nutritious Indian favorite you may want to try this with is tandoori chicken.
A good vegetarian option which uses greens and cheese is Saag Paneer.

, This is an especially great choice if you're eating the rice by itself. The nuts and raisins give the rice flavor and texture it wouldn't have otherwise. Making nut-and-raisin rice is easy — just add about 1/2 to 3/4 cups of each when you start cooking the rice in liquid and stir. Continue cooking the rice as normal.Halved cashews and chopped almond slivers are especially good choices, though other nuts like peanuts can also work well.

, Biryani is a South Asian delicacy that can take a long time to prepare, but is always a treat. While there are many different ways to make biryani, almost all of them use the long-grain basmati rice called for in the recipes above along with meat or vegetables. Even ingredients like hard-boiled eggs are sometimes used.


See our chicken biryani recipe for just one recipe to get you started — there are many more.

Use legumes.,
Add a vegetarian protein.,
Use lots of raw veggies.,
Roast vegetables for extra flavor.,
Try steaming vegetables.,
Arrange the ingredients.,
Top your Buddha bowls with dressing.,
Add a touch of bold flavor.",How to Make Buddha Bowls," Place a few small scoops of cooked rice into a large bowl. If you're not adding any other grains or starches, consider using about 1/2 cup (125 g) of cooked rice. For a little variety, try using one of these types of rice:Jasmine or Basmati
Wild
Brown
Bhutanese red;
, If you're tired of rice or just want a different texture, use cooked barley or quinoa. Barley will give your Buddha bowl a slightly chewy texture. Red or white quinoa will give it a slight crunch. Add a few spoonfuls of barley or quinoa if you're adding other grains or use about 1/2 cup (100 g) if not.

You can also use cooked millet which is becomes light and fluffy.

, If you'd prefer to get your complex carbohydrates from a vegetable instead of from grains, use sweet potatoes. Cut one sweet potato in half and drizzle it with olive oil. Place it skin-side down on a baking sheet and roast the sweet potato in a hot oven (400 degrees F or 200 C) for 25 to 30 minutes. Cut the tender sweet potato into pieces and put it in your bowl.You may want to flip the sweet potato over halfway during baking time to ensure even browning.
You don't need to peel the sweet potato.

, Corn is a popular Buddha bowl starch because it gives the dish sweetness and beautiful color. You can use canned sweet kernel corn, thawed frozen corn, corn that you've cut right off of the cob or roasted corn. Use a few spoonfuls if you just want a little sweetness or use a large scoop if you want to add other vegetables that work well with the corn (like tomatoes, red pepper, and avocado).If you want to make a warmer Buddha bowl, try using cooked polenta. This will also make the Buddha bowl seem rich and creamy.

, Beans are a great vegetarian way to add protein to your Buddha bowls. You can soak dry beans and cook them, or roast the beans in the oven for extra flavor. You can even just open a can of your favorite beans. Give them a quick rinse to remove excess sodium and put the beans in your bowl. You can try:Black beans
Kidney beans
White beans
Black eyed peas
Chickpeas (garbanzo beans)

, To add a little variety and color, you can add legumes for protein. Cook a batch of red or brown lentils which are filling and flavorful. You can even make a simple lentil curry to spoon into your Buddha bowls. You can also add green peas or edamame for a little sweetness or crunch.You can steam the peas or add fresh peas to your bowl.

, You can also top your Buddha bowls with vegetarian proteins like tofu, seitan, and tempeh. Try sauteing cubes of tofu in your favorite spices. You can season and grill tempeh before slicing it up. Or cook seitan for a meat-like texture in your bowl.While most Buddha bowls are vegetarian or vegan, you can include meat proteins if you like. For example, shred some roasted chicken, flake some cooked fish, or use chunks of turkey breast.

, One of the fastest ways to fill your Buddha bowls is to use raw vegetables. You can make a base of leafy greens (like arugula, spinach, or kale). Top the greens with more fresh vegetables, so you get different colors, flavors, and textures.For a crunchy texture, add sliced radishes, cucumbers, or alfalfa sprouts.
For a creamy taste, add sliced avocado or shelled fava beans.

, Roasting vegetables caramelizes them which makes them softer and sweeter. Just line a sheet pan with your vegetables, drizzle them with olive oil, and roast them in a hot oven until they're tender. Some great vegetables for roasting include:Sliced onions
Tomatoes (any kind)
Cauliflower or broccoli florets
Sweet potato chunks
Carrot sticks

, If you don't have the time to roast the veggies or you just want the flavor of the vegetable to shine, briefly steam them. You can steam the veggies in a pot on the stove for several minutes, so they just become tender. Try steaming:Broccoli or cauliflower florets
Chopped asparagus
Carrot slices
Green beans

, Assemble your Buddha bowls by placing whatever you like in the bowls. There's no rule about how much you should use, but to start you could aim for 1/2 cup of a grain or complex carbohydrate, 1 cup of protein, and 3 cups of vegetables.

The bowl should look visually pleasing with a variety of colors and textures.

, You can use any salad dressing or dip to finish your bowls. One of the most popular dressings is made with tahini. To make enough tahini dressing for two bowls, combine:4 tablespoons tahini
2 tablespoons lemon juice
1 tablespoon soy sauce or tamari
1 tablespoon maple syrup
4 tablespoons water

, Sprinkle something with a little texture or bright flavor over the bowls to finish them. You could drizzle a little herb pesto or sprinkle chia seeds or chives for crunch. For a sharp flavor, try adding a little kimchi. Or make your Buddha bowl spicy by squirting some sambal oelek or sriracha sauce on it.For a simple finish, you could stick with vinegar, olive oil, salt, and pepper.

Garnish the soup to serve.",How to Make Turtle Soup," You may be able to find it fresh in a local market, but if you're in an area where turtles aren't commonly eaten, you can buy turtle meat frozen and have it shipped to you.Be sure to do some research to make sure you get it from a reputable company.


Turtle meat that isn't sourced properly can have toxic metals and other materials that aren't good for your health.;
, If your meat is frozen, thaw it slowly in the refrigerator. Bring the meat to room temperature by placing it on the counter 1/2 hour before you're ready to cook it. This will ensure the meat cooks evenly and gets properly heated all the way through.

, Turtle soup is made with a variety of different vegetables that flavor the base of the soup. Prep your vegetables while the meat is thawing and coming to room temperature.


Peel and chop the onion. You'll need about 1 1/2 cups total.
Peel and chop the shallots. You should end up with about 1/3 cup.
Chop the bell pepper and measure out 1/2 cup.
Chop the celery and measure out 1/2 cup.
Peel and chop the garlic and measure out 2 tablespoons.
Chop the parsley and green onions - you'll need these later to serve as a garnish.

, Hard-boiled eggs are a traditional garnish for turtle soup. Place the eggs in a saucepan and cover with cold water. Bring the water to a boil, then cover the pan with a lid and remove it from heat. Let the eggs cook in the hot water for 10 minutes, then run them under cold water and peel them. Chop the eggs and set them aside.

, Slice a fresh lemon into quarters and squeeze out the juice. Measure out 1/4 cup of juice, and set it aside to add to the soup.

, Place the meat, 1 teaspoon salt, 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper, and 6 cups of water in a large saucepan. Put a lid on the saucepan and place it on the stove over high heat.


It's necessary to thoroughly cook the turtle meat before using it in the soup. Adding undercooked meat to the soup might allow potentially dangerous bacteria to survive.

, Keep simmering and stirring for 20 minutes while the meat cooks. Use a spoon to skim off the foam that will rise to the top., Drain the water into a bowl (don't discard it) and place the meat on a platter. Allow it to cool for a few minutes before handling. Save the liquid for later - you'll need it to help flavor the soup.

, Use a sharp knife to cut the meat into small, bite-sized cubes. Since turtle meat tends to be on the tougher side, make sure the pieces are small enough to chew comfortably. Set the platter of meat aside.

, Melt the butter in a large stockpot over medium high heat. Add the flour and use a wooden spoon to stir the mixture constantly until it thickens and turns golden brown, about five minutes. This is your roux, the base of the soup that will give it a velvety texture.

, Put the chopped onions, shallot, red pepper, and celery in with the roux. Stir the mixture every few minutes and keep cooking until the vegetables soften and the onion turns translucent, about 5 minutes.

, Toss in the bay leaves, garlic and thyme. Keep stirring and cooking the mixture for 2 minutes more.

, Mix everything together and stir as the tomatoes cook down a bit for about 3 more minutes.

, Pour in the turtle stock reserved from cooking the meat. Add the remaining salt and cayenne. Add the lemon juice, sherry and Worcestershire sauce. Adjust the heat so that the soup comes to a low simmer, and cook for another 10 minutes.

, Ladle the turtle soup into bowls and serve with chopped eggs, parsley and green onions on the side. It's delicious with a bowl of steamed rice.

When this happens, the pizza won't taste as good as it should. Only allow the pizza to defrost when you put it in the oven; that way, it cooks evenly, making sure that everything is thawed at the same time., If you aren't careful when doing this, the excess cheese that you need to make the pizza taste extra delicious will fall off or get stuck to the packaging, and you will be left with a bland pizza, which won't taste as good as it deserves to., When putting the pizza in the oven don't pick it up with your hands from the cardboard. If you do this you could risk breaking your pizza into pieces. Instead, when putting it in, slide it gently off the cardboard into the oven, so that it is nicely laid onto the pizza pan for heating. Also make sure that it is placed in the middle of the oven., When baking the frozen pizza, you are given a requirement of about 20 to 22 minutes for the pizza to cook. To make your pizza even better, you may consider cooking it for up to 23-27 minutes for total cooking time.

;
, Remove the unbaked crust from the packaging. Place it on a round or rectangular baking sheet, depending on what you have on hand. Use a pastry brush to spread a thin coating of olive oil over the top of the crust.








, How much pizza sauce you add is purely a matter of personal preference. If you love a lot of sauce, go ahead and slather it on. If you prefer your pizza on the dry side, spoon a little in the middle and spread it around in a thin layer.









If you want to make a white pizza, add a little extra olive oil and skip the pizza sauce.
You can make a quick pizza sauce using tomato paste, a can of diced tomatoes, and some spices. Simmer the paste and tomatoes (without draining them first) together over low heat. Add salt, oregano and pepper to taste. Continue simmering until the sauce cooks down to the consistency of pizza sauce.

, Layer your favorite toppings over the sauce. Add as many or as few toppings as you want. Put the heavier toppings, like onions, chicken or sausage, on the bottom layer, and add lighter toppings, like spinach leaves or peppers, on the top layer. Continue until your pizza is loaded with the amount of toppings you like.









Other than pepperoni and ham which are pre-cooked, meat toppings should always be cooked before you put them on the pizza. They'll get heated when you bake the pizza, but they won't fully cook. If you're using ground beef, sausage, chicken, or another meat, cook it thoroughly in a pan on the stove or in the oven and drain the grease before you add it to your pizza.
Remember that if you add too many vegetable toppings, your pizza crust may turn out a little soggy. The water from the vegetables moistens the dough. Limit the amount of spinach and other ""watery"" vegetables you put on your pizza if you're worried about this happening.

, Sprinkle mozzarella cheese over the toppings. Layer it on thick if you like it that way, or add a thin layer if you're going for a lighter pizza. Use Cheddar if you like.








, Place the pizza in the oven and have it bake for about 20 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is melted. Remove it from the oven and allow it to cool for a few minutes before slicing.

, Put the flour, olive oil, and salt in the mixing bowl with the yeast mixture. Use the dough hook attachment on your stand mixture or work by hand to stir the ingredients together until a wet dough forms. Keep mixing the dough until it becomes smooth and elastic.








If you're working by hand, the dough will become difficult to stir when it starts to thicken. Put down the spoon and knead the dough until it reaches the right texture.
If the dough looks wet after you've been mixing or kneading it for a long time, add some flour to dry it it up a little.

, Form it into a ball and place it in a clean mixing bowl coated with a little olive oil. Put a dishcloth, some muslin or plastic wrap over the bowl and place it in a warm part of the kitchen. Let the dough sit and rise until it has doubled in size, which should take about 2 hours.









You can let the dough rise in the refrigerator instead. This takes about 6 - 8 hours.
You can also freeze the dough before it rises and let it rise when you're ready to make pizza.

, Do this well before you're ready to bake the pizza, so the oven has plenty of time to get quite hot. If your oven tends to run cool, turn the temperature up to 450°F (232°C).









If you're using a baking stone or pizza stone, place it in the oven so it gets preheated as well.
If you're using a baking sheet, place it in the oven at this time.

, Divide the dough into two equal parts and shape them each into balls. On a floured work surface, roll out the first ball of dough into a circular shape, or use your fingers to stretch it out and shape it. If you're feeling ambitious, you could also try tossing the dough to form it into a pizza shape. When you're finished with the first crust, make the second.







, Use a pastry brush to spread a thin coating of olive oil over the tops of the crusts.








, Spread homemade pizza sauce (or sauce from a jar) onto the crusts. Layer on your favorite toppings, making sure not to go overboard or the crusts won't get crisp. Finish by sprinkling on your favorite type of cheese.








, Carefully remove the baking sheet or stone from the oven and sprinkle it with some cornmeal (or reach into the oven to sprinkle it on). Transfer the pizza to the baking stone or sheet, and place it back in the oven. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly. Repeat with the second pizza.









If you're using a baking peel, transfer the pizza directly from the peel to the stone in the oven. Baking peels are used by professional pizza bakers along with baking stones. The unbaked pizza is assembled on the peel, then transferred to the stone in the oven.

Gather ingredients for the whole wheat dough.,
Combine the ingredients.,
Dust surfaces with flour.,
Roll the dough.",How to Make a Healthy Pizza1," The whole wheat dough has more fiber in it than dough made with white flour. It's simply healthier for you. The extra fiber in the whole wheat dough helps with digestion. You can make your own whole wheat dough, or you can find it premade in many grocery stores. Most whole wheat pizza dough recipes call for these ingredients: Whole wheat flour, yeast, water, salt, oil, and occasionally sugar. Some dough also requires hot water, all-purpose flour, and extra virgin olive oil. The olive oil and sugar make the dough more tender.Avoid pre-made dough that contains trans fat, though. Check the label. ;
, Put 3/4 cup of whole-wheat flour, 3/4 cup of all-purpose flour, 1 package of quick rising yeast, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon sugar in a food processor. Mix the ingredients by pulsing them together. Next, mix 1/2 cup of hot water with 1 tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil.
Pour the liquid mixture into the food processor, and mix until the dough holds together.
Add a little more warm water if it seems dry. Add little more flour if it seems too sticky.
Form the dough into a ball.
A second version of this recipe calls for you to mix 1 teaspoon of active dry yeast, 3/4 cup plus two tablespoons of warm water, and 1 teaspoon honey together. Mix them in a bowl, and let them sit for up to 5 minutes until you see a layer of foam. Whisk two cups of white whole wheat flour with 1/2 teaspoon salt. Add the yeast mixture to it, along with a tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil. , Put the dough on a surface that you dust with flour. This is important, so the dough doesn't stick to the surface. Now, you will be ready to knead the dough.


To knead the dough, also, dust the dough itself with flour to reduce stickiness. You've used enough flour when the dough bounces back when you put a finger on it. Put the ball of dough on the surface, fold it in half. Then use the heels of your hands to push into the dough. Turn the dough by a quarter and repeat, for 6-10 minutes.
Whole wheat dough has less volume, not rising as much as other kinds of pizza dough. Handle the dough more lightly when kneading it so it doesn't break. The dough won't stretch as easily without tearing. You could add little white flour to it to make it easier to work with. Cover the dough with waxed paper that you have sprayed with cooking spray. Place the sprayed side of the paper against the dough.
Let the dough sits for about 20 minutes.
For the second recipe, cover the dough with plastic wrap, and let it sit for 2 hours. It's done when it's doubled in size. , Roll out the dough using either a rolling pin or your hand. A 13-inch size circle is recommended.


Shaping the dough by hand will create the crust that is less dense than using a rolling pin. To roll out the dough by hand, dust your fingers with flour. Take the ball of dough and shape it into a circle with your fingers. Start in the middle of the circle, and press the dough outward, while spreading your fingers out, to widen the disc's size. Then, lift the dough, putting your fingers on the edges of the circle. It's more important to have the even thickness throughout the dough than to accomplish a perfect circle.
Roll the dough as thin as you can. Brush olive oil on the dough when done.

Allow the mixture to sit for approximately 5 minutes or until the yeast dissolves and expands.Your warm water should be approximately 110 degrees Fahrenheit (43 degrees Celsius).;
, When the yeast has sat for several minutes, mix in 1 ¼ cups (296 ml) of room temperature water and 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of olive oil. Stir the mixture until all of the ingredients are well blended.Room temperature water should be approximately 75 degrees Fahrenheit (24 degrees Celsius).

, In a large food processor, combine 4 cups (508 g) of bread flour and 1 ½ teaspoons (8.5 g) of salt. Pulse the ingredients until they are completely blended.If you don’t have a food processor, you can also use a stand mixer with the dough hook attachment inserted.

, When the flour and salt are well combined, add the yeast and water mixture except for 2 to 3 tablespoons (30 to 45 ml) to the food processor through the feed tube. Pulse the food processor until the dough forms into a ball.If the dough doesn’t form a ball, add the yeast and water mixture that you held back and pulse again until a ball comes together.

, To ensure that the dough is elastic enough to stretch into a pizza later, continue pulsing it until it is completely smooth. It should take approximately 30 seconds., Remove the dough from the food processor, and place it on a lightly floured surface. Knead the dough a few times to create a smooth, even ball.To prevent the dough from sticking to your hands as you knead it, rub a little olive oil or other cooking oil on your skin before you handle it.

, Take the dough ball, and set it inside a large bowl that’s been greased with olive oil. Place a piece of plastic wrap over the bowl, and allow the dough to rise until it has doubled in size, which should take approximately 1 to 2 hours.After the dough has doubled in size, punch it with your hands to deflate it.

, Mix 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of olive oil with 2 cloves of garlic that’s been minced in a small saucepan. Heat the mixture over medium heat until the garlic starts to sizzle, which should take approximately 3 to 5 minutes.You can add half a small onion that’s been diced to the pan for extra flavor in the sauce.

, Once the garlic has started to sizzle, add a 28-ounce (794 g) can of crushed tomatoes. Mix until the ingredients are well combined, and then allow the sauce to simmer until it becomes thick, which should take approximately 15 minutes.Stir the sauce occasionally while it’s simmering to ensure that it cooks evenly and doesn’t scorch the bottom of the pan.
If desired, you can mix dried oregano, dried basil, crushed red pepper flakes, salt, and pepper into the sauce before you simmer it. Add the herbs and seasoning to taste.
Because crushed tomatoes don’t usually come in smaller cans, this recipe is going to make more sauce that you need for a single pizza. If you’re only making one pizza, freeze the leftover sauce in an airtight container for the next time.

, When the sauce has thickened, remove the saucepan from the heat. Set it aside to allow the sauce to cool -- you don’t want it to be hot when you start assembling the pizza.If you’re short on time, you don’t have to make the sauce for the pizza. Instead, use your favorite jarred pizza sauce or tomato-based pasta sauce.

, Once the dough has risen and you’ve punched it down, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface. Divide it in half and form each piece into a smooth ball with your hands. Cover the dough with a damp cloth and allow it to relax for 10 to 30 minutes.You only need 1 ball of dough per pizza, so if you’re making a single pizza, wrap the other ball in plastic wrap after it’s relaxed, place it in a freezer bag, and freeze it for the next time you’re making pizza. Allow it to defrost at room temperature 2 to 3 hours before you plan to use it.

, After the dough has relaxed, use your hands to flatten the ball into a disk shape. Use your fingertips to press and push the dough outward until you wind up with a 12 to 13-inch (30 to 33 cm) round.You can press down on the dough with your palms in the center to create a thicker edge around it for a thicker crust.

, Set the shaped dough onto a pizza peel or an inverted baking sheet that’s been lined with parchment paper. Use a pastry brush to lightly coat the surface of the dough with 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of olive oil.You don’t necessarily have to add the olive oil to the dough, but it does add flavor and helps create a more golden brown crust.

, Take approximately ¾ cup (177 ml) of the sauce that you made earlier and spread it over the dough. Don’t take it all the way to the edge of the dough, though. Leave a ¾- to 1-inch (1.9 to 2.5 cm) border around the pizza for the crust., After you’ve added a layer of sauce, cover it with ¼ cup (27.5 g) of finely grated parmesan cheese and 2 cups (200 g) of grated mozzarella cheese. Try to spread the cheese as evenly across the sauce as you can.If you like a really cheesy pizza, you can always add a little more mozzarella.
You can swap the mozzarella cheese for grated provolone or do a combination of mozzarella and provolone if you prefer.

, Take approximately 30 slices of pepperoni and place them evenly across the layer of cheese on the pizza. The goal is to have the same amount of pepperoni on each of the 8 slices you’ll cut when the pizza is done.While placing the pepperoni on top of the cheese is the traditional way to make pepperoni pizza, you can also place it directly on top of the sauce layer so it’s under the cheese. You can even add pepperoni in both layers if you prefer.
If you like the flavor of pepperoni but not how greasy it makes your pizza, take a large microwave-safe plate and line it with a sheet of paper towel. Place the pepperoni on it and layer another piece of paper towel on top. Microwave it for 30 to 45 seconds on high. The heat will drive the grease out of the pepperoni, while the paper towel absorbs it. You can then place it on the pizza without worrying about it becoming too greasy., To ensure that your oven is hot enough to create a delicious crust for the pizza, allow it to preheat to 500 degrees Fahrenheit (260 degrees Celsius) for at least 30 minutes. Make sure that the oven rack is positioned in the lower position, and set a pizza stone on it.If you don’t have a pizza stone, you can substitute an inverted, round baking sheet.

, Once the oven and stone are properly preheated, transfer the finished pizza from your peel or baking sheet onto the stone. Allow the pizza to bake for 12 to 15 minutes, or until the cheese and crust are golden brown.The pizza stone will be extremely hot when you slide the pizza onto it, so be careful not to burn yourself. Wear oven mitts for protection.

, When the pizza is finished, remove it from the oven and sprinkle a pinch of crushed red pepper flakes over it while it’s still hot. Let the pizza cool for approximately 10 minutes, and then use a pizza cutter to cut it into 8 slices.If you want to garnish the pizza with fresh basil, wait until it’s cooled slightly so the leaves don’t wilt.

Make crust out of vegetables.",How to Make a Healthy Pizza2," If you'd rather not use a flour-based crust, there are other alternatives that you can try that are healthy options.


Turn a whole-wheat tortilla into your crust if you want a thinner crust. Simply bake the tortilla on a pizza stone with toppings.
Try a whole-wheat pita pocket that you bake. Bagels with the filling removed can also work. Simply scoop out the doughy insides of the bagel with a spoon or knife, leaving only the shell. Place your pizza ingredients inside of it as you would a pita pocket. Use quinoa. You could make your crust with a healthier grain like quinoa. Stay away from processed flour. Quinoa is a gluten-free whole grain. , Vegetables give you a nutritional boost. The crust is no exception. It can be made entirely out of vegetables, reducing calories and boosting nutritional potential.


Make cauliflower dough. Place cauliflower florets into a word processor and pulse, until you turn the vegetables into the consistency of warm sand. Microwave for several minutes. Drain. Place the pulsed vegetable on a kitchen towel, and remove all liquid. Add 1 teaspoon almond flour to bind the cauliflower, along with 1/3 cup of grated Parmesan and grated Mozzarella cheese each, 1/4 teaspoon salt, 1/2 teaspoon basil, 1/2 teaspoon oregano,1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes, 1 egg, and 1/2 teaspoon grated the garlic. Mold the mixture into balls and press on parchment paper into circle shapes. Bake for 10 minutes at 450 degrees Fahrenheit. To make zucchini dough, follow a similar process. Grate and drain it. Then add same binding agents like mozzarella, almond meal, egg, Parmesan cheese, oregano, garlic powder, and salt. Forget dough completely and put your pizza toppings on the top of a portabella mushroom (or eggplant).

"
Boil the tomatoes.,
Mix the chopped tomatoes with herbs and onions.,
Complete the sauce.,
Use other alternatives for the fresh sauce.",How to Make a Healthy Pizza3," You will need 5 pounds of tomatoes as fresh as possible. However, if you don't have fresh tomatoes available in that quantity, you could substitute canned diced or whole tomatoes for the fresh tomatoes. Choose canned tomatoes without added spices.


Carve an X into each tomato's bottom, and put the tomatoes into a pot of boiling water.
You are waiting for the tomato skins to loosen. Usually, this takes 5 to 20 minutes.
Put the tomatoes in a bowl of ice water.
Peel them. Then, chop the tomatoes.
Red sauces are usually lower in calories than white sauces. Homemade sauce is better for you than canned sauces. , Take a Dutch oven and heat oil in it. Then, cook 2 medium onions and 4 cloves of garlic in it, and add your tomatoes (and juice) and then herbs.


Choose fresh herbs. It's recommended that you use 3/4 a teaspoon of basil, thyme, and oregano each.
Some people put a teaspoon or two of sugar into the sauce but don't use sugar if you are trying for a healthier version.
Boil and then simmer the sauce for 2 hours.

, Put the sauce in a blender, and add 2 tablespoons of tomato paste. Blend until the sauce is a smooth consistency. However, you want to let the sauce cool before you blend it. If you blend hot sauce, you could make the top of the blender explode. Alternatively, you could blend smaller amounts of the sauce at a time, rather than fill the blender with hot sauce. You can also lift the lid to allow steam to escape before blending. The sauce can be safely refrigerated for three days or frozen for six months.
Spread the sauce on your dough. The amount of sauce you should put on the pizza depends on its size. For a 16-inch pizza, you need about a cup of sauce. For an 8-inch pizza, 1/4 cup of sauce will do. For a 12-inch pizza, use 1/2 cup sauce with 1 tablespoon of sauce. , You could add vegetables into your tomato sauce. Possibilities include carrots, squash, peppers or greens. You could make a Margherita pizza with fresh tomatoes, basil, and mozzarella cheese. Plum tomatoes can be a good choice for this kind of pizza, which is healthier for you because it never includes meat. Olive oil, garlic, or pesto are other healthier alternatives to tomato sauce. Brush olive oil over the crust and skip the sauce. There are many known health benefits to olive oil. Although high in fat, the type of fat included in olive oil is considered healthy dietary fat. It contains unsaturated and polyunsaturated fats (PUFAs) that can lower heart disease risk and cholesterol. This might be a better choice if you don't have fresh tomatoes because canned tomatoes can be loaded with sugar. "
"
Add vegetables.,
Choose healthier meats.,
Try fruit.,
Use healthier cheese.,
Use herbs and spices.",How to Make a Healthy Pizza4," Now that your pizza sauce is on the crust add healthy toppings. Vegetables, especially green ones, are extremely low in calories and healthy for you. So, load your pizza up with them.


Spinach is one of the healthiest toppings you can put on a pizza. For example, it is loaded with vitamin K, which can prevent blood clots.
Broccoli is another good choice.Try adding eggplant. As long as you don't fry it, it's a healthy choice. Create a salad on your pizza. Arugula with tomatoes and a little Parmesan cheese makes a delicious pizza salad. Plum tomatoes contain lycopene, which is an antioxidant that has many health benefits. , Instead of the typical meats like sausage or pepperoni, try healthier, lower calorie meat, even if you don't normally think of them on pizza.


Recipes calling for turkey and part-skim cheese can clock in under 300 calories. Try putting shrimp and spinach on your pizza. Turkey bacon or chicken sausage give the feel of normal pizza without the fat. Some stores sell turkey pepperoni.

, You don't have to limit pizza toppings to vegetables and meats. Although many people have tried pineapple on pizza before, experiment with other fruits.


Put pears or apples on your pizza. Both fruits pair nicely with cheese.The good old staple pineapple will make you feel like you're eating the pizza you remember.

, If you must have cheese on your pizza, there are cheeses you can choose that are lower in calories and healthier.


Parmesan cheese has fewer calories than other types of cheese. Choose cheese made out of low-fat or skim milk. Ricotta is an interesting choice. Goat cheese and feta have less oil in them. They are pungent cheeses with a lot of flavors. Be aware that feta does not melt on pizza like other cheeses. However, there are many recipes that call for feta on pizza, especially Mediterranean styles. The cheese should be crumbled on the pizza and baked until golden brown. Skip cheese completely or only add it to half the pie. You can use online nutritional sites to check the number of calories in different kinds of cheeses. , If you load your sauce and pizza up with these, you will have so much flavor you might not miss the other more caloric items.


Basil and rosemary are herbs that taste good on pizza. Try chili pepper or hot peppers. In addition to boosting your metabolism, they will give your pizza's flavor a kick.

"
"
Preheat your oven.,
Use a pizza stone.,
Bake the pizza.",How to Make a Healthy Pizza5," You want the oven to get really hot. Set the oven at 500 degrees or your highest setting.






It usually takes a few minutes longer to cook pizzas with a lot of toppings. Coating your pizza pan or stone with crunched up cornflakes or cornmeal will make the pie less likely to stick. Dust the pan with them, and they will provide a healthier way to eliminate stickiness than oil. You could coat the stone or pan lightly with olive oil also.

, Baking is a healthy way to cook, in general, and using a pizza stone is a healthy way to get a flavorful pizza. Place your completed pizza on the stone, and put it in the oven. You should preheat the pizza stone first at about 400 degrees by putting it in the oven with nothing on it for about an hour. Pizza stones will make your crust more crispy. This is especially important when using unusual thin crusts, like pita pockets or tortillas. You can also find pizza stones made out of steel or clay. , Ten to 14 minutes is usually long enough for the pizza to become crispy and golden.


Remove it from the oven and serve it the right way.
The longer you cook the dough; the crispier the crust will be.

",How to Make Mexican Pizza," To get the tortillas crispy and ready for the pizza, it’s important to get your oven to the right temperature. Preheat it to 375 degrees Fahrenheit (approximately 190 degrees Celsius). Get your baking sheets ready by lightly greasing them with non-stick cooking spray.Pay close attention to your oven to be sure that it’s at the right temperature. An indicator light should come on or the oven should beep when it’s ready.
Make sure to grease two baking sheets because all of the tortillas won’t fit on one.;
, Take 6 medium size tortillas, which are usually 8-inches (203 mm) in diameter, and set them on the greased baking sheets. Put the tray in the oven, and allow them to bake for approximately five minutes.Depending on the size of your baking sheets, you’ll probably need 2 pans for the 6 tortillas.
You’ll know that the tortillas are done when they have a slight golden color and the edges are crispy.

, When the first side of the tortillas are done, use a pair of tongs to carefully flip them over. Cook the second side for another five minutes to get it crispy too. When both sides are done, remove the tortillas from the oven and set them aside.It’s easy to burn yourself when you’re flipping the tortillas so work slowly to avoid coming into contact with the hot baking sheet.

, In a large skillet, crumble 1 pound (approximately 454 g) of lean ground beef and over medium-high heat. Use a heat-safe spatula or wooden spoon to break the beef into equal size pieces and cook until brown, which should take approximately 7 to 10 minutes. Be sure to drain the skillet of any fat or grease.It’s best to use a non-stick skillet when you’re browning ground beef.
The meat should be completely brown. Stir through it to ensure that there are no pink spots.
To drain the beef of grease, tip the pan to the side, using a large spoon or spatula to hold the meat to the other side. Pour the grease into a glass jar or metal can so it can solidify and be disposed of later.
If you want to make a vegetarian Mexican pizza, you can omit the ground beef.

, With the ground beef still in the skillet, add ¾ cup (180 mL) of water and 1 packet of taco seasoning. Stir the ingredients together, and bring the skillet to a boil on high heat.If you prefer to make your own taco seasoning, you can use approximately 2 tablespoons (28.3 g) of your homemade mix instead of the store-bought packet.

, Once the beef, seasoning, and water mixture has come to a boil, reduce the heat to medium-low. Allow the mixture to simmer for 5 to 10 minutes, until most of the water has evaporated. Remove the skillet from the heat.Be sure to stir the mixture as it simmers to keep the beef from sticking to the pan.

, Open a 16 ounce (approximately 454 g) can of refried beans, and transfer the contents to a microwave-safe bowl. Heat the beans until warm in the microwave. The setting will depend on your microwave, but usually 2 minutes at 50% power is enough.Cover the refried beans with microwave-safe plastic wrap, with a corner turned back for venting. That will help keep your microwave clean.

, Once the refried beans are warm, spread a thin layer on one of the tortilla with the butter knife or the back of a spoon. Top the beans with approximately ⅓ of the ground beef mixture, making sure that it’s spread evenly., Cover the beef and bean mixture with a second tortilla. Next, open a can of enchilada sauce, and spoon approximately 3 tablespoons (approximately 44 mL) of it over the tortilla. Spread it evenly, making sure that it doesn’t drip over the edge of the tortilla.If you aren’t a fan of red enchilada sauce, you can replace it with your favorite salsa, taco sauce, or green tomatillo sauce.

, Take approximately ⅓ cup (approximately 113 g) of the cheddar cheese and ⅓ cup (approximately 113 g) of the pepper jack cheese, and sprinkle it over the enchilada sauce. Next, place some of the diced tomato, diced green onion, and sliced black olive on the cheese.You can add any other toppings, such as finely chopped jalapenos or bell peppers, that you want to the pizza.

, Repeat the same process of spreading the refried beans and meat on the first tortilla, covering them with a second tortilla, and spreading enchilada sauce, cheese, and toppings over it with the other 4 tortillas. In the end you’ll have 3 Mexican pizzas.If you’re making the pizzas for a family dinner or a party, it may be fun to let each person assemble their own. That way, they can customize it with the toppings that they prefer.

, When the pizzas are fully assembled, place them on the greased baking sheet(s). Depending on the size of your baking sheets, you may need to use 2 to fit all 3 pizzas. If you have a large baking sheet, you may be able to fit all 3., Place the baking sheet(s) in the 375 degrees Fahrenheit (approximately 190 degrees Celsius) oven, and allow them to bake for 5 to 10 minutes. You want to heat the pizza through and melt the cheese on top.Be careful not to overcook the pizzas. You only want to bake them until the cheese is just melted.

, Once the pizzas are done, take them out of the oven. Allow them to sit for approximately 5 minutes before slicing them into wedges with a pizza cutter.When you serve the pizzas, you may want to add a dollop of sour cream, guacamole, and/or salsa to the plate.
If you don’t have a pizza cutter, you can cut the pizza with a knife.

Separate it into two pieces, and form each piece into a ball by continually folding the dough under itself and rotating it to knead it.In addition to flouring your counter or other work surface, make sure to sprinkle some flour on the dough itself, as well as your hands.
This recipe makes two pizzas. If you only want to make one, place the other ball of dough in an airtight plastic bag or container. It will last in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.

, Take two 9- or 10-inch (23 to 25 cm) round cake pans and pour 1 to 2 tablespoons (15 to 30 ml) of olive oil into each. Place one of the dough balls in each pan, and turn them over in the oil to ensure that they’re completely coated.In addition to cake pans, you can use a cast iron skillets to bake the pizza.

, Once the dough in both pans is oiled, use the palm of your hand to flatten it into place. As you work, make sure that the oil spreads so it covers the entire bottom and sides of the pans., When the dough is pressed into place in the pans, cover each with a piece of plastic wrap. Let them sit out at room temperature for approximately 2 hours so the dough rises once again.Remember to grease the plastic wrap with nonstick cooking spray before you place it over the pans.

, As you’re waiting for the dough to rise, it’s important to make sure that the oven is hot enough to bake the pizzas. Preheat it to 500 degrees Fahrenheit (260 degrees Celsius). Place the oven rack so it’s in the center position as well.Be aware how your oven indicates that it’s reached the proper temperature. Many models beep or flash a light to alert you that the oven is fully preheated.

, While the dough is rising, mix 1 8-ounce (227 grams) can of tomato sauce, 1 teaspoon(5 grams) of dried oregano, ½ teaspoon (2.5 grams) of dried marjoram, ½ teaspoon (2.5 grams) of dried basil, and ½ teaspoon (2.5 grams) of garlic salt together in a medium bowl. Allow the mixture to sit for approximately 1 hour to ensure that the flavors have fully melded.If you prefer, you can use a jarred or homemade pizza sauce instead.

, When the pizza dough has risen for 2 hours in the pans, it should fill the pan to nearly the top. If any large bubbles have developed in the dough, pop them with a knife. Remove any air from beneath the dough by lifting an edge and allowing it to escape. Repeat the process all the way around the pizzas., After the sauce mixture has sat for an hour and the dough is ready, pour half of the sauce over each pizza. Use the back of a spoon to spread it over the dough to within an inch (2.5 cm) of the edge.Pizza Hut traditionally leaves the edge of the dough free of sauce to form the crust, but if you prefer, you can spread your sauce all the way to edge.

, Once the sauce is spread across the pizza, spread approximately 1 cup (125 g) of grated mozzarella cheese over the sauce on each. To season the pizzas, sprinkle a pinch of kosher salt over each.If you prefer extra cheese on your pizza, you can add up to 1 ½ cups (188 g) of mozzarella to each.

, With the cheese in place on the pizzas, you can add whatever toppings you prefer. Place toppings such as pepperoni, cooked sausage, meatball, onions, olives, mushrooms, and peppers in a single layer across all or part of the pizza.If you want, you can sprinkle a little extra mozzarella cheese over the toppings for even more cheese.

, When the pizzas are fully assembled, place the pans side by side on the center oven rack. Allow them to bake until the cheese is bubbling and the crust is golden brown, which should take approximately 15 minutes.As you get closer to the end of the cooking time, make sure to check on the pizzas regularly to ensure that they don’t burn.

, After you’ve taken the pizzas out of the oven, immediately spread a pinch or two of grated parmesan cheese over the top of each. Because the pizzas are still hot, the cheese will melt into the other ingredients.If you like a little spice on your pizza, you can also sprinkle crushed red pepper flakes over them while they’re hot.

, When the pizzas have cooled slightly, use a spatula to lift an edge and look at the bottom. If it’s crisp, you can slice it. If the bottom isn’t done, put the pan on a stove burner set to medium, and allow it to heat until the bottom is crisp, which should take 1 to 3 minutes.If you’re crisping the bottom of the pizza on the stove, make sure to the move the pan around so it heats evenly and doesn’t burn.

, When the pizzas are cool enough to handle, use a spatula to gently lift them from the pans. Place them on a cutting board, and use a knife or pizza cutter to cut them into 6 to 8 slices.

Remove and cut.",How to Make French Bread Pizza," To get a nice crunchy texture for your pizza, your oven needs to be hot enough when you put it inside. Preheat your oven as your first step, so it has enough time to reach the right temperature. Set your oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit (approximately 218 degrees Celsius), and make sure that it’s at that temperature before you bake your pizza.Most ovens will beep or a indicator light will turn red when the oven has reached the designated temperature.;
, As its name indicates, this pizza is usually made using a French baguette style bread. However, you can use any long, thin bread that you like. Take the loaf of bread, and carefully cut it in half lengthwise with a knife so you have two pizza bases.To make 3 to 4 servings, use a loaf of bread that’s approximately 18-inches long and 4-inches wide.
Crusty breads typically work best for French bread pizza, so Italian style loaves can often work.
If you don’t have any long, thin bread on hand, you can use any type of sandwich roll for smaller pizzas. You can even use English muffins.

, One of the most important ingredients in any pizza is the cheese, and mozzarella is the traditional choice. You’ll need approximately 1 cup of grated cheese to cover both pieces of bread. If you have a block of cheese, you’ll need to grate it so it melts more easily on the pizza.If you’re short on time, you can purchase cheese that’s already shredded at the supermarket.
While mozzarella is the usual cheese for pizza, you can use any variety that you like. Cheddar, Provolone, or even Swiss can be interesting options depending on the other toppings you’re using on your pizza. You can also find blends that contain multiple types, such as Italian blend, which usually contains a mix of mozzarella, Provolone, and Parmesan.

, As a delicious as French bread pizza is, you can make it even better with the right toppings. All of your usual favorites, such as pepperoni, mushrooms, sausage, onions, and peppers, will work, so you should chop and cook them as needed before starting your pizza.Because the bread is usually narrow, you may want to chop your toppings a little smaller than usual. For example, you may want to cut pepperoni slices in half or even quarters to fit more easily on the pizzas.
Other delicious toppings to consider for your pizza include ham, pineapple, bacon, jalapenos, and olives.
Some meat toppings, such as sausage, meatballs, and bacon, must be cooked before adding them to the pizza.

, Lay both pieces of your cut bread flat on a work surface, such as a counter or cutting board. To add a little flavor to the bread even before the other ingredients, add approximately 1 tablespoons of olive oil to each piece of bread. You can simply drizzle it over the bread, or use a pastry brush to ensure that it covers the bread more evenly.If you want to add even more flavor to your bread, you can season it further with minced garlic or garlic powder.
If you love cheese, sprinkle a little Parmesan cheese over the olive oil-coated bread.

, Sauce is usually a crucial ingredient for a pizza. Because French bread pizza is meant to be a quick meal, it’s best to just use a jarred pizza or other tomato-based pasta sauce. For each piece of bread, you’ll need approximately ¼ to ½ cup of sauce. Spoon it over the bread and then spread it until the whole piece is covered.If you like to make your own tomato sauce or have leftover homemade sauce in your fridge, use that for your pizza.
You don’t necessarily have to use a plain tomato sauce. Try a spicy arrabiata style pasta sauce or a creamy alfredo sauce to mix things up.
You can also skip sauce all together, and use fresh sliced tomatoes or ricotta cheese instead.

, Once the sauce is in place, cover each piece of bread with half of the grated cheese. Don’t apply too much cheese or it may drip off during baking and get stuck to the inside of your oven. After the cheese, layer any toppings that you’d like on top. Spread them as evenly as possible so you’ll get a little taste of the toppings with each bite.If you want to season the pizza with salt and pepper, do it after you’ve added the cheese and toppings.
You can skip the salt and sprinkle a little Parmesan cheese over the other cheese and toppings.

, Find a cookie sheet with a rim all the way around it, and line it with foil. Set the two pizzas on the pan, making sure that both pieces fit completely. The pizza shouldn’t touch one another either, or melted cheese may fuse them together when they’re cooking.If you’re using multiple loaves of bread to make more than two pizzas, you’ll likely need more than one pan. It’s best to bake the pizzas in batches than try to shove all of them on one cookie sheet.

, Place the sheet with pizza inside the oven on the lowest rack. You’ll want to let them back until the cheese starts to bubble and turns golden. In most cases, that takes 8 to 10 minutes.You should also check the edges of the bread before taking the pizzas out of the oven. They should be crispy and golden.

, When the pizzas are done, remove the cookie sheet from the oven. Allow them to cool just long enough so it’s possible to handle them. Use a knife to cut the pizza into pizza. Depending on how many people you plan to serve, you might just cut each pizza in half or in thirds. You can cut them in even smaller pieces, and serve them as an appetizer at a party.A serrated knife usually works best for cutting French bread pizza.
The pizzas are best served hot, so don’t allow them them to cool too long before serving.

Bake your pizza for 10 to 12 minutes.",How to Make Low Carb Pizza1," First, you will need to remove the core of the head. Using a sharp knife, cut around the large “stem” in the center of the head, so that you are removing the hard center. Then, simply use your hands to break the head into smaller florets, and put them in your food processor., Once you’ve added all of the florets, pop on the lid. Use the pulse button to chop the florets in short spurts. Once you’ve pulsed a bit, you can switch to the blending feature. Let your food processor run until the cauliflower is finely ground., Use a rubber spatula or spoon to get all of the ground cauliflower out of the food processor and into a pan on the stovetop. Add your water to the ground cauliflower, which is necessary for cooking.

, Once you’ve added the water, turn your stove temperature to medium-high. You’ll want to cook your ground cauliflower for about five to six minutes. Stay at the stovetop, continuously stirring the mixture as it cooks. While you’re cooking, add a pinch of salt –or however much you desire in a pizza crust!, After five or six minutes of cooking, remove your pan from the heat. You can just turn off the stovetop and let it cool slowly on the stove. If you’re in a hurry, feel free to pop the pan near a window or in the refrigerator to cool it off faster. It’s important that the mixture has cooled before moving onto the next step., Once your mixture has finished cooling, transfer it onto a clean napkin or cheesecloth. Pick up the cloth from the corners, so that the cauliflower is in a pouch. Over your pan or over the sink, squeeze the cauliflower as hard as you can so that water drains from the cloth. Continue doing this until you aren’t getting any more water out.


This is the most important step of the process. In order to create sturdy crust that doesn’t fall apart when you pick it up, you have to get as much water out of it as possible.

, Once your cauliflower is thoroughly drained, it’s time to mix in the other ingredients. Put it in a mixing bowl and add the other ingredients. Use a rubber spatula or a spoon to blend this mixture up thoroughly. When you’re done, you should have something similar to dough., First, line your baking sheet with parchment paper. The crust can stick to foil, but it will not stick to parchment paper. Roll your mixture into a ball, and place it in the middle of the baking sheet. Press it out with damp fingers, until you’ve created a circle about 1/4 inch thick.If you want, you can create a ridge with your fingers around the perimeter of the dough, so that it will look a bit more like regular pizza crust.

, Preheat your oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit, or 200 degrees Celsius. Set your timer to 40 minutes. This is the typical baking time for the crust, but keep your eye on it. The crust is ready when it is a medium golden brown color., Once you’ve removed the crust from the oven, carefully flip it over. You want to build your pizza on the bottom side. While you are adding your toppings, turn the oven up to 450 degrees Fahrenheit, or 220 degrees Celsius. This is where the customization happens. Add whatever toppings you like on pizza!You can make a “traditional” pizza with things like tomato sauce, cheese, and pepperoni. If you want to get unique, try adding something like barbecue sauce, pesto, or Alfredo sauce.

, Remove it from the oven when it looks finished to you. The edges will crisp up even more when you make it the second time. Transfer your pizza to a cooling rack for about five minutes before you try to cut it. This will help your cauliflower crust dry a bit and ensure that it doesn’t fall apart. Then, slice and enjoy!"

You want the mozzarella and cream cheese to become soft and malleable, which typically takes about thirty seconds. If you’ve never made this before, keep an eye on the cheeses and take it out when they’ve softened enough.While you are doing this, preheat your oven to 425 degrees, or 220 degrees Celsius, so it can warm while you create the crust.

, Blend everything together in your mixing bowl using a rubber spatula, until it’s reached a dough-like consistency. Once everything is mixed up completely, roll it into a large ball., Again, it’s imperative that you line your baking sheet with parchment paper so that it doesn’t stick. If you use foil, you run the risk of your crust sticking and being ruined. Press the dough into your desired shape.Once your dough is rolled out, spray it with olive oil or coconut oil and add a sprinkle of garlic salt.

, Before you pop it into the oven, use a fork to pierce holes along the surface to prevent it from bubbling and rising. Put it in the oven for eight to ten minutes, but keep an eye on it. If bubbles start forming, pierce more holes into the dough. As soon as it becomes a golden brown, remove it from the oven.Be careful not to overcook and dry out your crust. If you’ve never made this before, start with the minimum cooking time.

, Before you go nuts topping your pizza, increase the temperature on the oven to 450 degrees, or 230 degrees Celsius. Then, start making the pizza your own. Add cheese and meats, or create a vegetarian pizza. Add whatever you want! Pop it back in the oven for four to give minutes, and voila! You’ve created an easy and delicious, low carb pizza."

Use a different nut butter.,
Add fresh fruit instead of jelly.,
Add something savory.,
Use jam instead of the jelly.,
Try marshmallow fluff instead of jelly.,
Drizzle extra flavor.,
Add texture to the filling.",How to Upgrade Peanut Butter and Jelly1," If you want to make a simple swap that will give your sandwich a dramatically different taste, swap a different nut butter for the peanut butter. You could use cashew, almond, sunflower, or hazelnut butter. Many of these are available in creamy or crunchy varieties.


You could use a chocolate-hazelnut or chocolate-cashew spread for an even richer filling.;
, You can cut out some of the sugar by using fresh fruit instead of jelly. Slice up bananas, strawberries, or pears to place on the sandwich. You can also scatter blueberries, raspberries, or pomegranate seeds for a slightly tangy flavor.For a chewy, sweet taste, you can use dried fruit. Consider using dried apple rings, sliced apricots, dried cranberries, or raisins.

, Most people expect peanut butter and jelly sandwiches to be overly sweet, but they don't have to be. Add a little savory flavor to cut some of the sweetness. Try crumbling bacon over the peanut butter or lay a slice of ham on it. You could also stir a little hot sauce in the peanut butter for a kick of heat.Some stores carry bacon jam which is usually made with bacon and maple syrup. Spread a little of the bacon jam over your fillings.

, If you're not feeling very adventurous about changing the traditional sandwich, just use jam instead of jelly. Unlike jelly, which has the fruit strained out, jam has chunks of the fruit in it. This can also make the fruit flavor stronger.


Don't forget to try fruit butters which are creamy and less sweet than jam. For example, you could make a peanut butter and apple butter sandwich.

, You can purchase or make marshmallow fluff. Make a fluffernutter sandwich by using peanut butter and marshmallow fluff instead of the jelly. This is a great choice if you don't like the jelly seeping through the bread in traditional peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.For an extra decadent sandwich, you could toast the marshmallow fluff under a broiler before you press the bread together.

, You can use peanut butter and jelly as the basic fillings (or just use the peanut butter for a less sweet sandwich) and drizzle a syrup over them. For a robust flavor, drizzle a little molasses over the peanut butter. For a milder flavor, drizzle some honey, golden syrup, or agave syrup over the fillings.If you want to cut some of the sweetness of your fillings, whip up a little cream cheese and spread it over the peanut butter or jelly.

, You can add flavor and texture by sprinkling toasted nuts, pretzels, granola, potato chips, or chocolate sprinkles over the fillings. Try just adding one or two of these so you don't overwhelm the flavors of the sandwich.Try to add the crunchy ingredients right before you eat the sandwich. Some of these (like the potato chips) may become soggy if they sit on the sandwich for a long time.

Use artisan bread.,
Replace the bread.,
Consider grilling the sandwich.,
Cut the sandwich into shapes.,
Roll the sandwich into pinwheels.",How to Upgrade Peanut Butter and Jelly2," You probably reach for plain white bread when making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, but you could use any type of bread. Try using a rustic artisan bread, like sourdough or ciabatta. Use a bread that you normally enjoy eating.


For a really rich flavor, use banana bread to make the peanut butter and jelly sandwich.

, You don't have to use sandwich bread to make a peanut butter and jelly. Use any of your favorite baked goods to make the sandwich. Keep in mind that some of these may make smaller sandwiches, so you'll want to make several of them. Consider using:


Crumpets or English muffins
Biscuits
Pancakes
Waffles
Pita bread

, If you're really craving a warm sandwich, grill the peanut butter and jelly sandwich as you would a grilled cheese sandwich. You'll need to butter both sides of the sandwich and grill it in a heated skillet until it's golden brown on both sides.For a really unique take on a grilled peanut butter and jelly sandwich, grill the sandwich on a waffle iron until it's crisp on the sides.

, You can serve small peanut butter and jelly sandwiches by cutting them into small shapes. Just take a cookie cutter and cut near the center and sides of the sandwich, avoiding the crusts. You can use stars, hearts, ovals, or other fun shapes.


You can serve the small sandwich bites on lollipop sticks. Push a lollipop stick into each sandwich bite so that guests can pick one up for a cute appetizer., You can make peanut butter and jelly sandwiches more fun by simply rolling them up into pinwheels. Trim off the crusts and discard them. Use a rolling pin to lightly flatten the sandwiches, so they're easier to roll. Tightly roll the sandwiches and then cut them into slices.Try sliding several of the pinwheels onto skewers so you have peanut butter and jelly kebabs. These make great snack food.

Find a microwave-safe plate.,
Place the pizza on the plate.,
Place a glass of water in the microwave.,
Heat up your pizza.",How to Revitalize Day Old Pizza in a Microwave1," Choose a plate that’s either ceramic or glass. Make sure the plate doesn’t have any metal embellishments or decorations on the rim. Metal should never be used in a microwave as it can cause fires.


If you have nothing else, use a paper plate. Make sure the plate doesn’t have a plastic coating on the surface.
Never use plastic containers. When microwaved, these containers can leak hazardous chemicals into your food.;
, Place a paper towel on the plate to help soak up excess moisture.If your pizza is really dried out, you may want to skip this step. Next, break the pizza down into sections so that you can microwave two or three pieces of pizza at a time. Spread the pieces apart so that they’re not touching to help them heat evenly.


If you have more than two or three pieces of pizza you should plan to microwave them in batches. If you microwave a lot of pieces at once they won’t heat through properly and you’ll have to eat cold, rubbery pizza!
If you like your crust really crispy, skip the paper towel and put your pizza on parchment paper instead. , Choose a ceramic cup with a handle. Don’t use any other kind of cup; glass can crack in the microwave sometimes and the plastic may emit harmful chemicals. Fill the cup about two-thirds full of fresh tap water. The water will help fluff up the pizza crust and revitalize the toppings.Make sure the ceramic cup fits inside the microwave with the plate. If it doesn’t fit side-by-side, stack the plate on top of the cup.
Try to use a mug with a handle so that you can safely retrieve the hot mug when you’re done microwaving your pizza. If you don’t have one, wait for the ceramic cup to cool completely before removing it.

, Microwave everything in one minute intervals at half power until the pizza is as hot as you like it.By reheating the pizza slowly, you give the ingredients more time to come to the same temperature. Toppings that would normally heat up faster than the rest of the pizza won’t be lava hot when you try to eat them. Similarly, the inside of the pizza won’t be cold either.


Check if the pizza is hot enough by placing a finger near the pizza. If you touch the pizza, you may get burned.
If you need your pizza in a hurry, microwaving in thirty second intervals at normal power will work as well. However, your crust may not be as soft.

"
"
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.,
Place the pizza in the oven.,
Remove the heated pizza from the oven.",How to Revitalize Day Old Pizza in a Microwave2," Some ovens use a timer to let you know when the oven is hot enough. If your oven doesn't have that feature you may need to set your own timer. Let the oven preheat for seven to ten minutes to make sure it gets hot enough.Always practice good cooking habits when using the oven. Never open the oven while someone else is standing in front of it and keep all flammables away.

, For a crispier crust, place your pizza on a foil-lined cookie sheet before putting it in the oven.If you want a crunchy crust that’s soft on the inside, place the pizza directly onto the oven rack.However, be aware that the cheese may melt and fall into your oven. This won’t damage your oven, but you’ll miss out on some extra cheesy goodness!


Always use heat protected oven mitts or a sturdy hand towel when placing food into an oven. If you don’t, you may burn yourself.

, Your pizza should take three to six minutes to reheat. When it’s as done as you like it take the pizza out of the oven. If you used a foil-lined cookie sheet simply use oven mitts or a sturdy dish towel to lift the tray out of the oven. If you placed your pizza directly on the oven rack you’ll need to be more careful. Position the serving plate to be level with the oven rack. Use tongs to slide the pizza from the oven rack onto the serving dish. Be careful not to burn yourself.


Don’t try to lift the pizza with your tongs or you’ll risk all of your cheese and toppings falling off. Try to gently pull the pizza onto a plate to cool.
Let your pizza cool for about a minute or you may burn your mouth.

Finish the pizza on a skillet.,
Finish your pizza in a waffle iron.,
Add gourmet ingredients to your pizza.",How to Revitalize Day Old Pizza in a Microwave3," If you’re obsessed with a crunchy crust, consider baking the pizza on a skillet. Place a cast-iron skillet over medium heat until the pan gets hot. Place one or two slices of microwaved pizza on the skillet using tongs. After about thirty seconds to a minute, use the tongs to lift the pizza and check the bottom.Cook until it’s as crispy as you like it.


Don’t crowd the pan. If you put too many slices of pizza in the pan at once, the crust won’t crisp evenly.
If you want a crunchier finish, melt half a tablespoon of butter in the pan before heating up the pizza. This will add a buttery, deliciously flaky finish to the bottom crust., If you use a waffle iron to reheat your pizza, you can skip the microwave and oven entirely. First rearrange the toppings on the pizza. They should be clustered together in the upper left corner of the pizza slice near the crust. Then, fold the pizza. Bring the bottom point up to the top left corner and press the pizza to make a fold. Finally, press your pizza into a pre-heated waffle iron and cook for about five minutes, continually checking for doneness.If you have small pizza pieces or a large waffle iron you don’t need to fold the pizza or rearrange the toppings. Instead, sandwich two pizza pieces together and press them in the waffle iron.

, Fresh ingredients such as basil leaves and sliced mozzarella are excellent additions to any pizza. Also consider adding some traditional pizza toppings such as olives, anchovies, and sliced bell peppers. Finally, try experimenting. Add leftovers such as diced chicken or taco meat to the top of your pizza for a fun twist.


If you don’t want to add new ingredients, consider using a dipping sauce such as ranch or bleu cheese dressing to spice up your leftovers.

Don't forget the tip.",How to Order Pizza1," If you're going to call in an order, you need to find one that delivers to your neighborhood, or one that's close enough to get to in the time it takes to make the pizza, generally 20-45 minutes. Use Yelp or Google Maps to find nearby restaurants that serve the kind of pizza you like, and peruse their menus online.;
, Generally, you can look at most pizza restaurants menus online if you're curious about specific specialty pizzas, or you can ask after you call the restaurant to describe any specials or options that you might not be aware of. Before you call, decide on:


The size of your pizza, generally S (8-10 inch crust), M (10-12 inch crust), and L (+12 inches)
The number of pizzas you'd like to order
Your toppings
Any specialty instructions or diet restrictions
Any additional items you like, such as salad, soda, or wings

, Be prepared with your order, and be ready to answer any questions they'll ask. Ask the employee who answers to describe any specials and make sure you're aware of the price at the end of the call. Generally, the restaurant will need to know:


Your name
Your telephone number
Your address, along with any special instructions (especially if you live in an apartment building)
Your order

, Generally, you can either have the pizza delivered to hour house or you can go pick it up yourself. Most restaurants that deliver pizza include a small delivery fee, plus a customary tip for the delivery person.

, Before you hang up the phone, make sure you know how you're going to pay for the pizza, and how much it costs. Some places will take cards that you can use over the phone by supplying the restaurant with your card number and security PIN. Other places only accept cash. Make sure you've got enough to cover the cost of the pizza, plus a generous tip, and then sit back and wait for your pie.

, If you're getting the pizza delivered in the US, it's customary to leave a tip of around 15% for the delivery person, or at least $3. If the order is especially large, complicated, or if the weather is particularly nasty, add a dollar for each item you ordered.Try to have the tip calculated before you're standing in front of the delivery person awkwardly. If it works out to give them denominations that leave an appropriate tip in change, all the better: ""Keep the change, sir.""

Cool and serve the pizza.",How to Make Pizza Without an Oven at Home," Pour the lukewarm water into a medium sized mixing bowl or the bowl of a standing mixer. Add in the yeast to the water and let the yeast dissolve for about 10 minutes.You should see that the mixture becomes bubbly and that the yeast granules dissolve into the water.
If you don’t want to prepare your own dough, buy pre-prepared dough at the grocery store.;
, Pour in the 2 cups (473.17 ml) of all purpose flour and the 1 ½ (7.39 ml) teaspoons of salt into the bowl of yeast and water. Use a spatula or spoon to stir the ingredients vigorously until they make a shaggy dough. The dough doesn’t have to be completely homogenous, as you will knead it., Knead the dough, either by hand on a counter or table or by using the low setting on a standing mixer. To knead by hand, place the dough on the counter and begin to stretch and squeeze it, folding it over on itself and stretching it again. Keep kneading for about 5-8 minutes until the dough is smooth and expands back out when you poke it.If the dough is incredibly sticky, add a small amount of flour and rework it. Avoid adding too much flour, as this will make the dough have a thicker, heavier consistency.

, Once you have kneaded the dough into a smooth ball, pour cooking oil on a paper towel and use it to lightly oil the interior of a large bowl. Place the dough ball inside the bowl, cover the bowl with a cloth, and let the dough rise for 1-1 ½ hours until it is twice its size.If you are in a rush, you can skip the process of letting the dough rise and move on to preparing the pizza. Be aware that the crust of the pizza will be very thin and crisp as opposed to fluffy.
If you are preparing the dough in advance for the next day, let the dough rise for 30 minutes, then place it in the fridge in a covered bowl until you are ready to use it.

, While the dough is rising, you can begin to prepare the pizza toppings. Slice your favorite toppings, whether it be veggies like mushrooms or green bell peppers or meat like cooked sausage or ham. Slice about 1-2 cups (240- 480 ml) in total of the pizza toppings and put them aside., Take the dough out of the bowl and divide the dough into two equal sized balls. Pour a small amount of flour onto a clean counter or cutting board, then use your hands to spread out the flour into a thin, even layer. Place one ball of dough on the counter and roll it using a rolling pin to create a circle with a diameter that is slightly smaller than the pan you will be using to cook the pizzas. Repeat with the other dough ball.Once you’ve rolled the dough, use your hands to encourage the dough into a circle shape if need be.

, Place the pan or skillet you will be using to cook the pizza over medium high heat. Add a teaspoon or so (about 4.92 ml) of cooking oil and swirl so that the cooking oil coats the bottom of the pan. You can also use two equal sized pans if you want to cook both pizzas at the same time., Once the pan has heated, carefully drop one pizza dough circle into the pan and cook for about 1 minute until you see bubbles forming on the dough and the edges getting slightly golden.If the bubbles are large, you can deflate them by poking them with a spatula. You also can keep them if you wish; they will turn crispy when fully cooked.

, After the one minute of cooking is up, flip the dough circle over using a spatula. Then spread half the pizza sauce over the dough except for the outer two inches (5 cm) or so, as this will be the crust. Sprinkle on half the cheese and add half the pizza toppings., After you have added all the pizza toppings, place the lid on top of the pan or skillet you are using and turn the heat down to medium. Covering the pan traps the heat so that the cheese can melt and the toppings can cook., Leave the pan or skillet covered for 4-5 minutes. After the five minutes are up, take the lid off the pan. If the cheese has melted and the bottom of the pizza looks golden brown, the pizza should be done. If not, replace the lid back on the pan and check every minute or so until the pizza is ready., Once the pizza is ready, use a spatula to take it out of the pan and place it on a cutting board to cool. In the meantime, make another small pizza using the other dough circle. Once both pizzas are cooked and have cooled enough to eat, slice and enjoy your pan made pizza!, Heat the grill up to 600 degrees F (315.55 C). Next to the grill, set up a table that can hold all of your toppings and the two pizza doughs, as well as tongs, a pastry brush, a spatula, a large spoon and an oven mitt.Choose direct as opposed to indirect heat if that is a setting on your grill.
The hotness of the grill will give you crispier pizza with a deliciously charred crust that tastes almost like wood fired pizza.

, Use a pastry brush to brush olive oil onto one side of one of the pizzas, or onto both pizzas if your grill can fit them both at the same time., Lay the dough on the grill with the side coated in olive oil facing down. Try to fit both pizza doughs on the grill if you can. Coat the side facing up in olive oil as well., Keep the pizza dough in the uncovered grill for three minutes. After three minutes, the dough should look set and less soft than before, yet not too crispy., Use the tongs or a spatula to flip the dough after three minutes. Right after you flip it, use a large spoon to spread sauce over the dough, sprinkle the cheese, then add the toppings. Remember if you are cooking one pizza at a time to add only half the toppings you prepared., Close the lid of the grill and cook the pizza for another three minutes. Check after three minutes to see whether the pizza looks done. If the edges are crispy and the cheese has melted, remove the pizza. If not, put the top back on the grill and check every thirty seconds or so until the pizza looks done., Use a pair of tongs or a spatula to transfer the pizza from the grill to a cutting board. If you are cooking the pizzas one at a time, put the next circle of dough onto the grill and repeat the steps of grilling, topping, and removing the second pizza., Let the pizza sit for about three minutes or so to let it solidify and cool slightly. Then use a large knife or pizza wheel to cut the pizza into slices and enjoy it while it's hot."

Remove your waffle and serve.",How to Make Pizza Waffles," Grab a medium mixing bowl. Pop your water in the microwave or in a saucepan on the stovetop, and then heat it until it’s 110 degrees Fahrenheit, or 45 degrees Celsius. The water must be this warm for the yeast to work. Add the package of yeast and the sugar, and give it a stir. Let the mixture sit for about 10 minutes, or until it becomes a creamy consistency., After the yeast, sugar, and water has become a creamy consistency, it’s time to add the rest of the ingredients. Carefully pour in the flour, stirring the mixture as you add it. Then, sprinkle in the salt and add the olive oil.If you do not have bread flour, you can use all-purpose flour.

, Use a bit of elbow grease for this step. After you’ve added every ingredient, you need to beat them together until they’re completely smooth. Make sure to scrape along the sides and bottom of the bowl to get everything., With many pizza dough recipes, you need to let the dough rise for hours. With this recipe, you only need five minutes! Set the thoroughly mixed dough to the side, and set a timer for five minutes. Once it’s fully “rested,” you’re ready to go!, The great thing about pizza waffles is how easy they are to make. If you want to really make things easy, you can skip the homemade dough and simply buy some store-bought pizza dough. You can find this in the refrigerated section of your grocery store.

, Grab a chunk of your pizza dough and roll it into a ball, about the size of your palm. Then, use a rolling pin to flatten it. Rolled out, you want your pizza dough to be the size of the waffle iron and about half an inch thick. Spray your pre-heated waffle iron with a nonstick cooking spray and place the flattened dough on the iron., Once your pizza dough is on the waffle iron, spoon your marinara sauce onto it. Add about two tablespoons of sauce. Spoon it onto the center of the dough and spread it around, leaving about half an inch of dough uncovered around the perimeter. The sauce will spread out once you close the waffle iron, and you don’t want it to drip out of the sides., You can use grated or sliced cheese for this step. Sprinkle the grated cheese onto your pizza or place the slices over the dough. The cheese will melt once you close the iron, so leave a bit of room around the perimeter of the dough., If you prefer plain cheese pizza, you can leave your pizza waffle as it. Otherwise, start adding your favorite toppings. Layer pepperoni slices over the cheese, throw on a handful of onions, or add some spice with peppers.You can add as many ingredients as you want, but take care not to add too much of each. You don’t want to overfill your pizza waffle so that ingredients run out of the sides of the iron.

, Because there will be another layer of dough covering your ingredients, you want to add enough cheese and sauce to balance out the amount of “crust.” Once you’ve added the toppings that you want on your pizza, add another layer of the grated or sliced mozzarella. Then, spoon a bit more marinara sauce over that., To create the waffle, you’ll be sandwiching all of your yummy toppings within two layers of dough. Use your rolling pin to roll out another slab of dough the size of the waffle iron. Carefully place it over the toppings, so that everything is completely covered., After you close the lid, there will probably be excess dough hanging over the edges. Use a knife to carefully cut away this excess dough. Let your pizza waffle cook for about five to seven minutes. You may see cheese spill over the sides, which is okay. You can clean your waffle iron after it cools., After five to seven minutes, or once your pizza waffle is a nice golden brown, it’s time to remove it from the iron. Use a knife to carefully pop the pizza waffle out of the iron, and place it on a plate. Serve your pizza waffle with a side of marinara sauce for dipping."

Spread a little olive oil on your baking sheet and set the crust on it.You can form the crust into a circle or rectangle.

, Top the pizza with your choice of ingredients. Place the pizza in the preheated oven and bake it for 15 to 20 minutes. You may need more or less time depending on how thick your crust is and how many toppings you used.The crust should turn golden brown and the cheese will melt once the pizza is done.

Remove from heat and season.,
Let the sauce cool to room temperature before using it on your pizza.

",How to Make Pizza Sauce2," Blend the ricotta and cream together in a food processor until smooth.Set the blended cream mixture aside until ready to use.
You could also use a blender if you do not have a food processor.
Heavy cream will create a smoother, richer sauce, but half-and-half will create a lighter, healthier sauce.

, Use a small to medium skillet and heat the oil over medium heat.


If you do not have olive oil, canola oil or vegetable oil will work as substitutions.
The oil is hot enough to work with once it begins to glisten slightly.

, Add the chopped onion to the hot oil and and Sauté for 5 to 6 minutes.The onion should become translucent and soft.
Stir the onion continually with a heat-resistant spatula as you Sauté it.
If you do not have fresh onion, use 1 Tbsp (15 ml) dried minced onion flakes, instead. Add the onion flakes when you add the cream and ricotta blend to the pan.

, Toss the minced garlic into the skillet with the onion and oil. Cook for an additional 1 minute.


The garlic should become fragrant.
Stir the contents of the pan continually as they Sauté.
If you do not have fresh minced garlic, use 1/4 tsp (1.25 ml) garlic powder, instead. Add the garlic powder to the pan when you add the cream mixture.

, Add the ricotta and cream mixture to the skillet and reduce the heat to medium-low. Cook for another 3 minutes.


The sauce should simmer slowly as it cooks. Once it thickens and reduces slightly, it can be removed from the heat.

, Add the parsley, thyme, salt, and pepper. Stir the seasonings into the sauce with a wooden spoon.


If you do not have fresh herbs, use 1 Tbsp (15 ml) dried parsley and 1 tsp (5 ml) dried thyme, instead.
More salt and pepper can be added, if desired. Stir the salt and pepper in according to taste.

Use a slow cooker that is at least 3 ½ to 4 quarts. Cut the pork down to fit inside the slow cooker if necessary.Another option is to use pre-made pulled pork.;
, Remove the meat from the slow cooker and place it on a clean work surface. Use two forks to shred the pork into bite-sized pieces. Put two dinner forks back-to-back into the meat. Pull them opposite ways to break up and shred the pork.Remove and discard any pieces of gristle as you come across them.
Make sure to shred all of the meat at once, even if you won’t use it all. In order to refrigerate or freeze the leftovers safely, they should be broken down into pieces., Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C). Put the pork into a heat-safe container. Mix the barbeque sauce in well.Once the oven is preheated, cook the pork for 30 minutes or until it is heated throughout.

, Set aside two cups of pork for your pizza. Place the rest in shallow containers. Refrigerate and/or freeze the leftovers right away.Refrigerate cooked meat for as long as three or four days, in a refrigerator that maintains a temperature of 40°F (4°C) throughout.Make sure the containers are sealed airtight, or use securely closed food-safe bags. Keep the meat in the back of the refrigerator, if possible.Frozen food remains safe pretty much indefinitely. However, to maintain taste, try to use your frozen meat leftovers within two to three months., Pour olive oil into a medium saucepan, and set the burner to medium heat. Cook onions in the oil for eight to ten minutes, stirring them occasionally. Mix in the garlic and continue cooking for three to five more minutes, stirring it several times.Cook times may vary. Sautee the onions until they are softened, and the garlic until it is softened.
If you prefer a faster sauce, mix 1/4 cup of barbeque sauce with two teaspoons of chipotle chili powder. Season it with salt and black pepper, to taste., Mix in oregano, sugar, red pepper flakes, and crushed tomatoes. Season well with salt and pepper, and stir completely., Then reduce the heat until the sauce maintains a shimmer. Simmer for about 30 minutes, or until the sauce is thick and down to about two cups.Leave the pot uncovered until this step is finished. Then put a lid on the pot.
Once finished, remove the oregano and discard it.

, Set the baking temperature to 450°F (230°C). You’ll be putting the pizzas on baking sheets, so if they don’t both fit on a single baking sheet, make sure you have more than one baking rack in the oven., Use a large spoon or rubber spatula to spread the sauce evenly across the pizza crust. Place a layer of sliced onion, pulled pork and red bell pepper slices on top of the sauce.Sprinkle half of the mozzarella cheese over each pizza.Adding cheese is optional. Instead of only mozzarella cheese, you can use a blend of shredded cheddar, mozzarella, and Monterey jack cheese.Optional toppings you can add to each pizza (before adding cheese) are: 3/4 cup fresh pineapple chunks, 6 ounces of cooked and crumbled bacon, and one thinly sliced jalapeno pepper with the seeds removed. Thinly sliced roma tomatoes, sliced green onions, and thin pieces of red onion are other topping choices.

, Cook the pizzas on a baking sheet in the preheated oven for twelve to fifteen minutes. The toppings should be hot, and the pizza crust crisp on the bottom.If you want to brown the cheese on top, turn the broiler on for the last few minutes of baking time., Remove the pizzas from the oven. Sprinkle chopped, fresh parsley and fried onions over the top of the pizza, if desired.Optionally, you can use chopped cilantro or other fresh herb (such as oregano or basil) instead of parsley.

, Allow the pizzas to cool for three minutes. Then slice them up with a pizza cutter.Put out a bowl of barbeque sauce for dipping, if desired."

, Get out a 12-inch (30.5 cm) non-stick skillet. Put the skillet over medium heat. Melt 1 tablespoon (14.2 g) of butter in the skillet. Rotate the skillet as the butter melts so that the butter coats the bottom of it., Place one quesadilla in the skillet on top of the butter. Cook it for 6 to 8 minutes.

Slice and serve.",How to Make Pizza from Scratch," Place all four ingredients in a small mixing bowl and stir gently to combine.


Ideally, the water should be ""blood temperature,"" or between 96 to 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit (35.5 to 37 degrees Celsius).
Allow the mixture to sit for 5 minutes, or until the yeast fully dissolves and starts to foam.;
, Dump the flour out onto a clean, sturdy work surface and form it into a mound. Use your hands to alter the shape of this mound into a deep well with high walls.For this recipe, you'll knead the dough by hand. If you plan to use a stand mixer, however, you can place the flour into the bowl of the mixer instead of the table or counter.

, Add one-third of the water mixture. Use a fork to carefully knock some of the flour from the wall of the well into this puddle, but do not allow the well to collapse.


After mixing the water into the flour, repeat this step with another one-third of the water, followed by the remaining third.
When finished, a very sticky dough should form.

, Dust your hands with flour, then knead the dough by hand for 10 minutes. Stop only when the dough feels firm and cohesive.


If you'd prefer to knead the dough using a stand mixer, fit it with the dough hook attachment and work the dough on low to medium spread for 10 minutes., Spread the olive oil over the bottom and sides of a large mixing bowl. Place the dough inside, then turn it several times to coat the surface of the dough with oil.

, Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and allow it to sit in a warm spot for 60 minutes, or until the dough doubles in size.


Ideally, the air temperature should be between 75 and 85 degrees Fahrenheit (24 to 29 degrees Celsius).
If you do not have a warm enough spot, heat the oven to 150 degrees Fahrenheit (65 degrees Celsius). Turn off the preheated oven and give it several minutes to cool slightly, then allow the bowl of dough to rise inside.

, Separate the risen dough into two halves. Roll each half into a ball.


Place the balls of dough 1 inch (2.5 cm) apart on a lightly floured surface. When they expand enough to touch, they'll be ready to use or store.
If you wish to save one or both rounds for another time, you can place the dough in an airtight container and freeze it for up to two weeks. Fully thaw frozen dough to room temperature before working with it, though.

, Place the diced tomatoes into a medium mixing bowl and crush them using the back of a fork. Continue until the tomatoes are soupy, yet still chunky.If you don't mind getting your hands dirty, you could also crush the tomatoes by hand instead of using a fork. Doing so would actually make it easier to control the process.
Set the tomatoes aside after crushing them.

, Pour the oil into a heavy, 2-qt (2-L) saucepan. Set the pan on the stove over medium-high heat.


Give the oil at least 30 to 60 seconds to warm up. You should be able to turn the pan and easily coat the bottom with the oil once it's warm enough.

, Add the minced onion to the hot oil and cook, stirring frequently, for several minutes or until the onion becomes slightly translucent.

, Add the minced garlic to the oil and onion. Saute, stirring frequently, for another minute or until the garlic looks golden in color.Watch the contents of the saucepan carefully at this point. Minced garlic can burn quickly if you leave it unattended.

, Add the prepared tomatoes, oregano, basil, sugar, salt, and pepper to the saucepan.


Allow the mixture to cook at medium-high heat, stirring frequently, until it begins to boil gently.

, Reduce the heat to low and allow the sauce to simmer, uncovered, for at least 30 minutes.


You can simmer the sauce for up to 90 minutes. Sauce that simmers for longer periods will be thicker and more flavorful.

, Remove the finished sauce from the heat and let it cool down to room temperature.


If you want to save part of the sauce or all of the sauce for later, you can pour the cooled sauce into an airtight container and refrigerate it for up to one week. If frozen, the sauce can last for up to two months.

, If the sauce seems too chunky or thick, use an immersion blender to puree it until it reaches the right consistency.


After you puree the sauce, it should be ready to use.

, Use a box grater to shred the mozzarella cheese into thick shreds. Place the shredded cheese in a bowl and set aside.


For an even cheesier experience, double the amount of cheese and slice it into 1/4-inch (6-mm) thick pieces.
You can save time by using pre-shredded cheese or change the flavor by mixing different types of cheese.

, Use a sharp knife to cut the pepperoni into slices. The slices should be between 1/8-inch and 1/4-inch (3-mm and 6-mm) thick.


If desired, you could dice the pepperoni into small cubes instead of slicing it.
You may omit the pepperoni if you do not wish to include it.

, Place the bulk sausage in a skillet set over medium heat. Break it apart into crumbles with a spatula and cook, stirring frequently, for 10 minutes or until the sausage is fully browned.


The sausage is only optional. You can skip it or add other meats to the pizza, as well. Some meats, like bacon, will need to be cooked and crumbled ahead of time. Others, like ham, only need to be sliced.

, Fill a small, heavy-bottomed saucepan with 2 to 3 inches (5 to 7.6 cm) of olive oil. Heat the oil and poach the onions and peppers for 5 minutes, or until soft.


While this recipe only lists onions and peppers, you can use other vegetables, as well. Poaching the vegetables in oil will make them taste richer.Allow the oil to heat slowly to 190 degrees Fahrenheit (90 degrees Celsius) before adding the vegetables. If the oil sizzles or steams, it is too hot. Poach the vegetables in this hot oil until they soften, then fish them out with a slotted spoon and drain on clean paper towels.

, Tear the basil into small strips using your hands.


Do not use a knife. Chopping fresh basil could cause it to bruise.
You can also experiment with other fresh herbs, like oregano and parsley.

, Allow the oven to preheat for at least 30 minutes or up to 60 minutes.


Meanwhile, prepare a pizza stone or round baking sheet by coating it with a fine, even layer of cornmeal or flour.

, Place one rounded ball of dough onto a lightly floured work surface and gently stretch it into a flat circle. Use your hands to push out the edges.


If necessary, use a lightly floured rolling pin to flatten the dough to thickness of 1/4 inch (6 mm) or less.Alternatively, spread the dough out as much as possible on the work surface, then carefully pick it up. Place both fists beneath it and gradually stretch the dough out further, using a circular motion.
Note that if the dough shrinks back while you roll it out, allow it to rest for 5 minutes before continuing.

, Carefully lift the dough and place it onto the prepared pizza stone or baking sheet. Use your fingers to reshape it as needed.

, Use a pastry brush to lightly coat the top and sides of the dough with olive oil. Use just enough oil for a light coating; do not drench the crust.


The oil should help the crust remain crisp even after you add the toppings.

, Ladle up to 1/4 cup (60 ml) of pizza sauce over the center of the dough. Use the back of the ladle to spread the sauce to the edges.


Ideally, you should leave 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) between the edge of the sauce and the edge of the pizza dough. Leaving a little space should prevent the sauce from bubbling over the edge of the pizza and making a mess., Spread your cheese over the sauce, followed by the prepared meats and vegetables. Finish by sprinkling the pizza with the chopped herbs.


Continue to leave 1/2-inch (1.25-cm) of the outer crust edge uncovered.
Add toppings sparingly. If you add too many, you run the risk of drowning out the flavors instead of allowing them to complement one another.

, Place the pizza in the oven and cook it 10 to 15 minutes, or until the cheese looks golden and the crust looks golden-brown.


Consider rotating the pizza after the first 5 to 7 minutes to ensure even browning.

, Remove the pizza from the oven and let it cool for several minutes. When it is cool enough to handle, slice it into serving portions and enjoy.

",How to Make Pizza Bianca," Mix the warm water, sugar and yeast in a bowl and allow the yeast to dissolve (about 2 minutes). Stir in the flour and salt until it forms a ball.


If making style no. 2, add the 1 tsp of oil to the dough.;
, It should be a moist, smooth ball of dough, however as flour absorbs moisture at different rates, you may wish to add a little more water or flour as required.

,, Place on the back of a biscuit/cookie tray or on a large flat plate.

,, Periodically scatter a little flour or fine cornmeal under the dough to prevent it sticking. Continue with the next two tablespoons until absorbed. Sprinkle with salt and rosemary.
Style 2: Spread the minced garlic and ricotta over the surface of the dough. Top with sliced mozzarella and sprinkle with a little salt if desired.

,, It does make it slightly easier to remove the stone onto the stove top. Avoid pulling the oven rack out as it may tip (unless you are not holding it steady with an oven mitt), then place the pizza and stone back into the oven. A pizza oven does not require this extra work.

Preheat your oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).,
Make your dough or buy it pre-made.,
Grease a baking sheet lightly.,
Add sauce.,
Add your toppings.,
Add your cheese.,
Pop the pizza into the oven and cook for 15 - 20 minutes or until brown.,
Take the pizza out of the oven, let rest, and enjoy.",How to Make Easy Pizza1," While your oven is heating, prepare the ingredients.
, Of course, using pre-made dough from a supermarket is about as easy as it gets, although you can make your own in a matter of minutes.








, You can use cooking spray, olive oil, or butter. Transfer the dough onto the baking sheet. You can also use a pizza stone or pizza sheet if you have one.









Some cooks like using cornmeal on the bottom of a baking sheet or pizza stone. Cornmeal helps the cooked pizza slide off the baking sheet or pizza stone easier. Plus, the cooked cornmeal adds a nice crunch to the dough.

, From here on out, the sky's the limit. You can spread a traditional pizza sauce, spread your pizza with pesto, or even try an Alfredo sauce on your pizza. You can choose any of these sauces from your local grocery store to speed up the pizza-making process. Spread as much sauce as you want, using a knife, spatula, or the back of a spoon.








If you are in a rush and don't have time to go out and buy a pre-made sauce or make your own, you can always use ingredients lying around the house. For instance, spread your pizza with simple tomato sauce. If you are in a real rush, you could even use ketchup.

, Again, anything is possible when it comes to the toppings. Stick to veggies if you’re a vegetarian, try every kind of meat if you’re not. Get wild and try some exotic items like artichoke hearts, pineapples, BBQ chicken, potatoes — try everything and anything. Make sure to cook any meat that needs to be cooked beforehand and wash any vegetables. Some traditional topics include:









Pepperoni
Olives
Sausage
Mushrooms
Bell peppers

, The traditional cheese topping is mozzarella, but you can try any cheese you like. Ricotta cheese works well on pizza, as does feta. If you want to get a little fancy, you can purchase fresh mozzarella, cut into large discs, and spread them evenly over the pizza to make a traditional Margarita pizza.









To speed up the process, buy pre-shredded cheese to help speed up the process. Shredded cheese, rather than thick slices of cheese, will melt more quickly, ensuring that you are eating your delicious pizza as soon as possible.

, Once you have loaded your pizza with all of the toppings you want, slide it into the oven. Let your pizza bake for 15 to 20 minutes or until the crust is a golden brown and all the cheese has melted.








Keep an eye on your pizza so that it doesn’t burn. In particular, burnt cheese can ruin a pizza. A slightly burnt crust, however, can be a tasty mistake.

, Once your pizza is golden brown, remove it from the heat. It's going to be very hot, so use caution. Place the pan on the stove top. As torturous as this will be, you have to let the pizza sit for at least a few minutes to let the doughy crust settle. Enjoy!








"
"
Use an alternate crust instead of dough.,
Slather on some pizza sauce, pasta sauce, or even ketchup onto the bread.,
Pile on all the toppings.,
Cover your toppings with as much cheese as you want.,
Cook the pizza in a toaster oven or improvise in the microwave.,
Enjoy your super-easy, phenomenally quick pizza.








",How to Make Easy Pizza2," The dough is great if you've got it, but let's face it — it's often a hassle to make, and it can be finicky to cook. If you want to reduce pizza down to it's most basic elements and don't mind cheating (or improvising) a bit, try using naan bread. Naan comes pre-cooked and makes for an excellent pizza base. If you don't have naan, try any of these options:









Pita bread
English muffins
A piece of toast
Tortillas

, If you've got it, pizza sauce works great. But pasta sauce tastes almost identical, and ketchup or barbecue sauce works in a pinch.








, For this super-easy pizza, think kitchen-leftovers. Start with a vegetable or two, like roasted bell peppers and sauteed mushrooms. Maybe add some pepperoni or salami. Top it off with a condiment like black olives. If you want to experiment with some other classic pizza combinations, here are some ideas:









Chicken breast, artichoke hearts, tomatoes, and black olives
Caramelized onions, sausage, and fennel
Walnuts, prosciutto, and blue cheese

, Mozzarella, asiago, and Parmesan make for a classic pizza taste, but any cheese will do.









If you're using a strong cheese like Gorgonzola or a crumbly cheese like feta, plan on adding a little bit less to your pizza. Too much of these cheese can overwhelm the pizza.

, For bread-based pizza crust like naan, a toaster oven is ideal. Toaster ovens take a shorter amount of time to heat up compared to ovens. Plan on toasting at medium high for 5 minutes to start and then check in every minute thereafter.









If you're not using pizza dough and you're really crunched for time, you can even cook your pizza in the microwave. Microwaves are excellent at getting the cheese and toppings piping hot, but be prepared for a soft, squishy crust, rather than a baked, crunchy crust. Plan on cooking for 2 minutes to start and then checking in every 30 seconds thereafter.

Turn the heat to medium and stir the fat a little until it melts. Take care to scrape the bottom of the pan so you incorporate any of the browned bits. This will also keep them from burning as the fat melts., Measure out 1 1/2 cups (187 g) of all-purpose flour. Slowly add a little of the flour at a time while you whisk the melted fat. This will prevent lumps from forming in the roux.Don't worry if the melted fat sizzles up a little as you add the flour. Continue to carefully whisk the roux.

, Turn the heat down to low. Keep cooking and stirring the roux so none of it sticks to the bottom of the pot. You'll need to cook and stir the roux for 30 to 45 minutes so it becomes dark in color. The roux should become a dark mahogany color. You can cool the roux and use it in your gumbo recipe.Don't worry if the roux looks thinner than traditional roux used for thickening. Roux for gumbo is meant to be thinner and more flavorful.
If you don't want to use the roux right away, you can store it in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to one week.

, Pour 4 tablespoons (55 g) of vegetable oil into a large pot and turn the heat on to medium-high. Get out 4 bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs and 2 bone-in, skin-on chicken breasts. Place the chicken in the hot oil so the skin-sides are down. Cook the chicken for 3 to 4 minutes. Use tongs to carefully turn them over and brown the other side for 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer the chicken to a platter.The chicken won't be completely cooked at this point; it will finish cooking as the gumbo simmers. Browning the chicken just adds flavor.

, Dice enough yellow onions, green bell peppers, and celery to equal 2 cups of each (300 g of onions, 350 g of green bell pepper, and 450 g of celery). Put the diced vegetables into the pot that the chicken browned in and turn the heat on to medium-high. Stir and cook the vegetables for about 5 minutes.The vegetables will soften and the onion should become clear.

Saute the mixture until the sausage is golden brown., Place the browned pieces of chicken back into the pot with the vegetable mixture. Pour in 1 cup (240 ml) of the chicken stock and stir it well. Scrape up the bottom so any browned bits are mixed in. Pour in the remaining 11 cups (2.6 liters) of chicken stock.The chicken pieces should be completely covered with the stock at this point. If you don't have enough stock, you could use some water.

, Stir 1 tablespoon of cayenne pepper and 1 1/2 cups (354 ml) of gumbo roux into the pot. Bring the gumbo to a boil. Turn the heat down to medium-low so the gumbo simmers. Put the lid on the pot and cook the gumbo for 1 hour., Carefully lift out the pieces of chicken and set them aside. Use a spoon to skim away any excess oil floating on top of the gumbo. Season the gumbo with salt and pepper and put the lid back on. Simmer the gumbo for 30 more minutes.If you want your gumbo thinner, you may need to stir in more stock or water.

, Take the lid off the pot and skim off any excess oil from the gumbo. Put the chicken pieces back in the pot and put the lid back on. Simmer the gumbo for 20 more minutes.If you prefer, you can remove the chicken meat from the bones and put the shredded chicken in the gumbo.

, Taste the gumbo and adjust the seasonings according to your taste. For example, you may want to add Cajun seasoning and hot sauce. Scoop some cooked, white rice into a serving bowl and spoon the gumbo over it. Garnish the gumbo with diced green onions and filé powder.You can store leftover gumbo in an airtight container in the refrigerator for several days. The flavor might actually improve over time as the flavors blend.

Toss you dough for a perfect, round crust if you feel confident.",How to Make Cheese Pizza1," Add your yeast and sugar to the water (it should feel warm to the touch, but not warm enough to burn you) and lightly stir it. Let it sit for 6-7 minutes, until you see small bubbles forming at the surface of the water.


Activating the yeast is feeding it -- it eats the sugar and drinks the water. The bubbles are carbon dioxide made when the yeast ""breathes."";
, Pour the flour in a little bit at a time, adding more as it absorbs the water and yeast. Use one hand to add the flour and the other to mix it.

, This keeps the dough from sticking to the bowl or your hands and keeps moisture in. Keep mixing until the dough is glossy and tacky, but not sticky. Pinch a small amount and stretch it thin enough so light passes through. If the dough doesn't rip, it's ready to kneed.

, With the dough still in the bowl, use one hand to gather the dough together, then press firmly into the center of the dough with the heel of your hand.


Fold the far edge of the dough upwards and towards you, press your hand in again, and repeat. Continue the ""press-fold-turn"" for 3-4 minutes, or until your dough holds its shape without you touching it.

If the dough is moist or sticky, sprinkle additional flour over the top and on your hands.

, If you need more time, you can put the dough in the refrigerator, where it takes 4-5 hours to rise. The dough will be roughly twice as big when it finishes rising as when it started.

, Sprinkle two or three tablespoons of flour on a cutting board out counter to prevent the dough from sticking. If you are making two smaller pizzas, cut the dough ball in half.

, Use your palm to push the dough ball into a disc, then use your fingers to push and pull the dough flat. This process takes some practice, but go slowly and use your fingers to massage the pizza into your desired crust shape. When done, fold 1/2 inch of the edge back over to create the crust.


Work from the center of the dough outward to avoid ripping the dough.

, While you can make great crusts without the famous ""pizza toss,"" there is something satisfying about prepping your crust like the experts.


Make a fist and drape the flattened dough over it.
Make a fist of the other hand and slip it under the dough next to your other fist.
Carefully move your fists apart stretching the dough more.
Shift your fists (left towards your face, right away) so the dough rotates while stretching.
When the dough has reached about 8 inches (20cm) in diameter, you can quickly move your left fist in an arc that goes backwards towards your face. Do this while twisting your right fist forward away from your face. If you give a a little push upwards with your right fist the dough will spin like a Frisbee. Practice how it feels to balance the force of the twists equally.
Be sure to catch the falling, dough as gently as you can by lowering your fists as the pizza falls.
If you notice that the dough is tearing, combine, kneed it again for 30 seconds, and start over.

, Heat the sauce so that large bubbles are breaking on the surface, then lower the heat to a simmer. Stir regularly.

, The longer the sauce simmers, the richer and thicker it will become.

, Many pizza sauces are sweeter, so some cooks add 1-2 tablespoons of sugar. Fresh basil or rosemary can also add new depths to a pizza sauce.

, Pour the cooled sauce into a food processor and puree it to remove any large chunks of tomato or onion. This step is not necessary if you want a more rustic pizza in the end.

, While red sauce is the ""classic,"" there are lots of other ways to top a cheese pizza. Try a white sauce, or simply sautee 2-3 cloves of garlic in 2 tablespoons of olive oil and use the oil instead of sauce for garlic cheese pizza.

If it is hard to spread, use your hand to sprinkle the onion right on top. Make sure you sprinkle all around, all the slices need to have red onion on it. If desired, sprinkle the cilantro on top as well.

, The most important and thrilling ingredient of all for this pizza, the shrimp! Unlike the other ingredients, you can't sprinkle or spread the shrimp around the pizza. In order to have nearly each slice get a piece of shrimp you'll need to go one-by-one, placing each shrimp piece on each slice. Not all the slices will get a piece of shrimp so don't panic. Just try your very best.

, Place the pizza in the oven and have it bake until the crust is golden brown and the cheese has melted. Usually that takes about ten minutes but all ovens vary.

, Remove the pizza from the oven and have it cool on the pizza or baking stone until warm enough to serve.

Pick chunky or smooth.,
Read the label and look at the ingredients.,
Avoid “reduced fat” peanut butter.,
Consider grinding your own.,
Consider other nut butters.,
Try mixed peanut butters.",How to Eat Peanut Butter1," Just like there are Elvis people and Beatles people, there are two kinds of people in the world: smooth eaters and chunky eaters. The biggest and most important peanut butter decision is also the most fun. Do you like crunchy, chunky peanut butter, or smooth and creamy? There is no wrong answer.


Some studies show that, in the United States, women who live on the East Coast will gravitate toward smooth peanut butter, while male Californians and other West Coasters will more often pick chunky. Go figure.;
, Good peanut butter should only have two ingredients: peanuts, salt, and possibly a sweetener like honey or sugar. If you see added hydrogenated oils, steer clear. Natural peanut butter is more expensive because it contains the peanut oil, which will settle on the top of the jar and need to be stirred in before use.


The most valuable product of the peanut is in the oil, which large food companies will extract from the peanuts ground into peanut butter, and then replace with sunflower oil. So, while it seems like you’re getting whole ground-up peanuts in a jar of Skippy or Jif, you’re really getting peanuts and the oil of other, cheaper nuts.

, While it might seem like a healthier alternative, peanut butters that are advertised as ""reduced fat"" usually include more hydrogenated oils and more sugars, but the same amount of calories, to account for the loss of fat. Essentially used as a marketing scheme, this ploy ignores the fact that healthy fats from natural peanut butter are more effective as sources of fats. Reduced fat peanut butter replaces mono saturated ""healthy"" fats with refined sugars and carbohydrates, causing blood sugar spikes. It's not good for you., If you’re a particular peanut butter eater, you might enjoy mixing up your own batches and perfecting your recipe. Pick nuts you like the taste of, grind them in a food processor, and add a small amount of honey or salt, to taste. As you grind, you might need to add a little oil to aid in the process. You can control the consistency and the flavor and make the kind of peanut butter you like.


Remove the skins before grinding your peanuts on a high setting, adding oil as necessary. Use whatever peanuts you like to eat: Valencias, Virginias, Spanish peanuts, and Runners are all perfect for making peanut butter. Some prefer Spanish peanuts, because they have a slightly higher oil content. Raw peanuts can be used to make peanut butter, which will taste a little different than the more popular roasted variety. Try out honey-roasted peanuts for a special treat.
You can also grind your own peanut butter at most natural food stores automatically. Like grinding coffee, these grinders will work quickly at the flick of a switch and give you freshly-ground peanut butter. It's pretty much the best and the easiest way to get it. Find one close to you and give it a try.

, Peanut butter is the classic stand-by, but if you're looking to spice it up a bit, you can experiment with other more exotic nut butters to throw a little variety into the mix. They're typically more expensive, but feature completely different flavors than the traditional peanut butter. Commonly available spread and butters are made from:


Almond
Cashew
Sunflower seed
Hazelnut
Peanuts are ground nuts, or legumes, meaning that if you’ve got a peanut allergy, you might be fine with tree nuts, depending on the severity of your allergy. Find out if some of these alternatives might be more right for you. , Why buy the jelly separately? You can also get peanut butter with mix-ins already included. Swirled grape jelly? Nutella? Marshmallow fluff? It's almost too good to be true. While these mixes sometimes have a slightly grainier texture than smooth peanut butter, if you're a fan of chunky, this can be a fun alternative, especially for kids.

Spread peanut butter on toast.,
Spread peanut butter on fruit.,
Add peanut butter to smoothies and oatmeal for added protein.,
Make “ants on a log.” The classic kids' snack is just as great for adults.,
Go straight from the jar.",How to Eat Peanut Butter2," A complete breakfast, as fast as it is nutritious, includes a slice of whole grain toast and tablespoon or two of peanut butter. Warm toast, English muffins, or pancakes make peanut butter warm, gooey, and totally delicious, as well as healthy. Starting the day with protein can help you stay focused and energetic throughout the morning, kickstarting your metabolism and giving you the fuel to get going. It's a great snack.


A serving of peanut butter is usually two tablespoons, which contains between 180 and 190 calories, and just under 8 grams of protein, as well as 7-10 percent of necessary daily dietary fiber. Peanut butter is good for building strong tissues and boosting immunity.

, Starting your day with a serving of fruit like apples or bananas is a great way to get your metabolism going, but adding a serving of peanut butter–or dipping that serving right out of the jar–is a great way of taking that breakfast from good to great. By supplementing the protein from the peanut butter, those fruits become a complete breakfast, rather than just a quick snack. Full of fiber, vitamins, and protein, it's hard to think of a quicker, tastier, or more simple way to breakfast.

, Other breakfast items are perfectly amenable to the addition of peanut butter for thickening and adding a salty-sweet flavor underneath. Add a spoonful to cooked oatmeal to liven up the flavor without adding sugar, or use it to thicken a breakfast smoothie.


For a simple nutritious smoothie, add a half cup of plain greek yoghurt to your blender, one banana, a cup of fresh or frozen berries, and a tablespoon of peanut butter. Pulse the blender to mix thoroughly. If you like it a bit sweeter, you can add some honey to taste, as well as supplements like whey powder or spirulina. If it's too dense, a little orange juice or milk thins it out nicely.

, Line a tablespoon or two of peanut butter along the groove of a celery stick, then top with raisins. This fun treat makes for a surprising texture combo that almost everyone loves. This is a great and healthy way to get kids to eat fresh vegetables, if they're unwilling.

, Why waste time putting peanut butter on something? Or dishes? College students everywhere know one thing for sure: spoonfuls of peanut butter are perfect substitutes to actual meals. There are a lot worse things you could eat in a pinch than a couple spoonfuls of peanut butter, alternated with jelly.

From professional cyclists to lazy bachelors, peanut butter and jelly sandwiches might be one of the great equalizers of western civilization. It's just about perfect. Within that perfection, though, there's a great amount of variety and options, making it both simple and limitless.


The Classic starts with two slices of white sandwich bread. Spread a thin layer of peanut butter on each slice, then a thin layer of grape jelly on one side of the peanut butter. Lay the other slice of bread, peanut butter side down, onto the jelly side, keeping the jelly from soaking into the bread. Cut in half and enjoy with milk.

, Start with two slices of toasted whole-grain seeded bread. Spread a thin layer of chunky, all-natural peanut butter on both slices.

, Start with your favorite plain sandwich bread, the whiter the better. Spread smooth peanut butter on one side and marshmallow fluff on the other. Popular throughout New England, this is the unofficial state sandwich of Massachusetts. Serve this with a cup of spicy hot chocolate. Step aside, lobster roll.

, Ready to get weird? Spread chunky peanut butter on your favorite sandwich bread, then spread red chili sauce like Sriracha on one side, to taste. Crunch BBQ potato chips, or another chip you like better, on top of that. Serve with a PBR. Don't tell your mom.

, The king of rock 'n rolls favorite sandwich was as epic as he was. Start with a whole Italian sub roll and scoop the inside out.

The ingredients are basic pantry items that you can keep on hand to whip up a quick Thai dinner on the cheap.


Mix 2-3 tablespoons of your favorite peanut butter in a bowl with about a tablespoon of brown sugar, a teaspoon each of soy sauce, sesame seed oil, rice vinegar, and grated ginger, and sweet chili sauce to taste. Stir in a small amount of boiling water to thin the sauce to a consistency you like, adding more if necessary. Taste and adjust the spices to your taste. Serve on noodles or stir fry, topped with chopped peanuts, green onion, and cilantro.

, If you’ve got some leftover peanut sauce, a great use for it can be to mix up a cool-spicy coleslaw with shredded cabbage, carrots, bell pepper, green onion, cilantro, and chopped peanuts., While Americans like to claim peanut butter, the use of the peanut in African cuisine predates the use of peanuts in the Americas by hundreds of years. One of the most famous iterations and uses of groundnuts like the peanut is a spicy and aromatic broth flavored with peanuts and meat. It's delicious and simple to prepare.To make your own version, bring a whole chopped 3 lb. roaster chicken to boil in a pot with chicken stock, onion, garlic, two chopped tomatoes, and black pepper. When it boils, reduce to a simmer. In a skillet, gently heat a few tablespoons of chunky peanut butter with some hot water to thin it out and create a sauce. Season with red chili paste, ground ginger, brown sugar, and soy sauce to taste. When the oil starts to release from the peanut sauce, add it to the stock pot with the chicken and the vegetables. Let cook for 30 minutes.

, A fun treat for school lunches or after-school snacks can be making up some simple sushi rolls with sandwich bread, fruit, and peanut butter.Start with one piece of sandwich bread, spread with a thin layer of smooth peanut butter. On one edge, line thin slices of apple, pear, carrot, or other fruits parallel with the edge of the bread. Roll it up tightly, then slice up each roll as you would a sushi roll. Spread them out on a plate and serve them with caramel sauce instead of soy. The kids will love it.

, Of course, there's no better use for peanut butter than with sweet deserts. The perfect compliment for rich chocolate cakes and pies, peanut butter is as versatile for after dinner treats and it is for breakfast. Here are some classic peanut butter-based deserts:

You may also want to grab some butter, as butter can enhance the flavor of the sandwich. There are lots of different kinds of bread and spreads to choose from, so you'll have to do a little experimenting to know what you like.


Lots of types of peanut butter come with lots of added sugar and partially hydrogenated oils that are bad for your health. If you're looking for a healthier option, try an organic peanut butter. Natural peanut butter may have a layer of oil on top, but if you carefully stir it in when you open in the jar and then keep the jar of peanut butter in the refrigerator, the oil will not separate out again.
There are lots and lots of flavors for jellies and jams. The two most commonly used are grape and strawberry. However, you could branch out to a sharper taste like raspberry, or a mixture of several different kinds.
For you bread you'll probably want something that doesn't overwhelm your other flavors (like a rye or sourdough), so you'll probably want to go for plain whole wheat or white.;
, You'll decide how much peanut butter you want, but if you're going to be taking the sandwich somewhere, you'll probably want to do a little light on the peanut butter, otherwise it will get everywhere before you get to eat it.


Stir your peanut butter beforehand to soften it and make it easier to spread on the bread slice. Another tip for spreading peanut butter, especially the kind with peanuts in it, is to put some of the peanut butter in a bowl and microwave it on high for about 20 seconds. It will spread on the bread like soft butter.
If you do use butter, you'll put the butter on the same slice of bread as the peanut butter, before you put the peanut butter on.

, You'll want to use a teaspoon or knife. Again, unless you're going to be eating it right there, and you really like jelly, try to avoid overwhelming your sandwich with jam.

, To avoid having the peanut butter and jam run everywhere, do this quickly. A good way is to take both slices at the same time and quickly press them together.

, The best way to cut the sandwich is diagonal, from one corner to another, giving you two triangle shaped pieces. Otherwise, you can cut directly across the sandwich, leaving you with two rectangular shaped pieces.

, Just make sure that you wash your hands afterwards, because you'll be certain to get the gooey mixture of peanut butter and jelly on them.

, Make your sandwich a little more interesting by adding things like granola, pretzels, or Ritz crackers. The added benefit of granola is that it gives you more fiber and nutrients and is a healthier option.

, There are lots of different sweet things you can add to your sandwich, like syrup (especially maple syrup), a cut up banana, some honey, brown sugar, or different kinds of berries (blueberries, pomegranate seeds, etc).

, This will give your sandwich a little more crunch and a little more taste. It is also helpful when spreading peanut butter, because it doesn't tear as easily as regular bread.You could also try using biscuits instead of bread, because the peanut butter and jelly would spread really nicely and there would be a little different taste.

, You'll need 2 slices of bread, 1 egg, 2 tablespoons milk, some cinnamon, some brown sugar, and the peanut butter and jelly.Mix together cinnamon, egg, milk, and brown sugar. Dip your slices of bread into the mixture, making sure you don't coat it too much. Put bread in skillet and cook for a couple of minutes. Flip the bread and cook a couple more minutes. Remove from skillet and spread with peanut butter and jelly and return to skillet, cooking for about a minute on medium heat. Put on plate, cut in half, and eat!

, Whip up some homemade banana bread and spread it with your usual peanut butter and jelly. This a delicious treat and gives you the benefit of the bananas with the bonus of the sweetness of cake.

Bouillabaisse is a traditional Provence recipe and is flavored by whatever seafood and vegetables are readily available that day., While the exact origins of the name are lost to time, this stew is thought be a ""chip in"" pot of all the seafood caught that day in the harbor. Each fisherman would add his share and everyone would savor the stew together. Add tomato juice to the basic recipe to create cioppino., Fanesca is traditionally made during Easter and differs greatly from the others because it uses dried, salted cod that has been soaked overnight before cooking. In addition, beans such as cannellini, fava, lima and garbanzo are added to this complex mix of flavors. The other key ingredient is potatoes, particularly of a starchy variety, which gives the stew a more mild taste., This stew uses no shellfish, but starts with an entire white fish – head, tail, bones and all – that has been boiled to make the base stock. Other fish fillets are added later in the process with a helping of tomatoes and spices., This salmon-based stew uses only one fish that is flavored with dill, onions and lots of cream and butter for a thick and rich taste. This is a very common dish throughout the Nordic region., This fish and vegetable stew is thickened with cream and egg yolks. Many Belgians debate whether or not it should contain a variety of fish, or only Belgian perch. The dish can also be made with chicken, which is another staple of the Belgian diet."

, After you’ve cooked the leek and garlic mixture briefly, add a pinch cayenne pepper and the pound (454 g) of large fresh shrimp that’s been peeled and deveined to the pot. Cook the mixture on medium-low for 5 minutes.Stir the shrimp mixture occasionally as it’s cooking to ensure that it heats evenly.

, When the shrimp mixture has cooked for several minutes, pour ¼ cup (59 ml) of brandy into the pot and allow the mixture to cook for 1 minute. Next, add ¼ cup (59 ml) of dry sherry and cook the mixture for another 3 minutes.Any brandy will work for the bisque, but Cognac is a particularly good option.

, After the brandy and sherry have cooked off, remove the pot from the stove. Add the shrimp mixture to a food processor that’s fitted with a steel blade, and process it until it forms a coarse puree. Set aside for the moment.Depending on the size of your food processor, you may need to process the shrimp mixture in batches.
If you don’t have a food processor, you can use a blender or immersion blender to puree the shrimp mixture.

, Add 4 tablespoons (57 g) of unsalted butter to the same pot or Dutch oven that you cooked the shrimp mixture in. Turn the heat back up to medium, and allow the butter to melt, which should take 5 to 7 minutes.There’s no need to clean the pot or Dutch oven before adding the butter. You want the flavors from the shrimp mixture to help season it.

, Once the butter has melted, add ¼ cup (31 g) of all-purpose flour to the pot. Cook the mixture on medium-low for 1 minute to get rid of the raw flour taste.Make sure to stir the butter and flour mixture constantly with a wooden spoon as it cooks to ensure that it heats evenly.

, After you’ve cooked the butter and flour for a minute, pour 2 cups (475 ml) of half-and-half into the pot. Blend the ingredients together with a whisk, and cook the mixture until it thickens, which should take approximately 3 minutes.Whisk constantly as the mixture heats so none of it burns.

, When the butter, flour, and half-and-half mixture has thickened, add the shrimp puree, shrimp stock, ⅓ cup (75 g) of tomato paste, 2 teaspoons (12 g) of kosher salt, and 1 teaspoon (2 g) of freshly ground black pepper to the pot. Stir well, and turn the heat up to medium-high. Heat the bisque until it is hot but not boiling, which should take approximately 3 to 5 minutes.You can adjust the amounts of salt and pepper to suit your preferences. It helps to taste the bisque to determine how much seasoning it needs.

, When the bisque is hot, remove it from the heat. Use a ladle to transfer it to warmed bowls and serve immediately.You can garnish the bisque with chopped parsley if you like.
Store any leftover shrimp bisque in the refrigerator after it’s cooled. It should keep for 3 to 4 days.

Stir in the oyster liquid and milk slowly, bringing to a simmer for 3-4 minutes.,
Stir in salt, pepper, and any desired seasonings while the liquid simmers.,
Add the oysters to the simmering liquid, along with garlic and parsley if using.,
Cook for 3-4 minutes, or until the oysters curl and remove from heat.,
Stir in an extra 1-2 tablespoons of butter for a richer, heartier stew.,
Serve garnished with parsley, sliced green onions, or oyster crackers.",How to Make Oyster Stew1," If you're using onions/shallots, celery, or garlic, chop it up ahead of time to make the cook time easier. For the oysters, you want to prepare them now so that you can add them quickly when needed.Pre-shucked oysters are a good call if you can verify they are relatively fresh by asking the fishmonger. Cooked oysters lose much of the ""fresh"" flavor anyway, so don't feel like you must shuck them yourself. They are sold at the fish counter.;
, Turn the heat to medium and stir the butter around until just melted. Use a large, deep pan-- you'll need something to contain all the liquid for the stew., Do not let the flour simply sit -- use a whisk or wooden spoon to keep it moving, breaking up any clumps as they form. If you have a flat whisk, use this. The flour should start to take on a slightly caramel color as it cooks and darkens.

This is the base of a roux., These ingredients, which form the base of so many soups, stews, and sauces, are called ""aromatics."" As they cook, they will impart a rich, savory sweetness to the stew, but they are not strictly necessary. Stir and cook for 2 minutes., Add the first third or so of liquid, stirring continually as you do. Adding slowly lets the roux incorporate the cold liquid easily, which prevents ""breaking."" Use your spoon or whisk to break up anything stuck to the bottom of the pan once the liquid hits, then let the heats slow rise until there are bubbles rising to the surface., Sample the liquid as you season it, making sure it tastes to your liking. If you like spicy food, a dash of cayenne, Tobasco, and/or fresh black pepper will make a delicious, but subtle heat., The important ingredients here are the oysters. Simply toss them in, without the shells, and stir them into the liquid as it returns to a simmer., You do not want to overcook the oysters, which will make them tough and unappetizing. Once the edges start to curl up, cut the heat and start serving. If you're not ready to serve just yet, leave the pot on low, but know you should aim to serve shortly., While not strictly necessary, this extra pat of butter adds a rich, creamy sheen to the top of the stew that sticks to the oysters as you eat them, giving them a rich coating and flavor., This stew is best right off the stove, garnished with a light, refreshing bite of greenery or the crunch of a good oyster cracker. Enjoy!

Only buy fresh oysters if they are closed tight, or close immediately when touched.,
Purchase an oyster knife: a thick, dull-pointed blade for shucking.,
Rinse and scrub all the closed oysters under cold water.,
Set up an ice bath by filling a large bowl with ice and water and nesting a smaller bowl inside of it.,
Find the bottom of the oyster and place it on a small towel.,
Using half of the towel, cover up all of the oyster but the hinge.,
Poke the tip of your knife into the hinge, searching for a place you can easily pry the shell apart.,
Twist and pry the knife to lift the shells apart, prying until they ""pop."",
Turn the knife perpendicular to the oyster to pop it open even more.,
Cut along the flat top shell to completely open the oyster up.,
Dump the liquid and oyster in your cool bowl, toss the shell out, and repeat.",How to Make Oyster Stew2," If the oyster is open and doesn't close when tapped on the shell, do not buy it. To test closed oysters, knock two of them against each other -- if they sound hollow, don't buy them, as they've already died. Fresh oysters should feel heavy and full with water, and dead oysters will be light and empty.Fresh oysters should smell like a sea breeze. If they are fishy or odd smelling, don't buy them.
If you need to store oysters, cover with a damp cloth in the fridge. Do not cover or seal with plastic wrap -- oysters are living creatures and cannot be suffocated!, While you can use any knife, chances are good you'll break them beyond repair if you aren't careful. A dedicated oyster knife is, by far, the most efficient way to proceed., Be sure to really get in there, scrubbing away any excess dirt and sand. When done, leave them in cold water as you shuck, keeping them cool as you work.

Note that, while this cold water will drown the oysters, you are about to cook them. As long as you are shucking right before cooking, it will be fine.

, This allows you to drop the oysters, along with their desired liquids, into a cooled area while you work. Shucking takes some time, and you do not want your shucked oysters to go bad while you're at work on the other ones., Look lengthwise across the shell. You should see where the two halves meet, with one shell is relatively flat and the other has a rounded belly. The rounded half is the bottom of your oyster. It can be hard to find on some oysters, but some practice will make it apparent., The hinge is where the two shells meet. Position the towel so that the hinge faces your dominant (cutting) hand. You want the oyster in the towel like a hotdog in a bun. This towel will protect the hand holding the oyster down and keep things from sliding as you cut., You are not trying to drive the point into the oyster. You're just trying to get a ""foothold"" in the hinge, which will allow you to use the knife to pry the shell apart. It can take some time to find this sweet spot, but all oysters have them., Again, this isn't brute force -- you're not jamming the knife into the shell so much as using it to create space between the two shells. Keep working the knife up, down, and around until you feel the oyster yield and pop., Once you've got the oyster started, push the knife slightly further in and twist 45-degrees until the wide part of the blade prying the shells open. When done, whip your knife off on the towel to remove any extra mud or dirt stuck in the hinge., Keep the belly of the oyster flat on the towel to ensure none of the liquid drips out. This cut severs the muscle keeping the oyster closed. Simply cut across, using the top shell as your guide. The oyster, tucked safely in the belly, will await with its liquids as long as you keep it steady.

If, upon opening, you smell a fishy smell from the oysters, toss them out., Use your knife to pry the oyster out of the bottom shell, juices and all. Check to make sure no bits of shell flaked off into the oyster meat, then simply dump everyone into your bowl and keep shucking. If you find a tiny little crab in the oyster, just toss it out -- these little oyster crabs won't affect the final flavor or freshness of the oyster."

Serve with the remaining lobster meat.",How to Make Lobster Bisque," Carefully cut through the shell of each lobster tail using kitchen shears. Separate the tail in half lengthwise, dividing both the shell and the meat.


If you're using frozen lobster tails, you'll need to thaw the tails completely before beginning.
You'll likely need to cut through the top shell first, followed by the bottom shell. Cut through the lobster meat after splitting the shell, following the edge of the divided shell. The lobster meat should remain in the shell after you finish cutting the tails in half.
If you notice a large vein in the tail, remove that vein before continuing to the next step.;
, Pour 2 cups (500 ml) of water into a stockpot. Set it on the stove over medium-high heat, then reduce the heat to medium once the water begins to simmer.


As soon as the water simmers, add the salt, which should help draw out the flavor of the lobster tails.

, Place the tails shell-side down inside the steaming basket, then set the basket over the pot of simmering stock. Cover and cook for 5 to 7 minutes.Steam the lobster tails until they're cooked through. The shells should be bright red, and the meat should feel firm and look opaque.

, Use tongs to remove the lobster tails from the steamer basket and set them onto a separate plate. After cooling them for several minutes, dig the meat out of the shells.


Set aside the lobster meat until later, keeping it in the refrigerator so that it does not spoil.
Do not drain the water. This liquid actually absorbs some of the lobster flavor during the steaming process, so you'll actually benefit from adding it to the soup broth later on.

, Place 2 Tbsp (30 ml) of butter into a large stockpot or Dutch oven. Set it on the stove over medium-high heat and allow the butter to melt.


Once the butter melts, carefully turn the pan so that the butter can coat the entire bottom evenly.
Note that butter gives the soup a richer flavor, but if desired, you could use olive oil instead. Simply heat the oil until it glistens.

, Place the empty shells on the cutting board, insides-down. Using the heel of the hand or the flat side of a large kitchen knife, press down on the shells until they crack and become mostly flat.


By flattening the shells, you guarantee that more of the surface will touch the pan when you saute them in the next step.

, Place the shells in the melted butter and cook, stirring frequently, for 3 to 5 minutes.While you can technically use the shells without cooking them in butter, taking the time to perform this extra step draws more flavor out of them, which will also improve the flavor of the finished soup.

, Toss the shallots, celery, and garlic into the stockpot with the lobster. Continue to cook, stirring frequently, for another 2 minutes.


Both the garlic and shallots should become notably more fragrant. The garlic should turn a light golden brown, but the shallots should look slightly translucent.

, Pour the dry white wine into the stockpot. Stir it into the existing ingredients, scraping the bottom of the pan with the spoon as you do.


Deglazing the stockpot lifts off any bits of food that have stuck to the bottom of the pan while cooking. These deglazed bits can make the taste of the dish deeper and more complex.

, Add the tomato paste, undrained diced tomatoes, brandy, stock, and reserved steaming water to the stockpot. Sprinkle in the thyme, paprika, cayenne pepper, and bay leaf. Stir well to combine.


The paprika and cayenne pepper give the lobster bisque a slight kick. If you prefer a milder taste, reduce the amount of omit these two ingredients altogether.

, Bring the soup base to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium-low. Simmer the contents of the stockpot for 30 minutes.


Leave the stockpot uncovered during this time. Stir the base occasionally, and adjust the heat as needed to keep the soup at a steady simmer.

, Add the remaining 2 Tbsp (30 ml) of butter to a separate skillet. Place the pan on the stove over medium-high heat, and allow the butter to melt and coat the bottom of the pan.


Try to time this step so that the lobster meat is ready once the soup base is ready. Typically, you should melt this butter when the base only has roughly 10 minutes left of simmering time.

, Cut the reserved lobster meat into large chunks, then toss it into the hot butter. Cook, stirring frequently, for about 3 to 5 minutes or until the meat becomes lightly browned.


Separate the meat after you finish cooking it. Reserve four large chunks for the garnish, and prepare the rest for use in the soup itself.

, Pour the simmered soup base through a large, fine mesh sieve. Immediately return the liquid to the stockpot.


Fish through the solid ingredients and remove the bay leaf. Keep the rest of the solids.

, Toss the remaining soup solids and the soup portion of the lobster meat into a large blender. Puree the mixture until it becomes smooth.While it may seem unusual if you've never done it before, you should include the shells in this puree. Most of the shells will be blended down, and any chunks that remain will be strained out later.

, Add the puree back to the soup, mixing well to combine. Simmer the soup for another 10 to 15 minutes.

, Line the sieve with cheesecloth, then pour the soup through. Return the liquid to the stockpot and discard the remaining solids.


To get as much liquid out as possible, press down on the solids with the back of the mixing spoon, squeezing the liquid out through the cheesecloth and sieve as you do.

, Stir the heavy cream and half-and-half into the soup. Bring the soup to a gentle simmer over medium-low heat.


Note that it'll be easiest to add the dairy if you previously warm it to room temperature or slightly higher. If you use cold dairy, it may curdle once you add it to the hot soup.

, In a separate small bowl, whisk together 2 Tbsp (30 ml) of cold water and the tapioca flour or cornstarch. Continue mixing until a smooth slurry forms.


The cornstarch slurry acts as a thickener for the soup. Traditional lobster bisque actually uses uncooked rice, and some recipes call for a flour-based roux. Cornstarch slurries are easy to work with, however, and give the finished soup a smooth texture and a shiny appearance.

, Add the cornstarch slurry to the soup, stirring to combine. Cook the soup for another 2 or 3 minutes, or until it thickens.

, Ladle the finished soup into individual serving bowls. Garnish each bowl with a piece of the reserved lobster meat, and enjoy!


The soup is best served warm and can be enjoyed immediately, but if you want to increase the flavor even more, refrigerate the soup overnight and reheat it on the stove the following day."

Look over the clams before you cook them. If any of the shells are open while they are still raw, discard those; this means they are not fresh.
Some types of clams may take a little longer to cook. Gauge whether they are ready by checking their shells.;
, Bring 2 cups of water to a boil in a large soup pot or dutch oven. Add the clams and place a lid on the pot. Cook the clams for 5 minutes, uncover the pot and stir the clams, then replace the lid and cook for another 5 minutes. The clams are finished cooking when their shells are open.

, Remove the clams from the pot and set them aside in a bowl. Strain the broth that is left behind through a piece of cheesecloth or a fine-mesh strainer to remove any last bits of sand. You should be left with at least 2 1/2 cups of clam broth. If you need more, add water to bring it to that quantity.

, When the clams are cool, take them out of their shells. Lay them on a cutting board and roughly chop them until they are bite-sized. Set them aside to add to the chowder later.

, Place a large stockpot over medium high heat. Add the bacon pieces and cook until the fat is rendered and the bacon is crisp. Remove the bacon from the pot and set it aside. Remove all but 2 tablespoons of bacon fat from the pot.

, Reduce the heat under the stockpot to medium. Add the onions to the pot and cook until they are translucent, about five minutes. Sprinkle the flour over the onions and cook for one minute more, stirring so that the onions are coated in flour.

, Pour the broth over the onions. Stir the mixture with a wooden spoon. Increase the heat to medium high and let the broth come to a boil.

, Put the thyme, bay leaf, and potatoes in the pot, and bring the soup back to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium, cover the pot, and let the soup simmer until the potatoes are soft, about 1/2 hour.

, Stir the ingredients into the mixture. Cover the pot again and let the chowder heat to a simmer.

, Taste the soup to determine whether it needs salt and pepper, and add a few pinches until it reaches the level of saltiness and spice you desire.

, Remove the pot from heat, cover, and let the chowder rest for about 1/2 an hour. This gives the flavors time to completely meld without overcooking the vegetables or clams. Covering it with a lid will keep it hot enough to serve.

, Ladle the chowder into bowls. Serve with oyster crackers and traditional New England condiments like Tabasco sauce and Worcestershire sauce."

Add the flat-leaf parsley, thyme, Mexican oregano, 1/2 a medium onion, 2 carrots, 2 cloves of garlic, and 2 stalks of celery. Place the saucepan on the stove and heat on high until the water boils., Stir these new ingredients into the mixture. Allow the contents of the saucepan to reach a rolling boil again before reducing the heat to medium-low.


If possible, use bones from lean fish, like bass or cod, and avoid oily fish, like salmon.

, With the liquid barely at a simmer, allow the stock to cook uncovered for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.


During this time, the flavors should blend together, creating a more flavorful stock. If you want the flavor to be even stronger, you can simmer the broth up to 40 minutes. Never let it return to a boil after its initial simmer, however, since fish stock can quickly become cloudy if it gets too hot or cooks for too long.

, Pour the contents of the saucepan through a large, heavy strainer or colander. Reserve the liquid for use as stock in your caldo de camaron recipe. Discard the solid ingredients, including the vegetables and fish bones.


If necessary, remove the fish bones by hand before straining the rest of the liquid. Fish bones can sometimes get caught in the holes of a strainer, clogging them up and preventing the liquid from flowing through readily.
Note that this stock can be prepared in advance. If you opt to make the stock before you prepare the rest of the soup, pour the finished stock into an airtight container and refrigerate it for up to four days.

, Place the dried shrimp in a medium stockpot and cover them with cold water. Allow the shrimp to sit for 15 minutes.When done, drain the water through a colander and rinse the shrimp.
Return the drained and rinsed shrimp to the stockpot.
This step is important if you are using dried shrimp or other packaged shrimp. Soaking and rinsing the shrimp before cooking it can help remove any distortions in taste that may have developed during the packaging process.

, Cover the shrimp with 1 cup (250 ml) of cold water, or enough water to cover them completely. Bring the contents of the pot to a boil on medium-high heat, then reduce the heat to medium and let the shrimp gently simmer for 5 to 10 minutes.

, Pour the contents of the stockpot through a colander. Reserve both the shrimp and liquid, but set them aside separately.


The water in which you boiled the shrimp has been flavored with the taste of shrimp. You will add this to your stock just before you finish the soup for an added hint of shrimp in the taste of the broth.

, Allow the shrimp to cool until you can safely handle them with your hands. Peel off the heads, tails, and legs before setting the cooked shrimp aside.


You can yank out the legs and head with your fingers. Similarly, you can pinch the tail and gently pull it off the body using only your fingers.
You can remove the shells if desired, but you could also leave the shells on if you want the soup to have a little crunch to it. If you want to peel the shrimp, however, pinch the shell between your fingers starting at the head end of the shrimp. Pull the shell down and off the body of the shrimp using gentle pressure.

, Use a knife to cut out the stems and ribs, removing the seeds along with them in the process.


Work carefully. Use food-grade plastic gloves to handle the chiles if you want to avoid getting any of the hot juice on your hands, since the chiles could cause mild skin irritation.
Wash your hands well after handling the chiles. Do not touch your eyes before washing your hands, since doing so will cause your eyes to burn.

, Heat a large, dry skillet on medium-high for 2 minutes. Place the chiles on the skillet and toast, 10 to 15 seconds, before flipping them over to the other side and toasting another 10 seconds.


Turn the chiles using tongs.
The chiles should brown to the point of charring on both sides. You do not want the entire side to blacken, though. Ideally, the chiles should only be exposed to the heat long enough for a few dark brown spots to develop.

, Place the tomatoes, garlic, and remaining onion half in the skillet along with the chiles. Cover with water, and let simmer on medium heat for 10 minutes.


Stir the contents of the pan occasionally to prevent them from sticking to the bottom of the skillet.

, Transfer the contents of the pan to a blender or food processor. Puree the ingredients together on high speed until a thin sauce forms.


If you have a handheld electric blender, you could use that instead of a standing blender or food processor. No matter what tool you use, though, try to make the sauce as smooth and thoroughly blended as possible.

, Add the oil to a large stockpot and let it heat for a minute or so on medium temperature.


The oil does not need to be sizzling hot, but it should be warm enough to spread over the bottom of the pot evenly as you turn and rotate the dish.

, Allow the sauce the simmer uncovered for 8 to 10 minutes. It should become thicker during this time.


Use the rounded bottom of a ladle to smooth the sauce over the oil in an even layer.
Keep the stockpot uncovered during this time. By keeping the stockpot uncovered, you allow more of the liquid to evaporate, thus causing the sauce to thicken. If you cover the stockpot, though, the liquid stays trapped inside, and the sauce will stay thin.

, Pour the liquid you reserved upon straining the shrimp into the stockpot. Mix well to combine it with the sauce and cook for an additional 2 minutes, or until the liquid starts to simmer gently.

, Pour in the fish stock, then add the potatoes, carrots, and shrimp. Simmer on medium-high heat for 10 minutes, or until the potatoes and carrots are just barely soft enough to pierce with a fork.


To ensure that your soup cooks well enough within these 10 minutes, cut your carrot slices and potato cubes into pieces that are bite-size to half-bite-size. If you make these pieces any larger, they may take longer to cook. Cooking the soup for much longer than 10 to 15 minutes, however, can result in overcooked shrimp and overly thickened broth.

, The caldo de camaron is done. Ladle the hot soup into individual serving bowls and garnish each serving with chopped avocado, chopped red onion, fresh chopped cilantro, and a squeeze of fresh juice from a lime wedge.Store any leftover soup in the refrigerator or freezer.It should last for 3 days in the refrigerator or up to 1 month in the freezer. To successfully store the soup:

Fill your sink with cold water and add a tray or two of ice. Dunk the bottom of the soup pot in the water to cool the leftover soup quickly.
Pour the extra soup in the freezer-safe plastic bags. Label each bag with the contents and current date.
Place the bags in your refrigerator to cool or lay them flat in your freezer. Freeze them in a single layer initially, and stack the bags in your freezer once the soup has frozen solid.
Thaw frozen soup overnight in the refrigerator. Reheat the soup over low to medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, before serving.

, This will be more than enough for your chicken. You can save the rest of the spice mixture for another recipe, or use it in your soup.

, Be sure to coat both sides of the chicken evenly.

, Place the chicken breasts onto a roasting pan or into a casserole dish. Bake the chicken until it is well-done. Do not undercook the chicken breasts; they should not be pink in the center.

, If you'd like, you can cut the strips in half to make them shorter, or pull them apart using two forks.

, You can use olive oil or vegetable oil; olive oil will lend the soup extra flavor. Once the oil starts to sizzle, you are ready for the next step.


You can use the same saucepan that you used for the tortilla strips.

, Cook the ingredients over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the onion, garlic, and bell peppers soften. This will take about 2 to 3 minutes.

, If you can, try to use the reduced-sodium and sodium-free chicken stock. This will reduce the risk of your soup turning out too salty; you can always add more salt later.

, Raise the temperature to medium-high or high heat and wait until the soup starts to boil. As soon as it does, reduce the heat to low, and let the soup simmer for 7 minutes.

, You can use canned or frozen corn. If you use frozen corn, however, you might want to thaw it first; if you don't, you may have to cook your soup longer.


If you don't like corn, you can use canned black beans instead; be sure to drain them first, however!

, For example, if it is not salty enough, you can add more salt. If it is too flavorful, you can add a little bit of water.

, Put a sprinkle of tortilla strips into each bowl, then top it off with some chopped cilantro. Don't stir the soup; let the garnishes rest on top.

, You can also add more garnishes as well. A great idea would be to have little bowls filled with optional garnishes, and let the guests serve themselves. Here are some ideas to get you started:Diced avocado
Diced red onion
Grated Monterey Jack cheese
Salsa or Pico de Gallo
Sour cream

Rinse chicken thoroughly.,
Check the internal cavity.,
Trim excess fat.,
Remove the legs.,
Remove the wings.,
Cut up the breast.,
Place chicken pieces in a large stock pot.,
Add water to cover, salt, and bay leaf.,
Cover the pot and bring to boil.,
Uncover and skim off the top froth.,
Allow to simmer about 2 1/4 hours.,
Add the onions, celery, and carrots and a pinch or two of parsley.,
Allow to simmer about 45 minutes.,
Strain soup, saving the broth.,
Optionally, place cooked noodles or rice in bowl and add soup.",How to Make Chicken Soup," As with all poultry, use cold water when rinsing. Warm or hot water can promote the growth of bacteria that cause salmonella and other diseases.






;
, Some chickens have their gizzards, neck, and/or other organs stuffed into their chest cavity. If this is the case with your chicken, be sure to remove these before proceeding, though it's unlikely that you would accidentally add them to the soup.








, Use a sharp knife, a pair of kitchen shears, or your bare hands to remove the loose, excess fat at the base of the chicken's torso. If put in the soup, this loose fat becomes a gross surprise for whoever is unlucky enough to eat it.








, Pull each leg out from the body and remove it with a sharp knife. Once removed, you may want to divide the thigh from the drumstick by cutting along the ""fat line"" that marks the joint between the leg and thigh.








, Similar to how you removed the legs, pull each wing out from the body and cut it away from the torso with a sharp knife. Cut the wing in half at the joint and discard the smaller ""tip"" portion.








, Use a sawing motion to remove the breast from the ribs (for safety purposes, cut back to front). Spread the breast out on a cutting board and separate it from the bone by making lengthwise cuts along either side of its center. Double check each breast after cutting to ensure there are no remaining bones or fragments.









At this point, you may chop the breasts into halves, quarters, or as many pieces as you'd like.

, When you've cut as much chicken meat as you'd like, simply add it to a large pot and you're done. If you'd prefer, you can also remove the skin, though this isn't essential.









, Add enough water to cover all of your chicken, but don't feel the need to over-do it - if your soup is too thick, you can always add more water later, while waiting for a watery soup to reduce is time-consuming.









For added flavor, you may optionally add the chicken bouillon at this point as well.


, Over medium-high heat, this should take about 8-10 minutes, but may take more or less time depending on how much water you use.








, When your water starts boiling, remove the lid and remove the froth at the top with a wooden spoon. This prevents the water from boiling over.









, Your goal is to make the chicken meat so soft that it falls off the bone. As your soup simmers, periodically check on it to ensure that the chicken is cooking nicely and to skim any froth off the top of the pot.









, After your chicken has cooked for a few hours, you may add your vegetables, which take less time to cook.








, Stir periodically to ensure even mixing and to eliminate top froth.









, Strain your soup into another pot or similar container so that you retain the broth. Remove chicken meat from the bone, discarding any unappetizing pieces. When finished, return broth, chicken, and vegetables to the pot and serve.









, To recreate a bowl of classic childhood ""chicken noodle soup"", simply add cooked noodles (or rice) to your soup. Pasta and rice take less time to cook than your soup takes to make, so you can prepare them while your soup is simmering with ample time to spare.

Let simmer an additional 2 minutes.,
Serve warm.",How to Make Clam Chowder," Hard-shell clams or ""quahogs"" like large chowder clams, littlenecks, and cherrystones should have tightly closed shells.


If you can separate the shells easily, then the clam inside is dead. Clams that are already dead should not be purchased or, if already purchased, should be discarded.;
, Use your dominant hand to pass the blade of a small, dull knife in between the two closed shell halves.


Work with on clam at a time.
Hold the clam with a towel to prevent juice from dripping onto your hand and to provide extra traction as you cut.
The knife should have a blade that is thin enough to pass in between two tightly closed shell halves, but the blade should also be fairly blunt to minimize the risk of accidentally cutting yourself. Use a shucking knife if possible.

, Slide the knife around the perimeter of the clam to loosen both the adductor muscles and hinge.


Close your hand around the clam as you work, squeezing it slightly to put pressure on it.
Note that it will likely be difficult to pass the knife around the perimeter of the clam, and you may have to press or squeeze the knife in between the two shell halves.

, Twist the knife, rotating it from side to side, until the top shell lifts off.


Sever the top shell completely by cutting the upper adductor muscles with the blade of your knife.
Lift off the top shell.

, Slide the knife below the exposed crab meat, severing the lower adductor muscles.


Do not lift the crab meat out of the bottom shell yet.

, Fill a shall baking pan with ice and lay the shucked clams on top of the ice until you are ready to add them to the chowder.


Place the clams in the ice shell-side down.

, Drain the juice from fresh clams, setting it aside. Strain the juice to remove any pieces of shell. Add enough water to the juice to make 1 1/2 cups (375 ml) of liquid.Rough-chop the clams into small pieces and set aside.
Canned clams can be used instead of fresh clams. You should still drain the liquid from these clams and reserve it for use in the chowder. Add enough water to the liquid to make 1 1/2 cups (375 ml) of liquid.
Alternatively, add bottled clam juice to the reserved clam juice instead of water. Doing so will create a stronger clam flavor.

, Cook the bacon over medium heat for several minutes until it turns crisp and brown on both sides.


If the saucepan is too small to place full strips of bacon in, cut the slices in halves or thirds before placing them in the pan.
Note that bacon has enough fat in it to cook without the addition of extra oil.
When the bacon has finished cooking, drain it on paper towels and crumble it into small pieces. Set aside until the end.
Alternatively, you could use pre-cooked bacon or bacon bits instead of cooking your own bacon.

, Pour most of the bacon grease out of the saucepan, saving only 1 Tbsp (15 ml).


If, for whatever reason, you do not have enough grease to leave 1 Tbsp (15 ml) in the pan, add enough olive oil or cooking oil to make up the difference.
If using pre-cooked bacon or bacon bits, heat 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of olive oil or cooking oil in a large saucepan over medium heat.

, Pour the reserved, diluted clam juice into the saucepan. Add the potatoes, onion, instant bouillon granules, Worcestershire sauce, black pepper, and dried thyme immediately afterward.


You will need 3 medium potatoes, peeled and chopped into small, bite-size pieces. This should make about 2 1/2 cups (625 ml) of potatoes.
Chop 1 large onion, creating roughly 1 cup (250 ml) of chopped onion.
Use chicken or vegetable bouillon granules. Do not use beef-flavored granules.
Crush the thyme with your fingers before adding it. If using fresh thyme instead of dried, use 1 Tbsp (15 ml) and chop the thyme well before adding it.

, Heat the mixture to a boil over medium-high heat, then reduce the heat to medium-low and let simmer for 15 minutes.


Cover the pan as the chowder base simmers.
The potatoes should be tender once finished.

, Press each potato against the side of the pan using the back of a fork.


The potatoes should not be completely mashed, but they should be crushed or crumbled once finished.
Note that this step can be skipped if you diced the potatoes into small enough chunks.

, In a separate dish, combine the milk, half-and-half, and flour until smooth. Stir this mixture into the saucepan until evenly blended.


Once the flour mixture has been added to the chowder base, the contents of the saucepan should bubble and thicken.
You can use whole milk or 2-percent milk.
Similarly, you could use half-and-half or light cream.

, Stir the chopped or minced clams into the chowder. Let boil, then reduce the heat and cook for 2 additional minutes.


Boiling and simmering the chowder after you add the clams will ensure that the clams are cooked without being overcooked. It also ensures that the entire dish will be heated through.

, Pour the clam chowder into individual serving bowls and sprinkle with some of the bacon that you set aside earlier.

, Pour the juice out of the clam shells, straining it to remove any bits of debris. Combine the juice with enough water to make 1 1/2 cups (375 ml) of liquid.


Chop the clam meat into small pieces and set aside until ready to add.
Canned minced clams can also be used. Drain the liquid, again adding enough water to form 1 1/2 cups (375 ml) of liquid.
Opt for water instead of using bottled clam juice. You can technically add more clam juice to the reserved juice for a stronger flavor, but you will be adding more clam juice to the chowder later on, so adding more now could create too potent a flavor.

, Place 2 strips of bacon into a large saucepan and cook on medium heat until brown and crispy.


If you cannot fit the bacon into the saucepan, cut it into pieces before cooking it.
Drain the cooked bacon on layers of paper towels, and crumble it into fine pieces. Set aside until later.
Alternatively, you could use pre-cooked bacon strips or bacon bits instead of fresh bacon.

, Pour off most of the grease, reserving only 2 Tbsp (30 ml) of the drippings.


If you do not have enough grease to form 2 Tbsp (30 ml), add enough olive oil or cooking oil to the pan to make up the difference.
If you opt for pre-cooked bacon or bacon bits, use 2 Tbsp (30 ml) of olive oil in place of the bacon drippings.

, Add the chopped celery, chopped onion, and chopped carrots to the oil. Cook for several minutes on medium to medium-high heat until tender, stirring frequently.


You will need 2 stalks of celery, which should produce about 1 cup (250 ml) of chopped celery.
The small onion you use should produce about 1/3 cup (80 ml) chopped onion.
The small carrot you use should produce about 1/4 cup (60 ml) of chopped carrots. You could also shred the carrots using a box grater, if desired.

, Pour the reserved clam liquid and 8-oz (250-ml) bottle of clam juice into the saucepan. Also add the cubed potatoes, cayenne pepper, black pepper, and dried thyme.


Instead of the clam juice, you could use 1 cup (250 ml) chicken broth. Note that doing so will dilute the clam flavor.
You will need about 2 medium red potatoes, which should produce roughly 2 cups (500 ml) of cubed potatoes.
Crush the thyme in between your fingers before adding it. If using fresh thyme, use 1 Tbsp (15 ml) instead of 1 tsp (5 ml).

, Bring the chowder to a boil over medium-high heat, then immediately drop it down to medium-low heat so that it only simmers.


Keep the saucepan covered as the chowder simmers.

, Add the clams to the chowder mixture alongside one undrained 14.5-oz (450-ml) can of diced tomatoes. Also add the crumbled bacon from earlier.


Make sure that each of the new ingredients is evenly distributed throughout the chowder liquid.

, Bring the chowder to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for 2 more minutes.


This step cooks the clams without cooking them too long. It also makes sure that the entire chowder is heated through.

, Pour or ladle into individual serving bowls.

",How to Make Chicken Stock in a Slow Cooker," For the stock, you’ll need 2 medium yellow onions. Leave the skin on the onions, and use a sharp knife to roughly cut the onions into quarters. Set aside for the moment.You can substitute white onions for the yellow if you prefer.;
, To give the stock a rich flavor, you’ll need 1 garlic bulb that hasn’t been peeled. Use a sharp knife to cut the bulb in half crosswise so all of the cloves inside are sliced open and exposed. Set aside with the onion.If you aren’t a fan of garlic, you can omit it. If you prefer a more subtle garlic flavor, you can substitute a few cloves instead of the entire bulb.

, For the stock, you’ll need 4 celery stalks and 2 medium carrots. You can leave the leaves on the celery stalks and the carrots unpeeled as you roughly chop both into 1- to 2-inch (2.5- to 5-cm) pieces. Set aside with the onion and garlic.If you like, you can also roughly chop a parsnip for the stock.

, When you’re ready to make your stock, place the carcass and bones from one or more roasted chickens in the center of your slow cooker. If you’re using more than one chicken carcass, break them into pieces so they’ll fit in the slow cooker’s bowl.If you have loose bones, such as drumsticks, stick them inside the carcass to help save space in the slow cooker.

, Once the chicken is in place, scatter the chopped onion, garlic, celery, and carrots around the carcass. Next, add 2 bays leaves and your favorite herbs and seasonings, such as fresh thyme sprigs, parsley stems, leek tops, and/or whole peppercorns to add more flavor.If your slow cooker is small, you can place the vegetables, bay leaves, and other herbs on top of the chicken to ensure that all of the ingredients fit in the bowl.

, After you’ve added all of the ingredients to the slow cooker, pour enough water in to cover the chicken and other ingredients completely. It should take approximately 2 to 2 ½ quarts (1.89 to 2.3 l).It’s okay to fill the slow cooker within 1-inch (2.5-cm) of the top of the slow cooker.

, Once all of the ingredients are combined in the slow cooker, set it to low and allow it cook for at least 8 hours. The longer that you leave the stock to cook, the more flavorful it will be.You can leave the stock cooking in the slow cooker for as much as 24 hours if you like.

, When the stock has finished cooking for at least 8 hours, place a strainer over a large bowl. Use a pair of tongs to lift out the large bones and vegetables from the slow cooker and place them in the strainer.If you don’t have kitchen tongs, you can use two large forks to lift the large pieces from the stock.

, Once only small pieces of chicken, vegetables, herbs, and other seasonings remain in the slow cooker, carefully pour it through the strainer. Shake the strainer lightly over the bowl to ensure that all of the liquid passes through.If you want to strain an even clearer, cleaner stock, place a coffee filter or piece of cheesecloth over the strainer before you pour the stock through. That will remove even fine bits of debris from the stock.

, After you’ve strained the stock, pour it into several jars or other airtight containers. Let it sit out on the counter uncovered for 1 to 2 hours, or until it cools completely., When the stock has cooled completely, cover the containers with their lids. Place them in the refrigerator, where the stock will keep for up to a week.You can also store your stock in the freezer, where it will keep for up to 3 months.
It’s normal for the stock to thicken up into a gel when you refrigerator. When you reheat it, it will thin out to a liquid again.

Allow the mixture to heat until it comes to a boil, which should take approximately 10 minutes.You can use store-bought or homemade broth for the soup.;
, Once the broth comes to a boil, add 1 ¼ pound (567 g) whole chicken breast with skin and bones to the pan. Cover the pan, and lower the heat to medium-low. Allow the chicken to heat at a bare simmer for approximately 15 minutes, or until it is cooked through.The best way to tell if the chicken is cooked through is to insert an instant-read thermometer into the thickest part of the meat. It should register 165°F (74°C).You can also tell the chicken is done when the middle is opaque and no longer pink.

, When the chicken is cooked through, remove the saucepan from the heat. Let the chicken cool for 10 to 15 in the broth before transferring it to a cutting board. Reserve the broth., Once the chicken is cool enough to handle, use a knife to cut away the skin and remove the meat from the bones. Use a fork or clean fingers to shred chicken, and set it aside for the moment.Cover the chicken with plastic wrap, and store in the refrigerator until it’s time to mix it into the soup.

, Add 3 roughly chopped Roma tomatoes, 2 chipotle peppers in adobo, 1 chopped serrano pepper, 3 sliced garlic cloves, 1 small chopped white onion, 1 cup (237 ml) of water, ½ teaspoon (3 g) of salt, ½ teaspoon (1 g) of pepper, 1 teaspoon (1 g) of dried epazote, and 1 teaspoon (1 g) of oregano to a blender. Blend the mixture until it is smooth.If you don’t have a blender, you can puree the mixture in a food processor.
Adding the serrano pepper is optional. You can omit it if you prefer a milder soup.
Dried epazote is a Mexican herb. You can find it at Latin grocery stores, online retails, and in the international aisle of some general grocery stores.
After you blend up the tomato mixture, taste it. Add more salt and pepper if necessary.

, Add 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of olive oil to a large pot. Allow the oil to heat for 2 to 3 minutes on medium-high heat, or until it begins to shimmer.You can substitute vegetable or canola oil for the olive oil if you prefer.

, Once the oil is hot, pour the tomato mixture into the pot. Heat the mixture on medium-high until it comes to a boil, which should take about 5 to 7 minutes., When the mixture has come to a boil, lower the heat to medium. Allow it to cook for another 5 minutes.The mixture should thicken up slightly at it cooks.

, When the tomato mixture has thickened a bit, add the chicken broth that you reserved earlier to the pot. Stir well to ensure that it is fully mixed with the tomato mixture.After you mix in the chicken broth, give the mixture a taste. Add salt if necessary.

, Once the broth is fully blended with the tomato mixture, add the shredded chicken that you reserved earlier to the pot. Mix well to ensure that the chicken is incorporated throughout the mixture., When the chicken and tomato mixture are fully combined, mix in 2 carrots that have been cut into ⅛-inch (3-mm) thick slices, ½ pound (225 g) of fresh green beans that have been cut into 1-inch (2.5-cm) pieces, a 19-ounce (539 g) can of chickpeas that have been rinsed and drained, and 2 bay leaves. Let the mixture cook on medium until the carrots soften, which should take approximately 5 to 10 minutes.If you prefer, you can substitute shredded carrots for the slices. Shredded carrots will soften more quickly.

, Once the carrots are tender, add a zucchini that’s been cut into ¼-inch (6-mm) thick slices. Allow the soup to cook for another 15 minutes, or until the zucchini has softened too.When the soup is finished cooking, taste it. Add salt if necessary.

, When the soup is finished cooking, use a ladle to transfer it to individual bowls. Top the soup with diced avocado, shredded Monterey jack, chopped cilantro, diced onion, and/or lime wedges, and serve while it’s still hot.The soup pairs well with warm corn tortillas or tostadas.

Scrape the dough together onto a lightly floured surface and begin to knead into a smooth ball for 10 minutes. Continue adding flour when the ball becomes too sticky
A good way to test if the dough has been kneaded enough is to raise the ball of dough a foot above the surface and drop it, if the ball stays in tact then you are good to go, if not then keep kneading.
Glaze a large bowl with the remaining 2 teaspoons of olive oil, then add the dough. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let it sit in a warm area for about an hour to allow it to double in size.

Shape the dough as a square, for a monster's head that's a little different from the standard round pizza
Shape it in any weird way you like; monsters come in all shapes.

, The dough is now ready for turning into a pizza monster.

, Rather than telling you an exact way of putting together your monster, this section breaks down the monster features, allowing you to pick and choose how you'll decorate your pizza monster. It's also fun to make one and show it to the kids, then let them loose on decorating their own, any which way they like.

, The following are just some fun ways to make monster eyes (and remember, one eye or many eyes is just fine):


Use a green olive chopped in half. Ensure that the red pepper is in the middle of each half. Place on the pizza where eyes are to be.
Cut two slices of tomatoes for the eyes and add black olive slices for the pupils.
Cut onion slices. Use these for the outer eyes, with a black olive slice placed inside each one for pupils.
Use pepperoni rounds for eyes.

, Here are a few suggestions for making a monster mouth (and some fangs):


Cut a slice of tomato in half. Use the semi-circle for a mouth. To add fangs, carefully cut small triangles from onion and add around the mouth shape. Or, add cheese triangles after the pizza has been cooked.
Add a crooked row of bell pepper/capsicum slices; red works best.
Make a row of thinly cut olive slice halves across where the mouth goes. Then add cross sections of the same slices facing upward at even intervals along the mouth, to appear like stitches in the mouth.
Cut a length of bell pepper. Fill with a row of corn kernels; they look remarkably like teeth.
Just a bunch of grated cheese in a mouth shape works well.

, An idea or two for a monster's nose on the pizza:


Make a big triangle from bell pepper or pepperoni slices.
Add a round of pepperoni as a large nose.

,


Add a monster scar. Make scars from olive or bell pepper pieces; make a row first, then add pieces that cross over in the opposite direction to appear like a scar.
Add blood dribbles from the monster's mouth. Add blobs of tomato paste coming from the mouth area to the edge of the pizza.
Add wicked eyebrows. Add eyebrows made from olive or bell pepper slices that slant inward to give the effect of a mean or evil stare.
Cut pepperoni into long triangles to serve as bangs or hair.

, Follow either the instructions of the recipe or the packaging for times and temperature.

, Eat it while it's still nice and warm.


Ensure that you have serving plates large enough to serve the pizza monster whole. The pizza can be cut or torn after the diner has enjoyed looking at the fun shape.

Fontina cheese
Grated Parmesan cheese
Ricotta cheese
Boursin cheese
Cheddar cheese;
, A macaroni and cheese pizza is a pizza that's topped with cooked macaroni and cheese. Sprinkled over with extra cheese such as mozzarella or Parmesan; A macaroni and cheese pizza makes a regular cheese pizza even more cheesy than ever and is completely sauce-less. Feel free to use any type of macaroni and cheese when making this pizza. Any macaroni and cheese recipe will work well and will make the pizza even more cheesy than a normal one.
Packaged macaroni and cheese can also work for this pizza, but do note the taste varies from homemade macaroni and cheese.

, A white pizza, unlike most types of pizza, does not include any tomato sauce. It gets most of its delicious flavor from cheese. A white pizza usually will contain ricotta and mozzarella as a replacement for the sauce. It can also be topped with Alfredo sauce, garlic, vegetables, shrimp, and clams. , If you want to twist up your classic cheese pizza and want to make it even cheesier, cheesy pizza bread does the job. Cheesy pizza bread is made out of bread dough and is then topped with tomato sauce, plenty of cheese, and other desired toppings. Once it's baked, it's sliced into strips to be devoured easily. To be even cheesier, you can stuff cheese into the pizza bread and then bake it. When you take a bite, you'll be able to taste the cheese on the top and on the inside. Sprinkling garlic powder or minced garlic over the cheesy pizza bread can give it more flavor with the cheese.

, Made with New York style pizza dough and sprinkled with fresh cheese, pepper flakes, and other seasonings; This New York style pizza makes any pizza cheesier and is a great meal for dinner. The most common cheeses for this pizza include:


Shredded mozzarella cheese
Romano cheese
White cheddar
Provolone

, A stuffed-crust pizza has a crust that is stuffed with mozzarella string cheese, making it an even cheesier treat. After the crust is stuffed, you can top the base with any other desired toppings such as sauce, vegetables, meat, and even more cheese. Once it's baked, you'll be tasting gooey cheese both on the pizza and in the crust.

, Just like the sandwich, a Philly steak contains plenty of shredded provolone cheese and deli-style roasted beef. The combination of cheese and beef goes well and spices up any normal cheese pizza. You may also want to add other toppings to the pizza such as chopped bell pepper, onions, and tomato sauce. , Cheesy, gooey, and magnificent; A pizza cake is the absolute best way to make pizza even more cheesy. This pizza is multi-layered with cheese, sauce, and other toppings such as pepperoni or vegetables. It usually contains three layers, but some have four or five depending on how big or cheesy you want the pizza cake to be. The best of cheese to layer the pizza with is mozzarella cheese. It's easy to sprinkle over the pizza cake and gives it a delicious, gooey taste. , If you're looking for a spicy, cheesy pizza then buffalo chicken pizza might make a good treat. This pizza is covered with buffalo wing sauce or hot sauce and then topped with chicken, cheddar cheese, and mozzarella cheese. Once it's baked, you'll taste a cheesy and spicy explosion in your mouth for the mouthwatering flavors.


For a vegan version, make a buffalo pizza instead of a buffalo chicken one. The cheese is still there but there is no chicken added.
You can also sprinkle bacon bits and blue cheese over the pizza for more flavor.

, One of the most popular cheese toppings for pizza is mozzarella, mainly because it's a great a cheese to be baked in the oven when shredded. When buying mozzarella, always buy the ones that come in a block so you can shred it. Shredded deli mozzarella gives the pizza a richer taste from the cheese. Choose between whole or skim milk mozzarella. Whole milk mozzarella has a creamy texture and has a lot more flavor than skim milk, but includes more fat content. Consider picking out fresh mozzarella for your pizza. Fresh mozzarella is sold in eight-ounce balls and is very soft. It cannot be shredded but it can be sliced into pieces. , Provolone is a smoked cheese and has a different flavor than mozzarella, but still tastes just as delicious. It can be combined with mozzarella on your pizza since the two go very well together. When buying provolone, be sure to buy the one sold in a block so you can shred it by yourself. This helps give the pizza a creamier and richer taste. Instead of shredding the provolone, you can slice it into pieces and add it onto the pizza.
For more flavor, pick out an Italian or aged provolone cheese to add on your pizza. , Semi-firm cheeses like smoked gouda, Edam, fontina, emmental, and Gruyere. These type of cheeses are semi-hard and give out a thick but creamy texture once it's melted in the oven. In order to add it on your pizza, slice the cheese into pieces or bits and garnish it all over your pizza.


Smoked gouda goes well with a pizza that's covered with mozzarella, bacon, roasted vegetables, and/or caramelized onions. , A hard cheese such as Parmesan, romano, and grana padano are great to garnish over a pizza that's finished baking. You can shave or grate the cheese over the pizza to give it a more intense or rich flavor.


Since hard cheeses are very delicate, they have to be added on the pizza once it has finished cooking. If you add it on the pizza before it has cooked, it can lose flavor and overcook. , Mascarpone, boursin, regular cream cheese, and goat cheese are similar to mozzarella and make a good replacement. Break the cheese into small chunks and place it underneath your sauce and toppings since it can burn very quickly. Garlic, rosemary, basil, and other infused cream cheeses can bring good flavor into your pizza.

",How to Grill a Pizza," Your grill needs to be on high heat. One reason to cook a pizza on a grill is that you can get it hotter than you can your oven. Most professional pizza ovens get much hotter than home ovens, resulting in a crispy crust. You can achieve a crispy crust at home by using a very hot grill.Your grill should be about 550, but 600 degrees is better (with the lid closed).
Have your grill heating while you finish up with your ingredients.;
, When grilling pizza, you can use homemade dough, a premade dough ball, or a premade crust. If you are making your own crust, prepare it through the final stages, including rising. If you're using a store-bought dough ball, make sure it's thawed and risen if it was frozen., If you're using veggies, make sure they're sliced and ready to go. Also, shred or slice the cheese you're going to use. If you're including meat, make sure it's cooked first and chopped or broken into pizza-sized pieces. Have them all set up in bowls, ready to go., You can use a pre-made pizza sauce or make your own. You can also just tomatoes and olive oil as a sauce, or use another pre-made sauce like barbecue sauce, pesto, or marinara sauce as the base of your pizza.Most stores sell pizza sauce already made in a small jar or can. If you can't find it, marinara sauce is a decent substitute.
You can also use Alfredo sauce, too.

, Flour a clean surface, and use a rolling pin to roll out the dough into your desired shape. Both round and square will work, as long as they fit on your grill. However, try not to get them too big, as it can be more difficult to flip.You'll need to turn the pizza as you roll to get it rolled out evenly. You'll also be fighting the elasticity of the dough.
You don't want to get the dough too thin, as it can go through the grate. Keep it a little thicker than you would normally roll the dough.
Lightly flour a pizza peel or other flat surface (like a pizza pan) to take the pizza out to the grill.

, Once your grill is heated up, you need to oil the grate. The oil will help keep the pizza from sticking. You can use a plain olive oil, or you can use one flavored with another herb or seasoning, such as garlic, to add flavor to the pizza as you grill it., Oil is your friend when it comes to grilling pizza because the dough has a tendency to stick. Brush the top of the dough with more olive oil, being generous across the top of it. You can use a flavored or plain olive oil., Place the crust on the grill. You should place it oil-side down on the grill, so it keep it from sticking to the grill. Brush the side that's sticking up with more olive oil, then let it cook for about 3 minutes with the lid open and then a couple minutes with the grill closed.Check it after a minute or two with the lid closed. The bottom should be starting to set up. You don't necessarily want that side crispy.
Lift up the edge of the pizza with tongs to check it. Grill marks are fine.

, Once the pizza starts to set up and grill marks, flip it over. It should be starting to get brown. You can use tongs to flip it, but if you're having trouble, try using a spatula, too, to help you flip it. It shouldn't be sticking at all if it's cooked enough., Now that you have it flipped, it's time to add the sauce. Add on a spoonful or two of sauce. You can also use more olive oil instead, if you prefer. Quickly spread out the sauce over the whole surface of the pizza. You can use the back of a spoon or ladle to spread out the sauce. Go light on the sauce or the pizza could be soggy., Sprinkle the cheese on, or lay out slices of fresh mozzarella, if that's what you're using. You probably don't need as much as you think you do. Layer your other toppings over the top of the cheese, including your vegetables and your meats., The pizza toppings will cook better with the lid on the grill because it traps the heat and turns it back on the pizza. You'll only need to cook it about another 5 minutes, perhaps a bit less. If it smells like it's burning, you may need to move the pizza over to a cooler part of the grill.Check it after 3 minutes to see if it's done. Sometimes, the pizza will cook faster., When the cheese is melted and the pizza is done, use the tongs or a spatula to pull the pizza off onto a clean, flat surface. A baking pan or cutting board works well. The bottom of the pizza should be fairly stiff now, making it easier to move., You can use a pizza cutter or a knife to slice up the pizza. Kitchen shears also work well for cutting pizza. Serve up the pizza on plates with a salad or a fruit salad on the side. You can also top it with Parmesan.,"

Preheat your oven to 400°F (204°C).,
Mix together the ground beef, dried herb, basil, garlic clove, salt, and pepper in a large mixing bowl.,
Divide the mixture in half, then press each half into an 8-inch (20.32-centimeter) pie pan.,
Bake the meat for 10 to 15 minutes, or until it is done.If you are baking a thicker crust, the meatza may take up to 20 to 25 minutes to cook.,
Take the pans out of the oven.,
Prepare your pizza seasoning if you wish to use a homemade sauce.,
Start heating the oil, garlic, and seasoning for your pizza sauce.,
Add the tomato paste and water, then simmer the sauce for 5 minutes.,
Spread the sauce onto your meatzas.,
Consider adding some cheese.,
Add the rest of your toppings.,
Bake the pizza for 10 to 15 more minutes, or until the top of the meatza is browned to your liking.The meat should be completely cooked through by this point.,
Cut each pizza into fourths, then serve it.",How to Make a Meatza2," Make sure that the baking rack is in the center of the oven., You can use any type dried herbs you want, as long as they go well with beef. Oregano, thyme, and parsley go especially well together. You can mix the ingredients together using a wooden spoon or rubber spatula, or you can use your hands. If you decide to use your hands, be sure to put on a pair of plastic gloves. This will keep your hands clean.For a chicken meatza, try: 1 pound (454 grams) ground chicken, 1 minced garlic glove, and 1 teaspoon Italian herb.For a Greek meatza, try: 1 pound (454 g) of ground lamb, 1 egg, ½ to 1 tablespoons of fresh thyme, 1 teaspoon of dried oregano, ¼ teaspoon of dried onion powder, 1 teaspoon of salt, and 1 finely chopped garlic clove., Separate the meat into two parts, then roll each part into a ball. Press one of the balls into your first pan, then flatten it out, making sure to cover just the bottom of the pan. Wet your hands with water, then smooth the meat down until it is the same thickness throughout. Repeat the process for the other pan with the remaining meat ball.If you don't have pie pans, you can use other baking dishes instead. You can also make one big pizza in a 9 by 13-inch (22.86 by 33.02-centimeter) baking pan., It is ready when the meat is browned around the edges., There will likely be lots of fat gathered in the pan, so pour it into a can and discard it (or reserve it for cooking).Set the meatzas aside to cool while you prepare the sauce and toppings.

Do not pour the fat down the sink, or it will clog the drains once it hardens.

, If you already have a sauce that you'd like to use, then you can skip this step and click here to continue. In a small bowl, combine 4 teaspoons of each of the following: dried oregano, dried basil, and dried parsley. Add 2 teaspoons of coarse garlic powder, 1 teaspoon of salt, 1 teaspoon of onion salt, and ½ teaspoon of crushed red pepper flaked. Stir everything together.Measure out 1 teaspoon, then store the rest in a glass jar., Start by heating a small saucepan over low heat. Once it is hot, add 1 teaspoon of olive oil, 1 minced garlic clove, and 1 teaspoon of your prepared pizza seasoning; do not use all of the seasoning. Stir everything together, then let it cook for about 20 seconds., Stir in 3 ounces (85 grams) of tomato paste. Once it is evenly mixed in with the oil, stir in ¼ cup (60 milliliters) of water. Bring the sauce to a boil over medium to medium-high heat, then immediately reduce the heat to low. Let the sauce simmer for 5 minutes, or until it turns thick.
, You will need about ¼ cup (60 milliliters) of sauce for each meatza. If you made one big meatza, you can use all of the sauce. Spread the sauce in an even layer across the meatza, leaving a ½-inch (1.27-centimeter) boarder., Most chefs choose to forgo the cheese to make the meatza healthier, but you can add a sprinkle of it, if you'd like. Choose cheese that goes well with your choice of meat and toppings. Here are some ideas to get to you started:

For a marinara meatza, use shredded mozzarella cheese.For a chicken meatza, consider Parmesan cheese and/or mozzarella cheese.For a Greek meatza, try: ¼ cup (25 grams) of crumbled feta cheese., You can add just about anything you want on top of your pizza. You can use everything from the list included in the recipe, or just a few items, or you can experiment with your own toppings. Plan on using up to ½ cup (50 to 100 grams) of each topping.Save delicate toppings, such as arugula leaves and basil, for last.
For a marinara meatza, use 2 diced, small Roma tomatoes and ¼ cup (5 grams) of thinly sliced fresh basil.For a Greek meatza, consider: ½ cup (50 grams) of pitted kalamata olives, ½ small, thinly-sliced red onion. chopped green bell pepper, sliced cherry tomatoes, and arugula leaves.Give it a veggie spin. Use ½ cup (100 grams) of chopped tomatoes, ⅓ cup (35 grams) of chopped mushrooms, ¼ cup (40 grams) each of chopped onion and chopped bell pepper. Top it off with ½ teaspoon each of following: Italian seasoning, onion powder, garlic powder.,, If you made your pizza in a 9 by 13-inch (22.86 by 33.02-centimeter) baking pan, cut it into 8 or 9 rectangles instead."

Take one large piece of leftover pizza and fold it in half lengthwise, so the toppings are contained. If any toppings or cheese are oozing out, use a knife to trim them away. Put the pizza on a hot waffle iron and cook it until the outside of the pizza is crisp. Carefully remove the pizza and eat it while it's hot.You may need to cut your pizza into a smaller piece, depending on the size of your waffle iron.;
, Cook up a pan of scrambled eggs like you usually would. While the eggs are gently cooking, tear up a piece or two of leftover pizza into small bites. Stir the pizza into the eggs and finish cooking the eggs, so they set.For an elegant way to serve pizza and eggs, stir the pizza bits into a pan of beaten eggs to make a frittata. Place the pan under the broiler to finish cooking the eggs.

, If you have a lot of leftover pizza, lay the pieces in the bottom of a casserole dish. Whisk together eggs, milk, and cheese. Pour the mixture over the pizza and sprinkle it with more cheese. Bake the pizza casserole until the eggs are cooked.Consider adding diced onions, peppers, and mushrooms to the pizza bake.

, If you simply want to reheat last night's pizza and eat it for breakfast, skip the microwave. Instead, heat a skillet to medium-low and lay a slice of pizza, so the toppings are facing down. Cook the pizza for a few minutes, so the cheese melts a little and then flip it over. Cook the crust side for a couple of minutes before you eat the pizza.If you're worried the pizza will stick to your pan, you can start by cooking the crust side first. Just add a few tablespoons of water to the pan and stick the lid on. This will hep crisp up the crust.

, Take a large piece of leftover pizza and cut out a circle from the center. Place the pizza and the circle in a pan over medium heat and cook it for several minutes. Crack one egg into the hole and let it fry for a minute. Put the skillet in the oven and bake the pizza egg in the hole until the egg is set.This works best with pan-style or deep dish pizza. Avoid making it with a thin-crust style pizza.

, While marinara or pizza sauce is the standard base for most pizzas, you can use salsa for a fresh taste on your breakfast pizza. Salsa works well with many breakfast pizza toppings (like eggs and hash browns). You can use a chunky salsa, so you get large bites of onion, pepper, and tomato or use a smooth salsa, if you'd rather focus on the toppings.If you prefer, you can use a basic cheese sauce instead of salsa or marinara sauce.

, Instead of using pepperoni or Italian sausage, get a pizza with thick cut bacon for a true breakfast flavor. Thick cut bacon will give a meaty flavor to the pizza. You can also use ground breakfast sausage. Try to find one that uses maple flavoring.You can use standard bacon, but it may crisp up quickly. Keep an eye on the pizza, so the thin bacon doesn't burn.

, Adding hash browns is an easy way to make your pizza great for breakfast. Just thaw some frozen shredded hash browns and scatter the hash browns over the breakfast pizza. They'll crisp up as the pizza bakes.


You can also make a hash brown crust instead of using dough. Just combine hash browns with eggs and cheese. Pat this mixture into a circle and top it with your breakfast pizza toppings.

, While bell peppers can be used on standard pizza, they also taste great with other breakfast ingredients. Just slice red, orange, yellow, or green bell peppers into thin strips or large chunks. You can also open a jar of sun dried tomatoes packed in oil. Drain the oil and lay the strips of sun dried tomato on the pizza.You can use fresh cherry or grape tomatoes cut in half. Avoid using large tomatoes, since these may be watery which will make your breakfast pizza soggy.

, You can easily scramble a pan of eggs and top your breakfast pizza with them. For a classic style, crack whole eggs on the pizza right before it's ready to go in the oven. The eggs will cook gently and just set. This will give you soft-cooked eggs on your breakfast pizza.If doing soft-cooked eggs, ensure that the whites are cooked and the yolks are just set. They'll run as you cut into them.

, While any type of cheese will work well on a breakfast pizza, create a new flavor by using a soft cheese. For example, you could dollop and spread fresh ricotta or soft goat cheese. This is a great way to get extra protein and the cheese pairs well with sharper flavors (like bacon and bell peppers).You could also use softened cream cheese as a base or creamy topping for the breakfast pizza.

, If you want a truly unique breakfast pizza, add some of your favorite breakfast items onto the pizza. Sausage gravy makes a great topping or you could even use it as a base for the pizza. Use a gravy that has large chunks of sausage, so you get some meat in every bite.For a vegetarian version, you could use your favorite mushroom gravy.

",How to Cook Pizza on a Pizza Stone," Of course, you can skip this entire part and buy pre-made pizza dough at the store. But if you’re looking for the full pizza stone experience, this recipe makes a great Brooklyn Style pizza dough. This recipe makes two pizzas. If you only want one, place half the dough in the freezer when you place the other half in the refrigerator. 1 tsp. active dry yeast
1/4 cup cold water
1 cup cold water
1 tsp. salt
3 cups bread flour
3 tsp. extra virgin olive oil;
, Let it sit for 5-8 minutes. This will create a bubbling action, or proof, which test the effectiveness of the yeast.

, Once you’ve allowed your mixture to proof, mix in the salt and cold water. Follow this with the flour. Stir flour in 1 cup at a time until your dough is together enough to remove from the bowl., On a floured surface, knead your dough until it is smooth. It will take 10-15 minutes. Once you’ve gotten the desired smoothness, divide your dough into two even pieces and form each one into a tight ball. Coat each ball with extra virgin olive oil by brushing it evenly over them., Place your dough balls in sealed containers with enough room for the dough to rise. They shouldn’t take up more than half of the bowl. Let them sit in the refrigerator for at least 16 hours and then remove them an hour before you’re ready to use them., With the pizza stone on the bottom rack of your oven, preheat it to 550 degrees.

, Using one ball of at a time, lightly dust your dough with flour. Stretch gradually on a flat, floured surface until it is about as big as your pizza stone (typically about 14”).A cutting board, a flat baking sheet, or a peel will work for your surface. A peel is a wide flat tool for your pizza. The front edge is typically tapered so that your pizza can slide easily on and off of it.

, Once your dough is stretched to the desired size, spread your sauce and add your cheese. Top with the vegetables, meats, and seasonings of your choice.

, This will be much easier if you’ve properly floured your flat surface. Place the tip of your flat surface on the back of the preheated stone and slide your surface out of the oven so that your pizza is left on the stone. If your pizza seems to stick, try using a back and forth jerking motion to help it.

, Your pizza will only have to bake for 4-6 minutes in the oven. Watch it carefully and remove it when the crust begin to brown. Remove the pizza by again sliding your flat surface beneath the pizza., Be careful, the pizza will be extremely hot. Let it sit for a couple minutes before cutting to avoid burning yourself. You now have a crispy stone oven-style pizza., Turn the oven off after you’ve cooked your pizza. Let the stone cool completely before you take it out. This will take hours, so feel free to wait until the morning to clean your stone.

, Place the cooled stone in your sink and clean it just as you would any other dish. Brush off any loose bits of food and scrub away anything that has melted to the surface. Don’t let it sit in water for too long because the material is porous and will absorb the water. If this happens, your stone could crack the next time you try to use it., Use a dishtowel to wipe your stone dry and let it sit out on the counter to dry completely. Some staining is completely normal. As long as you scrub off any food, your stone is perfectly fine to re-use again and again.

",How to Cook Pizza in a Gas Oven," This one change can make a huge difference. Gas ovens often have less even heat and more moisture than electric ovens. A preheated pizza stone heats your food faster and more evenly, and draws out moisture to prevent soggy crusts.Place it on the lowest or second-lowest rack, or wherever you usually bake your pizzas.


Unglazed terra cotta tiles are an effective and much cheaper substitute.However, some clay contains lead or other non-food-safe substances. The risk is lower for tiles made in the U.S. or other countries that regulate lead closely.A cast iron pan is the next best option.;
, Professional pizza ovens are much hotter than anything in your kitchen. Crank the oven up to the highest setting — at least 500ºF (260ºC). A pizza stone or heavy cast-iron pan takes longer to heat than your oven, so wait at least 30 minutes.A large pizza stone may need 40–60 minutes. If you want to be sure, check with an infrared thermometer.

, Place your homemade pizza dough on a pizza peel dusted with flour or cornmeal to prevent sticking. Pound the dough into a disk and form the lip of the crust by hand.Toss or pull your pizza until it reaches the desired thickness and size. Brush the lip of the crust with olive oil and add all the toppings.


If you don't have a pizza peel, use a rimless baking sheet or an upside-down rimmed sheet, with floured parchment paper over it., Shake the pizza peel or baking sheet gently to unstick the dough. Place the end of the pizza peel onto the cooking surface and jiggle it so the pizza starts to slide off. Once the end of the pizza is flat on the stone, jerk the peel back quickly to drop the rest of it.The preheated stone or pan is extremely hot, so be careful.
If using a parchment-lined baking sheet, you'll get better char if you slide the pizza off the parchment paper and cook directly on stone or metal. If your pizza is messy with toppings, though, picking up the parchment and dropping it onto the cooking surface is an easier option.

, If you normally bake your pizzas at a lower temperature, don't rely on your recipe's time estimate. Most homemade pizza only takes 8–12 minutes at 500 to 550ºF (260–285ºC). Take yours out when the top is bubbling and the crust has browned.

, If your oven has issues with hot spots, rotate the pizza 90 degrees halfway through baking to help it brown evenly.This usually isn't necessary if you are using a pizza stone (and allowed enough time for it to preheat), since the stone's radiant heat should make up for your oven's shortcomings.


Do this quickly to minimize heat loss.

, Slide the pizza off the pizza stone or pan and onto a plate or cooling rack. Let cool for a couple minutes before cutting.


Check the underside of the crust before you remove it. The ideal crust is well-browned, with a few spots of char. If the crust is still pale, let it bake a couple minutes longer.

, In a base-heated oven, the crust will cook faster the lower it is. The top of the pizza cooks faster closer to the ceiling, mostly due to faster air currents.Use a lower rack next time if you've been getting brown, bubbly cheese over a pale, doughy crust. Move the pizza to a higher rack if the crust ended up crisper or more charred than you prefer.


All ovens are a bit different, so you might get different results, especially if your oven heats from the back or ceiling.
Some people even place their pizza stone directly on the floor of the oven, instead of on a rack. This will make an extra-crisp crust, but some pizza stones will crack under that much heat.

, If your oven runs cold or you prefer a thick crust, it can be difficult to bake the crust completely without burning the toppings. Try baking the pizza for a few minutes with only the sauce, then adding the other toppings and finishing the job., If your dough is still turning out underdone, use less sauce or switch to a drier cheese. If your oven is particularly cold or uneven, you may need to use less moisture in your dough.

, Thin, cracker-crust dough can bubble excessively. Poke the center of the dough several times with a fork to make holes for air to escape through., If delicate leafy greens, garlic, or thin slices of meat turn black and bitter, it's not necessarily your oven at fault. These toppings burn easily. Place them under the cheese or under other ingredients to prevent this., If the crust is perfect but the toppings need more time, make sure the toppings are spread in a thin, even layer.,"

Please note: These are up-to-date baking instructions according to the Totino’s website, but follow whatever baking instructions appear on the box if they are different from those here.;
, Then cut the plastic wrap and peel it completely off of the pizza.


Don’t forget to remove the plastic in your haste to enjoy a hot pizza. It will melt all over the pizza and make it inedible, and might make a big mess in your oven.
Do not allow your pizza to thaw before baking. Get it out of the freezer only as your oven is preheating.

, When your oven (or toaster oven) has finished preheating, place the pizza directly on the middle oven rack. This will produce the crispiest crust.Alternatively, you can also place the pizza on a cookie sheet, which can either be room temperature or preheated (by placing it in the oven ahead of time). This will not produce the same degree of crust crispiness, though.
Be careful. Remember, the oven and the rack will be extremely hot. If you are a child or are inexperienced with using the oven, have an adult or more knowledgeable baker assist you.

, Cooking times vary slightly depending upon the Party Pizza variety you choose and the type of oven you use. Follow the package instructions. For instance:A cheese pizza should bake for approximately 11-12 minutes on the oven rack, 13-14 minutes on a cookie sheet, and 17-18 minutes in a toaster oven.
A pepperoni pizza should bake for roughly the same amount of time as a cheese pizza.
A supreme pizza should bake for about 14-16 minutes on the oven rack, and 17-19 minutes either on a cookie sheet or in a toaster oven.
Remember, however, to trust your eyes and remove the pizza when it looks done. These thin, small pizzas will overcook and burn quickly!

, This is the easiest way to take the pizza out because a spatula can get right under the pizza to scrape it and bring it forward.


If the pizza is on a baking sheet, remove the sheet from the oven first.
Hold the spatula in one hand and a plate big enough to hold the pizza in the other. Quickly transfer the hot pizza to the plate, either by sliding or lifting and placing it with the spatula.
Remember — the pizza is hot, and so is the pan (if you used one). Be careful.

, If you are making it for yourself, you don't necessarily have to cut the pizza. You can just eat it whole.


If you’re sharing the pizza or want to be a bit more refined in your eating, use a pizza cutter to divide the pizza into pieces. (Totino’s Party Pizzas are now square instead of round, so you’ll get smaller squares instead of slices.)

, If you are in even more of a hurry or just really want to ensure maximum crispiness, you can try a variation that utilizes your microwave and your oven set on the broiler setting.Preheat your oven (or separate broiler) on the maximum broiler setting. Place a sturdy cookie sheet in the broiler to preheat as well, putting it on a rack that is as close to the heating element as possible.
Put your frozen, unwrapped Totino’s Party Pizza on a microwave-safe plate. Microwave it on “high” until the pizza is completely thawed. The pizza will be soft and pliable and the cheese will have begun to melt.
Carefully remove the hot cookie sheet from the broiler. Carefully slide the pizza from the plate to the hot cookie sheet. Carefully place the hot cookie sheet back into the broiler. Carefully wait for the pizza to finish baking.
Remove your pizza from the broiler when it is crispy, bubbly, and browned.

, You can’t control what ingredients are inside the Party Pizza, but you can control the toppings. Start with a plain cheese pizza and add whatever veggies, cheeses, cooked meats, or other items that you wish.You can add chopped fresh or sauteed onions, bell peppers, olives, mushrooms, or other veggies; any cooked meats, from pepperoni to last night’s leftover chicken; extra mozzarella or other good melting cheeses; and any other toppings that will safely cook to the proper temperature in the time it takes to bake the pizza.
Don’t overload the pizza, though. Totino’s pizzas have a very thin crust and won’t easily stand up to a mountain of toppings.

, You can also personalize your Totino’s Party Pizza as it completes its journey to crispy deliciousness. For instance, you can brush garlic butter, garlic oil, or olive oil along with pepper and parmesan onto the outer rim of the pizza during the last two minutes or so of baking.Or, you can add chopped fresh tomatoes, parmesan or feta cheese, fresh herbs like basil and oregano, or dried chile flakes to the finished pizza.
If you want to make a Totino’s Party Pizza as healthy as possible, try adding tender mixed greens tossed with oil and vinegar on top.

Store pizza in the freezer to keep it fresh up to two days.,
Prep it for reheating.",How to Store and Reheat Pizza1," Putting a box of pizza straight into the refrigerator will result in soggy pizza. The moisture from the tomato sauce, vegetables and meat will soak through the crust. The thinner the crust, the soggier it will get. Instead, spend a few minutes on storing your pizza the right way.

Your quest will be easier if you familiarize yourself with baking percentages, and keep detailed notes on each recipe.;
, The flour's protein content is incredibly important for pizza, especially when you plan to toss it. Look for bread flour or pizza flour with a protein content of at least 12.5%., The water should be ""blood temperature,"" or close to 96ºF (35.5ºC). Let this mixture stand until the yeast is dissolved and begins to bubble.

, Mix cold water, sugar, salt, and olive oil in a separate bowl.

, Place the flour in a large bowl. Stir the activated yeast, then pour it into the flour. Pour the cold water mixture as well.

, You may knead by hand or with a dough hook attached to a low-speed electric mixer. Knead until the dough is glossy and tacky, but not sticky. You should be able to pinch a small piece and pull it thin enough to let light pass through. This is a sign of a strong, high-gluten dough that will stay together when tossed, and make a chewy, tender crust.


Results can vary with humidity and other unpredictable factors. Add a little flour if the mixture is sticky, or a little water if the dough is dry.
This usually takes 5–15 minutes by hand, or 2–4 minutes in an electric mixer.

, Brush the dough with olive oil and store, covered, in the refrigerator. Leave overnight (or for at least 5 hours) to allow gluten to develop further. The cold temperature of the fridge slows yeast activity, preventing excessive rising from the long waiting period.Cold dough is also easier to handle.


Place the dough in an airtight container with enough room for the dough to double in size.
Alternatively, leave covered with a warm towel for 40–60 minutes at room temperature, or until dough doubles in size. Chill for one hour in the refrigerator., Scoop up the dough ball with a dough scraper, if you have one, to avoid stretching it. Cut it in half to form the dough for two smaller pizzas. These will be more convenient to handle and fit in a home oven. For the instructions below, use one dough ball at a time.

, Coat both sides with plenty of flour. Drop the dough ball on a flat, floured surface, flipped over so the side that was underneath while rising is now on top.To reduce mess, use cornmeal or semolina instead of regular flour.If your dough or hands stick at any point during the rest of the process, add more flour.

, Slap the ball of dough flat with your hand, kept as flat as possible. Don't press too hard, or you'll squeeze out the air and create a hard, dense crust. Just press until it is relatively flat, but still squishy.

, Hold your fingers straight and together. Press into the dough about 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) from the edge. Repeat this motion around the whole circle, forming a groove and a raised outer crust.

, Keep your fingers straight and together. Hold your hands flat, just above the dough, with your fingers pressing into the groove you just made. Fan your fingers outward a little, pressing against the crust. Bring your fingers together and rotate the dough a little, then repeat this fanning motion around the whole edge.This will make the outer crust edge thinner, and the pizza a bit larger.


Don't press your palms against the base of the dough. This can lead to uneven crust or tears.
Beginners can use a rolling pin when starting out. This is easier, but usually results in a denser crust.

, Once again, hold your fingers straight and together. Place them lightly on the dough in a comfortable position in front of you, angled toward each other. Press your fingertips against the edge, and push one hand outward to gently stretch that small area of the pizza. Rotate the dough and repeat, moving around the dough several times. With practice, you can use a fluid, fast motion, moving your hands in small circles.Stop when the dough is getting thin, and approaching the size you want.


Never move your hands in completely opposite directions, as this will create a thin center. Move at an angle instead to stretch just the outer area, leaving a small hump in the center of the dough.You can instead press the side of your hand down into the groove, then push directly outward to stretch the edge. Use your other hand to rotate the dough as you go., Slapping is an easier way to hand shape your pizza. Some chefs slap, some toss, and some start with slapping and finish with a toss or two. None of these methods are more correct than another. If you decide to slap, here's how it goes:Drape the dough over your palm and forearm. The more of your arm you use, the less likely the dough is to break.
""Slap"" the dough onto your opposite palm, letting it drape over your other hand and forearm. If your dough is in danger of tearing, let it drape gently instead of using force.
Repeat this motion back and forth. Each time you ""slap,"" the dough should rotate about one quarter turn. This rotation is vital for making the dough wide and even.

, If your dough looks strong and hasn't yet reached the desired size, it's time to adopt the tossing position. Extend your dominant hand as a flat palm, with fingers together. Keep your other hand in a fist to ""anchor"" the dough. Drape the pizza dough over both hands, supporting opposite sides of the dough., Rotate your arms inward to get ready for the throw. (If you are using your right palm, rotate your arms to the left.) This allows more rotation during the throw, imparting the spin that shapes the dough in the air.

, Bring your palm up and around, until the back of your hand is in front of your face.Follow with your fist to continue supporting the pizza, but focus on your palm, which will do the tossing. Practice this motion without tossing the pizza first, then try again with moderate speed during your toss.


Start with a more gentle throw than you think you need. Too little force, and the pizza doesn't leave your hand. Too much force, and the pizza flies across the room.

, Bring the upward motion of your palm to an abrupt stop when it comes in front of your face. This will send the pizza flying upward a short distance. In the air, it should spin at the same speed your hands rotated. The force from spinning pushes the dough flatter and wider, without pressing out the air.

, Although your hand stops moving upward, it should still complete the arch of its movement after the pizza is released. Follow through by moving your palm around and out, as though swatting a fly in front of your face. A smooth follow-through ensures that your hand is rotating at the moment when you release the pizza.


Don't worry too much about this for your first few tosses. It's more important to catch the falling pizza than to get the right hand shape.

, Catch the dough with both fists and forearms. Use as much of your forearm as you can, to avoid puncturing it. If you have a strong dough, you may be able to catch it on one fist, but this is risky for most recipes.


If you tossed with your right palm, catch the dough mostly on your left arm.
Expert dough tossers ""catch"" the dough on their fingertips, sending it spinning again without letting it rest. This is a complex technique that involves sending the dough in multiple trajectories and angles.It's best not to try this until you're a more experience pizzaiolo.

, If you slapped the dough or hand-stretched it heavily, you may only need one toss to get your pizza to the size you need. If you only used light hand-stretching, you may toss it several times. Once the pizza reaches the desired size, place the dough on a pizza screen, pizza stone, or baking sheet. You're ready to add the toppings.


The dough is ready when you say it's ready. The size of your oven and personal preference for crust thickness are the only criteria you need when cooking at home.

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 C).,
Place the pizza on a baking sheet, then put it in the oven.,
Cook the pizza for 15 minutes.",How to Store and Reheat Pizza2," Allow the oven to completely preheat before placing the pizza inside. The final result will be worth the wait - especially if you're reheating an entire pizza. If you place the pizza in too soon, it could turn out soft in the wrong places. If you follow this method, the pizza will taste similar to the original.

, If you have a baking stone, that's even better, since stones are constructed to evenly distribute the heat throughout your pizza. Also, to make the task of cleaning the baking sheet easier, put parchment paper on the baking sheet before placing the pizza on top of it.


If any of the toppings look unappetizing, remove these before reheating the pizza.






Consider dressing the pizza up with fresh diced tomatoes, basil, mushrooms, and other fresh vegetables. You can drizzle olive oil or add fresh cheese.







, When the pizza is done, the cheese should be bubbly and crispy brown in spots. Remove it from the oven and enjoy.

However, try this trick to make the pizza crispier than you'd expect with a microwave:


Place a cup or glass half filled with water beside the pizza slice, in the microwave.",How to Store and Reheat Pizza5," The trick to minimize burning is to reheat the pizza for a short time. Don't reheat too long. Expect this method to produce a slightly soggy pizza. The pizza will be tasty, but its texture won't be splendid.

, The water in the cup will prevent the microwaves from reaching deep inside the pizza slice, while letting the cheese melt and reheat the crust.
Reheat for 30 seconds.
In 30 seconds, your crispy, delicious pizza slice will be ready to eat!

Don’t buy pre-shredded mozzarella.,
Choose between whole or skim milk varieties.,
Try fresh mozzarella.",How to Choose Cheese for Your Homemade Pizza1," Instead, buy mozzarella in a block from your grocery’s deli. Then, shred the mozzarella at home. Using shredded deli mozzarella will provide a creamier and richer cheese flavor.If you are making a thirteen inch pizza, then ask for a four to six ounce block of cheese. If your pizza is smaller, then ask for less cheese.;
, Whole milk mozzarella has a creamier texture (similar to cream cheese) and has more flavor than skim milk varieties. The creamier texture and better flavor is due to the higher fat content. However, it has only one to two more grams of fat per serving than skim milk mozzarella.Because whole milk mozzarella has a richer flavor, you do not need to use as much cheese if you were using skim milk mozzarella.

, This version of mozzarella is the classic Italian cheese for pizzas. Fresh mozzarella is sold in eight-ounce balls. It is usually vacuum-sealed in a container sitting in whey. Because this cheese is soft and breaks apart easily, it cannot be shredded.When using this cheese on your pizza, slice it up and place the pieces spaced apart on the pizza. The mozzarella will melt and spread out over the pizza.
You can find fresh mozzarella at your grocery store’s deli.
Fresh mozzarella has a short shelf life and should be used within a week once it is opened.

Think about how much pizza you will be cooking at any one time.,
Research oven bases.,
Know how you will be cooking the pizzas.,
Know what what size you need.",How to Choose Which Commercial Catering Pizza Oven to Buy," Should you choose a deck pizza oven or conveyor oven?


Conveyor ovens can be convenient and easy to cook with. You make your pizza, place in the pan, put it on one end of the conveyor and wait for it to come out the other side cooked. A conveyor oven can provide a high output with consistent results.
Deck ovens create an authentic fuller flavor for the more experienced chef. Traditional pizzas can be made by cooking the pizza directly on the base of the oven. Deck ovens also look the part when front of house.;
, How many decks do you need? Single deck pizza ovens are a good option if pizza is only part of the food you offer in your catering business.


There are models such as the budget Lincat LPO which have a small footprint making them ideal for adding that extra dimension to your business.
Some single deck pizza ovens are stackable meaning you could start off with a single deck oven and add another deck at a later date.
Models that have stacking kits for their pizza ovens have them listed in our online shop and in the buyers guide on our website.
Do I need a twin or triple deck oven? Twin and triple deck pizza ovens are for catering businesses with larger pizza requirements. The largest capacity pizza oven for those who pizza is their main product is the Cuppone Giotto. The space age design pizza oven has a revolving base which can fit up to 14 x 12” pizzas on its base. It is made from stainless steel with a panoramic glass door and internal light, sure to wow your customers.

, Do you want to cook more than only pizza in the oven?


Pizza ovens such as the Roller Grill PZ660 are designed to cook not just pizzas but also quiche, lasagna, pies, breads, tarts and pastries.
Also pizza ovens designed for cooking pizzas with pans such as the Cuppone LLKTZ7201 or our range of conveyor ovens can be used to cook other products in the pans such as wedges or garlic bread. If you have a limited amount of space and want to offer a varied menu a versatile oven may be the right choice.

, What type of oven base do you want?


Pizza ovens designed for the pizza to be cooked directly on the ovens floor have stone or brick bases. This enables the ovens to get to the temperatures needed to make a traditional pizza by trapping and radiating heat. The heat is distributed evenly across the pizza base so that the pizza is perfectly crisp. Stoned baked pizza is a phrase everyone will have heard off.
Firebrick is also a common choice for a pizza oven base, the material is efficient at conducting heat and is designed for the rapid heat up and cool down that your oven will experience. Refractory materials such as firebricks are materials designed to retain their strength at high temperatures.

, Do you want to cook pizzas in pans?


The second option for cooking pizzas is to cook the pizzas in pans. Cuppone produce a range of ovens designed for pan pizzas such as the LLKTZ201. These ovens have an extra wide deck to accommodate 2 x 12” pizzas and 2 x 14” pizzas at one time. Conveyor ovens lend themselves perfectly to cooking pan pizzas. The size of the pizzas is limited by the width of the conveyor belt on the oven. However the number of pizzas which can be cooked is limited only by the time the pizza takes to travel from one end of the conveyor to the other, making a conveyor oven capable of a high output.

, Look at where it will be stored and what you will be cooking. What size oven do you need? What size pizzas would you like to be able to offer? For example the Cuppone LLKTZ6201 can fit 4 x 12” pizzas on its base. When you have decided on the oven you feel is right for your business measure the space available in your shop.


Make sure there is room for the oven before you order it!

Cut the dough into two round balls and repeat the following steps for each piece.,
Pick up the disk of dough, and pinch the dough about 1/2 inch (1.27cm) from the edge.,
When the disk of dough has been stretched enough to start to be floppy, proceed to tossing.",How to Make Pizza Dough," Add yeast and sugar. Stir lightly and let sit for 5 to 10 minutes until the yeast activates by turning into a foam on top of the water. Then add the salt and oil.







;
, You know you have added enough flour when the mixture becomes too thick to stir.









, It is ready when it is glossy and tacky, but not sticky; a small amount pinched off can be stretched (by pinching and pulling) thin enough to let light pass through.









Take the dough out of the bowl and put it on a clean, well-floured surface. A wooden board or clean table is best. Make sure it is at a height where you are comfortable working. If it is very moist or sticky, sprinkle additional flour over the top.
Gather the dough into a pile and begin pressing it together. Press the heels of your hands firmly into the dough, pushing forward slightly.
Fold the far edge of the dough upwards, towards you, and press it into the middle of the ball. Rotate it slightly. Repeat this press-fold-turn sequence for the duration of the kneading process.


,,,









Flatten one ball with your hand until about 1 or 1 1/2 inches (2cm - 4cm) thick.

, Try to stretch as you pinch, repeat this all around the edge.









,









Make a fist and drape the dough over your fist.
Make a fist of the other hand and slip it under the dough next to your other fist.
Carefully move your fists apart stretching the dough more.
Shift your fists (left towards your face, right away) so the dough rotates while stretching.
When the dough has reached about 8 inches (20cm) in diameter, you can quickly move your left fist in an arc that goes backwards towards your face. Do this while twisting your right fist forward away from your face. If you give a a little push upwards with your right fist the dough will spin like a Frisbee. Practice how it feels to balance the force of the fist twists equally. This will keep the pizza from spinning off into the corner (or worse).
Be sure to catch the falling, spinning pizza as gently as you can with your two fists to avoid tearing. However, if you notice that the dough is tearing, just start over, and do the spinning process again.

Clean up.",How to Appreciate Pizza Left Overs," Remember to refrigerate the leftover slices by wrapping them in cling wrap and putting in the fridge, or simply by putting the whole box into the fridge. This will ensure that in the morning there isn't any unidentifiable gunk on your pizza.;
, If you have a selection of pizzas, choose slices that are going to fill you up and that look tasty, for example, look for ones with lots of sauce and toppings you like. Once you know what you're going to have, grab a plate and a cup.

, You may need to reheat them again if they are not hot - and if the cheese hasn't melted.

, Find a place that is cozy, such as your room or in front of the computer.

, Many people eat pizza by the gulp full, others slowly. Try not to eat it too fast, as by eating it fast you can not appreciate the flavours. Each mouthful will be full of flavour sensations, and while your body may not thank you for all the carbohydrates, your taste buds will.

, So you had a yummy breakfast, not too nutritional, but you can make up for it by cleaning up after yourself. It has a way of finishing the experience as well as keeping clutter to a minimum.

Choose a provolone.,
Opt for a semi-firm cheese.,
Try a hard cheese.,
Consider cream cheese.",How to Choose Cheese for Your Homemade Pizza2," Provolone is a great cheese to combine with mozzarella on your pizza. Like the mozzarella, purchase a block of provolone from the deli and shred it at home. For added flavor, choose an aged or Italian provolone cheese.The ratio of provolone to mozzarella depends on your tastes. If you are unsure, begin with 70 percent mozzarella and 30 percent provolone.

, Semi-firm cheeses like Gouda, Gruyere, fontina, emmental, and Edam also taste great when mixed with mozzarella. This variety of cheese has a thick, creamy texture when melted. Dice up these cheeses and place the pieces on your pizza.Gouda goes well with caramelized onions, bacon, or roasted vegetables.
Mix one part Gouda to four parts mozzarella.

, Hard cheeses like Parmesan cheese, grana padano, and pecorino romano (romano) are great finishing touches on pizzas. Hard cheeses are rich in flavor, so grate or shave them over your finished pizza.Parmigiano reggiano has a richer, more intense flavor than American made Parmesan cheese.

, Cream cheeses like regular cream cheese, mascarpone, boursin, and goat cheese are great alternatives to mozzarella. Scatter small chunks over the dough. Place the pieces on the bottom under the sauce and toppings since it burns easily.Try infused cream cheese for extra flavor, for example, garlic, rosemary, or basil-infused cream cheeses.

Use cold cheese.,
Avoid some cheeses.,
Add hard cheeses later.,
Shred your cheese.",How to Choose Cheese for Your Homemade Pizza3," To prevent your cheese from overcooking, make sure the cheese is cold before placing it on the pizza. If not, the cheese might burn. Also, try not to use too much cheese. The proper amount of cheese for a thirteen inch pizza is four to six ounces., Oily or processed cheeses should be avoided. These include cheeses like Velveeta, cheddar, and pre-shredded cheese. For the best flavor and results, buy a block of cheese from the deli and shred it at home yourself., Hard cheeses like Parmesan, grana padano, and romano are very dry and delicate. If you put them on the pizza before it goes into the oven, they will burn and lose their flavor. Therefore, put these cheeses on the pizza only after it has come out of the oven., You can use a hand grater, rotary cheese grater, or a food processor with a shredding attachment to shred your cheese. Place soft cheeses in the freezer an hour before you begin grating it. This will make grating soft cheeses much easier.You can purchase a cheese grater from your local grocery or home goods store, or from a discount retailer like Target and Wal-Mart.

Begin the game of pizza roulette.,
Ready, set, go.",How to Play Pizza Roulette," Make as many hot flavored pizzas as you're having guests over. You will probably also need to make extra safe pizza for the less courageous who won't be playing this game.


For some help, see How to make pizza and How to make pizza dough.
If you can't be bothered making pizza, ask your local pizza place in advance to prepare such a pizza (or more) for you. You will probably have most luck asking a non-franchised, family-run pizza outlet unafraid to push the limits (you might also need to drop off the hot chili peppers for them to add).;
, Cover it well with cheese and other topping so it's hard to find.


Make chili-free pizza for the less courageous, the stomach-challenged and those who are just not into it. That's okay––they can wash up after.







, Remove the pizza from the oven when baked.

, Just be sure that the slice with the hottest possible chili is intact (that chili being only on that slice).

, Let all participants know that they're in for a mouthwatering and eye-watering treat. Make sure they know it's Pizza Roulette and that there is no picking of toppings allowed. Let them know where the yogurt or milk is too (to help cool the hot surge from the chili pepper).


At this stage, allow anyone who isn't keen on getting the hottest chili pepper ever to withdraw and eat the alternative pizzas instead. However, let them know they must be part of the cheer squad.

, Let the people eat pizza. The person who manages to get (and eat) the hottest chili ever wins. If there are several pizzas like this because you've got a big crowd, then have each separate winner do a pizza roulette eat-off to find the final winner.


What the winner wins is up to your imagination. Good trophies include a slab of beer, a live chili pepper plant or a printed certificate in the shape of a pizza or a chili pepper.

Enjoy!

",How to Make Pesto Pizza," Buy or assemble the ingredients. Have them placed out and ready to use. Preheat your oven to the temperature provided on your package instructions or pizza dough recipe.;
, Place the pizza crust in the pizza pan or pizza stone. Spread the pesto sauce evenly across it. Don't forget to leave room for the crust at the end, as seen in the photo. You will need to leave some room for the crust at the outer edge of the pizza base.

, You can place them in any order you like but here is a suggestion: cheese, tomatoes, beef or meat (or substitute), basil/spices, and top it off with a little salt and/or pepper.

, Place the pizza in the oven to bake. Follow the heating instructions provided on the packaging or with the recipe you've used for the base. Usually the cheese will be slightly melted and the meat will be tender.


Since pesto isn't as thick as the usual pizza sauce, the pizza may take a shorter time to cook. It's best to keep a frequent watch over it while baking. It's better to pull it out as soon as possible before if over-bakes.

, Remove the pesto pizza from the oven. Slice and serve on a serving plate.

Evaluate your barbecue.,
Prepare and preheat the grill.,
Start with a fairly thin crust.,
Slice the toppings thinly and choose flavorful toppings.,
Place your pizza onto a peel.,
Watch your pizza cook.,
Remove the pizza once cooked to your satisfaction and serve without delay.",How to Cook Pizza on a Barbecue," There needs to be enough radiant heat to be able to cook the toppings. Otherwise, you will only be cooking the crust from below.









Does your barbecue have a lid and thermostat? Can it reach and maintain a temperature of around 220ºC/428ºF? If not, there is still a simple way to work around this, as explained in the next step.
Does your barbecue have a large, flat hot-plate? You can use a slotted grill, but this does make the process far more likely to be a mess.;
, A little preparation makes for much more even heat and a better pizza.









The big issue/virtue with barbecues is the smoke factor that gives that smoky flavour to food. If the barbecue is not clean it will smoke the food too much and your pizza will not taste of anything aside from smoke. Its best to clean the plate before and after use as well as allowing a long enough preheat time to burn off any debris. As per the warnings below, with residences becoming closer, or similarly if you live in an apartment, it is best to consider your neighbours and ensure that the wind factor is favourable to blow any smoke away from homes (especially clothes-lines). As many restaurants now serve a form of grilled pizza, it would be better to frequent these places instead of becoming the local enemy if you don't have space to BBQ.
Use bricks to retain the right level of heat. Place bricks (free of any dirt that could burn, wrapped in foil if you wish) around the barbecue to simulate a baker's oven and preheat the barbecue until it reaches temperature. It will take more time to preheat adequately using bricks, but the heat will be more even and appropriate for cooking pizza.
If your barbecue has no flat plate (having only slotted or bar grills), cook the pizza on a heavy cast iron skillet, a pizza stone, or other heavy-duty and flame-proof flat piece of cookware.
If you have no lid, improvise one using an upturned roasting pan (which likewise must be preheated), which will radiate heat. Place the pizza under the roasting pan. Practice utmost care with this method, to avoid burns. For wood-fired barbecues or fire pits, try making a fixed frame surround out of bricks and using a hot roasting pan filled with hot coals.

This fixed structure should consist of placing one or two brick courses high, making two sides and a back, and leaving the front and top spaces open. The distance between the two side walls should be small enough that the roasting pan will sit firmly and safely on top. Then place the pizza into the space inside the ""walls"" and place the roasting pan on top to radiate heat down onto the pizza. (Only do this with a fixed setup; do not attempt to do this with loose bricks). Remove the roasting pan when the pizza is cooked to access the pizza, or if it is browning too quickly on top.



, Most barbecue pizzas have thinner crusts and have very few raw ingredients because they cook from the base up. A barbecue with really good heat control can allow more variations to crust thickness and structure; you'll need to experiment to learn what works best with your own barbecue.









Using wholemeal flours or fine cornmeal makes a more protein-rich and chewier dough, but it also takes longer to cook through.
You can precook or pre-grill the base in advance and then freeze it. The bases do freeze very well, so try making a batch of them at a time. A pre-cooked crust may not taste quite as good as one cooked from scratch, but it will save a lot of trouble.
When the crust is almost cooked through, add cooked toppings and bake long enough to warm them through and melt the cheese.

, Or keep it simple but still delicious – some barbecued pizzas are little more than the bread dough cooked briefly on both sides like a pancake, then brushed with an herb and garlic oil and eaten as is or wrapped around other foods, and they're still delicious.









Precook any meat, especially seafood and chicken. You don't want it to come out too rare. It is best to place meat closer to the edges of the pizza to cook it faster.

, You can also improvise with a wooden chopping board, baking sheet or other flat item to allow the smooth transfer of pizza onto the barbecue plate. Should you be using a dough and not a precooked base, try not to allow the dough to prove too much or it will go soft and will tear easily. Another ""practice makes perfect"" activity.








, A barbecue is a very difficult thing to control heat-wise, so regular checking is essential to avoid burning.








, If there are various people sitting around, ask for several helpers to keep tending the pizza cooking so that you can share the duties and enjoy the eating when your own pizza is ready.

Let your stone completely cool off.,
With a blunt tool, brush or scrape stuck on pieces of food.,
Never use soap on your pizza stone.,
Wipe your pizza stone with a damp cloth if necessary.,
As a last resort, soak your pizza stone in water.,
Let your stone dry completely before using it again.,
Avoid putting oils of any kind on the stone.,
Embrace your discolored pizza stone.",How to Clean a Pizza Stone1," Before handling, you should allow it to cool off in the oven for an hour, otherwise there's a possibility it could crack, especially if you expose it to cold air or water.Make sure that your stone cools to room temperature before you attempt to clean it.


If you must handle it when it is hot, use heat-resistant gloves so you do not burn yourself. Be sure any surface it is placed on is heat-resistant.
Pizza stones can also crack if you put a cold stone into a hot oven.;
, You can use a stone brush or plastic spatula to get any excess pieces of burnt food that have stuck to your stone. Scrape gently on the surface of the stone where the baked on food is.


Using a metal spatula may put scratches in your stone.

, Although it may seem intuitive to clean your stone with soap, doing this can ruin the stone for good. Pizza stones are porous, and soap will get inside of its pores and make your food taste like soap.Once you ruin your stone with soap it may never be the same.

, Damp a washcloth with warm water and wipe down the pizza stone. Wipe off any pieces of loosened food that you were able to get detached from scraping.

, Burnt or baked-on gunk may need to be soaked to soften the material for removal. In plain water, soak the pizza stone overnight, and try scraping again. Keep in mind that in soaking, your pizza stone will absorb quite a bit of water, so let it dry completely for a week or so. Even if it looks dry, it has a lot of water in it., Another reason that a pizza stone can crack in the oven is because it hasn’t fully dried before being put back into the oven. Remember to store the stone in room temperature before you heat it again. Water gets stuck in the pores of the stone and reduces the integrity of the stone when it’s reheated again.Allow your pizza stone 1-2 hours to dry before using it again.

, Olive oil or any other fat can cause your stone to smoke when you cook food on it.While some people think that this seasons the stone like a cast iron pan, the pores in the stone actually soaks up the oil instead of creating a non-stick surface.


To create a non-stick surface, use cornmeal on the top of your stone.
Oils from food will naturally leach into the pizza stone, and will do no harm...in fact it will make it better to use. However, as mentioned above, do not season it as you would a cast iron skillet.
Your stone will become naturally seasoned after cooking pizza or other foods on it.

, A well-used pizza stone typically has many dark, discolored areas. It does not look like a brand new slab right out of the box. But a pizza stone actually gets better over time. Do not try to scrub your pizza stone in an attempt to make it look brand-new, or think once it looks ""old"" it is time for a new one."

Mix equal parts baking soda and warm water in a bowl.,
Remove large burnt chunks of food with plastic spatula.,
Scrub the solution into your stone with a brush.,
Wipe the stone with a damp cloth.,
Allow the stone to fully dry.",How to Clean a Pizza Stone2," Mix it together until it forms a paste. It should be around the consistency of toothpaste. This solution will be able to remove deeper stains from your stone that a regular wiping can’t.


Baking soda is a sodium bicarbonate and is great for cleaning off dirt and grease.Since it’s only mildly abrasive and won’t alter the taste of your food, baking soda is the safest cleaner for your pizza stone.

, Before you scrub your stone with the solution you just made, you need to make sure that the bigger chunks of food that are stuck to your pizza stone are removed.


Be gentle when handling your pizza stone because repeated handling increases the chance of it cracking over time., Using a toothbrush or stone brush, make small circular motions and clean the problem areas of your pizza stone first. Aim for the discolored or dark areas on the stone and then work your way around the rest of the stone.


If there are still areas that have deep, baked-in stains, you may have to come back to them after wiping your stone.

, Once you have scrubbed your stone, you should have a layer of your baking soda cleaning solution on the stone. Wipe this down with a damp cloth when you feel like you won’t make any more progress by scrubbing.


Revisit the problem areas of the stone after wiping if you aren’t satisfied with how clean it is. Repeat the process until the stained area is lighter or has disappeared.

, Since this method of cleaning will probably allow more moisture into your stone then simply wiping it off, make sure you wait a day before using it again. Any leftover moisture could damage your stone.You can store your stone in the oven so that it stays room temperature. Just make sure to take it out when you are cooking other things.

Limit the use of this method to one time.,
Clean your oven until it’s completely clear of grease and dried food.,
Wipe off your stone with a dish rag.,
Place the stone in the oven and set it to 500 degrees.,
Turn on your self-cleaning function.,
Watch your pizza stone through the window.,
Allow your pizza stone to cool.",How to Clean a Pizza Stone3," There’s a chance you’ll crack your pizza stone, even if you follow these directions.Use this method only once, and try to do a thorough job so you don't have to do it again.


If there’s too much grease, it can start a grease or oil fire which is incredibly dangerous.
Some self-cleaning ovens have a self-lock feature when self-cleaning is on. If there’s fire inside of your oven, there is sometimes no way to open the door., Stuck on grease or any other fat will create a lot of smoke if you use your self cleaning function. Wipe down greasy rails with a rag and use an oven cleaner.


Make sure that your oven is dry before using the self-cleaning function.

, Clean off the initial grease and dirt buildup on your stone. Even though the self-cleaning feature will clean the stone, this initial cleaning will prevent smoke.


Make sure to remove any large chunks of food that are stuck on.

, You need to gradually increase the heat of your oven to prevent your pizza stone from cracking from a change in heat. Allow the preheat function to gradually increase the temperature of the stone. Leave stone in oven for at least an hour once it's reached 500 degrees.


The same method should be applied if you want an even cook on your pizza.

, The self-cleaning function on your oven will super-heat it, and is meant to burn away any excess grease or dirt.Allow the full cycle to run. Do not disrupt it unless there is a fire.

, Make sure to keep an eye on your pizza stone and oven. You should see grease bubbling on the surface of the stone. Do not open your oven while it is self-cleaning because of the smoke.


If you see a fire, turn off the self cleaning function and call the fire department.
Oxygen will cause an oven fire to grow when exposed to air and could create a dangerous backdraft. For that reason, keep the door on your oven closed.

, Fully cool your pizza stone overnight. The self-cleaning function should have removed any remaining dirt or spots on your stone.

, Begin by adding yeast in ½ cup of warm (not hot) water in a medium-sized mixing bowl. Slowly add the flour in small increments and mix well.

, Continue stirring until the dough is thoroughly mixed and retains its shape.

, Set aside in a warm location for approximately 30 minutes or until the dough has risen fully.


While the dough is rising, prepare the pizza sauce.

, Dice the red vine tomatoes and onions. Finely chop the garlic and fresh basil.

, When the oil is warm (not burning hot), add the garlic and onions and sauté for about five to six minutes or until the onions have become tender and transparent.


After the onions are cooked, add the diced tomatoes along with the tomato sauce. Add small amount of water, so the sauce does not become too thick.






Next, add the black pepper and the salsa. The salsa gives a spicy kick to the pizza and is used by many New York Pizzerias.







, Then, add the red pepper flakes depending on taste. Cover the saucepan and let the sauce simmer on LOW heat for about 5 minutes.


As the sauce simmers, form the pizza crust.







, For the crust, begin by covering a small area of counter with whole wheat flour. This is so that the crust does not stick to the counter.

, Remove the dough ball from the mixing bowl and spread it out onto the counter.

, Apply some flour to your hands and begin to knead the dough into a flat disk shape. This can also be facilitated by using a rolling pin to roll the dough. Make sure to roll it thin to make it New York Style crust. The final crust base should be around 18 inches in diameter.

, Around the circumference of the crust, fold some dough over itself to form a barrier on the dough for the sauce and toppings which will follow. It will also offer a grip to hold the pizza slice.

, To flavor the crust, customary in NYC pizzerias, use a cooking brush to brush some of the garlic butter to the crust base. Then, sprinkle some oregano flakes to give an herb flavor to the crust.

, Take the sauce off the heat and allow it to cool to room temperature. Using a ladle, place one to two ladles of sauce in the center of the pizza base. Using the bottom (rounded) edge of the ladle, spread the sauce over the whole crust making sure to keep the layer evenly spread. Typical New York Style pizzas have a very limited amount of pizza sauce.

, Make sure that there is not too much sauce towards the edge of the crust. Sauce should be concentrated about one inch (2.5cm) from the periphery.

, After sauce has been spread on the crust base, add the shredded fresh, mozzarella cheese to the sauce on the crust. This healthy variation uses nonfat milk cheese. Make sure to add a smaller layer of cheese so that toppings can be covered by more cheese later on.


The amount of cheese added depends on personal preference. A medium amount of cheese offers a good balance of authenticity while remaining healthier.

, The toppings can be chosen based on preference, however, an authentic NYC style pizza contains olives, green peppers, and Parmesan cheese.


After the toppings are evenly spread out over the whole pizza base, generously add mozzarella cheese over the toppings to cover them.







, Place the pizza on a large baking pan. Put it into the oven to bake. The pizza should be baked for about 20-25 minutes or until the cheese on the top has golden-brown color.

, After baking, remove the pizza and let cool for 15 minutes. Slice into large slices and enjoy the homemade goodness.


The pizza slice may need to be folded in one hand to be able to consume effectively.

Allow the pizza to cool briefly before slicing.",How to Make a White Pizza," Add 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of olive oil to a medium, heavy-bottomed saucepan. Place the pan on the stove, and heat it over medium heat until it begins to shimmer, which should take approximately 5 minutes.You can substitute vegetable oil for the olive oil, though you won’t get the same flavor.;
, Once you’ve heated the olive oil, add 1 small yellow onion that’s been diced to the pan. Cook the onion over medium heat for 5 to 6 minutes, or until it becomes translucent.Stir the onion regularly as you saute it to ensure that it cooks evenly.

, After the onion has become translucent, add 2 cloves of minced garlic to the pan. Allow the mixture to cook for another minute or until the garlic becomes fragrant.Stir the mixture as you cook it to ensure that it heats evenly.

, Once you’ve sauted the onion and garlic together, pour ¼ cup (59 ml) of heavy cream into the pan. Lower the heat to medium-low, and allow the mixture to cook down so the cream thickens up, which should take approximately 3 minutes.Make sure to stir the mixture as it’s heating so the cream doesn’t burn onto the bottom of the pan.

, After the sauce has thickened, take it off the stove. Mix in ½ teaspoon (½ g) of minced fresh thyme immediately, making sure that it’s fully incorporated.You can substitute marjoram for the thyme if you prefer.

, When the thyme is fully mixed into the sauce, mix in some salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste. Set the sauce aside, and allow it to cool completely before adding it to the pizza.If you want to give your white pizza a spicy kick, you can mix in a pinch or two of crushed red pepper with the salt and black pepper.

, To ensure that you’re ready to bake the pizza when you’ve finished assembling it, it’s important to preheat your pizza stone. Place it on the center rack of the oven, turn the temperature to 425 degrees Fahrenheit (220 degrees Celsius), and allow it to heat fully.If you don’t have a pizza stone, you can use a pizza pan instead. Just make sure to lightly grease the pan with olive oil before transferring the dough to it.

, For the pizza, you’ll need 12 ounces (300 g) of pizza dough. Use clean hands to stretch the dough into a circle. It should be approximately 12 inches (30-cm) in diameter and ¼-inch (6-mm) thick.You can use homemade pizza dough or purchase dough from the grocery store or local pizzeria.
If you’re having trouble stretching out the dough, you may want to use a rolling pin to help roll it out.
It’s okay if the dough is slightly thicker than ¼-inch (6-mm) along the edge of the circle. That will form a nice crust.

, To transfer the dough to the stone, you’ll need a wooden pizza peel. Sprinkle the surface lightly with unbleached high-gluten or bread flour, cornmeal, or semolina flour to prevent the dough from sticking to it. Next, carefully transfer the stretched out dough to the peel.If you don’t have a peel, you can put the dough on an inverted sheet pan and use it to transfer the assembled pizza onto the stone.

, Add 1 ½ cups (369 g) of ricotta cheese, ¼ teaspoon (1 g) of salt, ¼ teaspoon (¼ g) of dried thyme, and ⅛ teaspoon (¼ g) of coarsely ground black pepper to a medium bowl. Mix well until all of the ingredients are thoroughly combined.You can substitute fresh thyme for the dried if you prefer.

, When you’re ready to prepare the pizza, apply the white sauce that you prepared previously to the top of the dough. Make sure to leave a ¼-inch (6-mm) border along the edge of the pizza.You can use the back of a spoon to spread the sauce over the dough.

, Once you spread the white sauce over the dough, add 3 cups (339 g) of shredded mozzarella cheese over it. Distribute the cheese as evenly as possible so it covers all of the sauce.You can substitute provolone for the mozzarella if you prefer. A combination of the two also works well.
You may also want to add some grated Parmesan cheese over the mozzarella.

, After you’ve added the mozzarella to the pizza, place dollops of the ricotta mixture evenly all over the cheese. Aim for mounds of the ricotta mixture that are approximately 1 to 2 teaspoons (5 to 10 g) in size.You can swap the placement of the mozzarella and ricotta mixture if you prefer. Spread the ricotta mixture over the white sauce and then sprinkle the mozzarella cheese over it.

, Once you’ve assembled the pizza, transfer it from the peel to the preheated pizza stone in the oven. Slide the pizza carefully onto the stone by moving the peel back and forth gently.Take your time when sliding the pizza onto the heated stone. You don’t want to lose any of the pizza toppings in the transfer.

, When the pizza is on the stone, allow it to bake in the oven for approximately 15 to 20 minutes. You’ll know that the pizza is done when the crust is crispy and the cheese is melted and bubbling., After the pizza has finished baking, use the peel to transfer it out of the oven. Immediately sprinkle 1 tablespoon (4 g) of chopped fresh parsley over the pizza to garnish.You can substitute basil for the parsley if you prefer.

, When the pizza is garnished with the parsley, let it cool for approximately 3 minutes. Next, use a pizza cutter or knife to cut it into 8 equal slices and serve while warm.If you prefer a crispier crust, allow the pizza to cool completely for 15 to 20 minutes. Cut it, and place the individual slices back in the hot oven for 3 to 5 minutes or until the crust is as crisp as you’d like.

Salt all the meat generously on all sides.Wash your hands before and after handling raw meat.

, Once the oil is ready and the meats are salted, place the meats in the pot. Add the different types of meat at once. As you're working with a lot of meat, you'll likely have to work in batches. Make sure you can still easily move and flip the meat after adding it to the pan. Overcrowding will prevent the meat from browning properly., Use a wooden spoon to turn the meats over to make sure they're brown on both sides. Move the meats as necessary to get them completely brown on each side. Do not flip your meat over until the side touching the pan is completely brown., Once the meats are browned, remove them using a spatula or slotted spoon. Place the meats in a bowl and set them aside for now., Add your onions, peppers, celery, and carrots to the same pot you used to brown the meat. Turn the heat to high. Cook the vegetables until they're browned.You may need to add more oil if the vegetables start to steam or get stuck to the pan.
Cooking times vary depending on the precise heat of your stove and type of pot you're using.

, As soon as your vegetables brown, throw in the garlic. Cook the garlic for only one minute before proceeding with the cooking process., Take the bowl with the meats that you set aside earlier. Add the meats back to the pot with the vegetables and garlic., Once the meat is back in the pot, add both the chicken and beef broth. Then, add the can of crushed tomatoes. Stir all the ingredients until they're completely combined and then salt to taste., Let the mixture come to a simmer. Then, reduce the heat on the stove to a lower setting. Cover the pot and leave the ingredients simmering for two hours.Check the pot periodically while it's simmering and do not leave the pot unattended. This is a fire hazard.

, Use a spoon to fish out any pieces of meat that are attached to a bone. Strip the meat from the bones. Tear any larger chunks of meat into bite sized pieces and then throw them back in the pot.Wait a few minutes between taking the meat out of the pot and removing it from the bone. Meat will be very hot when it's just been taken out of the pot.

, If you have not already peeled and cut your potatoes, do so now. Then, toss the potatoes into the pot. Use a spoon to stir them into the remaining ingredients., Measure out your 4-8 tablespoons (60 to 120 mL) of Worcestershire sauce and pour it into your mixture. Then, stir it into the soup until everything is combined., Add your one pound (450 grams) bag of frozen corn and 14-ounce (392 grams) bag of frozen lima beans Stir everything together until the ingredients are evenly combined., After adding the corn and lima beans, let the soup cook for another 10 minutes. After 10 minutes have passed, you can serve your soup. Kentucky burgoo is traditionally served with hot sauce and corn bread on the side."

Use mason jars to control your portions.,
Make easy oatmeal for your mason jar breakfasts.,
Cook up some healthy coconut quinoa.,
Make a cherry compote and toasted mix-ins.,
Assemble your quinoa breakfast masterpiece in layers.",How to Make Healthy Mason Jar Meals1," Before you purchase a set of mason jars, make sure they’re graduated. Graduated jars have lines that measure the volume of the jar’s contents. That way, you’ll have total control over your portion size.For example, if you’re on a diet that calls for a 1/2 cup of oatmeal for breakfast, you can measure the appropriate portion and place it into a super-portable, half-pint sized jar.;
, Get a large saucepan hot over medium heat. Add the oats, water, and salt and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, simmer for three minutes, then remove from heat.Ladle equal portions of the oatmeal among the five mason jars. Let them stand uncovered for about an hour, or until they’re cool to the touch. Cap them, then put them in the refrigerator.
Make overnight, no-cook oats by portioning uncooked oats into the mason jar (for instance, 1 cup) and then adding your liquid (such as 1/2 cup of almond milk). Add any mix-in ingredients (nut butter, raisins, cranberries, etc.), cover, and refrigerate overnight. In the morning your oatmeal will be soft and ready to eat.
Pint-sized jars allow more room for additional mix-ins, but you can use half-pint jars for a more portable size and extra portion control.  
You can mix in optional added ingredients, like fresh or dried fruit and milk, before refrigerating your oatmeal or after you reheat it. It just depends on how portable you need your breakfast to be and whether you prefer a hot and cold temperature combination. Stir in maple syrup or honey for a healthy sweetener before reheating. Or, for a nice hot-cool temperature combination, reheat your oatmeal then add fresh blueberries, chopped strawberries, or a sliced banana.
Add different nutritious mix-ins to each jar to switch up your breakfasts’ flavors. You can add fresh blueberries to Monday’s jar, toasted almonds and coconut to Tuesday’s, raisins to Wednesday’s, and so on.

, Coconut quinoa with cherry compote is a great way to make your breakfast ahead of time and/or eat it on the go. To start, grab a medium saucepan, get it hot over medium heat, and add the almond milk and quinoa. Bring it to a gentle boil, then reduce heat to low and simmer until most of the milk has evaporated. Stir frequently while it simmers.Slowly stir in the coconut milk to the simmering mixture, adding about 1/4 of the can at a time. Stir gently until most of the liquid evaporates, then add the salt. Remove the pan from heat, then cover and set aside.Try not to reduce the milk completely. Leave a little liquid left so the quinoa has nice, creamy consistency.

, Get a medium frying pan hot over medium heat, then add the cherries, water, salt, and cardamom. Cook, stirring frequently, until the cherries release their juices and the sauce thickens, or about 10 to 15 minutes. When it thickens, stir in the maple syrup, cook for another two minutes, then remove from heat.You can add the cherry compote to either the oatmeal or the coconut quinoa.
To toast sliced almonds and shredded coconut, heat a small frying pan over low heat. Add the almonds, and flip the pan or stir them gently as they toast. Transfer the almonds to a separate dish once they have just started to brown. If your shredded coconut isn’t already toasted, use the same pan and technique to get them brown.

, Use one pint-sized jar or two half-pint jars, depending on your portion preferences. First, add the cooked quinoa, then a layer of the cherry compote, the toasted almonds, and, finally, the shredded coconut. If necessary, or if you prefer, continue to add another layer of each until you reach the top of the jar.Enjoy it cold, or if you prefer your quinoa hot, reheat it in the microwave for two to three minutes.

Prepare the humita filling.,
Fill the cornhusks.,
Cook the humitas.,
Serve.",How to Make Humitas," Peel the corn and set the cornhusks aside. Cut off the kernels and use them to make a puree.


You can use a grater to grate the corn by hand and thus make a puree.
Or you can put the kernels in a food processor and allow this device to turn them into a puree.;
, Put the mashed kernels in a bowl and add milk, basil, paprika, salt, and pepper. Stir the mixture for a few seconds until all of the ingredients are evenly mixed.


If you want to make sweet humitas, leave out the salt and add sugar in its place. Since the corn is already somewhat sweet, you don't need to add too much sugar to sweeten the mixture.

, In an oiled pan, sauté the onion and pepper. Once the onion becomes translucent, add the diced tomato and cook over low heat.


This mixture should be dry, so cook it over low heat until the juices have evaporated.

, Add the sautéed ingredients to the corn puree. Stir well in order to create a creamy and uniform filling.


If you want to use cheese in your humitas, this is the time to add it to the mixture.

, Place one husk on top of another, forming an X. In the center, place one and a half tablespoons of the filling.


Close the husks by making a small, firm packet so that the filling will not come out.
Tie the packet with the ends of the husks or with string.

, In a pot, heat enough water to cook all of the humitas. Once the water has boiled, lower the heat and add the humitas one by one. Cook them for approximately 45 minutes.

, When they are done cooking, remove the humitas and place them in a strainer. Let them rest for 5 minutes.


The humitas should be served warm, but not too hot, because your guests could burn themselves when opening the packet.

Turn puppies after one minute to ensure that they cook completely.,
Fry until golden on all sides.,
Rest finished hush puppies on a plate of paper towels to drain.",How to Make Hush Puppies1," The most common oil used is peanut, but vegetable, sunflower, or canola oil will do as well. As the oil warms to its appropriate heat, start mixing up ingredients.


If you don't have a deep fryer, don't worry. You can use a piece of bread to check your oil's temperature as well.;
, Use a fork or whisk to make sure everything is evenly mixed in., To dice an onion, cut it in half from end to end and peel off the skin. Cut off the tops -- the long, spindly end -- from each half. Then make long, vertical slices, following the onion's long, visible lines. Finally, cut horizontally across these long cuts to get small squares.


For even smaller pieces, stand the onion up on its end and cut each part in half once more before cutting your squares.

, Put the butter in the microwave for 30 seconds. If it's not totally melted, add 10 seconds at a time until it has just turned liquid -- it doesn't need to be hot. In a separate bowl, mix this butter into the buttermilk.

, You want all of your wet ingredients to be together, well mixed, in this separate bowl. It can help to whisk the egg ahead of time so that it is already scrambled.

, Pour your bowl of buttermilk mixture straight into the flours, salt, and sugar.

, You want a batter that is thicker than pancakes, but not so thick that it can't be stirred easily. Once it is all mixed in, stop -- you don't want to over stir. Use a rubber spatula for the best results.


If the batter is very wet and runny, add 1-2 more tablespoons of corn meal.
If the batter is thick and difficult to stir, add 1-2 more tablespoons of milk., A candy or frying thermometer is easiest, but it is far from your only option. Cut a 1-inch (2.5cm) piece of bread and drop it into the hot oil. If it is completely browned within 60 seconds, your oil is hot enough to fry with.


If the bread browns faster than 60 seconds, turn the heat down.
A kernel of popcorn will not pop until it's reached the right temperature, and can be used as another test subject when dropped in oil., A normal spoon should have the right amount of batter. Dip it in cold water to prevent the dough from sticking, then scoop a roughly 1"" (2.5cm) piece of dough into the hot oil.


Only cook 6-7 pieces at once to prevent cooling the oil with too much cold batter. If the oil gets too cold the puppies will take longer to cook and will come out greasy., Hush puppies will sometimes flip themselves, but if not you can use a slotted spoon to turn them over. This ensures all sides cook evenly.

, If they look nice and golden all over, they are ready to remove. While the exact time will depend on the size of the hush puppy and oil's heat, they shouldn't take longer than 2-3 minutes.

, This removes some of the excess oil from the surface, which helps the outsides cool into a crisp, delicious exterior. Enjoy!"

Make a light Caesar dressing.,
Add the ingredients for your Caesar salad in layers.,
Make the items you’ll need for a strawberry spinach salad.,
Layer the strawberry spinach salad ingredients in two large mason jars.",How to Make Healthy Mason Jar Meals2," You can make a mason jar salad using virtually any healthy ingredients, as long as you add them to the jar in the right order. The dressing goes first, then the least absorbent ingredients, like tomatoes or onions. Work your way up to the lightest ingredients on top, like kale or lettuce.If your heaviest and wettest ingredients are on bottom, your greens will be less likely to get soggy.

, Your mason jar salads should store for up to five days. To make them stay fresher longer, try adding chicken and other protein choices the day that you’ll be eating the salad. When you’re ready to serve, just shake the jar well, and eat it from the jar, or pour it into a bowl or plate.Mason-jar salads allow you to make these meals ahead of time so they'll be ready to go throughout the week. Instead of spending time every day preparing your lunch, you'll do it all in one session at the start of the week. In addition, the mason jars mean you can easily transport your salad to work or school.

, You can go with a store-bought light dressing or you can make your own. Mash the anchovies if they aren’t already, and add them to a small bowl with the yogurt, minced garlic, lemon juice, and Worcestershire sauce. Slowly drizzle in the olive oil as you constantly whisk to create an emulsion, then season with salt and pepper to taste., Start with 2 tablespoons of your store-bought or homemade light Caesar dressing. Then, in the following order, add the tomatoes, cucumbers, chicken (if you eat meat), Parmesan cheese, and quinoa. Finally, add the kale and romaine lettuce.If you made chicken the night before, diced up leftovers are a great addition to this salad. Otherwise, or if you’re a vegetarian, it’s fine to skip the meat. Add a pair of hard-boiled eggs or baked tofu if you want a vegetarian protein fix.

, First, whisk up your citrus poppy seed dressing by combining all the ingredients for the dressing except for the oil into a mixing bowl. Whisk the ingredients together vigorously as you slowly drizzle in the oil until they’re suspended in an emulsion. Measure out 3/4 cup (180 mL) of the dressing to use in the salad.Then roast your asparagus. Preheat your oven to 400°F (204°C) and break off the tough ends of the asparagus. Toss the asparagus with olive oil, salt, and pepper, then place them on a baking sheet in a single layer. Roast them for 25 minutes, until the stalks are tender but still crisp.You can use leftover asparagus or easily roast some fresh for your salad.

, The recipe allows for two large servings, so use a pair of 32-ounce (907 g) jars. Start by dividing the dressing evenly between the two jars. Then, add half of each ingredient to the jars in the following order: onions, cucumbers, strawberries, asparagus, chicken (if you’re a meat-eater), avocado, spinach, and almonds.Add diced or coarsely chopped chicken from last night’s dinner for an easy protein fix. Or, if you’re a vegetarian, you can skip the meat or substitute with a couple hard-boiled eggs, or divide a 16-ounce (454 g) can of chickpeas between the two jars.

1 cup all-purpose flour
1 cup + 2 tablespoons self-rising cornmeal
1/2 cup white sugar
1 large onion, finely diced
1 teaspoon salt, Instead of using a mixture of flour and cornmeal, get a more classic flavor by just using 2 cups of cornmeal. Use 2 eggs instead of 1 to help it hold together better., Green bell peppers are at the heart of Louisiana cooking, and some Cajun chefs can't do without them.

The mixture should look like a slightly shaggy dough at this point., Sprinkle a little flour on a work surface and dump the wet dough onto it. Use the palms of your hands to knead the dough for about 30 seconds to 1 minute. The dough should become soft and smooth.Avoid adding a lot of flour or your dough may become tough.

, Roll the log into a log shape so it's easier to cut. Use a bench scraper or knife to cut the dough into 6 or 7 even pieces. Let the pieces rest on your work space for about 10 minutes.If the knife or bench scraper sticks to the dough, dip the cutter in flour.

, Use the palms of your hands to roll each piece of dough into a ball. Set each ball on your work surface and use a rolling pin to roll them into circles. They should be about 1 cm thick.Don't worry if the circles aren't perfectly round.

, Use the bench cutter or knife to cut each circle in half. Take a sharp knife and cut a slit in the center of each half of dough. The slit will help the dough fry evenly., Set a large saucepan on the stove. Pour in vegetable oil, so it comes at least 3-inches (7.5-cm) up the sides of the pan. Turn the heat on to medium. The oil needs to be at least 350 degrees F (180 C) before you fry the fry jacks.You can check the temperature by inserting a deep-fry thermometer in the pan.

Bake the fish.,
Transfer the fish to a platter and serve.Whole red snapper looks impressive on a platter surrounded by fresh herb sprigs.",How to Cook Red Snapper1," There are many varieties of snapper, but red snapper has distinctive bright red metallic skin that fades into pink near the belly. When you're picking out a whole snapper, look for eyes that are clear and red. The flesh should be firm to the touch.


Snapper has become so ubiquitous that it's often used as a catchall term for any kind of white fish. For this reason it's commonly mislabeled as a similar but less desirable fish, like rock cod. When you buy snapper, be sure to do so from a trusted fishmonger so you'll know you're buying the real thing.Ask for the fish to be gutted and cleaned, unless you want to do so yourself.
You’ll need about ¾ of whole snapper per serving.;
, Be sure it's completely preheated before you put the fish in the oven.

, Choose a metal, glass or ceramic baking pan or dish that's just large enough to hold the fish. Line the pan with aluminum foil to prevent the fish from sticking.

, Red snapper is delicious with light seasonings that complement its fresh flavor. Sprinkle salt, pepper and lemon juice to taste inside the fish’s cavity. Add pieces of butter inside the fish to keep it moist while it bakes. Season the outside with more salt and pepper.


If you want the dish to have an herbal taste, add sprigs of thyme, rosemary or basil inside the fish's cavity.
For a complete meal, place sliced carrots, onions or potatoes around the fish in the baking dish. The vegetables will cook along with the fish.

, Place the baking dish in the oven and cook the fish for 45 minutes, or until the fish is cooked through. It can be a little tricky to tell whether the fish is ready, but you know it's done with the flesh is no longer translucent.


After 40 minutes or so, check the fish to see if it's done. You can gently pull back some flesh with a fork. If it looks white and easily flakes off, it's ready. If it's still a little rubbery, it needs more time.
Return it to the oven if it needs more time, then check again in five or ten minutes.

, To serve, use a serving fork or spoon to heap fish on individual plates.

Serve the filets with the herbed butter.",How to Cook Red Snapper2," Red snapper fillets should be purchased with the skin on, since it yields a delicious flavor and helps keep the fish together while it cooks. Look for fillets with metallic pink skin and firm flesh. You will need 1/4 to 1/3 pound per serving size.

, This high cooking temperature helps the fillets roast quickly so they have a flaky, moist texture.

, Baking the fillets on top of lemon slices helps them retain moisture. First lightly oil a baking sheet that has a rim. Slice a lemon into thin discs and lay them out on the baking sheet.

, One fillet should fit neatly over two slices, but if you're roasting large fillets, you might need three. Position each fillet skin side down.

, Sprinkle the top of the fillets with salt and pepper. You can also add a little cayenne, garlic powder, thyme, or any other herb to taste.

, Place the baking sheet in the oven once the oven is completely preheated. Bake the snapper fillets for about 15 minutes, or until they are no longer translucent. When they're done, the flesh should be opaque and it should flake easily when poked with a fork.

, Red snapper fillets can be dressed up with a simple butter sauce that brings out the best in their flavor. The sauce is quite easy to make, and it will take the dish up a notch. While the fish is baking, melt together the following ingredients in a saucepan:


2 tablespoons butter
¼ teaspoon paprika
1 teaspoon chopped rosemary
Salt and pepper to taste
A teaspoon of lemon zest

, Place each fillet on a plate atop two lemon sliced. Pour a little melted butter over each fillet. "

",How to Cook Red Snapper4," You may not be able to find skinless red snapper, but you can remove the skin once you get it home. The fillets will fry more evenly without the skin. Slice the fillets into finger-sized pieces to help them cook more quickly and evenly.

, Red snapper is so versatile that it tastes great with any type of breading or batter. You can use a classic dry seafood breading, Japanese Panko breading, or a beer batter.


To make a dry breading, mix 1/2 cup flour, 1/2 cup dry bread crumbs and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Add black and red pepper to taste.
Panko is a popular choice as well. This breading is sold in canisters available in the breading aisle in the grocery store.
If you like the taste of beer batter, mix 2 cups flour and one 12-ounce beer. Add 1/2 teaspoon salt and black pepper to taste., Pour enough oil into a stockpot to rise up the sides by two inches. Heat it over medium high heat until it reaches 365 degrees. Check the temperature with a kitchen thermometer before you proceed, since the fish won't fry correctly if the oil isn't hot enough.


Use an oil with a high smoke point, such as canola oil or peanut oil. Olive oil and other low smoke point oils will break down when they're heated to a high temperature.

, Be sure each piece is well coated on all sides. Try placing the fillets and batter together in a bag and shaking it to coat the fillets evenly.

, Place them in the oil a few at a time. Fry them for one or two minutes, or until the pieces float. Don’t crowd the pan or they won’t cook properly. The fish will fry very quickly, so monitor the pieces carefully to ensure they don't burn.

, Use a slotted spoon to transfer them from the pot to a towel-lined plate. The fried fish pieces are excellent when served with lemon wedges and tartar sauce.

Prepare the oysters for grilling.,
Prepare the grill.,
Decide whether to cook the oysters whole or on the half-shell.,
Prepare a seasoning for oysters on the half shell (optional).,
Cook the oysters.,
Remove whole oysters or oysters on the half-shell carefully so that they retain their juices.",How to Cook Oysters2," Scrub the outside of the shells with a scrub brush under cold, running water to remove all dirt. Discard any open or cracked shells. Let the oysters sit under water briefly, and then remove from the water while letting them drain.

, Use a charcoal grill or gas grill. Bring the grill to a medium high heat. Lay the oysters on the grill, flat side on the grill itself.

, Although there's little difference in method, how you cook your oysters will depend on whether you want to season your oysters beforehand or leave them unseasoned until right before you plop them down your gullet. If you want to season your oysters beforehand, shucking them is your best bet. If you'd prefer to season them after cooking, or perhaps not at all, you're better off leaving them in their shells while they cook.


How do you shuck oysters? Wrap the top of the oyster in a towel or put on heavy-duty gloves for protection. Slide an oyster knife into the hinge (backside) of the oyster. Twist the oyster knife by turning your wrist, like you're turning on the ignition in your car with a key.Scrape the blade across the top part of the oyster shell, twisting to open the muscle. Remove the top portion of the shell and loosen the oyster foot from the bottom shell with your knife.

, Oysters are great raw or cooked in their own brine, but sometimes a little seasoning makes the oyster shine even more. Look for ideas that suit your own tastes. For inspiration try out some of the following:


Butter and garlic
Butter and soy sauce
Butter, shallot, fresh parsley, cheese (Pecorino), cayenne, paprika
BBQ sauce

, Shut the lid to the grill and allow it to remain closed for 5 or 6 minutes. Open the lid and check on the oysters. What you're looking for will differ depending on how you prepared them:


Whole oysters should be checked for opening of the shell. You'll initially notice a line beginning to separate in the shell. Look for bubbling of the oyster brine inside that small separation. Throw out any oysters that haven't opened after 5-10 minutes.
Oysters on the half shell need to be vetted before and during the shucking process to ensure they're safe to eat. If the oyster is already open prior to shucking, or it doesn't put up any resistance during shucking and pops right open, throw it out. Oysters on the half shell will tighten slightly when cooked; their liquid will bubble and help cook them over the course of 5-10 minutes.

, Serve with drawn butter, lemon, or as-is.

",How to Cook Oysters3," Heat a deep fryer to 375° F (190° C).

, Cover the front of the oyster with a cloth and carefully slide an oyster knife into the hinge at the back of the oyster. Twist the knife with your wrist to break the hinge. Then slide the knife around the top of the shell, prying the top shell off when loose enough. Slide the knife under the bottom of the oyster flesh to remove the oyster foot from the bottom shell.

, Combine flour, salt and black pepper. Lightly beat together 2 eggs in a separate bowl. Drain 12 ounces of shucked oysters and dredge them in the egg mixture. Coat them in the dry mixture. Coat evenly and thickly but remove excess flour.

, Place the oysters, 5 or 6 at a time, in the deep fryer. Allow them to cook for 2 minutes until they are golden brown.

Wash your oysters thoroughly.,
Build a fire that's the size of your sheet metal.,
Place your oysters on top of the sheet metal in a single layer.,
Cover oysters with a wet burlap sack or wet beach towel and wait for oysters to fully cook.,
While you wait for the sheet metal to heat up again, enjoy your first batch of oysters with friends.",How to Cook Oysters4," Put on gloves so that the rough exterior of the shells don't scrape your hands while you wash any grit and grime from the oysters. Wash the oysters in a place where the runoff won't damage any of your yard and/or equipment.


Again, wash your oysters immediately before you plan on roasting them. Washing oysters too early before cooking can kill them, making them inedible.
Oysters from a purveyor are often washed when they are harvested, but it won't hurt to give them a once-over. You're better safe than sorry.

, In order to have a traditional oyster roast, you'll need a good sized fire and a big piece of sheet metal. If you don't have a piece of sheet metal, you can use a piece of metal grating, so long as the grating is small enough to contain the oysters.


Place four cinder blocks at the edge of your fire, positioned rectangularly so that they'll easily support the sheet metal when fitted over the fire.
Once the fire begins to die down, place your sheet metal on top of the cinder blocks and wait for it to get hot. (Of course, make sure your sheet metal is properly washed beforehand.) If splashing a couple drops of water onto the sheet metal causes the water to sizzle and disintegrate, the surface is ready to go.

, Make sure you have enough oysters. Budget anywhere from 6 - 16 oysters per person.

, Although burlap sacks work a little better than towels (and won't look unbecoming when they get steamed), towels are perfectly acceptable.


Give the batch of oysters anywhere from 8 to 10 minutes to finish cooking. If you prefer oysters to be less cooked, aim for about 8 minutes. If you prefer your oysters to be more cooked, aim to keep them under the burlap sack for a couple more minutes.
Throw away any oysters that haven't opened 1/4"" to 1/2"" after 10 minutes.

, The sheet should take a handful of minutes to properly heat up. Repeat process over again when sheet metal is hot enough to receive a new batch of oysters.

Thaw the octopus.,
Separate the tentacles from the body.,
Cut the middle piece and the head.,
Remove the beak and ink sac, if necessary.",How to Cook Octopus1," Frozen octopus can be thawed by sitting it in the refrigerator for roughly 24 hours.


Frozen octopus actually has an advantage over fresh octopus because the freezing process helps tenderize the meat. If you are working with fresh octopus, tenderize it first by beating it with a meat tenderizer.
Before cooking frozen octopus, however, it must be completely defrosted.;
, Use a sharp kitchen knife to cleanly slice off each tentacle at its base.


Note, however, that some recipes require you to cook the octopus whole before cutting it into pieces. Make sure that you read the instructions carefully for the recipe you plan to use before slicing up the octopus.
With the octopus lying flat on your working surface, hold up one tentacle and saw it off at the base. Remove the other tentacles in the same manner.
If you have kitchen shears, you can cut of the tentacles more easily with those than you can with a sharp knife.

, Separate the head from the middle piece and cut the head in half.


The middle piece that connected the octopus tentacles to the head is hard and unpleasant, so you can discard it. The head, however, should be cooked alongside the tentacles.

, When working with frozen octopus, this step is not usually needed, since most frozen octopus is sold with these pieces already removed.


Even if you work with fresh octopus, you can usually ask the fishmonger to clean the octopus for you before he wraps it up for you to take home.
Once you halve the head or body of the octopus, the ink sac and innards should be visible. You can cut these away and remove them with little difficulty.The beak might still be attached to the hard middle section you discarded, in which case, no further action is needed. If the beak is attached to the body, however, you can usually push it out by squeezing the octopus gently. Once it is exposed, simply cut it out and throw it away.

Cook your mahi mahi.,
Serve.",How to Cook Mahi Mahi1," The Ti plant is a evergreen shrub native to Hawaii with smooth blade-shaped leaves measuring about four inches wide and range from one to two feet in length.You can also use banana leaves.


Wrapping your mahi mahi in leaves helps the fish steam slowly, keeping its juices as it cooks.
If using frozen leaves, be sure to de-thaw them first.;
, For Ti leaves, cut each leaf along the center of the rib and throw the rib away. Look for fresh Ti leaves at a Mexican or Asian market. For banana leaves, soak the leaf in water to soften it (about 1 to 2 minutes) and tear 12 long strips from 1 or 2 leaves and boil for 30 seconds before draining.


Cut 24 more strips, each about 12 inches by 3 inches and set them aside.

, Carefully slice your mahi mahi into 12 equal pieces (about 2 in. by 2 in).


If working with frozen filets, defrost them before cutting.
Press lightly when cutting. The fish is delicate and you can easily crush the filets with too much pressure.

, Place your mahi mahi slices on a plate together and leave it in your refrigerator for at least 30 minutes.


You can drizzle lemon or lime juice, salt, pepper, fresh or dried herbs, or any seasonings you prefer onto the mahi mahi pieces while they chill.

, Arrange two strips of Ti leaves or banana leaves on top of one another in a cross shape. Your piece of fish should fit in the center of the cross without overlaying.


You will use the sides of the leaves to wrap your piece of fish for steaming later.
Top with grilled vegetables if you prefer.

, Begin with the lower strip and carefully fold the leaves over the filling by alternating strips in a cross shape. Use each new strip to fold the loose end of the previous strip over the filling.


Tuck the last strip beneath the packet.
Tie closed with the thinner boiled strips you prepared earlier.
Repeat for the rest of your mahi mahi pieces.

, Use a rack or steamer basket in a large pot with water until it rests just ½ inch below the top of the rack or basket.


Bring the water to a boil over high heat.

, Carefully place your fish packets in a single layer on the rack or in the basket. Do not stack your packets.


Steam in batches if necessary.
Cover the pot or rack and cook for 6-10 minutes (or until fish it barely opaque in the center). You may need to gently open one of your packets and cut to test.

, Gently remove your packets from the steamer and tip them slightly to drain any water than may have gathered inside. Serve hot or warm.

Cook the fish.",How to Cook Orange Roughy1,"

Orange roughy is growing in popularity, and now can be found at most grocery stores or fish markets. When choosing orange roughy, look for a fish that has moist skin, clear eyes, and does not present a fishy odor.
While orange roughy is most commonly sold in fillets, some locations may still sell the whole fish. If this is a problem, ask the fishmonger to clean the fish for you before you purchase it. Most grocery store or fish market experts will be willing to do this free of charge.

,

Orange roughy, which is to be grilled, should be seasoned with a small amount of salt and pepper on both sides before starting the cooking process. Drizzling the fish with a small amount of freshly squeezed lemon juice is also a good choice.

,

A grill that is being used to cook orange roughy should be quite hot. Start the grill at least 20 minutes before applying the fish for best cooking results.

,

Orange roughy has a relatively delicate texture. Because of this, grilling can be quite hard on the fish physically. To prevent tearing or damaging the flesh of the fish, consider placing it in a grilling basket. These are small ""cages"" which can be placed directly on top of a grill, and are effective at cooking a variety of foods which otherwise might not fare well on a grill.

,

In general, 4 minutes per side on the grill for the orange roughy is plenty of time to ensure complete cooking.

, Heat the stockpot over high heat until a rolling boil develops. Let boil for 5 minutes or so.


By letting the herbs and vegetables boil in the water before you add the octopus, you help draw the flavor of these aromatics into the water, creating the beginnings of a vegetable stock.

, Add all the tentacles and body pieces to the boiling water. The water will slow after you add the octopus, so let it come to a rapid boil again before pressing forward.


This recipe works best when the octopus has already been cut into separate tentacles and head pieces. Do not, however, cut the octopus further into smaller chunks. The octopus can still cook if cut smaller, but it is not recommended for aesthetic reasons.

, This could take anywhere from 20 to 45 minutes.Test the meat with a fork after 5 minutes. It will not be ready yet, but doing so will give you an idea of how it feels when it is still too tough. Pierce the meat again after 15 minutes and note the difference in tenderness.
When ready, the meat of the octopus should practically be falling off the fork as you lift it out of the broth.

, Boiled octopus is generally cut into slices and served with rice or in salad, but you can also enjoy it on its own.


You can strain and reserve the water, if desired, for use as seafood stock.

Preheat the oven to 250 degrees Fahrenheit (130 degrees Celsius).,
Place the octopus on the baking sheet.,
Cook the octopus until tender.,
Preheat a grill.,
Coat the octopus with oil.,
Char the octopus on the grill.,
Serve with olive oil, lemon juice, and parsley.",How to Cook Octopus3," Prepare a large rimmed baking sheet by lining it with aluminum foil.


The oven rack should also be switched to the lower-middle position so that the octopus has plenty of space inside the oven.
The majority of the actual cooking process will be done in the oven. Grilling is a great way to add extra flavor to the octopus, but the cooking method is too fast and will not create a tender enough octopus when used alone.

, Sprinkle it with salt and cover it with foil.


Create a loose seal by gently crimping the edge of the top sheet of foil to the rim of the baking sheet.

, This could take up to 2 hours. Let cool when done.


The meat should feel very tender when pierced with a small paring knife or fork.
As the octopus cools, remove the foil cover so that it cools faster.
At this point, you can also cover and refrigerate the octopus for two days or so. Discard any liquid that seeped out as the octopus cooked, however.

, Brush the grill rack lightly with 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of olive oil and preheat the grill for about 10 minutes to a high temperature.


For a gas grill, turn all the burners onto high and let preheat fully for 10 minutes.
For a charcoal grill, spread out a thick layer of charcoal on the bottom of the grill and let them burn down until white ash forms along the surface of the briquettes.

, After coating the pieces with olive oil, sprinkle them with salt and pepper, to taste.


The oil will give the exterior a better glow and a better crunch. It also helps the salt and pepper cling to the meat.

, Place the octopus pieces on the grill and cook for roughly 4 to 5 minutes, or until spotted with brown.After placing the pieces on your grill rack, close the grill and cook the pieces covered. You should only turn the pieces once, and do so during the middle of the cooking process.

, When grilled, octopus can be enjoyed on its own or sliced and added to other dishes. If you plan to serve it as is, though, the extra oil, fresh lemon juice, and parsley can make it an even more flavorful dish.

Heat the water and vinegar.,
Add the other aromatic ingredients.,
Scar the octopus.,
Poach the octopus.,
Cool slightly and serve.",How to Cook Octopus4," Combine the two ingredients in a large stockpot and bring them to a boil over high heat.


You can add the aromatic ingredients before the vinegar water reaches a boil, but boiling the water before you add these other ingredients can help keep the boiling point high, thereby making the water boil faster.

, Halve the lemon and squeeze the juice into the water before adding both halves to the water, as well. Also add the peppercorns, bay leaves, and salt.


Turn the heat down to medium and let the aromatics simmer for 10 minutes. Boiling these ingredients first will create a flavorful liquid for your octopus to cook in.

, Use tongs to dunk a whole, uncut octopus into the simmering water three times, letting it stay beneath the water for 5 seconds each time.


You could also wear thick rubber gloves and hold onto the octopus by the head with your hands as you scar it.
This method is best suited for a whole octopus. You will not be able to scar a cut-up octopus, since the purpose of this method is to cause the tentacles to curl up as they are rapidly dunked into the hot water.

, Drop it into the water and turn the temperature to medium-high, or until the water reaches a light boil. Let cook for 30 minutes, or until otherwise tender.


When tender enough to enjoy, the octopus should be tender enough to pierce with a fork.

, Let the octopus cool for a few minutes, just until it becomes cool enough to touch, and enjoy.


You could also cover the octopus and save it in the refrigerate up to 8 hours.

Like during grilling, orange roughy which is to be broiled must also be seasoned before cooking. In this method, consider sprinkling the fish with a small amount of Cajun seasoning to enhance the cooking process.;
,

To broil orange roughy, you will first need to set the oven to broil. In addition, spraying a large baking sheet or broiling pan with cooking spray is necessary to prevent the delicate flesh of the fish from sticking to the pan during cooking.

,

Place the prepared fish on the greased baking sheet or broiling pan, and place in the oven. Ideally, the fish should be about 3 inches (7.6 cm) away from the heat source for best results.

Choose halibut steaks that are fresh in appearance.,
Keep the fish moist.,
Limit how much you handle the fish.,
Season in moderation.",How to Cook Halibut1," The flesh should be a translucent, white and shiny. It should spring back when you press it. Avoid steaks that look mottled, discolored, or dull.

, Halibut is naturally low in fat, so it can dry out quickly during the cooking process. To prevent this, brush both sides with oil or melted butter before cooking halibut. You can also marinate the fish in oil or a flavored prepared marinade for a few hours before you cook it.

, Only turn the fish when it is halfway done. This will help keep it from breaking apart and will help ensure even cooking throughout the fillet. Turn the halibut over using a wide spatula or turner to make sure you flip the whole fillet.

, The flavor of halibut is delicate and light, so it's important to avoid over-seasoning the fish and losing its natural flavor. Avoid heavy spices or thick sauces. Instead, choose a light sauce or marinade to complement the flavor of the fish.

Wash the fresh tails in cold water thoroughly before preparing.

,
Use a kitchen knife to remove the blue membrane.,
Sprinkle salt over the surface of the meat approximately 1 hour before cooking.",How to Cook Monkfish1," Look for thinner strips, since they are easier to cook, and check for freshness. The meat should be off-white or pale gray and have a blue membrane. Avoid tails that have a strong odor, discolored edges, or brownish blood at the cut ends, as these are indicators that the meat is not fresh.

,, Be sure you cut it completely off, as it is inedible.

, Monk fish have a high-moisture content, and the meat will shrink or shrivel unless you draw out the water with salt first. Pat the tail meat dry to remove excess water and remaining salt before cooking.

Discard any mussels that have opened upon taking them out at home, or any mussels with cracked shells. Remember that any mussels that do not open after you cook them should be discarded -- this means that they were already dead before you started cooking them.
;
, Scrub the shells to remove any seaweed, dirt or other particles lodged on the shell. Rinse each shell individually, trying to remove as many of the stringy parts as you can.

, To debeard each mussel, just pinch the beard with your thumb and index finder and use a side to side motion to firmly tug it out. The beard isn't harmful and it is edible, just not particularly tasty, so don't fret if you can't debeard all of the mussels. Some of the mussels may have already had their beards removed, so don't worry if not every mussel has a beard. You can also use a knife to cut off the beard."

Avoid warm water, since this can promote bacterial growth and waterlog your fish.Always wash your hands in warm, soapy water before handling raw fish.
If the fish has not been gutted, use the thawing method below instead, then remove the inedible portions.;
, Pat the fish dry with a paper towel. This will remove additional ice crystals, as well as the moisture clinging to the fish scales.

, Thick slabs of frozen fish will take a long time to cook, but you can reduce this by wrapping them in foil or parchment pouches. The ice crystals in the fish will turn to steam, remain trapped in the packet, and help cook the fish more quickly. Increasing the cooking speed is especially important for high-heat cooking methods, as described below:


Grill fish in tightly closed foil packets, to prevent the outside charring while the inside cooks.
If pan-searing the fish, do not wrap the fish. Instead, cover the pan once the fish begins releasing juices, to trap steam that helps cook the fish evenly.

, Cooking the fish for a couple minutes will melt some of the ice on the exterior. This makes it easier to rub oil, butter, or marinade into the fish, and to get spices to stick.If you are breading the fish, you can place them fully frozen in a pan and cover with a thick layer of bread crumbs and spices., You can cook frozen fish however you would normally cook fish, or look in the recipes section for ideas. Frozen fish can take twice as long to cook as fresh fish, but you're still saving time by skipping the thawing stage. This is only a general time estimate, and the actual amount of time required varies base on the thickness of the fish. Check on the fish every couple minutes, using the following tips to tell when its done:


Cut a slit with a sharp knife. When done, the fish will be completely opaque near the surface, and just starting to become opaque in the center.If you have a food thermometer, cook the fish to an internal temperature of 145ºF (62.8ºC)."

You can disguise some three-day old chicken pretty easily, but it's much tougher to disguise some cod that's been sitting around for three days. In order to cook the best fish of your live, you'll want to get cozy with your fishmonger.


The best trick to getting the freshest fish available is to simply ask. Go up to the fishmonger manning the fish in your local grocery store and ask him what's fresh today. This will sometimes require being flexible about the kind of fish you cook, but it's for the better. Fresh fish almost invariably tastes better than old fish, whether it's salmon, mackerel, tuna, or swordfish — the list goes on.
The freshest fish will smell of the sea (briny) but not fishy; the gills should be bright and moist; the meat firm and springy; and the scales should not be dull or flake off easily.;
, The secret to cooking fish is knowing the temperature at which they're finished cooking. In order to do this, you'll want to use a food thermometer until you get the hang of things and can tell whether your fish is done by touching or merely looking at it. Most fish are perfectly cooked when they reach an internal temperature of 120° - 145°F (~49° - 63°C)., Ever heard of sushi? Or how about ceviche? These are two fish dishes that are not cooked at all. Unlike undercooked poultry, which carries the risk of salmonella, fish are okay to eat undercooked or even raw.Although raw or undercooked fish can contain parasites, the incidence rate of serious health concerns is serially overstated.You should feel very safe eating undercooked fish.
Some fish are better raw (or undercooked)! Fish like tuna are often given a light sear on both sides before removing from the heat and serving. Tuna tartar, famously, isn't cooked at all.

, Fish come in three basic varieties, each of which tends to be cooked in a different way and contains different nutritional properties. Knowing your way around the basic varieties will help you become a better cook:



White fish — cod, plaice, sole, and haddock, among others. These fish have translucent skin that turns an opalescent white when being cooked. Usually battered and deep fried, they form the basis of the classic English fish and chips.

Oily fish — salmon, trout, and sardines, among others. Oily fish are oilier than other varieties, but contain good oils (omega 3 fatty acids). They are often grilled, baked, or steamed.

Shellfish — shrimp, scallops, mussels, and oysters, among others. Shellfish are categorized either as ""crustaceans"" (shrimp) or ""mollusks"" (oysters). Commonly bottom feeders, shellfish are harder to digest than either white or oily fish.

, There are tons of different marinades that you can experiment with when cooking fish — soy sauce and honey works great on salmon, while olive oil and lemon work nice on whitefish. But ultimately, great fish — like great meat — tastes exquisite when you let the taste of the actual fish, and not the marinade, take over.

, Dry off your fish before cooking, whatever method of cooking you decide to use. Especially important for frying or pan-frying, excess moisture will cool down hot oil. Try to pat down fish fillets or steaks with a dry paper towel before cooking for best results.

, For best results, of course, you'll want to use fresh fish. But let's face it — fresh fish is expensive, a luxury that not all of us can afford. Frozen fish is a nice alternative, but you'll want to thaw your fish for a day in the refrigerator before cooking for best results. Oh, and remember to pat it down to remove excess moisture before cooking!


You can bake frozen fish, for example, but you'll want to double the normal cooking time from your recipe. Cooking frozen fish is very tricky however, and shouldn't be done as a rule of thumb if you can afford it.

, Perfect for summer months, grilling fish is both easy and enjoyable. With your coals or gas grill, you'll want to try to make a hot pile and a cold pile, so that you can cook the fish over low heat for the majority of the time, and then give it some color by finishing the cooking over high heat at the very end. Be sure to use the thermometer to get the temperature correct, and remember that fish cooks extremely quickly!When grilling fish, be sure to oil the grill and the fish generously before cooking. A well-oiled fish and grill will keep the fish from sticking to the grate when you choose to flip it. If you want to, you can also use an aluminum foil pouch to keep the fish in as it cooks; this saves cleanup time and cooks the fish very nicely.
Remember to choose the right kind of fish for grilling. Meaty, hearty fish like salmon, halibut, and swordfish work best on the grill, especially if you can get them cut into steaks.Delicate white fish like cod, flounder, or sole tend to fall apart easier on the grill, making for a less than ideal marriage between grill and fish.

, Probably the healthiest cooking option available, baking relies on dry heat and less oil to thoroughly bring the fish to perfection. Line a baking tray with wax paper or aluminum foil, thoroughly oil the fish (or paint with a dab of melted butter), and cook at a lower heat for a longer time. Here's some more specific pointers for you to remember as you bake fish:


If you're baking with a fish fillet that has a thicker center and thin sides, curl the thin sides underneath the fish as it cooks.That way, the sides won't be overcooked be the time the rest of the center is done.
Decide on your cooking temperature. Because fish are delicate and dry out easily, a lot of cooks recommend baking fish at low temperatures (think 250° F) for longer periods (20 minutes for fillets). For thicker (center cut) fish, many chefs recommend cooking at higher temperatures (400°F) for less time (15 minutes), although cooking times depend on the thickness of the cut.Try the 10-minute rule for baking fish, or ""Canadian cooking method."" Measure the cut of fish at its thickest point. For every inch of thickness, cook for 10 minutes at 400° - 450°F. Pro-rate the ratio for uneven thicknesses. For example, a 1.5 inch (3.8 cm) center cut piece of salmon should be cooked for 15 minutes at around 425° F.
For added flavor and moisture, think about adding herbs and aromatics to your baked fish. Lemon and capers or dill works great with salmon as well as with other types of fish. Bread crumbs work well with white fish, particularly tilapia.

, Pan frying gives you the option of being a little more creative with your fish. Not only can you dredge your fish in flour or cornmeal to get a nice crunchy exterior, but you can also make sauces from the juices leftover in the bottom of the pan. Here are some secrets for pan-frying fish to perfection.


Start off with enough oil and a hot pan. Oil your steel pan generously but not excessively and get it hot. Starting off hot helps cook the skin on the fish quickly, allowing it to adhere to the meat of the fish for nice presentation and an even nicer feel in the mouth.
Always pan-fry with skin side down to begin with. That way, your skin browns evenly and adheres to the meat of the fish.
After a minute or two on medium or high heat, turn the heat down to medium-low or low.Cook the fish slowly from here on out. Cook too hot at the moisture will evaporate from the fish before it's fully cooked, leading to a drier fish.
Flip once! Start off cooking the fish skin side down at high temperature. Turn the temp down significantly, and continue cooking for a little bit. Flip the fish once, and only once. Continue cooking the fish until your thermometer reads about 137°F. If you don't have a thermometer, you can tell that the fish is cooked if you can easily cut and flake the meat with a fork.

, The idea behind poaching is to cook the fish through by submerging it in a hot or simmering, but not boiling, liquid inside a covered pan. The liquid should consist mostly of water, but other ingredients are usually added to increase the flavor. White wine and salt are commonly used, along with herbs (thyme, rosemary, parsley, etc.) and/or vegetables (onions, celery, carrots, etc.).


Try poaching with court bouillon, an excellent poaching liquid. Court bouillon is commonly made out of water, salt, white wine, vegetables (usually mirepoix) and a bouquet garniMake Bouquet Garni, or herb bouquet.
There are two ways to poach: The ""deep"" poach, which is completely submerging the fish in a poaching liquid, or the ""shallow"" poach, where the fish is partially submerged in poaching liquid. Deep poached fish typically do not need a cover for the pot, while shallow poached fish typically do.
In general, your poaching liquid should only be about 160 - 180ºF. This means a slight shimmering or quivering on the surface of the liquid, and maybe a bubble or two there. For hotter, simmering poaching liquids, the cooking time will decrease significantly.
Which fish are great for poaching? Arctic char, barramundi, halibut, mahi mahi, striped bass, sturgeon, and tuna all work excellent in poaching liquid.

, Fried fish feeds the soul. Although it is less healthy than poaching or baking, it can elevate an ""ordinary"" fish like catfish into an art form. Fish are usually battered and then dunked into a hot pan filled with oil. Here are some basics for you to remember as you fry fish:


Decide on dredge vs. batter. You can dredge your fish in flour and egg, making for a lighter fish, or whip up a batter out of beer or buttermilk for a thicker, crunchier shell. Cooking times do not vary significantly for either method.
You'll most likely want your oil to be at around 375ºF when you start frying, and cook the fillets for about 3 to 4 minutes, or until golden brown. One trick for determining whether you've got the right heat for frying is to float a strike-anywhere match on top of the frying liquid. The match has a flash point of 365ºF, around the ideal cooking temperature. It's not a Martha Stewart-approved trick, but it will definitely get the job done!

, The crisp nuttiness of almonds marries perfectly with the rich, unctuousness of the salmon. A no-nonsense alternative to breaded salmon!

, That's right, a whole fish. In many cultures the eyes and cheeks of a fish are considered a delicacy. Stuffed with some fruits, veggies, or herbs, this makes a truly transcendent dish.

, This recipe involves fennel, which doesn't overpower the delicate trout. Add in ginger, shallot, and lemon peel, and you've got a nice little slaw to go over your trout.

, Cod can be baked to perfection with just a little bit of butter, lemon, and onion. Delicious!

, This bottom-feeding fish with two eyes on one side of its face is surprisingly delicate, seeing as it doesn't move around very much and thus has a high fat content. For a quick but tasty morsel.

Thaw for eight hours in the refrigerator.,
Thaw under cold water.,
Defrost in a microwave.,
Cook as usual.",How to Cook Frozen Fish2," The colder the thawing temperature, the less likely that harmful bacteria populations will grow on your fish. Thawing overnight is the recommended method whenever you have the time.Keep your fridge below 46ºF (8ºC) to keep your fish safe, and cook with 48 hours.


Frozen foods will produce water as the ice melts, so keep your fish in a container that can catch water. To avoid waterlogging your fish, you could punch holes in the base of that container, and place it above a second container that will catch the draining water.
While most fish will thaw within 8 hours, massive amounts of fish could take up to 24 hours.

, If you don't want to wait for hours to thaw your fish, seal it inside a zip locked bag and submerge it in cold water.This method usually takes 1–2 hours per pound (0.45 kg) of fish, and is the fastest method that still retains quality.


Never use water at room temperature or warmer, as this encourages the growth of bacteria..

, This method is not recommended for most circumstances, since the uneven cooking will usually make part of the fish rubbery before the rest of it is defrosted. It is typically much faster than the other methods, however, taking about 3–6 minutes per pound (0.45 kg) with most microwaves. Check on the fish halfway through, and flip each piece over.

, Once the fish is pliable, meaning it is no longer stiff, it is fully thawed. Cook it as you would a fresh fish, or take a look at the recipes section for ideas.


Note that the fish will still be cold once thawed.

Learn unique recipes.",How to Cook Frozen Fish3," If you're not used to cooking fish at home, or you want to try out a new method, review the basic instructions so you know what temperature and cooking times are necessary. Fish is often grilled, baked, poached, or sautéed.

, Different types of fish have different flavors and textures, so recipes often specify an exact type. Learn about cooking halibut, snapper, grouper, flounder, tilapia, or salmon.


Remember that cooking frozen fish without thawing will typically take twice as long as the recipe calls for.

, Unlike red meat, most fish picks up on flavoring after only 5–15 minutes of marination. This makes it easy to season and flavor even if cooking it from frozen. Make sweet and sour fillets, fish in cheese sauce, Cajun style blackened fish, or Mexican style fish for tacos.

, Some recipes call for less typical methods of preparing fish. These don't have to be difficult with the right instructions, and usually just involve cooking the fish along with other ingredients. Try cooking chowder, fish quiche, battered fish & chips, or kedgeree.

Know that almost all of the following steps can be substituted with other ingredients to your hearts content.,
Chop up your fresh fruit -- strawberries, raspberries, and/or blueberries, for the classic -- into bite-sized pieces.,
Cut your cake into flat strips or squares.,
Brush your ladyfingers or thin slices of cake with the sherry or flavored liquor of your choice.,

Add a third of the custard and spread evenly over the fruit.,
Top the custard with a thin layer of whipped cream.,
Continue layering -- cake, fruit, custard, then cream -- until you reach the top of the bowl.,
Consider topping it with more fruit, crumbled cookies, or a spring of fresh mint.",How to Make a Trifle1," A trifle doesn't need to be cooked and requires little hard-core cooking skill to put together. It can be made well in advance and is particularly adaptable if you feel like new flavors. When considering your trifle, know that you have some options:



Fruit: As long as it is bite-sized, anything goes. In general, softer, sweeter fruits that pack a lot of juice do best.

Custard: Pick a custard or pudding that matches your fruit, or use a vanilla flavored custard that will go with just about anything.

Jelly or Jam: Again, pick something to complement your fruits, but know that jelly isn't the only option. Adventurous cooks might use some honey, or even a chocolate spread like Nutella.;
, You can use any fruit you want, as evidenced in a later section, but for the typical English trifle you'll want to stick to the colors of the Union Jack -- white, red, and blue., Ladyfingers are the classic choice because they're already in strips and will soak up the liquids for the berries and liquor quickly. That said, a 1/2"" thick white cake makes an excellent substitute, so long as it is chopped up to easily placed pieces.


Angel food cake and pound cake also make wonderful substitutes, so long as you cut them with a serrated knife to roughly a 1/2"" thickness., Of course, you can skip the liquor for a youth-oriented dessert, but you should know it is a mainstay of the classic trifle. The usual choice is a cream sherry, which will go well with just about any filling or fruit, but you can mix it up depending on your toppings. Orange and lemon liquors, in general, go particularly well with most trifles.

, Try out a three-berry jam or raspberry if you're following the ""classic"" recipe, but remember that this dish is meant for experimentation. Slather the tops of the cake or ladyfingers with a generous helping of jam.

, They don't have to interlock like puzzle pieces, but try to keep them close together. Some people even start with a light layer of custard to help keep the cake in place as you're setting up. Cover the entire bottom of the bowl., Lightly mash the fruit, which unleashes juices that will drip down and soak into the cakes deliciously.

, Don't worry if some of it drips through or clumps, you just want enough of it so that all the fruit is covered. If you want to impress some party guests, take a look at the side of the bowl and work on getting nice, even, visible layers between the cake, fruit, and custard.

, This optional, and is best if you're using a flavored, and not vanilla custard. Still, the difference in textures between a thick, silky custard and light, airy whipped cream is a wonderful surprise, so feel free to use a little of the whipped stuff no matter what your recipe.

, Depending on the size of your trifle dish (or plain glass bowl), you may need to ration out your supplies wisely to make sure you have enough for even layers. That said, a little unevenness is somewhat inevitable, so don't worry about it too much. The final dish should have distinct, colorful layers visible.

, You can crumble op graham crackers for a bit of crunch, layer the top alluringly with fruit, or even dollop another layer of jam on top. Or, simply leave the top covered in whipped cream -- it's up to you!


A dash of cinnamon or candied ginger, with the right recipes, is heavenly."

Keep stirring until you've completely dissolved the sugar and cornstarch.If you want to use a fresh vanilla bean, cut the pod lengthwise and scoop out the seeds, adding them to the mixture now along with the vanilla husk.

, Stir occasionally, letting the milk scald. You'll see bubbles around the edges of the pot. Once it happens, keep stirring for another 20-30 seconds before removing from the heat., This ""tempers"" the eggs, which is the process of getting them slowly up to heat so that they don't accidentally cook., This should only take 2-3 minutes, and the custard should coat the back of your stirring spoon, not drip right off, when it is ready.

If you want to use a flavored extract, like vanilla, add it in now!, Make sure, of course, that water cannot get into the custard. Then simply cover it with a towel or cheesecloth and let it cool down to room temperature.

For an even smoother custard, run it through a fine-mesh strainer before pouring into the chilling bowl., If you want something a bit more flavorful for your trifle, consider mixing in the following ingredients to mix things up:


Chocolate syrup or cocoa powder.
4-5 tablespoons of lemon curd
Orange zest and orange extract
1-2 teaspoons instant coffee
Flavored liquor, such as raspberry or chocolate

, While you may not want to use plain yogurt, a fairly bland one is ideal; the blander the yogurt, the more the sweetness from the fruits stands out. French Vanilla or some other very basic flavor works best.

, This is optional, but doing so can add yet more sweetness.

The tips should also be firmly packed together.Asparagus spears can be fat or skinny. Thicker spears takes a little longer to cook, but both are equally flavorful and nutritious. No matter, which you choose, though, the spears should be evenly sized.;
, Clean the asparagus by rinsing them thoroughly under cold, running water, gently rubbing the tips to loosen any dirt, sand, or debris.


Asparagus is grown in sandy soil and usually has some debris in the tips. As such, a thorough rinsing is important.
Pat dry with paper towels once rinsed.

, Use your hands or a knife to snap off the bottom 1/3 of each spear.


Usually, this will be about 1 to 1.5 inches (2.5 to 3.8 cm).
These ends are especially woody and are generally not very appetizing.
You should be able to roughly estimate where the right breaking point is by gently bending the spear a few times near the bottom. The point at which the stalk turns tender will usually be the easiest, most natural breaking point, and you can usually break the bottoms off at this point with your hands.

, Use a vegetable peeler to scrape off the rough scales or knobs on the outside each stalk.


This is not necessary, but it does give the spears a clean look. It can also be especially good if you are using thick asparagus.
You only need to peel the lower 2 inches (5 cm) or so of the spear.

Boil the water.,
Cook the baby corn for 15 seconds.,
Transfer the baby corn to ice water.,
Serve or use as desired.",How to Cook Baby Corn2," Fill two-thirds of a small to medium saucepan with water. Bring that water to a boil over medium-high heat.


Meanwhile, fill a medium to large bowl with ice water. Set this bowl aside for later use.;
, Dunk the baby corn in the boiling water. After approximately 15 seconds, drain the water and remove the baby corn from the hot pan., Submerge the baby corn in the bowl of ice water. Keep the miniature cobs in the ice water for 30 to 60 seconds.


The ice water halts the cooking process and prevents the corn from getting any softer. When you feel the baby corn, it should still seem quite crisp.

, Drain the water and dry the baby corn. You can then serve the baby corn as it is or use it in other recipes.


You can toss blanched baby corn into salads, chilled pasta, or other cold dishes.
Similarly, you can add blanched baby corn to hot dishes during the last minute or so of cooking. Since the corn is already partially cooked, you won't need to continue cooking it much longer.

"

Boil the water.,
Cook the baby corn for 4 to 5 minutes.,
Serve.",How to Cook Baby Corn3," Fill two-thirds of a small to medium saucepan with water. Set the saucepan on the stove over medium-high heat and bring the water to a boil.


If desired, you can add salt to the water after it reaches a boil. Doing so can draw more flavor out of the corn as it cooks. Do not add the salt before the water boils, however, since doing so will increase the amount of time required to bring the water up to temperature.

, Add the baby corn to the boiling water. Cover the saucepan and reduce the heat to medium, then cook the corn until it becomes tender-crisp.You should be able to easily pierce the corn with a fork, but it should still have some “bite” or crispness. Do not cook it past the tender-crisp stage.

, Drain the water and serve the cooked baby corn while it's still hot.


Consider serving the corn with melted butter. You can even season the butter with fresh herbs.
You can reserve any leftovers by keeping them in a sealed container in your refrigerator, but you should try to use these leftovers within one or two days.

Simmer the water.,
Place the baby corn in the steamer.,
Cook for 3 to 6 minutes.,
Serve.",How to Cook Baby Corn4," Fill a medium stockpot with 2 inches (5 cm) of water. Set the pan on the stove over medium-high heat and bring the water to a steady simmer.


Make sure that the steamer basket fits inside the mouth of the stockpot. The basket should be able to rest over the lip of the pan without touching the bottom of the pot.

, Place the baby corn in the steamer basket, then set the steamer basket on top of the stockpot and over the simmering water.


Try to arrange the baby corn cobs into an even layer to promote even cooking.

, Cover the steamer and stockpot with an appropriate lid. Steam the baby corn until it becomes slightly tender.Check for doneness by piercing the corn with a fork. It should be easy to pierce, but it should still retain some crispness. Past the “tender crisp” stage, baby corn can become soggy and unpleasant.

, Remove the baby corn from the heat and serve it while it's still hot.


Consider serving the baby corn with butter or a drizzle of olive oil.
Store leftovers in an airtight container in your refrigerator. Use within one or two days.

"
"
Heat the oil.,
Cook the baby corn for for 2 to 4 minutes.,
Serve.",How to Cook Baby Corn5," Add 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of cooking oil to a medium skillet or wok. Set the pan on your stove over medium-high heat.


Olive oil works well, but you can use other cooking oils, as well. Consider using vegetable oil, canola oil, or sunflower oil.

, Add the baby corn to the hot oil. Cook, stirring continuously, until the corn becomes tender and light golden brown on all sides.


When bitten or pierced with a fork, the baby corn should feel tender but should still retain some “bite” or crispness.

, Drain the oil and serve the baby corn while it's still hot.


The cooking oil should added flavor to the corn, so you probably won't need to add any butter. You could, however, serve the corn with a sprinkle of fresh herbs or a dash of pepper.
Save leftovers in an airtight container and store them in your refrigerator for up to one or two days.

Preheat the oil.,
Mix the batter.,
Drench the baby corn in batter.,
Fry the baby corn for 2 to 4 minutes.,
Drain and serve.",How to Cook Baby Corn6," Pour 2 to 3 inches (5 to 7.5 cm) of vegetable oil into a heavy-bottomed saucepan. Place the saucepan on the stove over medium-high heat, and heat the oil to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (175 degrees Celsius).


Use a frying thermometer to check the temperature of the oil. If the oil isn't hot enough, the batter could get soggy before the corn finishes cooking. If the oil is too hot, the batter could burn before the corn is adequately cooked.

, Meanwhile, combine the all-purpose flour, corn starch, chili powder, garlic powder, and salt. Add enough water to this mixture to form a thin, paste-like batter.This is a very basic batter, but you can vary the spices as desired to produce a stronger or milder flavor.

, Working in batches, dip the cobs of baby corn into the batter. Use a fork to turn each baby corn, coating all sides.

, Toss several coated cobs of baby corn into the hot oil. Fry the corn until both sides are golden brown, flipping them once halfway through the process.


Continue working in batches to avoid crowding the pan. The temperature of the oil will drop slightly when you add the corn to it, and adding too much at once can drop the temperature too severely, thereby inhibiting the cooking process.

, Use a slotted spoon to transfer the baby corn from the hot oil to a plate lined with paper towels. Wait several minutes, then enjoy the corn while it's still hot.


Deep fried baby corn is difficult to save and will likely become soggy if you attempt to reheat it after refrigeration. If necessary, however, you could refrigerate leftovers in an airtight container for up to one day.

Soak four paper towels in water.,
Spread the paper towels out in a continuous sheet.,
Lay the asparagus on top of the paper towels.,
Roll the asparagus up into a bundle.,
Microwave the bundle for 3 to 4 minutes.,
Carefully unwrap and serve.",How to Cook Asparagus in the Microwave2," Spray or pour the 1/4 cup (60 ml) of water onto the paper towels. Squeeze them gently to remove any excess water.


The towels need to be damp, but they do not need to be dripping wet.

, Lay the damp paper towels out on the counter so the end of one overlaps with the end of the next, and so on, forming a connected line.


Ideally, if your paper towels came from a single roll, they will still be connected to one another. If you are using paper napkins or paper towels that have already been separated, though, they need to overlap by 1 inch (2.5 cm) or so. Otherwise, you will not be able to roll them up smoothly later.

, Place the prepared asparagus at one end of the long paper towel sheet, keeping them in an even cluster. Sprinkle with salt, if desired.


The cluster of spears should lie parallel to the short end of the paper towel sheet. Try to keep the asparagus spears in the center of the sheet width-wise, and do not let the tops or bottoms of the spears peek out or extend over the edge of the towels.

, Carefully wrap the paper towel around the asparagus bundle. Continue wrapping until you reach the end of the paper towel line.


You should be left with a tightly packed bundle when done, and the spears should be neatly tucked inside.
If you have extra room on either end of the roll, fold the paper towel under toward the open seam side of the roll to seal off the ends. If you do not have extra room, however, you do not need to worry about this.

, Cook the wrapped asparagus on full power until the spears just barely become crisp tender.Place the bundle in your microwave with the open seam-side facing down. This secures the seam in place, thereby preventing the paper towels from unraveling as the asparagus cooks.
This process essentially microwave-steams the asparagus. The damp paper towels heat up, sending steam inward to the spears. By steaming the asparagus, you preserve more crunch and more nutrients.

, Unroll the bundle and remove the paper towel with tongs. Serve the asparagus immediately.


Be careful as you unroll the paper towels. Since steam was created, you can expect a large amount of steam to come off the spears as you unveil them. Using tongs can protect your hands, but you should also keep your face back to avoid burning your face, as well.
Add a dollop of butter or garlic butter to the asparagus before serving, if desired.

"
"
Place the asparagus in a microwave-safe dish.,
Add water, orange juice, or white wine.,
Microwave for 4 to 7 minutes.,
Serve hot.",How to Cook Asparagus in the Microwave3," Arrange the asparagus spears in a microwavable dish with the tips pointing in the center, if possible.


The tips are a more tender part of the asparagus spear, so they tend to cook faster than the woody stalk. As a result, these tips are also more likely to become mushy if overcooked.
Since the center of the microwave receives less heat than the outside, placing the tips toward the center will help prevent them from cooking too fast.
Note, however, that if you are using a rectangular dish can cannot arrange the asparagus spears in this manner; you can just line the spears up evenly. They should still cook without any problems.

, Only add 1/4 cup (60 ml) of liquid. Sprinkle with salt, if desired.


If you want the flavor of the asparagus to shine on its own, or if you plan to season the asparagus or toss it in a dressing after you cook it, use water.
If you want to add a quick boost of flavor to the asparagus as you cook it, however, try either orange juiceor white wine., Cover the dish and microwave on full power until the spears become tender.


If the dish has a microwave-safe lid, use the lid, but open any built-in vents before putting it on or put the lid on slightly askew to prevent too much steam and pressure from building up inside.
If you are microwaving cuts and tips instead of whole spears, only cook the asparagus for 3 to 5 minutes at full power.
Stir the asparagus halfway through to promote even cooking.

, Let the dish stand for 5 minutes before serving, then transfer the cooked asparagus to individual serving dishes.


Be careful when removing the cover from your container. A great deal of steam can build up during the cooking process, and you can burn your hands or face if you get your skin too close.
Add a dollop of butter or garlic butter to the asparagus before serving, if desired. Toss the asparagus spears gently to coat them.

"
"
Mix the butter and garlic.Use a fork to thoroughly blend the softened, room temperature butter with the freshly minced garlic until the garlic is evenly distributed throughout.,
Add a dollop to the asparagus before serving.",How to Cook Asparagus in the Microwave4,"


The butter must be softened. If the butter is still chilled, it will be impossible to mix the garlic in evenly.
To soften butter, leave it out on the kitchen counter for about 30 minutes. If you are short on time, microwave the butter, in its paper wrapping, for about 10 seconds. Do not microwave foil wrapping.
If you do not have fresh garlic or do not want pieces of minced garlic mixed into your asparagus dish, you could use 1/8 tsp (0.625 ml) of garlic powder, instead.

, Place roughly 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of garlic butter on the hot, microwaved asparagus, tossing the spears gently to melt the butter and coat the asparagus.


If you want to flavor the asparagus as it cooks, use the tender-cook method outlined above and add the 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of garlic butter to the asparagus when you add the salt, just before you cover and cook it.
The rest of the butter can be stored and refrigerated in an airtight container for 3 days.

Combine the broth and seasonings over heat.,
Cook the baby corn for 3 to 6 minutes.,
Serve.",How to Cook Baby Corn7," Pour the chicken/vegetable broth into a medium frying pan. Stir in the soy sauce, salt, and pepper, then bring the seasoned broth to a simmer over medium-high heat.

, Place the baby corn in the seasoned broth. Reduce the heat to medium-low and cover the pan, then cook the corn until it becomes tender-crisp.Consider turning the corn once halfway through the cooking process. Doing so can help distribute the flavors of the broth more evenly.
Do not cook the corn beyond the tender-crisp stage. It should feel soft when pierced with a fork or bitten into, but it should still retain some “bite” or crispness.

, Remove the baby corn from any remaining broth and serve it while it's still warm.


Store leftovers in an airtight container and refrigerate them for up to one or two days.

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit (200 degrees Celsius).,
Toss the baby corn in oil.,
Roast the corn for 20 to 25 minutes.Place the baby corn in the preheated oven and cook it until they become tender and light golden brown.,
Serve.",How to Cook Baby Corn8," Meanwhile, prepare a baking sheet by lining it with nonstick aluminum foil.

, Arrange the baby corn on the prepared baking sheet and drizzle the cobs with sesame oil. Toss gently, using a fork, to coat the corn evenly.


If desired, you could also sprinkle the coated baby corn cobs with a little salt for an additional boost of flavor.

,


To promote even browning, stir and flip the baby corn cobs halfway through the baking process.
Ideally, the baby corn should be tender-crisp when you remove it from the oven. If you roast it too long, it can become unpleasantly soggy.

, Remove the finished corn from the oven and serve it while it's still warm.

Loosely cover the dish with its lid or with a sheet of microwave-safe plastic wrap.

, Cook the baby corn on high power until it becomes tender-crisp.


The exact cooking time will vary depending on the type and size of the baby corn. Canned baby corn has already been pre-cooked, so it should be done within 2 minutes. Smaller portions of frozen or fresh baby corn may require 3 or 4 minutes, while larger portions might need the full 7 minutes. Check the corn at 1 to 2 minute intervals to avoid cooking it past the tender-crisp stage.

Blanch the broccoli rabe.,
Store any you don't cook.",How to Clean Broccoli Rabe," The best way to clean a leafy green like rabe is to give it a cold water bath. Fill a large bowl with cool water. You can also use a clean sink if you prefer. Dump the rabe in, separating the leaves as you go so dirt can shake loose.Alternatively, you can wash the greens under cold, running water. However, submerging them is a safer bet for getting out all the dirt and grit.;
, Once you have the greens submerged, you need to agitate them, much like a washing machine does. Move them around in the water so that the dirt comes away form the leaves and into the water.Wash all the crevices in the rabe, including in and around the small buds.

, Once the you've agitated the rabe for a few minutes, walk away and let them soak. The greens should float to the top, while the dirt should sift to the bottom. Five to ten minutes is sufficient time for them to soak., If the greens are extra dirty, they may need another rinse. Scoop them out, and refill the water. In fact, the rule of thumb used to be three rinses.Modern day produce is generally not as dirty as in the past, but you may still need to rinse it more than once if you got it from the farmer's market., Unless you're blanching or boiling the broccoli rabe, dry it before cooking. You can place the greens in a salad spinner to dry them off. Do it in batches if you need to. An overfilled salad spinner won't get the greens dry.You can also lay them on a paper towel for drying and pat the top with more paper towels., As with many vegetables, the cut ends of the broccoli rabe may have turned brown in the time the vegetable was in the store. Cut off about an inch of each stem before you start cooking., If you notice any parts of the broccoli rabe look bad, don't be afraid to cut that part out. Look for brown or discolored areas, for instance. It's better to throw out areas that you're unsure about, as they can harbor bacteria., Pour water into a pot. Use one tablespoon of salt for a gallon of water. Place it on the stove over high heat, and bring the water to a boil. Also, have a bowl of ice water ready for after you cook the broccoli rabe.Many recipes call for the rabe to be blanched before other methods of cooking. The main purpose is to cut some of the bitterness., Drop the broccoli rabe in the boiling water, leaving it in the water for about three minutes. Scoop it out, and plunge it in ice water to stop the cooking, swishing it around a bit. Drain it well before you continue cooking it., If you don't use all of the broccoli rabe in the recipe, you can store the rest of it in the refrigerator. Keep it in a plastic bag. It will stay good for about five days, though it may last a day or two longer.Place a paper towel in the bag to help absorb moisture."

Write your shopping list out covering what you need - few things can annoy as much as getting home after your shopping to find you have forgotten a key ingredient.,
Find a suitable vegetable store.,
Choose suitable vegetables.,
On selecting your vegetables and fruits here are some things to try, some will look a little funny, but you'll find real experienced shoppers doing this anyway:


Smell the produce, this is best with fruit and melons, it should smell worth eating with a rich but fresh perfume.,
Here are some more things to consider as well when choosing vegetables:


In season: Vegetables are best in season and at their most affordable
Local: For some people, supporting local industry and not having vegetables travel too far is an important consideration.,
Know how to store and prepare your vegetables.",How to Buy Vegetables,";
, Places selling vegetables vary and some are likely to be more concerned about the quality of their vegetables than other places. For example, a place specializing in vegetables such as a fruit and vegetable store is more likely to be choosy and about the freshness and quality of their fruit and vegetables than a 24/7 store which sells all sorts of things for all prices. Places to look include:


Fruit and vegetable stores
Local supermarket
Farmer's markets
Delicatessens (sometimes)
Roadside stalls (often great, fresh bargains to be found)
Night markets
Wholesalers

, There are several considerations when buying vegetables, depending on what concerns you and your recipe.

, If it smells too strong, or odd in anyway, it may have been damaged or is old even if it looks OK.
Examine the color, this one is pretty straightforward (such as brown bananas etc), but some fruit such as pineapple display their ripeness by their changing from green to gold.
Examine it for lumps, bumps and bruises and insect damage. Do the store a favor and discretely hand in any damaged or old produce on their display as it #removes the risk of contamination spreading and makes their display look better.
Originally it was recommended to test by squeezing fruit near the stem (such as mangoes and avocados), but in reality this is a bad habit to encourage as this is a sure way to end with bad fruit, even if you take the fruit you tested. Just don't do it.
Talk to the people who work in that section - they know if a particularly choice range of new season produce has just come in, or some rare produce worth trying. Compliment them (regardless of the size of the store) if they have something good as it's always worthwhile to encourage this.
Leafy greens, broccoli, carrots etc should be crisp and firm, any sign of wilt or discoloring and its past its prime.
Particularly with tomatoes and soft fruits - buy & use good ripe ones for today and select slightly under-ripe ones to ripen at home for the next use. Don't buy all ripe food, unless you intend to eat it today as it could go bad before you needed it. If this sounds like it may be too complicated, shop when you need to.
Avoid anything that has sprouted when it shouldn't (such as potato, sweet potato, onion, garlic, ginger etc).
The common white mushroom should be closed (look at them stem pointing up - the mushroom should still be closed to the stem). When they open and reveal the brown underside, they age quicker. If they are open so the top curls up, they could be over-ripe which can make you very ill. Some varieties are OK like this, some aren't.
Eggplants are usually light purple when they are fresh and darken more as they ripen. Near black eggplants have little time left.
Ginger should be smooth with the smaller bulbs pinkish.
The ""Bargain"" rack should be explored carefully - occasionally you might find a win of surplus stock to make pickles and chutneys, but sometimes its only suitable for the compost bin. Save your money and buy fresh.

,
Allergies: Obviously, if someone in your family has an allergy to certain vegetables, either don't purchase it or don't feed that vegetable to them. Even more obviously, this does not mean a ""dislike"" of vegetables!
Variety: The best advice is to ""eat your colors"". Make sure to choose various vegetable colors to meet your nutritional needs. It isn't supposed to be hard, just obvious.

Obtain asparagus at their freshest point.,
Wash the asparagus.,
Cut the asparagus into spears.,
Place the asparagus into medium-sized jars (preferably Mason).,
Add salt.,
Add boiling water.,
Close the jars.,
Put the jars into a pressure cooker.,
Cool the jars.",How to Can Asparagus," When canning asparagus, it is recommended that you find the freshest ones in order to retain their nutrients as best as possible. Despite the popular belief, canned vegetables can contain as much nutrients and vitamins as fresh ones. Therefore, it is best to find fresh asparagus that are the most nutritious.;
, Once you have found the freshest ones, prepare them for the canning process by washing them under cold water. As you do so, you can break off the spears and toss away the tough base ends. By the time you are finished, you should have a pile of tender ends, ready to be cut and canned., You have the option of cutting them into different sizes (ex: one-inch or whole), depending on your preference. Once you have finished slicing them, you can either cook the asparagus pieces or leave them fresh before canning them.

, Be sure to pack the asparagus together as tightly as possible in order to save space. This will also discourage them from floating up from the canning liquid and becoming spoiled. Leave approximately an one inch gap from the top of the jars.


You have the option of leaving the slices raw or cooking them. If you prefer to cook them, leave the asparagus in boiling water for two minutes before packing them in the jars.

, Place about a teaspoon of salt for each quart jar that you have. Although this step is optional, it is recommended, as it enhances the taste of the asparagus.

, Once you have packed the asparagus in the jars, pour in boiling water until it is about an inch from the top. This will serve as the canning liquid, which helps prevent the asparagus from becoming spoiled.

, Tightly screw the lid on to prevent air from entering.

, Cook for about thirty minutes, or follow your pressure cooker's provided instructions. This will kill botulism bacteria and reduce the risk of botulism spores surviving and endangering your health.

, Once they have completed their time in pressure cooker, carefully remove them and allow them to naturally cool down to room temperature. Afterwards, they can be stored in a cool place below 30 °C (86 °F). Be sure that you label the jars. Note that the asparagus can last for up to seven months, depending on the condition of the vegetables when you first obtained them.

Wash the jars and lids.,
Sanitize and heat the lids.Set a small pot of water to a boil over medium to medium-high heat.,
Sanitize the jars in hot water.,
Dry the jars and lids.",How to Can Pears1," Use dish detergent and hot water to scrub the jars and lids, especially if they were previously used. Make sure to thoroughly rinse them with running water to remove any soap.;
, Once the water begins to boil, turn the heat down so that it stays at a simmer rather than a rolling boil. Dunk the lids inside the water and allow them to remain there for about five minutes before removing them with jar tongs.

, Boil a large stockpot of water on the stove top over high heat. Once the water has reached a rolling boil, carefully dunk the jars into the water using jar tongs, moving carefully to avoid burning yourself or letting the jars clunk together. Allow the items to sit in the boiling water for ten minutes.


Alternatively, you can use a hot water cycle on your dishwasher to sanitize the jars, as well. Do not add dish detergent if you previously washed the pieces by hand. If you do add soap, make sure that the dishwasher goes through a full rinse cycle before pulling the jars and lids out.
Make sure that the washing and sanitizing occurs immediately before the jars are ready to be filled. Both the jars and lids need to be hot in order to safely hold the hot contents you will be pouring in.

, Use a clean dish towel or paper towels to wipe the jars and lids dry. Allowing them to air dry naturally may cause them to cool too much.

Cook the pears slightly.",How to Can Pears2," Pears used for canning should be the same pears you use for eating. The fruit should be ripe and soft. Do not use under-ripe fruit or pears that have soft spots, bruises, or rotted portions.

, Sanitation is key in keeping the pears safe for consumption. Wash the pears by running them under cool to warm water, scrubbing the skins lightly with your fingers or a soft toothbrush. Use a knife or vegetable peeler to remove the thin layer of skin on the outside of each pear.

, Use a sharp knife to cut the pears into halves. You can also cut them into quarters, if desired. Cut around the inner core and remove any seeds or pieces of the core from the halves or quarters.

, Put the lemon juice into a large stockpot and add the pear slices. Toss the slices in the juice to coat. The lemon juice acts as a preservative to prevent the pears from browning after being cut.

, Bring the mixture to a boil over high heat before reducing the heat to medium and allowing the syrup to simmer an additional two to three minutes. This simple syrup will be what the pears sit in inside their jars.

, Pour the syrup into the pot of pears and mix well to coat. There should be enough liquid to cover the fruit slices.

, After the pears are sitting in syrup, heat them over medium-high until the syrup reaches a boil again.

, Reduce the heat so that the syrup comes down to a simmer again. Cover the pot and cook for about four to five minutes. You do not want them to become too soft, but the pears should be warmed thoroughly.

Begin boiling water in a boiling-water canner.,
Place a wide-mouth funnel into each jar as you fill it.,
Scoop the pears into the jars.,
Ladle syrup over the pears in the jars.,
Remove any air bubbles.,
Clean off the tops of the jars.,
Place the lids on the jars.,
Carefully lower the jars into the boiling water in the canner.,
Process the canned pears until sealed.,
Remove the jars from the water.,
Allow the jars to cool before checking the seal.,
Store the canned pears.",How to Can Pears3," Fill the canner about two-thirds high with water, or enough to cover the jars when placed inside. Make sure that a jar rack is placed at the bottom for your jars to sit on. If you do not have a rack, you may need to place a dish towel on the bottom of the canner to prevent the jars from moving around too much as they process.


You can use a large stockpot in place of a boiling-water canner if necessary. You will still need to place a rack or towel inside, though.

, You can fill the jars without a funnel, but the process will usually be a little slower and messier without one.

, Use a slotted spoon to transfer the pears from the pot into the jars. Focus on transferring the pears for now, rather than the syrup, to make sure that the pears are evenly distributed in the jars.

, Slowly pour syrup from the stockpot into each jar to fill up empty space. The pears should be completely covered by the syrup, but you need to leave at least 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) of empty space at the top of each jar.

, Take a plastic knife or smooth butter knife and run it around the inside perimeter of the jar to remove air bubbles trapped inside.

, If you got syrup or anything else onto the outside of the jars, wipe it off with a clean sponge or towel. Excess syrup can actually prevent the jars from sealing correctly.

, Firmly fix the lids onto the jars, but stop once you begin to feel resistance. Making the lids too tight can actually cause the jars to chip or crack as they process.

, Use jar tongs or a magnetic jar lifter. Make sure that the jars do not strike each other going into the canner and that they do not touch each other inside the canner.

, The processing time will vary depending on your altitude.Process pint-size jars for 20 minutes at altitudes below 1000 feet (304.8 m).
Process for for 25 minutes for altitudes between 1000 and 3000 feet (304.8 m to 914.4 m).
Process for 30 minutes at altitudes between 3000 and 6000 feet (914.4 m to 1.828 km).
Process for 35 minutes for any altitude above 6000 feet (1.828 km).

, As soon as the processing time has passed, turn the heat off and remove the jars using jar tongs or a magnetic jar lifter. Remove them carefully to prevent them from striking into anything. Set the jars out on a cutting board or dish towel set in a cool, dry area until.

, After 12 to 24 hours pass, check the center button on the top of the lid to make sure that the lid sealed. If the button does not move, the canning process was successful. If it ""pops"" up and down, it was not successful, and the pears should be stored in the refrigerator and consumed within several days.

, Successfully canned pears can be labeled and stored inside a cool cupboard.

Recognize the different rhubarb crops.,
Find plump stalks.,
Feel the stalk for texture.,
Examine the stalk color.,
Look at the stalk’s luster.,
Check the leaves.",How to Buy Rhubarb1," Knowing the seasons and crops of rhubarb can help you buy the most optimal one for your purposes. The first, or forced, crop grows in pots and is harvested between January and early February. This rhubarb is more tender and delicately flavored. The second, or maincrop, crop arrives between late March and early June. It has a more intense flavor and robust texture than the early crop.In some places, there is a third crop from late July to early August.;
, Look for rhubarb at your local farmer’s market or grocery store. Sort through the plants and look for stalks that are plump. These are often the best stalks of rhubarb for consumption.Some plump stalks may be green, which can indicate that they are older. These may be less flavorful., Good quality rhubarb stalks are firm to the touch. They should also be crisp, which you can test by snapping off a small bit. Getting firm, crisp stalks of rhubarb can help you turn them into a wonderful dish.Keep in mind first crop rhubarb stalks may be more tender in texture than second crop ones.

, Rhubarb can range in color from green to a deep red. Opt for redder stalks of rhubarb. These are younger, more tender, and sweeter. They may also taste better. Some stalks may have a slight green-ish tinge to them, which is normal. Buy these if there aren’t any perfectly, deep red stalks available., One final trait that can signal the quality of a rhubarb stalk is the luster. Check for shinier plants, which can indicate that they are young, fresh and delicious., Many stores and markets will remove rhubarb leaves because you can’t eat them. If the leaves are still attached, they can also help you pick out the best rhubarb. Find leaves that are a brighter green color. They should also be perky and not wilted. This can help tell if the stalks are older or haven’t received proper care.Rhubarb plants leaves are poisonous when consumed in large quantities.

Choose different types of plant.,
Grow plants from seeds.,
Plant rhubarb crowns.,
Buy seedlings.",How to Buy Rhubarb2," There are many different kinds of rhubarb. They have subtle variations in appearance and taste. Plant different kinds to enhance your flavor experience or stick to one you know you like. The following are types of rhubarb plant:McDonald’s Canadian Red: a deep red plant good for canning, freezing, or baking
Canada Red: cherry-red color that has a sweet, juicy flavor
Colorado Red: pure red good for jams and jellies
Cherry red: cherry-red color that has a sweet flavor
German-wine: green stems with pink speckles that have a very sweet flavor
The Sutton: green and red streaked that has a very fragrant, tender and sweet taste

, Rhubarb is a hearty plant that can withstand winters and drought. It may take two years for the seeds and plants to establish themselves, but once they do, your yields will increase every year. Buying seeds of your chosen rhubarb plants can give you a never ending supply of this tangy vegetable.Soak the seeds for 1-2 hours before planting to speed germination. Then add 2 seeds per 2- to 3-inch pot.Keep the plants in a warm area to speed germination. If they are in a sunny spot, make sure the plants have afternoon shade during the hottest months.

, Another way to buy rhubarb plants is using a rhubarb crown. This is a bare, dormant plant crown and its root systems. Purchase these at most garden and home stores, or ask a friend with a rhubarb plant to give you one.Place the crown with the dormant bud facing into the ground in a sunny spot. Plant additional crowns about 3 feet apart.

, Many markets and gardening or home stores sell rhubarb seedlings. These are rhubarb plants that are about 4 inches tall. They are also ready to plant in your garden. Purchase seedlings with green, perky and unbroken leaves. Check the soil to ensure it’s moist. Doing this can ensure you buy healthy, viable seedlings that grow into delicious plants.Plant your seedlings in a protected, warm spot. They should receive afternoon shade during the hottest months of the year.

Season the cabbage.",How to Boil Cabbage," Green cabbage is the most popular type of cabbage, but you can also boil red cabbage, savoy cabbage, napa cabbage or the Chinese cabbage, Bok Choy.



Green cabbage: The classic green cabbage has wide fan-like leaves that have a waxy rubber feel when raw. It has a sweet taste when cooked but can taste quite peppery when eaten raw.

Red cabbage: It's known for its dark reddish-purple leaves and have a deeper flavour than green cabbage. It's often used for pickling and adding colour to dishes.

Savoy cabbage: This cabbage has a softer and crinkly feel to it with deep greens and white veins. It's high in vitamin K, vitamin C, and fiber and has a mild earthy taste to it.

Napa cabbage: This cabbage comes in an oblong shape and looks closely like romaine lettuce with its yellow greenish leaves and prominent white stems. It tastes much sweeter when raw than green cabbages.Bok Choy: A traditional Chinese cabbage, bok coy is light and peppery or bitter to taste. When cooked, the white stems remain crisp while its leaves become soft. It is also quite watery compared to most cabbages.;
, You want leaves that are fresh and crisp, not wilted, brown or marked. The weight of the cabbage should also feel heavy for its size.


Wilted or damaged outer leaves usually indicate the cabbage is old or has been handled rather roughly.
The best time to harvest the freshest cabbage is during the summer. Cabbage tastes sweeter and better after frost as cabbage is usually grown in wet and cool conditions., While this may seem convenient, cabbage begins to lose its vitamin C and other nutrients as soon as it is cut.


Shredded or pre-cut cabbage may also be stored for long periods of time, depleting its taste.

, Discard any leaves that look wilted, worn or discoloured. It's common practice to discard the outer leaves since it is the most exposed to dirt and damage.

, Rise it under a stream of cool water. It's extremely important that you rinse the cabbage thoroughly as most farms use pesticides and other insecticides to keep pests and diseases away from their crops.


Organic cabbages should not have been grown with any pesticides or insecticides added but it's still important to rinse and clean your cabbage to rid it of any dirt, insects, eggs, or sand that may still be on your cabbage.
You can also consider soaking your cabbage in saline water or plain water for 30 minutes to better clean it., It is common to slice cabbage into wedges or into long, slim shreds but you can boil your cabbage in any form or shape you prefer.

#* Be sure to cut out the stem or centre of the cabbage.

Chop off any coarse stems that are at the bottom of the wedges you have cut.

, It is common to slice the cabbage wedges into long, slim shreds but you can boil your cabbage in any form or shape you prefer. You can also boil your cabbage in wedges.


Shred the cabbage on a cutting board by placing it flat side down. Slice as thick or as thin as you want the shreds to be.
Use a mandolin if you have one. This kitchen utensil will allow you to shred the cabbage by sliding it across a sharp blade

, The water should be about 3/4 of an inch (1.9 cm) deep or enough to place your cabbage in without overflowing.


Don't worry about having the exact volume of water as you'll be draining any excess water out.
Instead of water, you can use vegetable or meat stock to infuse flavour to your cabbage. Use liquid stock or mix powdered stock into your boiling water.

, Don't worry about overcrowding your pot. The cabbage will absorb the water and decrease dramatically in volume.

, Shredded cabbage can cook for about 5 minutes and wedges will take 10 to 15 minutes to cook.


Keep an eye on the cabbage to ensure it does not overcook. Finished cabbage should become tender. Overcooked cabbage can release unpleasant flavours and aromas.

, Use a slotted spoon, or pour it into a colander to get rid of the excess water.


If you've use stock to boil your cabbage, the water may be used again for soups or even to drink at its present stage.

, Since cabbage can be quite bitter, use salt to balance out its taste but don't add so much that the cabbage tastes salty.

",How to Can Vegetables," Select fresh, ripe vegetables that are free of blemishes, dents or bruises. Wash, remove peel and seeds (if necessary) and cut the vegetables into 2 inch (5 cm) segments, slices or cubes.;
, Keep the jars and lids hot until they are ready to be filled.


Jars and lids can be kept hot by placing them upside down in a pot of hot water or by washing them in a dishwasher and keeping them in the dishwasher until needed.

, Pack the clean jars with the vegetables and cooking liquid, leaving 1 inch (2.5 cm) of space at the top of the jars.


Add one tsp. (5 mL) of canning salt to each jar (optional)

, Place the sealed jars on the rack in the pressure canner filled with 3 quarts (2.8 L) of hot water. The jars must not sit directly on the bottom of the canner, and should not touch each other to allow steam to flow freely around them.

, Allow steam to vent from the canner for 10 minutes before adding canner weights or closing vents. After 10 minutes close vents or put on weights (depending on the type of pressure canner you are using) and allow the pressure to build.

, Check the gauge frequently to ensure the pressure remains constant.


For dial gauge canners, set pressure to 11 PSI (75.8 kPa) for altitudes of 0 to 2000 feet (0 to 610 m), 12 PSI (82.7 kPa) for altitudes of 2001 to 4000 feet (610 to 1220 m), 13 PSI (89.6 kPa) for altitudes of 4001 to 6000 feet (1220 to 1830 m), and 14 PSI (96.5 kPa) for 6001 to 8000 feet (1830 to 2440 m).
For weighted gauge canners set pressure to 10 PSI (68.95 kPa) for altitudes of 0 to 1000 feet (0 to 305 m), and 15 PSI (103.4 kPa) for altitudes above 1,000 feet (304.8 m).

, Carefully remove lid and allow steam to escape.

, Keep 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) of space between jars to allow air to circulate.


Listen for a small “ping” sound indicating that the seal of the jar lids has been sucked down and the jars are properly sealed. This could take around 12 hours.

Find a store near you that sells jicama.,
Choose small to medium size jicama roots.,
Look for roots that have smooth, shiny, unblemished skin.,
Store the jicama properly.,
Prepare the jicama as desired.",How to Buy Jicama," Jicama is becoming more common in both American and world cuisine, and as such it has become relatively easy to find. Many grocery stores will carry jicama in the produce section, especially between fall and spring when it is in season. If you can't find it at a regular grocery store, try an organic foods store or a farmer's market. Specialty Mexican grocery stores may also carry jicama.;
, When picking out jicama, look for roots that are smaller in size. As the root grows larger, its flavor dissipates and its texture becomes slightly tougher and loses its appealing crispness.

, Jicama's thick skin protects the flesh inside from rotting or drying out. Choose ones with smooth, shiny, and unblemished skins, as these will have the best-preserved interiors and will be least susceptible to bacterial and fungal infiltration. Dull and blemished jicama should be avoided. Check the stem end for green discoloration and do not purchase - this is mold.

, Once you have purchased your jicama, make sure to store it correctly. Jicama should be stored in a cool, dry place and left uncovered. Even a small amount of moisture can lead to rotting, so avoid putting jicama in the refrigerator. Jicama can be stored for up to 3 weeks.


If storing cut jicama, cover the root loosely with a paper towel and place it in a plastic bag. The bag can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks. Before use, you may want to cut away some of the exposed flesh if it has become soggy or discolored.

, Jicama is often consumed raw in salads or slaws. It can also be cooked in stir fries, soups, or other preparations. Its culinary use and flavor is very similar to water chestnuts or apples.

Put your pieces of vegetable into a pot.,
Fill your pot with cold water, completely submerging your vegetables.,
Set your stovetop on high and bring the water to a boil.,
Reduce the heat to a simmer, and cover your pot with the lid.,
Test if your vegetables are done by poking them with a fork.,
Drain the pot of water.",How to Boil Vegetables1," Run your vegetables under cold running water to prevent you from getting sick from pesticides or bacteria.Although boiling water will remove most of the bacteria that can be found on vegetables, you can still be exposed to it by handling them.


If you don’t plan on peeling a vegetable, make sure you scrub it with a produce brush to remove dirt.Dry off any vegetables you’ve peeled or washed with a paper towel or clean cloth.;
, Cutting your vegetables into comparable sizes will ensure that they all cook at the same speed. While you don’t need to get the size of your vegetable pieces exact, try to get as close as you can.


If you cut different sizes, smaller pieces will overcook, while larger pieces will remain raw.Root vegetables typically take longer to cook. If you want to cut down on cooking time, cut smaller pieces., Take your pieces of vegetable and place them into a deep pot that has an accompanying lid.


If you don’t have a big enough pot to boil all your vegetables, you can cook 2 batches of vegetables individually, in a smaller pot.

, Root vegetables such as beets, turnips, carrots, radishes, and potatoes cook better when they start in cold water. The gradual heat-up makes the vegetables resistant to overcooking, and ensures the outside and inside of your vegetable cooks uniformly.Fill your pot so the water rises a half-inch above your vegetables.
Seasoning with salt at this stage will add more flavor to your vegetables.

, Bring the water to a rolling boil. You’ll know you’ve achieved this when numerous bubbles begin to break on the water’s surface.


You can cover your vegetables while the water comes to a boil to quicken the rate of boiling.A full rolling boil can not be dissipated by stirring., Different vegetables require different cooking times. Root vegetables take longer than all other types of vegetable because of the starch that can be found in them. Often root vegetables are also larger than regular vegetables, which can also increase boiling times.Check on your vegetables often to ensure that you don’t overcook them.
Beets need to be boiled for 45 minutes to an hour.Turnips will take around 25 minutes if cut into smaller pieces.Typically potatoes will take 10-15 minutes to boil.Carrots will usually take 8-10 minutes, with smaller pieces taking anywhere from 5 to 10 minutes.Look online for specific boiling times for the root veggie that you want to cook.
If you continue to boil at the highest temperature, you’ll have water loss and run the risk of your water overboiling, or spilling out of the sides of your pot. This is why reducing the heat is so important after the water begins to boil., You can check on your vegetables every 5 minutes if you’re unsure how long you should cook them. If you’re having a hard time getting through the vegetable with your fork, or the fork gets stuck in the vegetable, you need to cook it longer. If your fork goes in and out, then your vegetables are adequately cooked.Frequently check back so you don’t overcook your vegetables. Over boiled vegetables get mushy.

, You can either use a strainer or a colander to drain your pot of water. Make sure that you begin draining as soon as you turn off your stove, because the vegetables will still be cooking while sitting in the water, and you don’t want to overcook them.

For broccoli, this would entail removing the thick bases at the bottom of their stems. For green beans this would include snapping off the inedible ends. Rinse your vegetables under cold water after trimming them.


For vegetables with tough stems like broccoli, cauliflower, or asparagus, you can use a knife to cut off the bottom parts of the vegetable.For corn, you want to remove the thick stem and husk it, or remove the green outer leaves.
Most frozen vegetables can be boiled before they are thawed.Leafy greens also posses thick, fibrous stems that should be removed before boiling.If you are cooking leafy greens like lettuce or cabbage, you will need also need to remove the core., All pieces of your green vegetables should be a similar size to ensure even cooking among different greens. If you are cooking leafy greens like cabbage, cutting the leaves into smaller pieces will help you fit more of the cabbage into the pot.


For some vegetables like green beans or broccoli, you may have to cut down larger pieces, to accommodate the varying sizes of each piece.

, Boiling softer green vegetables is more effective if you are starting off with boiling water. Because they are not as thick as root vegetables, and don’t posses a hard exterior, green vegetables usually cook faster.


Salt raises the boiling point of water and can also help season your boiled vegetables., Once your water is a at a rolling boil, gently place the vegetables into the boiling pot of water. You can use a slotted spoon for this.


Cabbage typically takes 5-10 minutes to fully cook through.Green beans will take anywhere from 5 to 15 minutes depending on how they are cut.Broccoli only takes 3-4 minutes to boil in water.Corn on the cob takes 5 minutes to fully cook through on the stovetop.It’s advised you don’t boil frozen vegetables because they may become mushy.However, if you must it should only take 3-5 minutes, depending on the vegetable.

Roast your dinner in a dark-colored roasting pan.,
Chop any side vegetables you're roasting alongside your meat into smaller pieces.,
Remove any bones from poultry roasts, such as turkey or chicken, wherever possible.",How to Make a Roast Cook Faster," This cooking process works by using a fan to continuously blow hot air onto the meat rather than just surround it, and as a result you can roast dishes and sides approximately 25% faster than with a regular oven. If time is a factor for you, you may wish to consider purchasing and using a convection oven.;
, Pressure cookers steam the roast by using a great deal of pressure and force the heat into the meat. This option will roast food in approximately 1/3 of the time compared to traditional cooking methods. The initial investment in a good pressure cooker is generally modest and has the added benefit of being ""green,"" which can save you roughly 70% of the energy that an oven uses.

, You can use a pan you already own rather than having to purchase new appliances or tools. By searing the roast for approximately 5 minutes per side, you will flash heat the meat in a much faster way and produce a crispy crust on the outside of the roast, which many diners enjoy.

, When placed in a dark gray or black pan, meat will cook and brown slightly quicker in the oven. A dark metal roasting pan will shave anywhere from 30 to 60 minutes off the total oven cooking time.

, Larger chunks take longer to cook, which will extend your cooking time. Use a kitchen knife to cut bite-size pieces.

, Use a sharp knife to cut out any bones from the meat, and you can reduce cooking time. Although removing bones can add approximately 20 minutes to your overall cooking time, it can be done in advance of cooking and saves you significant time in roasting by reducing the overall size of the bird.

Lay the egg on a smooth, flat surface.,
Spin the egg.,
Stop its rotation quickly.,
Watch what happens to the egg.,
For a quicker test, watch the egg's motion as it spins.",How to Tell If Eggs Are Raw or Hard Boiled1," There should be many of these in your kitchen: you can use a cutting board, a counter top, or even the bottom of the sink.


;
, Grasp the egg between the fingers and thumb of your hand. With a sharp twisting motion, spin the egg on its side like a top. The motion you use should be a little like snapping your fingers. It should now be spinning at a steady, regular pace.




, Extend your index finger as if you were pointing. Quickly place your finger down on the center of the rotating egg. It should stop spinning. Immediately remove your finger from the egg as soon as it comes to a stop.





Press hard enough to stop the motion of the egg quickly. It should go from spinning to still in the span of a second or so.

, Depending on whether your egg is hard boiled or raw, it will behave differently at this point. See below:





If the egg stays still, it is a hard boiled egg.
If the egg continues to slowly rotate or wobble it is uncooked. This is because the liquid white and yolk are still spinning inside the shell. The egg's center of gravity shifts as the liquid contents move around, causing the egg to keep moving., The test above should tell you accurately whether or not your egg is hard boiled. However, you can also get this information by carefully watching the way the egg spins — you don't need to stop it with your finger. This is convenient if you need to test many eggs at once.





If the egg spins quickly and steadily like a top, the egg is hard boiled. Its center of gravity is stable.
If it spins slowly, it has a major wobble, or it's tough to spin at all, it's raw. The liquid inside is shifting around as the egg spins and throwing it off balance."
"
Shake the egg.,
Look for tiny streams of air bubbles.,
Shine a flashlight through the egg.",How to Tell If Eggs Are Raw or Hard Boiled2," Take the egg in your fingertips and give it a gentle shake like a maraca. Concentrate on the feeling you get from the egg.





If the egg is hard boiled, it will feel solid like a rock.
If the egg is liquid, you will be able to feel the liquid inside moving and shifting as you shake it.

, Place the egg in a pot or bowl of very hot water (nearly boiling is best). Look for small streams of bubbles coming out of the shell of the egg. When the test is over, take the eggs out quickly unless you want them to boil.





If the egg is raw, you will see these bubbles. Egg shells are not completely solid — they are actually covered by thousands of tiny holes that sometimes can allow gases to pass through. Heating the egg makes the gas inside the shell to expand and pass through these holes, creating bubbles.If the egg is boiled, you probably won't see these bubbles because the gas was already forced out during the boiling process.

, Wait until night or head to a dark room with your egg and a bright flashlight. Turn the flashlight on and hold it against the side of the egg. This test works best with smaller flashlights so that the rim of the flashlight forms a tight ""seal"" against the egg shell.





If the egg lights up like a lantern, it is raw. The liquid inside allows the light through.
If the egg is dark and opaque, it is hard-boiled. The solid white and yolk do not let the light through.

"
"
Boil with onion skins.,
Dye the eggs with food coloring.,
Write on the shells.",How to Tell If Eggs Are Raw or Hard Boiled3," If you mark your eggs when you boil them, you won't need to do the tests above to tell them apart from your raw eggs. One simple way to do this is to drop some loose onion skins into the boiling water with the eggs. The boiled eggs will come out a nice beige color. This makes them easy to tell apart from your raw eggs.

The more onion skins you use, the more noticeable the dying effect. If you can, use about 12 onions' worth of skins to get eggs with a deeply-dyed appearance.
Skins from red onions also tend to dye the eggs more darkly than skins from white or yellow onions.

, Using food coloring or Easter dye kits makes it easy to keep track of which eggs are boiled. You can even color code your eggs: red for hard boiled, blue for soft boiled, etc.


If you're boiling the eggs in a small pot, you can add a few drops of food coloring and a few teaspoons of vinegar directly to the water as you boil. Otherwise, boil the eggs first, then soak them in a mixture of 1/2 cup boiling water, 1 teaspoon vinegar, and a few drops of food coloring afterward.

, This method isn't fancy, but it is quick and easy. Simply boil your eggs as normal, then remove them from the water and allow them to dry. When they are completely dry, mark them on the shell with a pencil or marker. For instance, you can try writing ""B"" for ""boiled.""


Don't worry — since you have to remove the shell to eat boiled eggs, this doesn't make your eggs unsafe to eat, even if you use ink.

Note that there are two types of cream - fresh cream and long-life cream.,
Choose quality fresh cream.,
Learn the different varieties of fresh cream available.,
Note that some of these cream varieties may be named differently in your region.

",How to Use Different Types of Cream," Both types of cream have different characteristics and this article is concerned only with fresh cream varieties. Fresh cream is rich, smooth and velvety. Fresh cream has uses in many different dishes, including as a source of thickening soups, making sauces taste richer and garnishing desserts. Naturally, cream also makes a substantial ingredient in its own right for some dessert dishes such as syllabubs and ice cream.;
, When purchasing fresh cream, it is wise to follow these guidelines:


Purchase only the amount needed; cream goes off quickly
Purchase in-date cream only; advise the store owner of any out-of-date cream on the shelf
Store well covered by a lid, plastic film or aluminium foil to prevent spoiling and tainting of flavour by other foods in the refrigerator
Use within days of purchase to ensure freshness

, Fresh cream breaks down into the following varieties (please note that the fat content described may vary depending on your dairy industry's regulations:



Double cream: contains a butterfat content of no less than 48%. The main features to look for are a cream that is rich and extremely creamy. This is a suitable pouring cream and goes well with fruit and chocolate puddings. This cream will hold its shape well. In the U.S., it is referred to as extra-heavy or manufacturer's cream and is rarely available through retail outlets. In Australia it may also be marketed as ""rich cream"".

Whipping/whipped cream: The minimum butterfat content is 35%. This cream is thinner than double cream. It is usually cheaper also. Once whipped, this cream goes well with cakes (topping and filling), on desserts (e.g., pavlova) and atop hot drinks (e.g., hot chocolate). In the U.S., this would be referred to as ""heavy whipping"" cream. If it has between 30-36% butterfat, it is referred to as ""whipping"" or ""light whipping"" cream. In Australia it may also be marketed as ""thickened cream"".

Single cream: The butterfat content of single cream is no less than 18%. Single cream is a pouring cream that goes well with fruit salad and as a coffee milk substitute for those who like a richer taste in their coffee. Single cream is also the best cream for adding to sauces, soups, stocks, and in casserole dishes.

Half-cream/light cream: With a butterfat content of no less than 12%, half-cream is great for people who find the taste of cream too rich. Like single cream,, half-cream works well with coffee and can also be used on fruit salads where the taste of the cream should not overwhelm the dish. Try dipping a biscuit or cookie in it for an extravagant treat.

Clotted cream: This cream contains a minimum butterfat content of 55%. It is produced by a special process; the cream is heated to 82ºC/180ºF. The crust of the cooled cream is removed and is the clotted portion of the cream. It goes perfectly with scones and jam.

Crème fraîche: This cream is a mixture of sour cream and fresh cream, and has a touch of buttermilk. Its taste is rich and slightly sour. Best used for soups, desserts and as one ingredient in Asian-inspired dipping sauces.

Buy the milk last.,
Pick the milk with the furthest use by date.,
Put the milk in a refrigerator as soon as you get home.,
Consume the milk within five to seven days of its printed sell-by date.Food specialists recommend that once opened, it is best to finish the milk in three days.,
Store milk on the refrigerator shelves.,
Take some measures to avoid contamination or spoiling of your milk.,
Freeze milk to keep for a long time.,
Refrigerate canned and UHT milk.,
Keep powdered milk in a cool and dry place.,
Remember that chocolate milk goes bad.",How to Store Milk," Milk should be constantly stored at 39°F (4°C) and by carting it around the supermarket while you casually select your other groceries and browse the cereal aisle, it can really warm up.;
, Look towards the back of the fridge where they usually store the newest milk.

, If you have a long trip before you arrive home, keep a cooler bag in the car to store the milk in.

, Often it is better to buy small bottles more often.


Open the bottles or cartons in the order you bought them. Place the oldest bottles towards the front of the fridge and use them first, because if it's first in, it's first out.

, Most people keep their milk on the door, but it is best to keep it on the shelves where it is cooler and has a more stable temperature., Even when it's refrigerated, you can help it last longer:


Keep the lids on the bottle. Tightly screw the lid on so that the milk doesn't absorb any odours from strong smelling food. If you want to be extra careful store the milk separately from other foods.
Never return unused milk back into the original bottle. Once it spends any time at room temperature, milk spoils quickly. When people have unused milk from a jug, especially in restaurants, it is often put back in the bottle which can easily create spoilage. Don't do this.
Avoid exposing the milk to light. Light can destroy many of the vitamins and nutrients in milk such as vitamin D and riboflavin.Maintain the cleanliness in your fridge. Milk can easily pick up any odors. Keep all food in your fridge sealed so they don't get a chance to contaminate your milk.

, You can freeze milk for up to 3 months. After thawing, the texture and taste may be a little affected, but the milk will still be safe and usable, especially if used in cooking or mixed with anything else.. Make sure the container you're freezing it in has a little room at the top, to allow for expansion as it freeze.


Always thaw milk in the fridge and if it separates beat it up with an electric blender.
For the best results freeze skim milk. Condensed and evaporated milk also freeze well.

, Even though you buy ultra-heat treated milk at room temperature, when opened it must be transferred to an airtight container, refrigerated and consumed within three days.

, Once opened, powdered milk should be consumed within a month. After being made up, reconstituted powder milk should be transferred to an airtight container, refrigerated and consumed within three days.

, Flavored milks are more tricky to tell if they are bad because of their high sugar content. Like regular milk, chocolate milk lasts for about a week.

Combine all ingredients.,
Make adjustments.,
Knead by hand.,
Let the dough rest for one hour (optional).,
Divide the dough.,
Roll the dough by hand.,
Use a pasta machine instead.,
Cut the noodles.,
Cook the pasta or store it.,
Finished.

",How to Make Noodles," Start by mixing all the ingredients together, form. There are several ways to accomplish this:



In a food processor, pulse a few times to combine, then process for about 45 seconds.In a stand mixer, combine with a flat beater for 30–60 seconds. Switch to a dough hook attachment and mix at medium speed for another 2 minutes.By hand, add flour and salt to a bowl and form a 4 inch (10 cm) ""well"" in the center. Beat eggs and egg yolks together, then pour into the well. Slowly push flour into the egg with a fork, until you've formed a soft dough.;
, The brand of flour, size of eggs, and humidity in the air all affect the dough. If the mixture isn't combining smoothly, adjust the recipe:If your dough feels wet and tacky, add a spoonful of flour at a time until it feels firm.
If your dough is so dry it won't combine or breaks apart when held, mist it with water or spatter a few drops with your fingertips. Do not do this for minor cracks.

, Place the dough on a floured surface and fold in any remaining flour by hand or with a bench knife. Knead the dough by pressing it down and forward with the flat of your hand. Rotate and repeat until the dough is smooth and firm, and no air bubbles are visible when you slice into it.This takes about 10 minutes if you combined the ingredients by hand, and only 1–2 minutes if you used a food processor or mixer., Over time, moisture will distribute more evenly in the dough. This makes the dough easier to handle, and makes softer, less rubbery pasta. If you have some experience handling dough, you can skip this step without major problems., Roll the dough by hand into a cylinder. Cut the cylinder into six equal pieces. For the steps below, work with one piece at a time.


Sprinkle flour over any dough you aren't currently using, and cover with a towel or plastic wrap., If you don't have a pasta machine, flour a counter top and roll the pasta out by hand. This takes some muscle and time, so think of it as a baker's exercise plan. Each piece of dough should roll into a rectangle 6 inches (15 cm) wide and 20 inches (50 cm) long. When finished, it should be transparent enough to see your fingers through it.Lift it off the counter frequently. Dust with more flour to prevent sticking.
The heavier the rolling pin, the faster this will be.

, A pasta machine saves you time and effort, but you'll need to know how to use it correctly. A hand-cranked machine is the cheapest option, but you can use an attachment for kitchen mixers instead.Set the machine to its widest setting. Press the dough to a flat rectangle and send it through.
Fold one end over the center, then the other, making a stack of three layers of dough. Flour lightly and roll it through again. Repeat at least three times to add chewy texture. Repeat this technique if your pasta tears.
Set the machine to a slightly narrower setting. Dust with flour and send the dough through, without folding. Repeat with increasingly narrower settings, until desired thickness is reached (typically the third-to-last setting or further)., You can use a pizza cutter, a sharp knife, or a pasta cutting machine. This same dough can be used to form noodles of any size. Fold the dough strips into tubes to make macaroni. Pinch dough rectangles in the center to form farfalle.


Place pasta sheets between wax paper or a kitchen towel while you aren't actively cutting them. This prevents them from drying out.

, This dough is best cooked immediately, and only takes 60–120 seconds in boiling water.If you want to store it long term, hang the noodles up to dry over clean, plastic coat hangers or pasta drying racks.Dry until brittle, then store in an airtight container. Once dried, it should last several weeks.

Look for the different labels on eggs before you check the price.,
Ask your supplier to provide the eggs that you are seeking if they are not available.,
Try to prefer free-range eggs.",How to Understand Egg Labels," Here is a rundown on what you might see in a well-stocked supermarket:



Free-range eggs - these are eggs that come from chickens allowed to forage for food over a wide area of land, all day long. Usually such hens will be kept in a hen-house overnight to protect them from predators such as foxes. These eggs might also carry an ""organic"" label indicating that any feed given to the hens is organic in origin (see next).

Organic eggs - these are laid by hens restricted to feed that is free of chemical fertilisers, fungicides, herbicides, and pesticides.

Omega-3 eggs - these are eggs that come from hens that have feed containing around 10-20 percent flax seed meal. Such eggs have higher polyunsaturated fat and Omega-3 fatty acids levels than other eggs.

Barn-laid eggs - these eggs are produced from chickens that live in large barns. The chickens are usually divided up into large pens. The birds can stretch their wings, walk around, dust-bathe, perch and scratch around for food. They socialise as chickens should. Beak trimming may be carried out to prevent injuries. The food provided to the chickens may or may not be organic.

Cage-laid eggs - often the label does not announce this and it is wise to assume that without a label, this is your egg source. Hens kept in cages have trimmed beaks and very little room to move around. About 5 chickens can share a cage. They cannot flap their wings and they are unable to forage for food. The number of chickens per cage, the amount of space per cage etc. is regulated under the laws of different jurisdictions, so it pays to know the specifications under your local laws if you really want to be aware of the conditions such chickens are being kept under in your area.;
, A good quality store will provide a choice of egg labels so that you can make an informed decision on what to buy.

, The more people who buy these eggs, the more that this type of farming is supported and the better lives the chickens lead. It will also help to reduce the price if they are selling more free-range eggs.

Switch sour cream for plain yogurt.,
Use low-fat or non-fat Greek yogurt for a healthier substitute.,
Opt for full-fat yogurt instead of non-fat.,
Prevent Greek yogurt from curdling.,
Consider using crème fraiche.,
Try kefir cream.,
Choose a buttermilk and butter mix for baked goods.,
Select heavy whipping cream.,
Use cashews to make a vegan sour cream replacement.",How to Substitute for Sour Cream," If you are looking for a healthier option, then plain Greek yogurt and plain yogurt are similar in texture and consistency to sour cream and are excellent substitutes in recipes likes dips, salad dressings, marinades, and your favorite baked treats. For most dishes, you can use the same amount of yogurt as you would for sour cream, making the swap a simple one.Be aware that the flavor of your dishes may a slight tangy taste that is not as strong in sour cream.Make a cool dip for your next party by swapping out sour cream for yogurt. Mix a cup of Greek yogurt or plain yogurt with a tablespoon of chopped dill, a chopped garlic clove, and a teaspoon of lemon juice for a creamy, zesty dip that is perfect for dipping vegetables or pita chips.;
, Plain non-fat or low-fat Greek yogurt is lower in calories, fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, and sodium than sour cream, making it a healthy replacement. One cup of regular sour cream can contain around 480 calories, while a cup of full-fat, plain Greek yogurt contains around 220 calories. Greek yogurt is an excellent source of protein and helps fuel your body and metabolism, and it is full of probiotics, which can help aid in digestion.Greek yogurt comes in a variety of flavors. Choose plain Greek yogurt as a substitute for sour cream as it is most similar to sour cream’s flavor, texture, and consistency.
Top a baked potato with Greek yogurt instead of sour cream to cut back on calories. Mix some yogurt with a pinch of salt, pepper, and some chopped parsley or chives to create a tasty, healthier garnish., Plain yogurt is also an excellent and healthy substitute for sour cream. When using plain yogurt, select a full-fat yogurt over a non-fat variety. Non-fat yogurts contain added thickeners and stabilizers which can make its consistency very different than the consistency of sour cream., Because Greek yogurt has a higher protein content and a lower fat content than sour cream, it is more likely to curdle when it comes into contact with hot foods. To avoid this, wait until you are about to eat your meal at the table before you layer the yogurt on a baked potato, a taco, or a bowl of soup.If you are adding yogurt to a hot sauce, keep the temperature low and add the yogurt at the end to prevent it from curdling., You can try crème fraiche if you are looking for a gourmet option. Like yogurt, crème fraiche is a cultured product that has a similar creamy texture and consistency to sour cream. This rich cream is milder in flavor and can be used in both sweet and savory dishes. It has a higher fat content than both sour cream and yogurt, so it will not curdle when added to hot sauces.However, the higher fat content will cause it to melt if it is added to the top of a hot soup or placed under an oven broiler.Find crème fraiche in your local supermarket in the cheese or dairy department.

, Kefir cream is a versatile sour cream substitute that is cultured from cream and contains many beneficial enzymes and probiotics.You can try this option if you are trying to get more probiotics in your diet. This substitute is not as thick as sour cream. Because of its runny consistency, it is best used for baking or for whipping up homemade salad dressings and marinades.Because of its higher protein content, kefir cream can curdle when exposed to high temperatures. Add kefir to your favorite sauce or soup while on low heat or off heat right before serving., You can create a sour cream substitute at home by mixing butter and buttermilk. Buttermilk is sour milk, and it can be found in the dairy aisle at your local grocery store. To replace one cup of sour cream in a recipe, thoroughly mix ¾ cups of buttermilk with ¼ cup of butter.Because the mixture may not be as thick as sour cream, it is best used for baking or for salad dressings., If you are looking in your fridge trying to find a way to substitute sour cream or if your local grocery store has just run out, check for some heavy whipping cream to make a sour cream substitute. Heavy whipping cream has a high fat content and a creamy, thick texture. To use heavy cream as a sour cream replacement, whisk a cup of heavy cream with a tablespoon of vinegar or lemon juice to give it a tangy taste. The mixture should start to thicken and appear similar to the consistency of sour cream.Use this mixture as a topping for soups or mix it with chopped cucumber and dill to make a Greek marinade for chicken or lamb kebabs.

, You can create a vegan-friendly sour-cream substitute by using raw cashews, lemon juice, and apple cider. Soak 1 cup of raw cashews in water overnight. The next day, blend the softened cashews in a food processor with a dash of salt, 1 tablespoon of lemon juice, and ½ tablespoon of apple cider until the mixture is smooth and creamy. This recipe contains the same creamy, tangy flavor of sour cream."

Shift the balance of bacteria back to a healthier status that supports the immune system based upon our gastrointestinal tract naturally playing host to a variety of bacteria which may be off balance.,
Consume required ""active, beneficial bacteria"" (called probiotics) in yogurt (meaning selected, living microorganisms) in your diet.,
Be aware that most yogurt sold at the grocery store is pasteurized and does not contain an active yogurt culture.

,
Check the various brands of active yogurt because some have different kinds of cultured probiotic bacteria.,
See research that suggests that one of the powerful probiotic bugs -- called Lactobacillus casei (L. casei) -- in yogurt and as an allergy fighter may decrease imbalances of the body's levels of histamines, including to balance immune substances involved in seasonal allergies and do absolutely help with digestion.

,
Use natural yogurt with active ""good bacteria"" in many ways in sufficient numbers to get benefits:


Top yogurt with cereal for breakfast.,
Read about fewer sniffles and ""ah-choos"" as people who suffer from allergies, apparently have these bacteria levels off balance.That's what a recent small study suggests.,
Consider topical (external) applications such as Remove Blackheads With Oatmeal and Yogurt and other uses on the skin.

,,
Use it rather than milk in cereal.
Add fresh fruit.
Try a little swirl of honey, preserves, jelly, etc. not refined sugars.
Eat it as a dessert.
Eat it as a snack.
Drink yogurt as a beverage.
Substitute unsweetened natural yogurt for sour cream such as for baked potatoes.

, Seasonal allergy sufferers in the study consumed either a probiotic-fortified dairy drink or a placebo drink for 5 months. And at the end of the study, those who had knocked back the L. casei drinks showed lower levels of immune substances that contribute to allergies.
""By the age of 2 years, 35% of children in a study have developed allergic eczema, a condition in which the skin becomes irritated, red and itchy. But children who had received probiotics were half as likely to develop the skin condition. This cut in eczema risk is the most spectacular, single result to come out of studies on preventing allergic disease. Exactly why friendly gut bacteria might protect against allergies is unclear, but the effect may be an extension of the hygiene hypothesis. This hypothesis holds that the worldwide growth in allergic disease is in part due to our increasingly sterile surroundings. When babies are exposed to germs early on, some experts suggest, their immune systems are steered toward infection-fighting mode -- and away from the tendency to overreact to normally benign substances. Support for this idea comes from studies showing that infants who have more colds and other infections have lower asthma rates later in life. The results of this study suggest that intestine-dwelling bacteria may also play an important role in pushing the immune system away from allergic reactions.,,"

Form and seal the mini-Stromboli.,
Bake the mini-Stromboli.",How to Make Mini Stromboli1," Turn the oven on to 350 degrees F (180 C). Get out a baking sheet and lay a sheet of parchment paper on it. Open one 12-ounce (339 g) can of refrigerated crescent dinner rolls OR one 16-ounce (467 g) can of refrigerated biscuits.The parchment paper will keep the mini-Stromboli from sticking to the sheet.;
, If you're using crescents, unroll the dough on your baking sheet and set them apart. Leave them in the triangle shapes. If you're using biscuit dough, set each biscuit on the sheet. Use a rolling to gently roll each biscuit into a circle about 5-inches (12 cm) in size.You don't need to roll out the crescent dough, since it's already thin.

, Divide your meats among the dough. If you used crescents, place the fillings on the large end of the triangle. If you used biscuits, put the fillings in the center. You'll need to divide these fillings among the dough pieces:16 slices pepperoni
12 slices hard salami
12 slices cooked ham
1 cup (113 g) shredded mozzarella cheese
Black pepper to taste
1⁄8 teaspoon garlic powder
2 teaspoons grated parmesan cheese

, If you used crescent rolls, hold the large end of the dough and roll it up, so you end with the pointed tip. The filling should be contained in the center of the dough. If you used biscuit dough, fold each circle in half and pinch the edges to make a tight seal. You can shape the mini-Stromboli into half-moons, balls, or rectangles.Set the mini-Stromboli on your prepared baking sheet with the sealed sides facing down.

, Put the baking sheet in the preheated oven and bake the mini-Stromboli for 11 to 13 minutes. They should turn just a little brown once they've cooked and they'll puff up slightly.You can serve the mini-Stromboli with 1 cup (225 g) of your favorite marinara sauce.

Refrigerate for 2 hours or overnight before serving.",How to Make Noodle Salad2," As with the recipe above, you want to use at least a few quarts so that you can cover the pasta completely. Wait until it reaches a full, rolling boil before proceeding.


Add a few pinches of salt to the water for flavor and to get the water slightly hotter.You can also pour in a dash of olive oil to keep the noodles from sticking to each other.

, Add the dry spaghetti to the water carefully. If it is too long, you can break it in half to get it to fit in the pot.


Cook according to package directions. Use the shortest recommended cooking time to leave your pasta slightly firm (or al dente).

, Carefully pour the al dente pasta into a strainer in the sink. Rinse with cold water to stop the cooking process. Let the water drain out for a few minutes.

, Transfer the pasta to a large serving bowl. Pour in the dressing and stir to coat the pasta completely.

, Dice all of the remaining ingredients into 1/4 inch pieces. Add them to the bowl with the pasta. Toss to combine, adding a little more dressing if the dish seems too dry.

, This dish is meant to be served cold, making it a great summer salad. It will keep up to a week in the refrigerator in a covered container.


Congratulations mdash; your salad is ready to eat. If you'd like, you can also add croutons, shaved Parmesan cheese, bacon bits, Genoa salami, or any other ingredients you think would pair well with its Italian flavors.

Dice up 3/4 cup (130 g) of red pepper, 3/4 cup (130 g) of green pepper, and 3/4 cup (115 g) of onion. Add this to the skillet along with 1/2 teaspoon of the salt and saute the vegetables for 10 to 15 minutes.Stir the vegetables frequently to prevent them from sticking to the skillet. The vegetables will become soft once they're finished sauteeing.

, Turn the oven on to 375 degrees F (190 C). Transfer the sauteed vegetables to a large mixing bowl and stir in 1/4 cup (56 g) of the marinara sauce. Add 24 cooked mini-meatballs or pepperoni slices and stir the mixture well.You could use any meat instead of the mini-meatballs. For example, you could use cooked ground beef, chorizo, or Italian sausage.

, Lay a sheet of parchment paper on a baking sheet and set one pound (467 g) of refrigerated pizza dough on it. Divide the dough into 8 pieces and roll each one into an oval shape about 5-inches (12 cm) in size.You can use homemade or purchased pizza dough.

, Divide 1 1/2 cups (170 g) of shredded mozzarella among each of the ovals. Try to put the cheese in the center. Spread a little of the filling mixture onto the center of each oval as well.You can use a cookie scoop to easily portion the filling among the mini-Stromboli.

, To seal a mini-Stromboli, fold both sides of one dough oval up towards the center and pinch them together. Turn the mini-Stromboli over, so the seam side faces down, and set it on your prepared baking sheet. Do this for each of the remaining dough circles.It's important to get a good seal, so the filling won't leak out as the mini-Stromboli bake.

, Cut two to three slits on the top of each dough circle and sprinkle the mini-Stromboli with 1/2 teaspoon of Italian seasoning. Put the baking sheet in the oven and cook the mini-Stromboli for 20 minutes. They should become golden brown.Serve the mini-Stromboli with the remaining 1 3/4 cup (395 g) of marinara sauce.

, Add ½ tablet or ½ tsp. (2.5 ml) of liquid rennet to ¼ cup (60 ml) of cool distilled water. Stir the tablet until it's dissolved and set it aside.

, Add 2 tsp. (10 ml) of citric acid powder to 1/2 cup (120 ml) of cool distilled water. Stir until it is dissolved.

, Place 1 gallon (3.8 L) of pasteurized milk into a 6-8 qt. (5.7-7.6L) pot. Do not use ultra pasteurized (UHT) milk. UHT milk does not form a solid enough curd to make mozzarella cheese.

, Stir gently, and there will be some curdling.

, Use medium-low heat. Stir occasionally to keep the milk from scorching. You can use a whisk, spoon, or heatproof spatula. The curd will begin to develop at this stage. Use a thermometer to determine when the milk reaches 88ºF (31ºC).

, Stir carefully for 30 seconds and then lower the heat to low. Cook the milk mixture over low heat until it reaches 105ºF (40ºC).

, This will allow the curd, which is the white mass, to separate from the whey or liquid before cutting the curd.

, Cut the curd into one inch (2.5 cm) squares with a knife then let it rest for about 5 minutes. It may help to hold the curd still with a ladle or large spoon while you are cutting. Hold a knife straight upright and cut the curd into slices in the pot. Then repeat the same cuts with the knife at an angle. Turn the pot, cut, and cut again to make a checkerboard of cuts.


You may not be able to see your previous cuts. Just do the best you can to make it even.

, Use a stainless steel slotted spoon to transfer the curd from the pot and place it in the colander or cheesecloth, collecting any whey that drains off in the bowl beneath. If you are using cheesecloth, you can tie the ends and hang the mozzarella to drain for three to four hours if you would like a firmer cheese. If you choose this option, do not return it to the pot after draining before adding the salt and starting to work the curd.


When you're done, transfer the whey that has drained off back to the pot.

, To prepare the curd, you should first place the colander of curd into the pot of whey to maintain its temperature. Then, add ½ tsp. (2.5 ml) of salt to the curd. Once you've done that, you can fold the curd over on itself to increase the draining of whey. The more you fold the curd at this point, the more dry your mozzarella will be.

, The water should be 170 - 175ºF (76 - 79ºC).

, Place one-third of the curd in the hot water at a time and let sit for approximately three minutes. Drain the water and then sprinkle two tablespoons of salt on it. Place two to three cups onto the curds and let sit for two minutes. Then, take a wooden spoon and begin to push all the curds to one side of the bowl. If the cheese curds are ready for stretching, they will stick together. If the curds aren't sticking together, then you may have to add more hot water and let sit a little longer. When it sticks together well, it's time to stretch!

, When you do this, you should stretch it when it gets sticky enough that it begins to hold together. If it does not stretch, check the temperature of your water. It may be too cool. If the mozzarella cheese begins to tear, place it back in the water for a moment to heat up again. Stretch the mozzarella cheese in two inch strips and fold it over on itself several times.It is important not to overwork the cheese, for it will make a dry and hard mozzarella ball.

, Form the mozzarella cheese into a ball when it forms a mass and has a sheen. To accomplish this, fold a two inch strip over 3 times and then force it through your thumb and index finger. Once you have a ball, squeeze your thumb and index finger together to break loose the bottom of the mozzarella ball from the rest of the cheese strip.

, Mix 2 cups (465 ml) of whey with 2 tbsp. (10 ml) of salt and some ice. This is the brine for your mozzarella cheese. You can cool the mozzarella cheese in the brine. When it has sufficiently cooled, you can remove it from the brine.

, Wrap it in plastic wrap or store it in an airtight container. Refrigerate it for up to a week or freeze it for up to a month.

Enjoy the finished curds.",How to Make Cheese Curds," Sanitize all the cooking utensils by submerging them in boiling water for several minutes. Dry well with clean paper towels before continuing.

You'll need to maintain a healthy, controlled balance of bacteria when making cheese curds, and that balance could be upset if unsanitary cooking utensils introduce additional bacteria to the ingredients.;
, You don't need to pasteurize the milk if you're already starting with commercially pasteurized dairy, but you should do so if you start with raw milk.

Note that both cow's milk and goat's milk can be used for cheese curds.
To pasteurize milk, heat the milk to 161 degrees Fahrenheit (71.6 degrees Celsius) using a double boiler. Maintain this temperature for 30 minutes, then cool the milk in an ice bath until it reaches 40 degrees Fahrenheit (4.4 degrees Celsius).

, Add 1/2 tsp (1.25 ml) of 30% calcium chloride to 1/8 cup (30 ml) of cool, non-chlorinated water. Stir until well-combined.Even though the calcium chloride is already diluted, diluting it further can extend its volume and allow it to spread more evenly throughout the milk.

, In a separate dish, combine 1/2 tsp (1.25 ml) ml of single-strength liquid rennet with 1/4 cup (60 ml) of cool, non-chlorinated water. Stir until well-combined.

Note that you can use 1/2 rennet tablet instead of the liquid rennet. Crush the tablet before adding the water, then stir until dissolved.

, Fill a large stainless steel pot half full with water. Place a smaller pot inside of it, then set the entire assembly on the stove.

Switch the heat onto medium. While the water in the larger pot reaches a simmer, continue to the next step.
Note that the water in the larger pot should never be allowed to boil over the sides of the smaller pot.

, Pour the milk into the smaller pot. Allow it to heat up without stirring it.Attach a cooking thermometer to the side of the pot so that you can closely monitor the temperature. The tip of the thermometer should dip into the milk but should not touch the side or bottom of the metal pan.

, Sprinkle the mesophilic culture over the surface of the milk, then stir it into the liquid until it is thoroughly distributed.

Use a mesophilic culture blend like MA 4000 or MM 100. Alternatively, you can use 1/4 cup (60 ml) of buttermilk instead of the culture.

, Cover the double boiler set-up and hold the temperature at 90 degrees Fahrenheit (32 degrees Celsius) for 60 minutes.

You may need to reduce or switch off the heat to prevent the temperature from continuing to climb.
The milk must remain at a temperature between 86 and 96 degrees Fahrenheit (30 and 35 degrees Celsius), and it should be allowed to sit for 30 to 90 minutes.

, Pour the calcium chloride onto the ladle and lower it into the milk. Stir well for at least 30 to 60 seconds.

If you chose to use raw, unpasteurized milk, you may wish to omit the calcium chloride since raw milk has more freely distributed calcium in it.

, Sprinkle the rennet over the surface of the milk, then stir it into the milk using an up-and-down motion for 60 seconds.

To help distribute the rennet evenly, pour it over a perforated ladle held over the surface of the milk.

, Still the milk, then cover it and allow it to rest for 30 to 45 minutes.

To still the milk, hold the ladle at the top of the milk until no more ripples form.
The milk mixture should turn into a gel after several minutes. Wait until the gel can be cleanly cut before continuing.

, After the curd has rested, slice into the top of it with a knife to verify that it's ready to work with.

After cutting the slit, insert the wide, flat side of the knife into the curd and lift the curd where the slit ends. The slit should continue forward when you do this, creating an opening with a clean edge.
If the curd isn't ready, allow it to continue cooking for a longer period of time.

, Use a sharp knife to slice the curd into 3/8 to 1/2 inch (0.75 to 1.25 cm) cubes. Keep the size of the cubes as even as possible.

Slice into the curd, separating it into parallel vertical columns.
Turn the knife, then cut through the curd in perpendicular columns, spacing them apart at even intervals.

, Cover the pot and allow the curds to sit, undisturbed, for 3 to 5 minutes.Note that the curds should still be sitting at an approximate temperature of 90 degrees Fahrenheit (32 degrees Celsius) during this stage.

, Gently stir the curds using an up-and-down motion while raising the cooking temperature. It should eventually reach a range between 100 and 102 degrees Fahrenheit (38 and 39 degrees Celsius).

This increase must happen gradually, so do not increase the stove heat above medium. Ideally, the increase will take approximately 30 minutes.
If the curds begin to heat up too quick, you should remove the pot from the heat for several minutes to stop the temperature from climbing too fast.

, Cook the cheese curds at this temperature for another 30 to 60 minutes, or until the curds develop an even and springy texture.

Stir the curds every 5 minutes or so while they rest.
You can continue cooking the curds for several minutes after they reach this consistency if you'd prefer a drier texture.
Checking the pH isn't necessary, but if you choose to do so, the pH should be between 6.2 and 6.10.

, Scoop out the curds using a slotted ladle and place them into a colander. Set the colander over the pot and allow the whey to drain.

To make gathering the curds easier, use your hands or the back of the ladle to press the curds into the bottom of the pot. After they form a solid mass, scoop out the mass and place it in the colander.
The colander should rest above the whey and not inside of it. Place a thermometer into the curd, then cover the pot and allow it to rest for 10 to 15 minutes at 98 degrees Fahrenheit (37 degrees Celsius).
When ready, the curds should mat and clump together into a solid mass.

, Remove the curds from the colander and cut the slab in half. Stack the two halves together, cover, and let them sit for 10 to 15 minutes.

You may wish to return the cut, stacked slabs to the colander to keep them warm.
Otherwise, place a bag of warm water measuring 98 degrees Fahrenheit (37 degrees Celsius) on top of the stack slabs to keep them adequately warm.

, Flip the stacked curd slabs over every 10 to 15 minutes over a 2-hour period of time.

Check the texture of the curd after the first 90 minutes. When the curd is ready, it should tear apart like cooked chicken breast.

, Place the curd onto a cutting board and cut it into 2-inch (5-cm) pieces.

Note that the slabs should be flattened to about 1 inch (2.5 cm) by this stage.
Cut the curds into 1-inch (2.5-cm) strips, then cut the strips crosswise into 2-inch (5-cm) long pieces.

, Sprinkle the curds with the salt, then toss gently with your hands or a spoon until all of the salt is dissolved.Cover the salted curds and allow them to sit for 5 to 10 minutes. During this time, the curds should absorb the salt.
More whey may drain away during this step, too. It might be a good idea to let the salted curds sit in your colander for that reason.

, Once the curds absorb all of the salt, they should be ready to enjoy. The fresh curds will create a satisfying ""squeak"" against your teeth when you bite into them.

To store the curds, place them in a resealable plastic bag and keep them in the refrigerator for up to one week. They will lose their ""squeak"" after the first day, though.
You can also freeze the curds in a freezer-safe plastic bag for up to 4 months.

Cover raw eggs with cold water.,
Turn off the heat as soon as the water boils.,
Watch the clock for more specific yolks.,
Consider adding salt or vinegar to the water.,
Simmer, don't boil.,
Use the slow cool-down if you lost track of time.",How to Tell When an Egg Is Boiled1," Take however many raw eggs you want to boil and put them in a heavy-bottomed pot. Gently, fill the pot with cold water, taking care not to jostle the delicate eggshells too much. Use enough to cover the eggs by about an inch. Put the pot, uncovered, over medium-high heat and bring it to a boil.


Never add raw eggs to boiling water. Boiling the water first results in the most inconsistent cooking process, often ending with broken shells, leaky eggs, and greenish yolks. Bringing the eggs up to temperature slowly ensures even cooking.;
, Depending on how you want your eggs cooked, you can remove the egg at different times in the process, but the easiest to remember and the most sure way to cook eggs, however, is to remove the pot from the heat just after it reaches a boil and leave the eggs in the water until the water cools. Boiled this way, you can be confident the eggs are hard-boiled and solid:









Add eggs to cool water and heat to boiling over medium-high heat
Remove the water from the heat as soon as it boils
Cover the pot with a lid
Let the eggs sit for 15 minutes, or until the water becomes cool enough to dip a finger in

, If you want a softer-boiled egg, or you want to eat more quickly, you can remove the eggs from the simmering water after a variable amount of time has elapsed. If you want to do this, turn the heat down slightly, to about medium, when the water reaches a boil, and start watching the clock.










For soft-boiled eggs, remove after 2 minutes. The whites should be cooked thoroughly, and the yolks should still be somewhat runny. Rinse immediately in cold water to stop the cooking process, or they'll become quickly over-done.

For medium-boiled eggs, remove after 4 1/2 minutes. The yolks of medium-eggs should be just about solid, but moist, more like a custard than a hard-cooked egg.

For hard-boiled eggs, remove after 8 minutes. The yolks of hard-boiled eggs are crumbly and bright yellow, completely solid, but with none of the grayish-green around the yolk that over-cooking yields., It's a common misconception that adding salt to water will raise the boiling point and result in a more uniform boil, or will make the egg easier to peel. It is true, however, that adding salt will season the water, affecting the flavor (even in hard boiled eggs), but you'd need to add an irrational amount of salt (about a half-cup) to raise the temperature even a few degrees.








Adding about a teaspoon of vinegar, however, will help to keep the white intact, should the shell crack any during the boiling process, without affecting the flavor significantly. Consider adding a small amount to keep your eggs solid.

, Greenish or grayish rings around the yolk are a telltale sign that you've boiled the egg either at too-high a temperature, possibly by dropping it directly into boiling water, or that you cooked it for too long. To avoid this, don't cook eggs at a rolling boil, but turn it down to about medium temperature, cooking them at a quick simmer. There should still be bubbles, but not so many that the eggs jostle around and rattle the pot.









The green-gray color results from iron in the egg yolk interacting with sulphur in the white, and only happens when they react at high temperature. You'll never reach that high temperature if you bring the eggs up gradually and remove them from the heat in time., If you added your eggs to boiling water, or haven't been watching the clock, don't fear. Make sure they've been in the water for at least 5 minutes, and them cover the pot and remove them from the heat. Wait 10 minutes and they'll be done every time.

Mix up some blue cheese dressing for salads.,
Whip up a blue cheese spread fromage fort style.,
Sweeten up a blue cheese tartine with honey.",How to Use Leftover Blue Cheese1," Add your ingredients to a food processor. Pulse the ingredients until they combine but the mixture is still chunky. Once the ingredients are combined, store the sauce in the refrigerator in an airtight container.


Generally, you can expect this dipping sauce to stay good for a few weeks to a month.;
, In a small mixing bowl, use a wooden spoon (or some other suitable kitchen implement) to combine the mayonnaise, sour cream, and milk. Then stir in the white wine vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, sugar, kosher salt, fresh ground black pepper, and garlic powder. Agitate the ingredients until they are well mixed. Then:Fold in the blue cheese to the mixture. If you don't like large chunks of blue cheese in your dressing, you may want to crumble the cheese while adding it.
After the cheese is added, transfer the dressing to an airtight container. Refrigerate and stir this dressing well when you are ready to serve it. Doing so should keep it good for a few weeks to a month., This traditional style of French cheese spread literally translates in English to ""strong cheese."" Add cheese pieces (mostly comprised of blue cheese), garlic, dry white wine (like a Pinot Grigio or Sauvignon Blanc), and a hearty twist of fresh ground black pepper to a food processor. Then:



Process the food for about 30 seconds or until the mixture is creamy, yet still somewhat firm.
Store the fromage fort in a container. It can be spread on top of bread cold, or can be broiled while on bread. Broiling will cause the cheese to brown., A tartine is the French name for a kind of open-face sandwich. Take four slices of quality rustic bread (sourdough is the traditional choice) and lightly toast each piece. Then:


Sprinkle blue cheese on one side of the toasted bread, then grill the bread or put it in a toaster oven to slightly melt the cheese. This should take 1 minute or less.
Drizzle honey over the melted blue cheese. Once the honey is on the bread, your tartine is ready to eat."

Spin the egg.,
Hold the egg up to the light.,
Drop the egg in warm water and look for bubbles.,
Crack it open, if all else fails.",How to Tell When an Egg Is Boiled2," The quickest way to distinguish between an uncooked egg and a solid boiled egg is to put it flat on the counter and spin it. A raw egg will wobble and spin slowly, because it's filled with liquid, while a boiled egg will spin very quickly and very easily.









Try this now by getting out a raw egg and trying to spin it like a top, on the flat side of the shell. Compare that to an egg you know is done and you'll have an easy quick test to distinguish between them every time.

, Another easy way to distinguish between uncooked eggs and solid eggs is to hold it up to the light. The thin shell of a raw egg should let some light through, and you'll be able to see the yolk on the inside. A boiled egg will be completely solid.


Use a flashlight on the other side of the egg and shine it toward you, holding the egg between the light and your eyes. Move it back and forth slightly while you look for the yolk.

, If an egg is raw, tiny air bubbles will rise from the shell as soon as its submerged in water. If it's in the warm boil, it'll be hard to tell because the water itself will be bubbling. But keeping an eye on the bubbles that rise from the egg itself is a good fast way to tell whether the egg is raw or cooked.








, If you're boiling multiple eggs and you're still not sure how to figure out whether or not they're done, take one out, run it under water, and crack it open quickly to check. Cut it in half and examine the yolk. If it's where you want it to be, take the rest of the eggs out. If not, leave them in for another few minutes. You'll only have sacrificed one and you won't be wondering.

Use goat cheese instead of cream cheese.,
Substitute goat cheese for sour cream.,
Use goat cheese in side salads.,
Bake gluten-free biscuits with goat cheese.,
Make a goat cheese spread.,
Make goat cheese ice cream.",How to Use Goat Cheese2," Goat cheese can be used as a substitute for cream cheese in many ways. For instance, spread it on toast or bagels for breakfast. You can even use goat cheese as a healthier alternative in recipes that call for cream cheese, such as dips., Goat cheese is more flavorful than sour cream, and can serve as an enjoyable alternative. For instance, use goat cheese on tacos in lieu of sour cream and/or other cheeses., Instead of yogurt or feta cheese, goat cheese makes a great companion to many fruits and fruit salads. For example, make a fruit salad with peaches and apricots, and top with a small pieces of goat cheese. Similarly, use goat cheese to top a sweet-corn salad.Relatively crumbly versions of goat cheese, such as Crottin and Bûcheron work well in sweeter side salad dishes.
The tangy flavor of goat cheese pairs especially well with bitter fruits, such as grapefruit.
Finally, watermelon and goat cheese pair very well. Toss them together in a vinaigrette and season with one or two of your favorite herbs.

, There a handful of ways to bake gluten free foods, and goat cheese makes for a particularly delicious option. To make two dozen bite-size cheesy “biscuits,” you’ll need 2 cups all purpose gluten-free flour, 2 teaspoons baking powder, 1 teaspoon granulated sugar, ½ teaspoon each baking soda, kosher salt, and black pepper. You’ll also need ½ stick unsalted butter, 5 ounces crumbled goat cheese, ½ cup diced dill, and ¾ cup buttermilk.Whisk the flour, baking powder, baking soda, sugar, salt, and pepper together. Work small pieces of butter into the mix incrementally, followed by the goat cheese and dill. Add the buttermilk last, stirring until the mixture is combined.
Spread the dough onto a floured cutting board, pressing it until it’s roughly an inch (2.5cm) thick. Cut the dough into squares that are roughly 1x1in (2.5x2.5cm). Place the squares on a baking sheet covered in parchment paper.
Bake the biscuits for roughly 15 min at 400 degrees F (204 degrees C). The biscuits are finished when the tops turn golden brown. All the biscuits to cool to a safe temperature before serving.

, Seasoning and softening goat cheese can turn it into an incredibly tasty spread for crackers, bread, and more. In a mason jar or similar container, place 5 ounces of goat cheese, fresh garlic, cloves, parsley, peppercorn, thyme, and bay leaves. Add enough olive oil to submerge the other ingredients. Seal the container and allow the cheese to sit for a few days in your refrigerator.Notably, this dip will be relatively much healthier than many other dip recipes that call for ingredients high in fat and sodium.

, You read that right - you can indeed make ice cream with goat cheese. Believe it or not, it tastes a lot like cheesecake. To make about a quart of chocolate ice cream, you’ll need 8 ounces of goat cheese at room temp, 2 cups heavy cream, 2 cups whole milk, ¾ cup sugar, ⅓ cup unsweetened cocoa powder, 1 tablespoon corn syrup, and 2 ounces of chopped up milk chocolate.Whisk soft, room temp goat cheese for a few minutes, or until creamy.
Heat the heavy cream, milk, sugar, cocoa and corn syrup in a large pan over medium heat. Whisk the mixture until the sugar is completely dissolved, and reduce heat to low once the mixture begins to boil. Whisk in the milk chocolate as well.
Pour the heated mixture over the goat cheese, whisking it all together until the goat cheese is completely melted. This will likely take a few full minutes. No chunks, however small, should remain.
Cool the mixture in the fridge for a few hours, and churn it with an ice cream maker (or blender attachment) for 25 minutes. Cover in a freezer-safe container and freeze for at least 4 hours before serving.

Default to fresh goat cheese for spreading.,
Opt for aged goat cheeses for firmness.,
Use soft-ripened goat cheeses for specific purposes.,
Store goat cheese according to the style.",How to Use Goat Cheese3," There is a lot of variety between brands and styles of goat cheese. Not only does flavor differ, but so does texture and crumbliness. Accordingly, you may find you like certain type of goat cheese more than others, or that some types work better for certain uses.Fresh goat cheese is usually packaged in tubes or tubs of various sizes and shapes. It is also sometimes packaged in single-serving triangles that are great for packed lunches.

, Ageing goat cheese for a few months in controlled conditions allows the cheese to ripen. This leads to a more firm texture, as well as a more potent flavor. Aged goat cheese can even be grated, so is great for topping dishes from salads to lasagna., The variety and popularity of different soft-ripened goat cheeses has lead to the develop of several options in this category, each with a distinctive reputation. Note that the soft white rind is edible.Valençay is sold in a pyramid container, and relatively dense, but still very creamy. Earthy, nutty flavors make this particular goat cheese especially good on burgers or other grilled meats.
Another brand, called Crottin gets more dry as it ages, which makes for an especially crumbly goat cheese.
Bûcheron, on the other hand, gets softer - as well as more flavorful - as it ages. Eat it younger for a mild, slice-able goat cheese.
Finally, Florette is especially creamy, with a texture similar to Brie. This one is especially good mixed into omelets.

, All types of goat cheese will keep for at least a few weeks in your fridge. Most importantly, keep them tightly sealed from the air. The vegetable crisper is the best location in the fridge, as temperature is help especially constant.


Soft and semi-soft goat cheese should be stored in a resealable plastic container.
Wrap harder goat cheeses in parchment or wax paper before wrapping them tightly in aluminum foil or plastic wrap.
Remove any goat cheese from the fridge roughly half an hour before you want to serve it, especially on its own. Goat cheese is best served at room temperature.

Note that the two cheeses are made from different milk sources.,
Be aware of the textural and taste differences between the two types of cheese.,
Use your Parmesan and Pecorino.",How to Tell the Difference Between Parmesan and Pecorino," Parmesan is made from cow's milk, whereas Pecorino is made from ewe's milk. In fact, the word ""pecora"" is Italian for ""ewe"". Italians refer to Parmesan as ""Parmigiano Reggiano"".;
, Each cheese comes with its own texture and ""ripeness"":


Parmesan: is a fruity flavoured cheese with a peppery after-taste. It tends to be sold at varying stages of ripeness, which impacts the strength of its taste but its texture usually remains the same, hard and grainy.
Pecorino: this is a sharp, salty-flavoured cheese. Pecorino tends to be most widely available after considerable aging or ripening. Pecorino is hard like Parmesan and grates well. It is also possible to get a softer Pecorino, however, and this is where it can differ from Parmesan in texture. If you purchase fresher, younger Pecorino, you will discover that it is softer, with a lighter colouring and a texture similar to a firm Brie. It also tastes less strong.

, Both cheese types are similar, and so are fairly interchangeable unless you prefer one for any particular reason. Providing both cheese types on a cheese platter is a good serving suggestion. And both are fine for cooking, so feel free to substitute Pecorino for Parmesan in your favourite recipes, as the taste will be fairly similar.

Smell the cheese.,
Consider the color(s).,
Taste the cheese.",How to Tell when Blue Cheese Is Bad1," The best way to tell if your blue cheese has spoiled is to smell it. Fresh blue cheese has a strong scent, but it changes as it starts to go bad. Give the cheese a sniff, and if it has an ammonia-like smell, it is probably spoiled.It’s a good idea to give blue cheese a smell when you’ve just brought it home. That way, you’ll know what it smells like when it’s fresh and be better able to detect when the scent begins to change.;
, Fresh blue cheese already has mold in it, which is typically blue or green in color. However, you want to pay attention to the color of the creamy part of the cheese. It’s normally a white, beige, or yellow shade. If you notice that it’s started to turn pink, brown, or green, your blue cheese has likely spoiled.Just as with the scent of the cheese, make sure to note the color of your blue cheese when it’s fresh so it’s easier to spot changes if it goes bad.
In addition to color changes, study the cheese to see if its surface appears slimy or fuzzy, and discard if you notice changes in texture.

, If your blue cheese still smells the same and hasn’t changed in color, you can usually tell if it’s gone bad by giving it a taste. While fresh blue cheese has a strong, sharp taste, old cheese becomes especially biting when it starts to spoil. If you taste a bit of the blue cheese and it’s too strong to enjoy, you should throw it away.In most cases, eating a small bit of spoiled blue cheese isn’t going to make you sick, so tasting it isn’t dangerous.

"
Toss unrefrigerated cheese after two days.,
Throw away refrigerated cheese after three to four weeks.,
Get rid of frozen cheese after six months.",How to Tell when Blue Cheese Is Bad2," Blue cheese should be refrigerated to keep it fresh, so if you leave it out on your counter, it’s going to spoil more quickly. In most cases, you’ll notice that it’s gone bad after just a few days. If you’re accidentally left blue cheese out, it’s best to throw it away if it’s been two days or more., When blue cheese is kept in the refrigerator, it can last quite a while. Check the expiration date on your cheese -- in most cases, it will remain good for one to two weeks past the date. That typically means it will last in fridge for three to four weeks.To keep your blue cheese fresh as long as possible, make sure your refrigerator temperature isn’t set above 40 degrees.

, If blue cheese is kept in the freezer at 0 degrees, it can last indefinitely, which means you can freeze excess cheese that you don’t plan on using within the month to prevent it from spoiling. However, for best taste and texture, you shouldn’t keep it frozen for more than half a year.Keep in mind that the taste and texture of blue cheese can change slightly when it’s thawed. It loses some of its sharp flavor and usually crumbles more easily.

"
"
Cut cheese for freezing.,
Double wrap the cheese.,
Store on bottom shelf in the refrigerator.",How to Tell when Blue Cheese Is Bad3," If you want to store your blue cheese in the freezer, you must cut it into pieces that are no larger than a ½ pound each. For crumbled blue cheese, divide it into portions that are a similar weight. Use a food scale to weight each slice or portion before you prepare it for storage.You can freeze blue cheese that you've already opened or served. Just make sure to cut the remaining cheese wedge or divide crumbles into the ½ pound portions as directed.

, Whether you plan to store blue cheese in the refrigerator or freezer, it needs to be wrapped properly to ensure that it will stay fresh as long as possible. First, wrap the cheese in wax or parchment paper. Next, place plastic wrap or foil over the paper to ensure that it won’t dry out.If you are freezing the cheese, place the double wrapped piece into a plastic freezer bag to protect it from freezer burn.
If you’re concerned about the cheese picking up the scent or flavors of other items inside your refrigerator, you may want to place it in an airtight container after it’s been wrapped for additional protection.

, The colder that blue cheese, the longer it will stay fresh. Because the lower section of the fridge is usually the coldest, you want to make sure to keep it in on the bottom shelf to preserve for as long as possible. If your refrigerator has drawers at the bottom, that's an ideal place to store blue cheese because they likely won’t be opened every time you look in the fridge, so the temperature will remain stable."

Use a microwave.,
Let the cream cheese gradually come to room temperature.,
Warm the cream cheese in a water bath.,
Check for consistency before using the cream cheese.,
Don't let softened cream cheese sit for long periods of time.,
Avoid over-heating.",How to Soften Cream Cheese1," Scoop the cream cheese into a microwave-safe bowl or dish. Set the microwave to ""High"" and heat briefly. For a medium-sized (eight ounces or less) container of cream cheese, you'll usually need about 15-20 seconds of cooking time.








If the cream cheese isn't soft enough, continue to heat it in ten second increments. Check its texture after each heating session.
If the cream cheese is too soft, let it sit in a cool bowl on the counter for five minutes (or in the fridge for two minutes).;
, Take the cream cheese out of the fridge. Leave it on the counter top for half an hour in its original container. It should noticeably soften once it reaches room temperature.









After 30 minutes, open the packaging and check the texture. If the cream cheese still feels cool to the touch and isn't soft enough, let it sit another 20-30 minutes. If it's room temperature and it still isn't soft enough, use one of the other methods to soften it.

, Fill a bowl with lukewarm water. Place the cream cheese into the water in its original packaging. Let it sit for 10 minutes. The water will gradually transfer its heat to the cream cheese, softening its texture.









If the cream cheese has already been opened, put it in an airtight plastic bag or wrap it tightly in cling wrap to prevent water from getting in.
If the cream cheese doesn't soften enough, give it an extra five minutes. If it still isn't soft enough, use warmer water (but not hot water, which can melt it).
If the cream cheese was frozen, use cold water instead of lukewarm, which can cause it to heat unevenly.

, Once you've warmed the cream cheese, take a few seconds to check that it is the right consistency. Press a spoon into the cream cheese (either through the wrapper or directly into the cheese itself). If it gives way easily and offers no resistance, it should be plenty soft. On the other hand, if it's still firm, you may want to warm it a little more.








, Cream cheese has a fairly long shelf life: in the fridge, it can sometimes last for up to a month and in the freezer it can easily last twice that.However, like many dairy products, it spoils fairly quickly at room temperature. After warming your cream cheese, try to use it as quickly as possible, returning any leftovers to the fridge.









Cream cheese shouldn't be left at room temperature longer than 1-2 hours. Consider throwing it away after leaving it out this much time., It's possible to warm cream cheese too much when trying to soften it. In this case, you can start to melt the solids in the cream cheese, leaving you with a soupy, runny mess that isn't easy to cool back to a ""normal"" texture.









Prevention is the best cure here. Use gentle heat and short warming periods to prevent over-heating, increasing the temperature and time gradually if you need a softer texture.

Wait for a cool day.,
Cut a cheese of your choice.,
Dry the cheese and bring to room temperature.,
Consider buying a cold smoker.,
Alternatively, make your own cold smoker.",How to Smoke Cheese1," Cheese must be ""cold smoked,"" to prevent melting. This is easiest to accomplish if the air temperature is no higher than 60 °F (16 °C), even with the methods we'll use to keep temperatures low.


If you do try this on a warm day, start with a small batch to minimize mess and lost cheese from melting. The store-bought cold smoker method is best for warm days.;
, Any cheese can be smoked, unless it is so soft it will fall through the grate. Gouda, cheddar, and Gruyère are all common options. For fully smoked cheese, use pieces no larger than 4"" x 4"" by 2"" (10cm x 10cm x 5cm), so the smoke can penetrate through the entire piece of cheese.If you prefer cheese with a smoky rind and soft interior, use larger pieces.

, Unwrap your cheese and leave it in the refrigerator overnight. Remove from the refrigerator the next day and leave it until it reaches room temperature.This will cause some moisture to evaporate, making it easier to develop the smoky rind. Wipe off moisture from the cheese surface using a paper towel.


There's some disagreement among cheese-smokers over this step. Some people prefer to keep the cheese chilled or even frozen before smoking. Others dislike the texture changes that come with freezing, and may even prefer the convenience of skipping the refrigeration step and just leaving the cheese out at room temperature for one or two hours.

, You can purchase a ""cold smoker"" attachment or adapter for your hot smoker, or a standalone cold smoker. These range in cost from about $35 to well over $100. However, once the cold smoker is set up, smoking is simple and risk of melting the cheese is low.Some cold smoker attachments are small, low-heat devices with special wood dust fuel. These can be placed at the bottom of the hot smoker, and used as directed.
Other cold smoker attachments are additional compartments that attach to your hot smoker. If not created by the same company, you may need to attach the two together yourself. Some models only require a drill, nut, and bolt to achieve this, but find out before you buy.
Either way, once you set the cold smoker up, cook the cheese over wood chips or wood pellets for 1–6 hours, turning at least once, then remove and refrigerate for 1–4 weeks before eating. See the ""hot smoker"" section for more tips.

, Continue on to one of the sections below, depending on the tools you have available:


There are two ways to MacGyver an ordinary (hot) smoker or closable grill to make your own cold smoker. You can use a pan of ice, or you can build your own mini smoke source from a tin can. Both are described in the ""hot smoker"" section.
If you do not have any type of smoker or grill and do not want to buy one, you can attempt to smoke the cheese in a spare refrigerator over a hot plate. This can be a successful smoker, but is difficult to control and requires extra attention to fire safety.

Add milk or cream.,
Add melted butter.,
Try adding a small amount of lemon juice.,
Mix with marshmallow fluff.,
Mix with mascarpone.",How to Soften Cream Cheese2," These neutral-flavored dairy products are perfect for thinning out cream cheese without affecting its taste much. They may make it slightly less ""tangy"" but the difference should not be major. The procedure for adding these ingredients (as well as the ones below) is simple:









Add a small amount of the milk, etc. to the cream cheese. Start with no more than one tablespoon.
Stir well to combine. The cream cheese should become a little less solid and a little easier to stir.
Add small extra amounts of milk, etc. as needed if it's still not soft enough.

, This is another good choice for thinning out cream cheese. Melt butter in the microwave (separate from the cream cheese), then combine it with the cream cheese in a separate bowl by stirring well. Don't heat the cream cheese together with the butter unless you want it to melt as well.









If you have the choice, use unsalted butter to have the smallest possible effect on the taste of the cream cheese.

, Lemon juice won't just thin out solid cream cheese — it will also give it a noticeably tart taste. While this is great for frosting and other sweet and sour desserts, it won't go well with every dish, so use this method with caution.









You may want to use a little less lemon juice than you would use for the other ingredients in this section. Some frosting recipes that call for as little as two teaspoons of lemon juice can have problems with the finished product being too runny., Fluffy marshmallow toppings like Cool Whip may not seem like they would taste good with cream cheese, but they can be perfect when thinning cream cheese for frosting. These sorts of spreads tend to give cream cheese a mildly sweet flavor rather than the tartness of lemon juice or the neutral flavors of milk and melted butter.








, Mascarpone is an Italian spread that is very similar to cream cheese, just a little lighter and softer.Because it's so close to cream cheese already, mascarpone makes a good choice when you want to make cream cheese just a little softer than it already is. The effect is subtle, but noticeable — perfect when using the mix as a spread for desserts like french toast and bread pudding.

Smoke for 0.5 to 6 hours, turning occasionally.,
Let the cheese cure before eating.",How to Smoke Cheese2," The simplest way to keep your cheese cool in a hot smoker or grill is to place a large pan of ice .Put a grate over the pan for the cheese to rest on, then skip down to the ""Light a flavorful smoke source"" step. If you don't have room for the ice pan, or you are concerned about the moisture slowing the smoking down, try the next step instead.


If you have the space, fill a colander with ice instead and put it over a pan to catch drips. This makes it easier to replace the ice.
Read the section on preparing the cheese if you haven't already.

, Take a clean, sturdy tin can, such as a soup can holding at least 10 oz. (300 mL). You'll use this as an undersize chimney starter, keeping the fire small and low-temperature.


If you have a large smoker, you may need to use a larger coffee can instead to get enough smoke density.

, If using ice, start the fire as normal, using three or four small charcoal briquettes (or an electric smoker's heating element). Use a pan of flavorful wood chips or pellets directly over the heat to create the smoke. (See the tips section below for advice on flavors.) If you are using the tin can, there are two options available:


Tin can method A: fill half the can with charcoal briquettes. Fill the next ¼ of the can with water-soaked wood chips, then the rest of the can with dry woodchips.Tin can method B: Punch a hole in the can near the upper rim. Stick a brand-new, soldering iron into this hole, then fill about half the can with wood pellets (no charcoal necessary). Plug in the soldering iron to start the fire.Never use a soldering iron that has been used for soldering, or the smoke will contain toxic chemicals.

, Adjust the air vents until plenty of smoke is produced, but the wood is burning slow and steady.

, With the smoke source at the base of the smoker or grill, add the cheese pieces over the top grate. Close the smoker or grill.


If the day is windy, you can cover the closed device with a tarp to keep the smoke inside., With these methods, it's a smart idea to check the cheese every 15 to 20 minutes, especially the first time you try it. Look for the following problems and correct them:


Maintain the fire by adding more charcoal every 30–40 minutes, or more wood chips or pellets whenever they run low. (Include both wet and dry wood chips if using tin can method A.)
If the cheese develops sweat beads, it is getting close to melting. Narrow the air vents or cool the cheese using the methods below.
If using an ice pan, replace ice water with fresh ice. On a cool day with a low fire, this may not be necessary.

, Cheese absorbs flavors easily, and does not need to be smoked as long as meat does. Turn the cheese over every 15–30 minutes, or at least once during the smoking process. Wait until the cheese has developed a darker ""smoke ring"" around its edges before removing from heat.


Soft cheese in a warm smoker can be finished in as little as 30 minutes, if you prefer a light flavor. One or two hours is more common.
Thick blocks of hard cheese smoked on a cold winter day may take as long as 4–6 hours. For your first attempt, 3 hours or less is recommended to avoid overpowering the original cheese flavor.

, Remove the cheese and wrap it in wax paper or parchment paper. Keep it in the refrigerator for at least a week so the smoke flavor mellows into a more attractive taste. Often, the cheese tastes better after two to four weeks refrigerated.


Do not wrap the cheese in plastic. If you want to prevent it drying out, wrap in wax paper, then place in an unsealed plastic bag.

Set aside a refrigerator to use only for smoking.,
Place a hot plate at the bottom of the refrigerator.,
Add a wood chip pan.,
Place a pan of ice on the middle rack.,
Begin to smoke the cheese.,
Smoke the cheese for 1–6 hours, checking regularly.,
Refrigerate the cheese.",How to Smoke Cheese3," This refrigerator may develop an ineradicable smoky flavor, and needs to be completely empty. This should be kept in an area without nearby fire hazards, such as a garage or basement with concrete floors and no flammable materials nearby. The refrigerator does not need to be functional.


Refer to the ""preparing the cheese"" instructions at the top of the page before you continue.

, Place a hot plate on the bottom of the fridge, preferably one with a temperature control.

, Place a small bread pan, tin can, or other heat-safe container over the hot plate. Fill it with wood chips or wood pellets intended for smoking, or taken from a source of pure wood with no toxic additives.


See the tips section for advice on wood flavors.

, Above the hot plate, fill a large container with ice. This will keep the cheese cool and prevent it from melting.

, Lay the cheese pieces on the upper rack of the refrigerator. Turn on the hot plate to a low setting and shut the refrigerator door.

, Check every 10–15 minutes for these problems and correct them if necessary:


If the ice has melted, replace the ice water with fresh ice.
If the cheese develops sweat beads, turn off the hot plate until the cheese cools down.
Once the cheese develops a smoke ring around the edge, flip it over. Once the smoke ring is on both sides, remove from the setup and turn off the hot plate.

, Wrap in wax paper and refrigerate for at least a week for best flavor. Some cheeses taste best after two to four weeks for smoking.


Don't give up on a nasty-tasting cheese directly from the smoker – er, the refrigerator. The flavor often improves dramatically.

Pickle the eggs.,
Make deviled eggs.,
Marinate them in soy sauce.",How to Use Leftover Hard Boiled Eggs2," Pour a 16-ounce can of pickled beets into a large container or mason jar. Add one cup (237 ml) of apple cider vinegar, a 1/3 cup (78 ml) of brown sugar, a tablespoon (15 ml) of peppercorn, and a teaspoon (4.93 ml) of salt. Mix the ingredients until they are well-combined and the sugar is dissolved. Add 6 hardboiled eggs to the mixture one at a time. Place the lid on the jar and refrigerate for 12 hours, or up to three days. After they have finished marinating, serve as is or make deviled eggs out of the yolk.The longer the eggs marinate, the stronger the pickled flavor and pink color will be.

, Slice six hardboiled eggs in half and place them on a clean platter. Remove the yolks with a spoon or your fingers and place them in a bowl. Use a fork to mash the yolk into a powder. Add in 2 ½ (37.5 ml) tablespoons of mayo, two teaspoons (10 ml) of yellow mustard, and salt and pepper to taste. Mix the ingredients together until a smooth paste forms. Place the filling in the empty egg halves with a spoon (about ½ teaspoon of filling for each egg). Finish by sprinkling paprika powder on each deviled egg.This recipe makes 12 servings.
If you like, you can garnish the eggs with freshly chopped parsley or green onions.
Gently squeeze the eggs to loosen the yolks for removal.

, Heat six tablespoons (90 ml) of water on medium heat until hot (105 to 115 degrees Fahrenheit/40 to 46 degrees Celsius). Place the hot water in a large container or mason jar. Mix in one tablespoon (15 ml) of granulated sugar until it is dissolved. Add two tablespoons (30 ml) of rice wine vinegar, ¾ cup (177 ml) of low-sodium soy sauce, ½ teaspoon (2.46 ml) of chili garlic sauce, and two diced scallions to the water. Mix until well-combined. Place six eggs in the jar one at a time. Place the lid on the jar and refrigerate for two hours, or up to 24 hours. Once they have finished marinating, slice in half and serve as is.You can also serve them over rice, ramen, or on a salad for a quick, fulfilling meal.
This recipe makes six to twelve servings.

Whisk in two tablespoons of flour and ¼ teaspoon (1.23 ml) of salt. Cook the butter and salt for one minute or until fragrant. Stir in ½ cup (118 ml) of milk until a thick mixture forms. Then mix in another ½ cup of milk, stirring constantly until a thick mixture forms again. Add one chopped hardboiled egg to the mixture and mix until well-combined. Take the mixture off the heat and pour it over toast. Garnish the creamed eggs with another chopped hardboiled egg and herbs or seasonings to taste.This recipe makes one serving.

, Set your oven to broil. Slice four English muffins in half and place them on a cookie sheet. Drizzle them with olive oil. Slice two tomatoes into eight pieces and place the pieces on the English muffins. Cut four hardboiled eggs in half. Place the halves on top of the tomatoes. Sprinkle each “pizza” with grated mozzarella, oregano, salt, and pepper. Place the cookie sheet in the oven and broil for five minutes or until the mozzarella is melted. Serve as is.This recipe makes four servings.

, Heat your oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit (204.4 degrees Celsius). Beat one large egg in a bowl and set aside. Pour two tablespoons (30 ml) of flour on a plate, and ¾ cup (177 ml) of panko breadcrumbs on a separate plate. Mix a pound of pork sausage, a teaspoon (4.93 ml) of dried minced onion, and a teaspoon of salt in a large bowl until well-combined. Roll four hardboiled eggs in the flour until they are coated. Shape the sausage around the coated eggs until you cannot see the egg anymore. Dip the eggs in the beaten egg. Then roll them in the breadcrumbs until they are completely covered. Place the eggs on a baking sheet and place the sheet in the oven. Bake for 35 minutes, or until the sausage is cooked through.This recipe makes four servings.

Get the proper utensils.,
Start by whipping your eggs in the bowl.,
Spoon in some hot liquid to the eggs while whisking vigorously.,
Pour the tempered egg into the hot liquid, when it’s ready.,
Strain curds you make accidentally.",How to Temper an Egg1," Whatever the dish you’re making, tempering eggs for it is a lot easier than you might think. As long as you work quickly and by adding only a small amount of hot liquid to your eggs, your eggs will be tempered in no time. To do it right, you’ll need:


Heat resistant bowl. It’s important to beat your eggs in a tempered glass (like Pyrex) bowl, or a ceramic bowl, so it won’t heat up and cook the eggs from underneath. You want the liquid to do the cooking, not the surface, which will cause the eggs to curdle.
Whisk. The technique requires that you aggressively whisk the eggs while adding hot liquid, making a whisk useful. In a pinch, a fork is a fine alternative.
Ladle. You’ll need something to spoon the hot liquid from the pot, preferably a large ladle with a spout, so you can control how much you add.;
, Depending on your recipe, you might have anywhere between 1 and 6 eggs that you’re preparing to temper, but the process will be the same regardless of the amounts. Crack all your eggs into your heat resistant bowl, then beat them until thoroughly integrated.Continue whipping the eggs until they just become frothy. Beaten eggs, as you’d make for scrambled eggs, will be more likely to curdle, since the consistency will be thicker. You want more of an omelet consistency. When you start to see a foam appear on the top of the eggs, you’re in good shape.
Let the eggs sit and come up to room temperature while you make the rest of the recipe. It’s more difficult to temper very cold eggs, so it’s important to let them come up to room temp gently before tempering.

, Whether you’re making a savory dish or a custard, the next step is basically the same. You want to add a small amount of the hot liquid you’re using to temper, while whisking the eggs vigorously at the same time. When you’re sure the eggs haven’t curdled, add a little more. Continue in this way until the eggs are tempered.


Start with a tablespoon or two and wait until you’re sure it isn’t curdling to add more. Some recipes will play fast and loose with the instructions, telling you to add a whole ladle full of boiling milk to eggs. It’s safer to start with smaller amounts and gradually bring the heat up. Continue adding until you’ve increased the volume of the eggs by at least half.

, Eggs are tempered when the mixture is steaming, and you can feel the heat in your hand holding the bowl. At this point, the eggs are essentially cooked without having scrambled. You can pour it all in at once, give it a few stirs, and the tempering is done. You don’t have to worry about the eggs curdling at this point.


The mixture helps to thicken broths and custards, creating a rich sauce. When you pour it back in, you should notice the broth or the milk thicken somewhat, and take on a cloudier, yellowy tint.

, If you rush the process by trying to add too much heat at once, you might notice a few curds start to form. Don’t panic, but stop adding the hot liquid and stirring the eggs. Get a spoon and fish out the curds, or run the egg mixture through a strainer if necessary and restart the process. If the whole thing as curdled, throw it out and start over.


Alternatively, you can just ignore some curds if you don’t mind the texture. Keep whisking vigorously and you’ll hardly even notice the texture.

Heat milk just to boiling on the stove.,
Mix the appropriate amount of sugar into the eggs.,
Start with a few tablespoons of milk.,
Continue adding until all of the milk has been added.",How to Temper an Egg2," If you're making eggnog, custard, pudding, or ice cream, almost all recipes will start with scalded milk, or milk brought just to a boil. Whip your eggs in a heat-resistant bowl and go about the process of heating the milk over the stove according to the recipe you're using.

, For some recipes, you'll need to measure out the sugar into the eggs before you temper the eggs. If this is the case, measure it out and add it to the eggs. Whisk them together vigorously while the milk heats., Remove the milk from the heat after it's scalded and add a very small amount of milk to the heat-resistant bowl with the eggs and sugar in it. Use your ladle and spoon out about a tablespoon into your whipped eggs, whisking vigorously while you add. Make sure the eggs haven't curdled before adding more.


If it helps, count to ten in between additions of milk, just to be sure you're not rushing it. That's slow enough that you'll probably be safe from curdling., Keep spooning the milk into the eggs, a little at a time, until you've transferred all the milk over to the egg bowl. Depending on what you're doing with the recipe, you might add this mixture to dry ingredients or chill it down for ice cream. Either way, you've tempered the eggs and you're ready to move forward with the recipe.

"
"
Don’t season the eggs.,
Start with a very small amount of broth.,
Continue adding until the bowl is steaming.,
Pour the mixture back into the soup pot.",How to Temper an Egg3," Adding salt to beaten eggs starts breaking down the proteins, releasing moisture and creating a less uniform consistency in the egg mixture. This means that the eggs will temper less evenly when you add broth. Season the broth after the eggs have been tempered and added into the soup, not before you temper the eggs.

, Ladle out some of the broth, spooning in a small amount to the bowl with the eggs in it. Whisk the eggs vigorously while you add the liquid. Count to ten before you add another spoonful and allow the temperature to come up gradually.


Try as best you can to only use broth to temper the eggs. Depending on what kind of soup you're making, it can be hard to avoid little chunks of vegetables or meat. It's fine if you get a bit of veg in there with your eggs–it's all going together anyway–but the eggs will whisk easier with just broth and egg, and the eggs will temper more quickly.

, Continue adding broth in small amounts and put your hand on the side of the bowl to check for the temperature. Look closely for steam. If you're doing it properly, the eggs should still be perfectly liquid, but should be steaming and warm, meaning that they're tempered properly. When you see steam, your eggs are tempered.

, When the bowl is steaming as much as the pot with the broth, you can pour the tempered eggs directly into the soup. Stir the eggs around to enrich the broth with the tempered eggs. The broth should thicken some–not much–and will take on a cloudier, slightly yellowish or milky color.

Temper eggs into dishes with long noodles.,
Beat some shredded cheese into the egg mixture.,
Heat the pasta gently in the skillet.,
Stir the pasta vigorously while adding in the egg.",How to Temper an Egg4," One way of tempering eggs common in Italian cooking is to add raw egg directly to hot pasta to create a rich sauce. Most famously, this is the technique used for making spaghetti carbonara, the simple combination of noodles, egg, pancetta (or bacon), and lots and lots of black pepper.


Carbonara is typically made with spaghetti noodles, but also can be made with any noodle you like to eat. Technique-wise, it's sometimes easier to temper the eggs in the pan using longer noodles, which tangle together to create a larger surface and keep the eggs off the bottom of the pan, so they won't scramble. You can do it with any noodle, however.

, While your pasta cooks, beat about 2 eggs in a bowl and add enough shredded parmesan cheese to double the amount. This can be more than you'd think–around a half cup or so of shredded parmesan. You can use other kinds of cheese, but drier, flakier cheeses like parmesan usually integrate more easily into the egg and melt more quickly than some other kinds.


In a carbonara, you'll also add lots and lots of black pepper to the eggs before you add it to the pasta. The pepper is where the dish gets it's name–the pepper grains look like bits of ""carbon.""

, For most recipes, you'll fry up some kind of meat, onions, garlic, and spices in a skillet first, then remove the pan from the heat. Cook your pasta separately, then add it to the skillet with the other ingredients. Put the skillet on low heat, stirring the noodles in the meat and vegetables to heat it gently.


The goal is to warm the egg on the top side of the pasta before it works through to the bottom of the pan, where it will likely start to curdle. It takes temperature control and good stirring to make it work correctly.

, Pour the egg over the pasta noodles in the skillet over low heat, using a wooden spoon to stir the noodles around vigorously. Continue agitating the noodles, moving them around constantly. They should cook very quickly, and you want to avoid letting them curdle on the bottom of the skillet. Remove the skillet from the heat when you see steam and fork the noodles into a separate bowl.


Eggs cook much more quickly than most people think, so heating the noodles through gently and having them at the proper temperature when you had them should temper the eggs very quickly, coating the noodles in a rich and thick cheesy sauce. Season with chopped parsley and serve immediately."

Use fresh eggs.,
Bring the eggs to room temperature.,
Place the eggs in a saucepan of water.,
Slowly heat the water.,
Maintain the temperature for three to five minutes.,
Rinse the eggs with cold water.,
Store the eggs in your refrigerator.",How to Pasteurize Eggs1," As a general rule, relatively fresh eggs are safer to use than old eggs. Do not use an egg that is past its expiration date and never use an egg that has any cracks in the shell.;
, Take the eggs you plan on using out of the refrigerator and let them sit out on your kitchen counter for 15 to 20 minutes. The shell of each egg should feel close to room temperature before you proceed any further.


Do not use chilled eggs for this procedure. The egg yolks need to reach a temperature of 138 degrees Fahrenheit (58.9 degrees Celsius) before potential bacteria will die, but cold eggs may not warm up sufficiently during the limited amount of time they can spend in the warm water used for pasteurizing. Room temperature eggs, on the other hand, have a better chance.

, Fill a small saucepan halfway with cool to cold water. Carefully place the eggs inside the water, laying them on the bottom of the saucepan in a single layer.


If necessary, add more water to the saucepan after placing the eggs inside. The eggs should be covered by about 1 inch (2.5 cm) of water.
Attach an instant-read thermometer to the side of the pan. Make sure that the tip of the thermometer rests underneath the water so that it can read the temperature of the water throughout the process. You will need to monitor the temperature very closely.
Note that any instant-read thermometer will work, but a digital thermometer is probably your best bet since it allows you to read temperature fluctuations more precisely.

, Place the saucepan on the stove and heat it using a medium heat setting. Allow the water to reach a temperature of 140 degrees Fahrenheit (60 degrees Celsius).Ideally, you should not allow the temperature of the water to rise about 142 degrees Fahrenheit (61.1 degrees Celsius) during any point of the process. At higher temperatures, the consistency and properties of the egg could be altered. You may end up cooking the eggs slightly without even realizing it.
In a pinch, however, you might be able to allow the temperature to rise as high as 150 degrees Fahrenheit (65.6 degrees Celsius) without seeing significant changes in the quality of the raw egg. In particular, if you are not using a thermometer, you will need to watch the water and wait for bubbles to form on the bottom of the pan. When that happens, the temperature of the water will be about 150 degrees Fahrenheit (65.6 degrees Celsius). While this temperature is a little higher than the ideal, it can still work well enough.

, With the water temperature remaining constant at 140 degrees Fahrenheit, continue heating large eggs for a full three minutes. Extra large eggs should be kept in the hot water for five minutes.


Since the temperature of the water should never rise above 142 degrees Fahrenheit (61.1 degrees Celsius), you will need to continually monitor the temperature during this process. Adjust the temperature settings on you stove as needed to accomplish this task.
If you allowed the temperature of the water to rise to 150 degrees Fahrenheit (65.6 degrees Celsius) or if you are pasteurizing your eggs without the use of a thermometer, you should remove the pan from the heat source before allowing the eggs to sit in the hot water for three to five minutes.

, Carefully fish the eggs out of the water using a slotted spoon and rinse them under cold water until the shell drops down to room temperature or below.


Alternatively, you could place the eggs in a bowl of ice water instead of rinsing them under cool, running water. Running water is preferable since sitting water is more likely to develop bacteria, but either option will technically work.
Rinsing the eggs with cold water quickly drops the internal temperature of the egg, thereby preventing that temperature from continuing to rise or cook the egg.

, The eggs should be pasteurized at this point. You can use them right away or continue storing them in your refrigerator for another week or so.

Whisk constantly for until the temperature of the water drops.,
Use the eggs immediately.",How to Pasteurize Eggs2," The eggs should be as fresh as possible and free of cracks. Make sure that the eggs are also clean.


The use of room temperature eggs is not quite as important with this method since the egg white and/or yolk will be exposed to the heat more directly, but room temperature eggs are still slightly preferable with this method than cold eggs.

, Fill a large saucepan one-third to one-half full with water and set it on your stove over high heat. Allow it to reach a steady simmer and a steady steam before turning off the heat.


Continue on with the following step as you wait for the water to heat up.
You will also need a second stainless steel bowl that fits comfortably inside this large saucepan of water. The sides of your bowl need to be tall enough to prevent water from the outer pan from splashing inside. Do not place this bowl inside the water just yet, however.

, Crack your eggs and let the yolk and/or white fall directly into your second stainless steel bowl.


With this method, you can pasteurize both the egg white and egg yolk at the same time. If you only need the yolk or the white, though, you can separate the eggs before dropping the portion you need into the bowl. Discard the unneeded portion by dumping it down the drain of your kitchen sink.

, Combine the raw egg with a little liquid, using 2 Tbsp (30 ml) of liquid for each complete egg, egg white, or egg yolk. Whisk the ingredients together thoroughly until the egg starts to look foamy.


You can use any liquid called for within the recipe, including water, lemon juice, milk, or flavorings. Make sure that you do not add both lemon juice and milk at the same time, though, since the lemon juice (or any acidic liquid, for that matter) will cause the milk to curdle. Curdled milk can ruin the eggs by making them lumpy.

, Once the water is simmering and the heat has been turned off, place the bottom of the bowl inside your saucepan of water, holding it down using pliers or tongs if necessary.


This method uses a double boiler technique to heat and pasteurize the eggs indirectly. You could technically heat the eggs directly by skipping the extra saucepan of water, but doing so increases the risk of accidentally cooking the eggs instead of pasteurizing them. If you do heat the eggs directly, though, make sure that you use the lowest heat setting possible on your stove.

, As soon as you place the bowl of eggs in the hot water, you need to begin whisking the eggs with a fork or wire whisk. Continue whisking for two to three minutes, or until the water drops down to a lukewarm temperature.


The constant movement distributes the heat evenly throughout the egg mixture, thereby preventing the egg from cooking in any particular spot or from remaining partially unpasteurized.

, Let the eggs cool for three minutes or so, then use them as called for in your recipe. You should not attempt to refrigerate or freeze these eggs.

The loop resembles a circle.It's important to place it around the narrow end of the egg instead of the wide, as it will cut into the egg rather than the shell if you use it on the wide end.








, Twist the loop (round part) of the topper slightly around the egg as you do so. Metal teeth will slide out from the loop, and twisting the loop around the egg helps the blades cut the shell cleanly. Or, you can hold the topper steady, and twist the egg slightly in a clockwise or counterclockwise direction as you squeeze the blades. Either method will help to cut the shell all the way through.








, The topper cuts off approximately the top 1/2 inch of the egg. At this point, the shell may naturally come off with the instrument, or it may remain on the egg. If it remains on the egg, simply use a spoon or your fingers to lift it off.

, The top part of the shell will remain on the egg, but it will be completely loose. The topper cuts cleanly all the way through it. Remove it with a spoon or your fingers.








, You can also use an egg spoon if you have one available. The curve of the spoon should naturally follow the curve of the egg. Push it gently downward and then horizontally. 







, This loosens the body of the egg away from the surrounding shell. Be gentle so as not to break the egg itself. The spoon may cause several large cracks in the shell as you do this, which is fine.








, Try not to further crack the shell into small pieces as you do so, because particles may attach to the egg. Because it's soft boiled, the egg may run sightly at this point, so transfer it quickly.

Add 1/3 cup of water.,
Cover the bowl.,
Cook the egg.,
Remove the bowl from the microwave.",How to Microwave an Egg1," Any microwave-safe mug or bowl will work fine, but those with circular, flat bottoms work best. You'll end up with an egg in a convenient patty shape, perfect for serving on toast or an English muffin.;
, Dip a paper towel in a little bit of vegetable or olive oil and smear the oil around the inside of the bowl. You could also spray the mug or bowl with non-stick cooking spray. Melting butter into the bowl is another option.

, Be careful so you don't break the yolk.

, Just pour it right on on top of the egg.

, Use a microwave-safe plate or paper towel. This will help prevent any splatters from dirtying your microwave oven.

, Place it in the microwave and cook it on the highest power setting for 35 seconds. When it's done cooking, remove the paper towel and inspect the egg. If the white is still liquid, put it back in the microwave and cook for an additional 10 or 15 seconds. Microwave wattages will vary, so adjust these cooking times as needed based on your microwave's power. When the white is no longer runny, it is done cooking.


This cooking temperature results in a medium-cooked. If you want the yolk to stay runny, cook the egg at 50 percent power for about 60 seconds. Keep cooking until the white is set but the yolk is still runny.For a hard-cooked egg (similar to a hard-boiled egg) cook on the highest power setting for 60 seconds.

Leave the eggs in their original carton.,
Keep the eggs large-end up.,
Store the eggs on a central shelf in the refrigerator.",How to Store Eggs1," The packaging that your eggs come in when you first buy them is also the best place for them to remain while in storage. The composite material of the carton prevents the eggshells from absorbing odors from the other items in the refrigerator. It also serves to keep them safely spaced and covered so that they won’t be cracked or crushed.Built-in refrigerator egg compartments often require you to dump all your eggs in unprotected, which can lead to big messes and wasted eggs.
Leaving the eggs in their original carton also ensures that the expiration date remains in plain sight.;
, Eggs are situated in the carton with the bulbous end on top for a reason. This keeps the yolk centered inside, which protects it from breaking. A balanced, intact yolk will taste fresher and yields better results when used in miscellaneous recipes.Avoid moving or repositioning eggs too much, as this may damage the yolk or the natural air pockets inside.

, Many people think stashing their eggs on the inside of the door is more convenient. However, the main body of the refrigerator is superior for preserving eggs because it allows them to maintain a more consistent temperature. To maximize their lifespan, keep your eggs at around 40 degrees F (7 degrees C) or cooler.Frequent opening and closing of the refrigerator makes for more rapid changes in temperature around the door.
Processed eggs should always be refrigerated, while it may be okay to store raw, freshly laid eggs at room temperature."

Separate the whites from the yolks.,
Beat the eggs together.,
Add a pinch of sugar or salt.,
Freeze in an airtight container.",How to Store Eggs2," Crack the eggs you wish to freeze and pour the whites into a freezer-safe airtight container. Sift out the yolks—these should be placed in a separate container. Take care not to puncture the yolks while cracking and sifting the eggs.Protect separated egg yolks by refrigerating them in a bowl cold water.Storing the white and yolks separately will make them easier to use as needed in culinary projects.

, Alternately, you can just as easily freeze whole eggs without the need to separate them first. Simply whip the eggs until they’re completely integrated, then transfer them to the freezing container When properly frozen, whole eggs will usually stay fresh for up to a year.Freezing eggs whole can be a more space-effective storage solution.

, Eggs yolks have a tendency to harden into a thick gel when frozen. You can avoid this by mixing in a small amount of salt or sugar, which will keep the yolks from congealing. These additives make it more difficult for the proteins in the yolks to bond and solidify in low temperatures.Generally, you should aim to incorporate about ⅛ teaspoon of salt and 1 ½ teaspoons of sugar for every ¼ cup of eggs (about four large eggs).Use salt for eggs that are destined for savory dishes and sugar for those that will go into desserts and other sweet confections.

, As previously mentioned, the container you choose to freeze eggs should be one with a lid that makes it completely airtight. Otherwise, moisture may enter or escape from the container, potentially ruining the eggs. A lidded piece of Tupperware or similar container will work best for this purpose.If you happen to run low on spare storage containers, you can portion the yolks or white into an ordinary ice cube tray.Freezer bags aren’t recommended, as they can easily burst and create a mess. Should you be forced to use a freezer bag, make sure it’s securely sealed and that you’ve pressed out all excess air before closing it.

Beware of eggs that have a foul odor.,
Look for cloudy whites.,
Check the consistency of the yolk.,
Place the egg in a bowl of water to see if it floats.",How to Store Eggs3," The easiest way to tell when a package of eggs has gone bad is to take a whiff. After awhile, expired eggs will begin to emit an unpleasant sulfur stench. This odor is unignorable, so if you don’t detect anything offputting, there’s a good chance your eggs are okay.Fresh eggs should have no real smell of any kind.
Dispose of rotten eggs down the garbage disposal rather than the trash to keep the stench from spreading throughout your home.

, Once you crack the egg, take note of the condition of the white and yolk. Young egg whites should have a somewhat milky appearance due to their high natural protein content. As the egg ages and begins to break down, the white will become perfectly clear, and may turn thin and soupy.Clear whites don’t necessarily mean that an egg is bad, but they can be an indicator of freshness.
Avoid cooking with eggs that contain watery whites, as these have a more difficult time binding ingredients together.

, A healthy egg yolk will be firm and intact, with a rich golden-yellow color. By contrast, bad eggs will almost always contain flat, asymmetrical or easily-ruptured yolks. Dull-looking yolks are a clear sign that the egg is past its prime.Fresh eggs from pastured chickens often have large yolks that are a darker orange color and take up more of the area inside the egg., One time-honored method of testing the quality of questionable eggs is to submerge them in a few inches of water. If the egg is fresh, it will sink straight to the bottom of the bowl. If it bobs to the surface or hovers near the waterline, you may be better off acquiring another batch. When the shells of older eggs deteriorate, it creates a buildup of gasses inside, which will cause them to float.The float test will allow you to find out whether your eggs are still good without having to crack them.

Keep crostini, bread slices or crackers in a bowl.",How to Serve Cheese," Many experts like the combination of a soft creamy cheese, a blue cheese and a hard cheese. For example, Camembert, Stilton and Manchego.;
, One wheel of aged or traditional cheese is perfect for surprise guests or a snack before going out to dinner., Once you know what type of wine, beer or spirits you’ll be serving, go to the local cheese counter and ask for suggested pairings., Try to use the cuisine of the country where the cheese is made as a guide. For example, a Spanish cheese might pair well with roasted peppers and a feta might go well with olives.


Other common pairings include quince paste, fruit, jam, salt, pickled items and butter or oil.
A good pairing will bring out the flavor of the cheese. However, you should taste test to ensure a good match., They should be served at room temperature.


Keep the climate in mind before you serve. If it’s a hot summer day, your cheese may only need 10 or 15 minutes. If your refrigerator is particularly cold, your cheese may take an hour to come to room temperature., Keep the rest of the wheel in a cool room or refrigerator.

, Wipe the knife, then score the cheese rind.


Apply pressure to the section of cheese you want to cut off by rocking the knife back and forth.

,, Good etiquette dictates that guests shouldn’t leave the rind on the board, whether or not they follow that rule. Most rinds are edible.

, Unless your crowd recognizes cheese by sight, a small chalkboard, a serving card or a label will help them navigate. You are less likely to have people select a cheese that they won’t like and refuse to eat if you label everything.

Multiply the number of people you are hosting by the number of oz. you want to provide and shop accordingly.

, Cheese platters or trays should be large, so that a person can cut off a piece of cheese without it touching other types of cheese with their hands or utensils.

, Cut two, lay them perpendicularly to the cheese wedge and lay a sharp knife nearby.


Avoid cutting all the cheese into slices or cubes. It will dry out more quickly, especially if it is left out in the open air.

Serve light cheeses before dinner.,
Choose a variety of cheeses.,
Develop a regional theme.,
Use cheeses made from different types of milk.,
Stay in the same family.",How to Serve Cheese As an Appetizer1," For an appetizer, you will want to serve light cheeses that are not heavy and will not fill your guests. You want to whet your guest’s appetites, not satiate them. Consider serving light cheeses like fresh mozzarella and goat cheese.You might also consider a light cheese that pairs well with the main meal that you are serving. For example, goat cheese is a great compliment to Mediterranean or Middle Eastern dishes.;
, In order to appreciate the truly complex flavors of cheese, the best strategy is to opt for a variety of different cheese types. Serve soft and hard cheeses with distinctly varied flavors. Mix in cheeses from different animals and from multiple geographic locations.Ideally, you will want to serve three to five cheeses. More than that can get a little overwhelming and crowd your serving area.
For example, you may want to offer your guests a plate that includes Comte, camembert, Manchego, and gorgonzola.

, One method of determining what cheeses to serve is to choose cheese from a specific geographic area. Focus on cheese from a certain country or a specific cheese-producing region. For example, you might decide that you want to serve Italian cheeses or choose serve cheeses exclusive to the Loire Valley of France.You can also do the opposite of this and serve a variety of cheese from around the world.

, You can also pick your cheeses based on the animal that produced it. Serve cheeses that come from goat, sheep, and cow’s milk. This will give you a variety of flavors and a unique pairing., If you want a lesson in how to spot the differences between cheeses of the same family, consider a more homogenous cheese plate. For example, serve three or four different styles of brie and camembert. Let your guests appreciate the similarities of the cheeses while exploring their subtle differences."
"
Serve savory accompaniments.,
Choose plain or neutral-flavored crackers and breads.,
Skip most raw vegetables.,
Pick sweet fruits that are not too acidic.,
Pair your cheese with your wine.,
Match your cheese with the right beer.",How to Serve Cheese As an Appetizer2," When you are serving cheese as an appetizer, try to pair it with savory foods. This can include cured meats, like prosciutto and salami, nuts, roasted red peppers, and sauces like mustards and chutneys. You might also consider serving caramelized onions or artichoke hearts.Try to avoid spicy things. The heat of these foods can overwhelm the flavor of your cheese.
Olives also make a good accompaniment.

, Avoid any strong-flavored breads or crackers that will overwhelm the flavor of your cheeses. Skip any items that have garlic or herb flavorings. Instead, choose sourdough or French bread and neutral-flavored crackers., Although not all vegetables are bad for pairing with cheese, try to avoid those with strong flavors. Carrots, broccoli, and cauliflower are not natural pairings with most cheeses. If you are going to serve vegetables, stick with things like sliced fennel and endive spears., Serve your guests fruits like apples, pears, grapes, and figs. You might also want to serve some dried fruits and raisins. These items will complement the flavors of your cheeses and not distract from or overwhelm them.Avoid fruits like orange, grapefruit, kiwi and pineapple. These fruits have a tendency to make the cheeses taste bitter in your mouth.

, In general, you should try to pair milder cheese with lighter, milder wine and stronger-flavored cheeses with more robust, bolder wines. When in doubt, it also helps to remember the old adage, “what grows together goes together.” Cheeses from specific regions tend to pair well with wines from the same area. For example, a goat cheese from the Loire pairs well with a Loire Sancerre.
If you are struggling to determine good pairings, talk to a sommelier or a cheesemonger.

, The rules for pairing cheeses and beers are very similar to those that dictate wine. Lighter cheeses go well with lighter beers and stronger cheeses pair well with darker, heavier beers. You should also look with an eye for geography and try to create pairings from the same region.Consider having a variety of beers available for your guests that pair well with the cheeses available.

"
Determine how much to serve.,
Precut hard, semi-hard and semi-soft cheeses into wedges or cubes.,
Present soft cheeses whole.,
Serve the cheese at room temperature.",How to Serve Cheese As an Appetizer3," You will want to avoid over serving your guests during the appetizer. In order to accomplish this, you should plan to serve about 1 to 2 ounces (28 to 57 grams) of cheese per guest. Ultimately, the amount of cheese you will serve is going to depend on how many guests you invite.For example, if your dinner party includes eight people, you will want to make sure that you serve at least 16 ounces (454 grams) of cheese.

, You should slice firmer cheeses before serving them to your guests. With the harder cheese in particular, you do not want your guests struggling to cut off slices on the tray. Make things easy for your guests by slicing or breaking off chunks of the cheese beforehand.Hard and semi-hard cheeses include gouda, cheddar, Swiss and parmesan.
Semi-soft cheeses include bleu cheese, Monterey Jack and Havarti.
Exposure to the air can really enhance the flavor of certain semi-hard cheeses.

, Leave soft cheeses in their rind and do not cut into them before you serve them. Because your guests will want to spread these cheeses on crackers and breads, you should serve them whole with a knife. The interior of some of these cheeses is runny so you will want to keep it whole until you serve your guests.Soft cheeses include brie and camembert.
The rind is the firm exterior of the cheese. With many soft cheeses, the rind is edible.

, Because cold mutes flavor, you will want to make sure that you serve your cheeses at room temperature. Be sure to remove your cheeses from the refrigerator at least an hour before serving them. Some harder cheeses may need two hours to properly warm up and aerate.Make sure you do not set out your cheeses in a warm room. This can cause them to melt.

"
"
Give the cheeses some room.,
Keep the cheese separate from other foods.,
Use a different knife for each cheese.,
Create the proper arrangement.",How to Serve Cheese As an Appetizer4," When you present your cheeses, make sure that they are not too close together. Stronger smelling cheeses can overwhelm lighter cheeses. If you place your milder cheeses close to a stinky cheese, they all may end up tasting like the pungent cheese. Spreading out your cheeses also makes it easier for your guests to get to them.If you really want to give your cheeses some room, consider placing them on their own plate or platter.

, You should also avoid placing the cheeses in close proximity to the foods with which you have paired them. This will prevent stronger smelling items from overwhelming your lighter cheeses. Although it may be esthetically more pleasing to have everything clumped together, spreading things out will preserve the flavor of the cheese and prevent any traffic jams at the hors d’oeuvres table.

, For your softer cheeses, make sure to give each cheese its own knife. This will prevent a cross-contamination of flavors. The same is true for your harder cheeses if you decide not to precut them.A butter knife will work well for softer cheeses. You may need a paring knife for harder cheeses.

, In order to help guide your guests, you may want to consider arranging your cheeses in a clockwise fashion from mildest to most pungent. You may also want to label the cheeses and briefly note their characteristics. Place the cheeses on a circular platter or a Lazy Susan to facilitate access and visibility."

Use several pieces of plastic wrap and make sure the entire rind is covered., During this time the brie will harden, which will make it easier to remove the rind.


30 minutes is the minimum amount of time necessary to give the brie the chance to firm up. If you have more time, it's fine to freeze the brie for a few hours or even overnight.

, If the brie still feels soft, put it back in the freezer for another half hour. This method only works if the brie is completely firm. If it feels stiff to the touch, place the brie on a cutting board.

, Stand the brie on its side and use a serrated knife to slice both circular ends off of the brie. Once you've made the cut, use your fingers to pry off the rind. If the brie is sufficiently firm, the top and bottom should be easy to cut off.


If it's difficult to slice through the brie or remove the rind from the cheese, wrap the brie in plastic and place it in the freezer for an additional 30 minutes, then try again.

, Lay the brie flat against the cutting board. Use the serrated knife to cut along the edge of the brie to slice off the sides. As you cut, start pulling the sides of the rind away from the brie, bit by bit. Continue until you've completely removed the rind from the brie.


In order to keep the brie from sticking to the cutting board, you might want to lay a piece of waxed paper or parchment paper on the board before setting down the wheel of cheese.
If the cheese seems to be sticking to the rind, wrap the wheel in plastic wrap and place it in the freezer to harden before trying again.

, Allow the cold cheese to come to room temperature before serving.

Offer Boursin as a spread.,
Pair Boursin with a simple platter.,
Offer less standard snacks, too.",How to Serve Boursin Cheese1," Boursin cheese is soft and creamy, so don’t expect to serve it as you would with, say, hard cheddar, which you can cut into firm cubes and serve with toothpicks for handholds. Provide a knife or spoon so guests can spread it on other snacks. Also be sure that you transfer it, if needed, to a hard serving plate or bowl if it’s wrapped in foil, since a knife could potentially slice the foil.;
, Stick with the classic platter snacks if you’re a traditionalist. Arrange slices of bread and/or assorted crackers around your cheese. If fruits and vegetables are more your thing, do the same with them, or offer both. However, if you do both, keep the fruits and veggies separated from the bread and crackers, since the moisture from one could soften the other., Boursin is very versatile when it comes to being paired with other foods. Surprise your guests with more than the same-old same-old. Instead of (or in addition to) the crackers and veggies, consider offering dry cured meats, olives, jam, honey, and/or chocolate."

Place a pan on an even burner and begin with a burner temperature just below medium heat.,
Within a few minutes of turning the burner on, spray olive oil (see the tips section on this) or place three tablespoons of melted butter into the bottom of the pan.,
Allow the pan to heat, but not so much as to cause the oil or butter to burn.,
Break the first egg into a small dish or bowl and then lower the dish into the hot pan and gently pour the egg into the pan.,
Continue to break up to three eggs, one at a time, into the dish and transfer them to the pan.,
After one or two minutes of cooking, take the cover for the pan and run approximately one to two tablespoons of tap water into its underside.,
Observe the hardness of the yolk by lifting the pan lid from time to time.,
Use the spatula (and this is the first and only time you should have to use the spatula) and gently lift the eggs out onto a plate.

",How to Make Fried Eggs Without Flipping Them," Use a pan with enough space to allow for some running between eggs. Avoid frying more than three eggs at a time. Watch the temperature as you cook. Be on the safe side - turning down the heat a little is better than too much heat. A burned egg isn't appealing.;
, Monitor the burner temperature to avoid browning the oil or butter.

, A lower temperature is better; too high, and you will burn the oil and eggs quickly.

, You should hear a slight sizzle, but there shouldn't be popping or violent splattering occurring.

, Do this quickly so your eggs will finish at approximately the same time.

, Pour this water into the pan, but not directly onto the eggs. Then put the lid on the frying pan and cook the eggs for four to seven minutes, depending upon the heat. The water will create a hood over the egg yolks. (You can also melt butter and spoon it over the egg yolks and then put the pan lid on to create approximately the same effect, but with a much higher calorie count.)

, When the desired ""doneness"" is near, remove the lid of the pan so that the remaining water can evaporate. The goal is to have a well-cooked egg without the crispy edges -- that may take some practice, but once you've found the right burner setting, remember what it is. The water helps to provide a moist cooking environment so the oil is never allowed to directly burn the egg.

, During this time the brie will harden, which will make it easier to remove the rind.


30 minutes is the minimum amount of time necessary to give the brie the chance to firm up. If you have more time, it's fine to freeze the brie for a few hours or even overnight.

, If the brie still feels soft, put it back in the freezer for another half hour. This method only works if the brie is completely firm. If it feels stiff to the touch, place the brie on a cutting board.

, Place the brie on a cutting board and use a serrated knife to slice the top off of the brie. Once you've made the cut, use your fingers to pry off the rind. If the brie is sufficiently firm, the top should be easy to cut off.


Slicing off just the top leaves a ""bowl"" for the creamy cheese to be scooped from when eating or preparing to serve. This same method can be used for a pie slice of brie as well. If preferred all the rind can be removed before cooking or serving.
Use caution to remove as little of the creamy cheese as possible and only remove the white dry rind.

, Put the brie in a baking dish and bake it for 15 to 20 minutes at 300 degrees. It should be shiny and creamy when done.

, Tart, sweet berry or orange jam perfectly complements the creamy, salty brie., Whole wheat or water crackers are both excellent with baked brie.

Then read the cooking directions for your particular brand of elbow pasta. Pour the recommended amount of water into a large pot to cook 12 ounces (340 g) and turn the burner’s heat to high. Once the water comes to a boil, add the pasta. Cook for about a minute less than the directions advise for al dente. Then transfer the pasta to a strainer in the sink and drain the water., First, melt one stick of unsalted butter in your microwave or a small pot on the stovetop. While that melts, empty 2.5 sleeves of Ritz crackers into a large mixing bowl. Use your hands to crumble them into small chunks. Then add ¾ cup (84.75 g) of shredded sharp cheddar cheese and then the melted butter. Stir until they are evenly mixed., First, divide 24 paper muffin liners between two standard-size muffin tins (with each one holding 12 liners). Then coat the inside of the liners with non-stick cooking spray so they peel easily from your finished cupcakes. Split the mixture for the bottom crust between the liners as evenly as possible. Use the bottom of a small glass or similar hard, circular object to flatten the mixture into a compact bottom for your cupcakes., In a second large mixing bowl, combine the cooked pasta with 3.25 cups (367.25 g) of shredded sharp cheddar cheese, plus 5.2 ounces (147.5 g) of Boursin garlic-herb cheese and 2 tablespoons of cold unsalted butter. Then, in a third mixing bowl, whisk together 2 large eggs, ¾ cup (177.5 ml) of whole milk, and ¼ cup of sour cream (57.5 g). Once mixed, pour the liquid ingredients into the pasta bowl, add ¼ teaspoon of salt and ⅛ teaspoon of red pepper flakes, and gently stir to combine., First, ladle equal portions of the mac and cheese into each muffin liner. Once they’re all filled, place the tin in the oven. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, or until the tops begin to turn a light golden brown.

Wash them all under running water to remove any dirt and trace chemicals. Then peel the potatoes and cut them into roughly 1-inch (2.5 cm) cubes. Next, if using fresh kale, remove the leaves from the stems and chop them into bite-size pieces., Place them into a large pot. Fill the pot with enough water to cover them. Place the pot on your stovetop’s burner and turn the heat to medium-high. To bring the water to a boil faster, cover the pot. Once the water begins to boil, remove the lid and cook uncovered for an additional ten minutes, or until the potatoes turn tender. Then transfer to a strainer in the sink to drain the water. Leave them there for now., Return the empty pot to the stovetop. Add ½ cup (118 ml) of whole milk and ½ cup (118 ml) of heavy cream. Then stir in your kale, plus 10.4 ounces of Boursin cheese (295 g). Turn the burner to medium heat. Once the mixture begins to boil, lower the heat to simmer and cover the pot. Cook for roughly 5 minutes, or until the kale wilts and turns tender. Stir in ½ teaspoon of salt and ¼ teaspoon of black pepper and then remove the pot from the hot burner., Return the potatoes to the pot. Use a potato masher to mash them into your cheese mixture.

Do not remove the mixture from the dish until the halloumi has been coated in it., You can keep the halloumi in its original block form, cut it in half, or cut it into strips. Turn it around in the mixture to coat it thoroughly. Next, allow the halloumi to marinate for one hour. Turn the cheese once during the hour., Simmer these ingredients on a high heat setting for a few minutes. Then, bring the heat down to medium and cook the mixture. Stir it occasionally until it has a thick consistency and then remove it.This should take 12 to 15 minutes for fresh berries.
It will take 20 to 30 minutes altogether if you’re using frozen berries.

, This will prevent the food from sticking to the grill. First, allow the grill to heat up. After that, put oil on a folded paper towel. Use tongs to to rub the towel over the rack.


Do not put cooking spray on a very hot grill., Make sure the grill is preheated to medium-high. Put the halloumi in a pan and grill it until is warm. This should take about two minutes for each side. You can use a metal spatula to loosen the halloumi before flipping it to the other side., Take the jam you made and serve it with the halloumi. It should be served at room temperature.

The least amount of time you should let it soak is two hours, but it is also okay to allow it to soak overnight., Use a knife to cut the halloumi into long slices that would be the ideal size and length for skewers. Once the slices have been made, thread them onto the skewers. The amount of cheese that you cut depends on the amount of people that you want to serve, though the amount of ingredients used in this recipe is made to serve four to six people.Use metal skewers or wooden skewers that have soaked in water for ten minutes.
You can find skewers at most supermarkets.

, Drizzle the skewered halloumi with two tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil. Make sure that the olive oil is evenly distributed over the cheese., Use a pinch of both the oregano and black pepper. Evenly sprinkle the ingredients over the halloumi cheese.

, You will need an outdoor barbecue to grill the halloumi skewers. If you don’t have an outdoor barbecue, you can use a hot griddle pan. The hot griddle pan will work just as well to grill the halloumi.

, Do this after they have been skewered and sprinkled. Grill for two to three minutes on each side., Remove the skewers off of the barbecue and put them onto plates or a tray. Serve them with the sauce of your choice, or no sauce at all if you don’t want it. A few sauces that pair well with this recipe are smoky pepper tomato salsa, creamy Aji green sauce, and chimichurri sauce.If you don’t want to make your own sauce, look for a premade sauce, like the salsa, at your local grocery store.

Cube the cheese.,
Melt the butter in a medium saucepan.Add 2 Tbsp (30 ml) of butter to a small saucepan and place it on your stove.,
Heat up the Velveeta.,
Add milk, if desired.,
Melt the cheese product down completely.,
Serve warm.",How to Melt Velveeta Cheese1," Use a sharp kitchen knife to cut the Velveeta cheese into 1/2-inch to 1-inch (1.25 to 2.5 cm) cubes.


Smaller cubes will melt quicker and more evenly than larger cubes. Regardless of what size exactly you make the cubes, try to make sure that all the cubes are roughly the same size. Cubes that are unevenly sized will melt at different rates, and as a result, some of the cheese may burn before the rest melts down.;
, Heat the butter on a medium-low, stirring it frequently with a wooden mixing spoon, until the butter has completely melted and spread over the bottom of the pan.


You should not skip the butter when melting Velveeta using this method. The butter prevents the cheese from coming into direct contact with the bottom of the pan, acting as a thin barrier to prevent the Velveeta from burning.
Do not use a heat higher than medium-low at any point throughout the process.

, Add the Velveeta cubes to the saucepan, spreading them out evenly across the bottom. Stir the cubes into the melted butter, coating them thoroughly. Continue heating and stirring the Velveeta for several minutes or until the cheese is halfway melted.


You must stir the cheese constantly as it melts. If you do not stir the cheese, parts of it could end up burning.
As you stir, make sure that you scrape the bottom of the pan.

, Velveeta cheese can turn into a burnt, lumpy, and thick mess when you melt it using this method, but you should be able to prevent all of that from happening by adding up to 7 Tbsp (105 ml) of milk to the pan when the cheese is only partially melted.


You may not need to add the milk; Velveeta can melt on the stove without it. The addition of milk is strongly recommended because it makes it much easier to melt the cheese product evenly and thoroughly without trouble.

, Continue heating the Velveeta mixture on medium-low heat, stirring constantly, until it melts down into a smooth sauce.

, Use the melted Velveeta as a sauce or dip, or in another recipe, as soon as you melt it down and while it still feels warm. If you wait too long, the cheese could thicken up again.

Cut the Velveeta cheese into cubes.,
Boil water in the bottom part of a double boiler.Fill the bottom half of a double boiler with 2 to 3 inches (5 to 7.6 cm) of water.,
Melt the butter in the top part of the double boiler.,
Add and melt the cheese.,
Serve warm.",How to Melt Velveeta Cheese2," Cut the brick of Velveeta cheese into cubes that are roughly 1/2-inch to 1-inch (1.25 to 2.5 cm) around.


Cut the Velveeta into evenly sized pieces to make sure that it melts down at an even pace.
Smaller cubes will melt faster than large cubes.

, Place this portion on the stove and heat it on medium-high for a couple of minutes, or until the water starts to boil.


If you do not have a double boiler, use a large saucepan for the bottom portion and a stainless steel bowl capable of resting around the mouth of the saucepan for the top portion.
Make sure that the water level is not high enough to touch the top half of your double boiler.
After the water boils, you should reduce the heat as needed to keep the water at a steady simmer.

, Add the butter to the top half of the double boiler and place the top half over the bottom. Stir the butter using a wooden mixing spoon, heating it indirectly until it melts down completely and spreads over the bottom of the pan.


The butter is not strictly essential for this method, but it is still strongly recommended since it gives the Velveeta an extra layer of protection against the heat and helps prevent the cheese product from burning.

, Toss the cubes of Velveeta into the top part of the double boiler, as well. Mix them continuously with your mixing spoon until they melt down into a thick, creamy sauce.


Note that you do not need to add milk to this version, so the resulting sauce will be thicker than the melted cheese sauce produced by the saucepan method.
You still need to stir the cheese continually as it melts to make sure that it does not burn or otherwise melt unevenly.

, If you let the melted Velveeta sit out at room temperature for too long, it can start to solidify again. It is best to use the Velveeta cheese while it is still warm and freshly melted.

Cube the Velveeta.,
Combine the milk and cheese in a microwave-safe dish.,
Microwave in 30 second intervals.,
Serve warm.",How to Melt Velveeta Cheese3," Cut the Velveeta cheese brick with a sharp kitchen knife. The resulting cubes should each be about 1/2 inch to 1 inch (1.25 to 2.5 cm) in every dimension.


Make sure that the cubes are all evenly sized to ensure even melting.
Small cubes are better than large ones since they melt quicker.

, Arrange the cubes of Velveeta cheese in a medium to large microwave-safe dish and pour up to 7 Tbsp (105 ml) of milk over them. Cover the dish with a lid or a piece of microwave-safe plastic wrap.


The use of milk is strongly advised for this method since it prevents the cheese from burning in the microwave. Furthermore, the milk creates a much smoother sauce.

, Place the dish in the microwave and cook the mixture on high for 30 seconds. Stir the contents of the dish, then microwave it again for another 30 seconds. Repeat as needed until the cheese melts down into a smooth sauce.You may need to microwave the Velveeta for up to 2 or 3 minutes total.
Frequent stirring is necessary if you want to prevent the cheese from burning as it melts.

, The Velveeta cheese product should be served or otherwise used as soon as it comes out of the microwave. If you let it sit out too long or attempt to refrigerate it, the Velveeta will start to solidify again.

Cut the Velveeta into cubes.,
Cook the cheese for 30 minutes.,
Cook for an additional 1 to 2 hours.,
Serve warm.",How to Melt Velveeta Cheese4," Use a sharp kitchen knife to separate the cheese product into 1/2-inch to 1-inch (1.25 to 2.5 cm) cubes.


Cut the cubes so that they are all roughly the same size. Also keep in mind that small cubes tend to melt faster than larger cubes.

, Place the cubes of Velveeta into your slow cooker and cover the machine. Heat the cheese using the low setting for a total of 30 minutes, then open the lid and stir the partially melted cubes.


Stirring the cheese at this time helps promote even melting.
You should not need to add butter or milk to the Velveeta when you use this method. Since a slow cooker uses such a low, slow heat, there is very little chance that the Velveeta will burn or become lumpy. As such, there is no real need for the addition of other ingredients.

, Replace the lid on your slow cooker and continue cooking the cheese until it melts down into a smooth, thick sauce. This can take anywhere from 1 to 2 hours.Try not to stir or remove the lid of the slow cooker during this time. The steam that builds up inside the machine is partially responsible for the melting process, so that process may take longer if you frequently lift that lid off.

, If you need the Velveeta to remain warm for a long time, switch the setting of the slow cooker to “warm” and serve or use the melted cheese directly out of the slow cooker.

Turn the peppers every 5 minutes to ensure that they’re roasted evenly on all sides.You can adjust the number of peppers to suit your tastes. If you don’t want your dip to be very spicy, stick to 1 pepper. If you prefer a spicier dip, use 2.
You can substitute any hot peppers that you like for the banana peppers. Jalapenos are a good option.
When you’re broiling the peppers, set the rack in the upper third of the oven so there is approximately 8- to 9-inches (20- to 23-cm) between the peppers and the broiling element.;
, When the peppers are finished roasting, transfer them to a bowl and cover them with a towel so they cool enough that you can handle them. Remove the skins, seeds, and stems, and use a sharp knife to finely chop them.When you’re handling hot peppers, particularly the seeds, it’s a good idea to wear rubber gloves. The oils in the peppers can irritate your skin and eyes.

, Add the chopped banana peppers, ⅓ pound (151 g) of feta cheese, ⅓ cup (95 g) of Greek yogurt, and 2 teaspoons (10 ml) of cider vinegar to the bowl of a food processor. Process the mixture until it has a thick, fairly smooth texture.Be sure to use plain Greek yogurt for the dip.

, Once you’ve processed the pepper mixture, slowly begin to pour 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of olive oil into the food processor while you pulse it.

Choose a variety of cheeses that range in flavor from mild to strong.,
Serve soft cheeses whole.,
Slice hard cheeses uniformly.,
Arrange cheeses according to intensity of flavor and milk content.,
Offer accompaniments with cheeses.",How to Prepare Wine and Cheese1," Serving a variety ensures that all of your guests can find something to suit their palates. Choose 3 to 5 varieties of cheese for a party of 20 guests where the cheese will serve as an appetizer or first course. Add 1 variety of cheese for every 10 additional guests. If cheese is being served as the main meal at your gathering, start with 5 to 7 varieties and add 1 variety for every additional 10 guests.


Choose some mild cheeses, like a fresh buffalo mozzarella with a mild flavor and creamy texture. Select others with strong flavors, like an herb Havarti. This will allow guests to experience the difference between mild and strong cheeses from various regions.
Offer at least 1 commonly known cheese for every cheese that is lesser known. Prepare cheddar or Swiss if you're offering Havarti or Emmentaler. This will give guests who aren't familiar with rarer cheese varieties something that tastes familiar.;
,


Soft cheeses like Brie that are soft but encased in a hard rind are best served whole to keep them intact until eaten. Place the whole round on a chilled serving platter with a cheese knife that guests can use to spread the cheese on crackers or fruit. The chilled platter will prevent soft cheeses from running.

, Use a sharp, non-serrated knife to slice hard cheeses into slices about 1/4-inch thick. Slice round cheeses into thin triangular wedges. Shave thin wafers off wedge-shaped cheeses. Crumbly cheeses, like Bleu cheese, can be formed into small, bite-size pieces.

, Keep cheeses like aged Cheddar and Brie together, because these flavors will be very intense. Place milder, non-aged cheeses, like Mozzarella, on a separate platter.


Separate cheeses made from different milks. Cow's milk cheese is balanced in fat and protein content, giving it a versatile creamy texture found in cheeses like Muenster and Gouda. Sheep's milk has a higher lactose content that results in stronger cheeses like Roquefort and Pecorino Romano. Goat's milk cheese is tangier than cow's milk or sheep's milk due to it's low potassium level, resulting in cheeses like Bucheron that have a tangy bite.
The flavors of cheeses that are made and then aged before being served, like Cheddar and Bleu, intensify as they are aged. This is why non-aged cheeses tend to have a milder flavor than aged varieties.
Bring all cheeses to room temperature about a half hour before serving to enhance their flavor. Serve hard cheeses on wooden cutting boards for a level cutting surface with a separate cheese knife for each selection.

,


Intersperse cheese selections with crackers, bread rounds, grapes or fruit slices. These will enhance the flavors of the cheeses. Unsalted nuts and whole-grain breads and crackers help cleanse the palate between wine and cheese selections.
Complement classic Italian cheeses like Asiago or Reggiano with Italian condiments like olives or bread cubes dipped in herb olive oil.
Pair strongly flavored or salty cheeses like Blue, Feta and Gorgonzola with honey, grapes or berries to balance out the saltiness with sweetness. Soft cheeses like Brie pair well with condiments that have contrasting textures, like crackers or toasted bread.
Goat's milk and sheep's milk cheeses pair well with caramelized or salted pecans, walnuts or almonds. Cow's and goat's milk cheeses also go well with chorizo or serrano ham.

Serve full-bodied white wines like Chardonnay and lighter red wines like Pinot Noir at slightly below normal room temperature. Chill the wine in the refrigerator for a few hours or overnight, then let it stand at room temperature for about 45 minutes before serving.
Lighter white wines like Pinot Grigio and Sauvignon Blanc should be chilled until just before serving. Keep these wines in a refrigerator or wine locker that will keep them at around 52 degrees Fahrenheit (11 degrees Celsius).
Keep white wines cold until they are poured by using a chilled ice bucket or wine refrigerator at the serving table.

, Wines of all varieties should be uncorked and allowed to breathe. This enhances the full flavor and undertones of the wine.


Pour the wine into a decanter, which is a glass vessel with a wide body and narrow mouth, to expose wine to the maximum amount of oxygen. When decanting red wines, tip the wine bottle as little as possible. This will keep most of the sediment in the bottle instead of in the decanter. Swirl red wines in the decanter after pouring to expose it to the air.
Dark red wines, like Shiraz and Syrah, that have a lot of tannins should be aerated for 1 to 2 hours before serving. This will reduce the tannic flavor. White wines, lighter red wines like Pinot Noir and rose wines have few tannins, so they only require about 20 to 30 minutes to breathe before serving.

,


Red wine glasses have shorter stems and wider mouths. These glasses allow for rich red wines to aerate as the wine is being consumed.
White wine glasses have longer stems and taller, more slender mouths. Consider chilling white wine glasses to keep the wine cold when poured.
Use a table side wine chiller to keep white wine at the optimum serving temperature. Some chillers have separate temperature compartments to store white and red wines.

Place the reindeer carefully down on the serving plate.,
Make the remaining reindeer cheese triangles in the same manner.",How to Make Reindeer Cheese Triangles," In this way, you can work through each reindeer in the manner of a production line without having to stop and chop anything or remove wrappers, etc.;
, Cut small triangle shapes from the bell pepper, tomato or other red savory food item you're using as the nose. The triangle can be pretty rough but it shouldn't be too large for the tip of the cheese. Cut sufficient for the amount of cheese triangles you're using.

, If you're using peppercorns, simply tip them into a small container to make them easy to grab. If using half olives or other food items needing chopping, cut them into small rounds now. Keep within easy reach.

, Carefully unwrap each cheese triangle to be used. Take care not to pull off the end of the triangle as you're unwrapping but if you accidentally do, the nose should cover this mistake. Take it slowly rather than rushing this step. When peeled, lay the peeled cheese on a silicone sheet or parchment paper piece over a plate or tray, so that the cheese stays clean and is easy to pick up.

, Ensure that you use only the ones that are perfect; do not use broken ones as they won't work without all the holes being intact (feel free to munch on those ones).


Small nicks out of the pretzels are okay unless you're after perfection.

, Ensure that it is clean and ready for food. Do not line it with anything made of paper––paper napkins, etc., will stick to the cheese and ruin it for eating. If you want to line it, use something made from plastic, silicone or another non-stick surface.

, It may be easiest to add the pretzels first, but you will likely find your own rhythm as you're making the reindeer as everything stays stuck to the cheese once on, in which case, simply shift around the steps for adding the features to suit your preference.

, Slide the bottom hole of a whole pretzel over the base corner of the wider end of the cheese triangle. It should fit snugly in place. Repeat for the other base corner on the wide end of the cheese triangle, again fitting it snugly. Presto, you have two antlers added without much ado.

, On the single narrow tip end of the cheese triangle, gently press the nose shape on the top. It should stick fairly easily, as the cheese is sticky enough. However, you may need to adjust the nose size if you think it appears too big or small; the first reindeer can be a good guide.

, Press in the peppercorns or olive halves gently where you think the eyes look best, a little way under the wide end of the cheese triangle. Be sure to space the eyes apart evenly, unless you want a crazy reindeer, which is fine too.

, Stand back and check that you're happy with how it has turned out. It now serves as the basic template to follow for the remaining cheese triangles.

, You should find that you get quicker the more you make, as you hit a rhythm and get the knack for it. When each one is completed, carefully arrange on the serving platter.

This is especially true if you are baking mozzarella on bread or crust, like when you make a pizza. Instead of loading up on cheese, try a smaller amount than you might be tempted to use., One way to avoid watery mozzarella is to mix it with another cheese while cooking. For example, if you are baking a pizza, you can mix mozzarella with a harder cheese like parmesan. This will result in a less watery layer of cheese than if you use only mozzarella.

, If you are making a pizza, you can prevent your mozzarella from getting too watery by baking the crust for a few minutes before adding the mozzarella. Try placing the sauce on your crust and baking the crust and sauce for about 5 minutes. Then remove the pizza from the oven and add the cheese. Finish baking the pizza."

Try using low-moisture mozzarella.,

Avoid buffalo mozzarella.",How to Prevent Mozzarella from Getting Watery3," If you are using mozzarella in a dish that needs to be cooked, such as a pizza, you can opt for a low moisture variety of mozzarella. Low moisture mozzarella is generally dry to the touch, and should exude less moisture as it is cooked. You can find it next to other varieties of mozzarella at your local grocery.Low-moisture mozzarella can be purchased already shredded or in a block.

, Low-fat mozzarella will exude less oil than a full-fat variety. If you are cooking with mozzarella, a low-fat variety can be less watery than full-fat mozzarella. This can be a good choice in dishes like pizza and lasagna where watery mozzarella can be problematic. Keep in mind that low-fat mozzarella might not melt as well as a full-fat variety., Traditional buffalo mozzarella, also known as mozzarella di bufala, is an Italian cheese made with buffalo milk. This variety of mozzarella has a high water and fat content, which contributes to its watery texture. When cooked, this variety becomes quite watery."

Use fresh eggs.,
Choose a good pan.,
Bring the pan up to medium heat.,
Crack your egg into a separate bowl.Whenever using eggs, you should always crack them into a separate bowl before adding them to the dish or other ingredients.,
Pour the egg into the preheated, oiled or buttered pan.,
Season or garnish the egg while it’s still cooking.,
Lower the heat and cover the pan when the whites lose their translucence (for sunny-side up).This will likely take 2-3 minutes, though it may vary depending on your pan temperature.,
Flip the egg if you want it over easy, medium, or hard (optional).,
Remove from heat when ready to serve.",How to Make a Fried Egg1," Although older eggs that have been sitting in the fridge for a few weeks are better for boiling, you want your eggs to be as fresh as possible when frying.Purchase large or jumbo-sized eggs for a more satisfying portion size.;
, There’s no “proper” or “correct” pan for frying an egg, but you want to make sure you use a pan that heats through evenly, and which won’t cause the egg to stick to it. A non-stick pan or a well-seasoned cast-iron pan are your best bets.If the only pan you have tends to make food stick to it, use a little extra butter or nonstick cooking spray when frying the egg.

, Wait at least a minute before adding anything to the pan to make sure that it’s at the appropriate heat.Once the pan is hot, add half a teaspoon of butter or oil.
Once the butter has melted or the oil has begun to shimmer, tilt the pan to spread the fat all over its surface, coating the pan evenly.
Make sure the fat doesn’t begin to smoke, as this suggests your pan is too hot. Cooking an egg over too hot a temperature will result in uneven textures, where the bottom cooks quickly and the top is still runny.

, This way, if the egg turns out to have gone bad, or if you get shell in the whites, you can either discard the egg or fish the shell pieces out without having to start over.









Tap the broad center of the egg gently against the counter to create a small dent in the shell.
Holding the egg firmly in both hands, poke your thumbs into the dent to create a hole, then crack the shell open, allowing the egg to fall into the bowl.
If you do get any shell in the bowl, you can use a larger piece of shell to coax it out of the egg. They attract like magnets!

, If you didn’t have fresh eggs, and used old ones instead, the whites will likely spread out more than you’d like. Use your spatula to pull the edges of the egg whites closer to the yolk, creating a pleasant, rounded shape around it.








, It’s normal for the whites to seem like they’re simmering over medium heat, but eventually, they will transition from their original clear runny texture to a whiter, firmer texture. When it does, season your fried egg with salt and pepper.









Add whatever garnishes you’d like at this point as well. You might top it with chopped chives, bacon bits, or a sprinkling of cheese.

, After you’ve seasoned and/or garnished your egg, turn the heat down to low and cover the pan with an appropriately sized lid. This helps distribute the heat evenly across the top of the egg, not just the bottom. This should take one to two additional minutes., If you don’t want your egg sunny-side up, don’t cover the pan to steam-cook the top of the egg. Instead, you’ll want to flip the egg and expose the uncooked side to the heat of the pan. This can be a very tricky process, and if you’re sloppy, you could break the yolk and have to start over.









Insert the spatula under the egg and slide it over to the edge of the pan.
Tilt the pan as though you were trying to slide the egg off the edge.
Keeping the spatula under the egg, slide the egg up and over the side of the pan, then allow the egg to tilt back over the pan and land yolk-side down.
Cook for an additional minute after flipping for an over easy egg.
Cook for an additional minute and half after flipping for an over medium egg.
Cook for an additional two minutes after flipping for an over hard egg. The yolk should be firm when poked.

, Personal preference on the texture of eggs varies wildly, so it’s up to you when you think your egg is ready to eat. As a general rule, you want the whites to be completely cooked through, without a runny texture. You can poke the whites with your spatula to see how liquid it still is. Once cooked to your satisfaction, remove from the pan and serve.


To protect against salmonella, cook the egg until the yolks are fairly firm. A little bit runny is fine, but don’t eat undercooked eggs."

Store eggs in the refrigerator for up to five days.",How to Cook Hard Boiled Eggs Without Cracking," If you keep your eggs in the refrigerator, it's important that you don't try to cook them cold. Eggs crack because gases heat and expand within the shell. When the pressure becomes too great, the gases escape by cracking weak points in the porous shell. Bringing eggs to room temperature before cooking slows down that process.


If you don't want to wait for the eggs to warm up naturally, try soaking them in hot tap water for a few minutes before cooking.;
, When an egg is fresh, the the outer membrane sticks to the egg shell while the inner membrane sticks to the albumen (the ""white""). As an egg ages, these membranes adhere more closely to the shell itself., Before you submerge an egg, prick the large end of the shell with a clean thumbtack or safety pin. This will allow the trapped air bubbles—which are normally responsible for cracking—to escape during the boiling process., Stack the eggs very gently to avoid cracking. Don't overcrowd the pot—you should only boil one layer of eggs at a time, and they should not be pressing against each other. If you try to boil too many eggs at once, some of them may crack from the weight.Test whether your eggs are fresh by placing them into a bowl of saltwater. If the egg sinks to the bottom, it's fresh. If it floats to the top, there's a good chance that it has gone bad.
Lay a folded cheesecloth inside the bottom of the pot. This helps cushion the eggs so that they are less likely to crack.

, Fill the pot gently with at least one inch (3 cm) of water. Pour the water against the side of the pan so that it does not disturb the eggs. If you cannot avoid pouring the water onto the eggs, steady them with your hand so that they do not slide around and crack.


Add half a teaspoon of salt to the water. This makes the eggs easier to peel, and it may help prevent them from cracking. Salted water helps to make the egg white firm up more quickly. It also helps plug small leaks if the shell cracks during the cooking process.
Never drop eggs directly into a pot of hot water, or the shells will crack and the egg will run (giving you poached eggs). By exposing cold eggs to warm or hot water, you are ""shocking"" them with a sudden temperature shift, which causes cracks to form.Furthermore, cold water helps to keep the eggs from overcooking.

, Use one teaspoon of vinegar for each egg, and pour it directly into the water before you turn the heat on. Adding vinegar to the water helps the proteins in the egg white coagulate faster to plug any cracks that develop in the shell.This is a common problem, especially with eggs that are very cold.


You can also wait to add vinegar when an egg cracks in the water. You may notice a bit of white fluid seeping from a cracked egg. Try to be quick here — if you add the vinegar to the water as soon as you notice a crack, the egg should still boil evenly.
If you don't add the vinegar in time, don't worry. The cracked egg should still boil fine, although it may not look perfect.Be sparing. If you use too much, your eggs will taste and smell like vinegar.

, Let the water boil slowly so that the eggs do not crack from a rapid temperature shift. Cover the pot with a lid. The water will boil a bit more quickly with the lid on, but feel free to leave it off if you want to keep an eye on the eggs.Make sure that the eggs don't settle at the bottom, where they'll cook less evenly and break more easily. Stir the water any time that you see the eggs begin to settle. Use a wooden spoon to stir, and be very gentle so that you don't crack the eggs.

, As soon as the water reaches a full boil, turn the heat off and let the eggs sit in the hot water. Leave the lid on the pan. The heat of the water and the remaining warmth from the burner will be enough to finish cooking your eggs. Leave the eggs in the pot for another 3-15 minutes, depending how hard or soft you like them:


If you like your eggs soft-boiled, remove them from the water within three minutes. The whites should be set, while the yolks should be runny and warm. Be very gentle when you remove the eggs—scoop each egg out with a large spoon to avoid cracking.If you like your eggs medium-boiled, take them out of the water in 5-7 minutes. The yolks should be semi-soft in the center, and the whites should be very firm. You should still handle the eggs gently, but you don't need to worry as much about them cracking.
If you like your eggs hard-boiled, leave them in the hot water for 9-12 minutes. The yolks should be firm all the way through, and you don't need to worry about the eggs cracking. If you want a solid but soft and bright yellow yolk, leave the eggs in water for 9-10 minutes. If you'd like eggs with a harder, pale yellow center, leave them in for 11-12 minutes.

, After 12 minutes, your yolk will develop grayish or greenish streaks. The egg is still edible, and the streaks don't have much effect on taste. However, some people find green- and gray-streaked eggs less appetizing.Consider buying a color-changing egg timer, a heat-sensitive indicator that you can place in the water with your boiling eggs. You can find these timers online or at kitschy kitchen-supply stores., If the egg cracks in the water while cooking, it should still be safe to eat — and, indeed, it may still cook normally if the crack is not too severe. If an egg is cracked before you start cooking, do not bother to boil it. Bacteria may well have penetrated the shell and infected the interior, making it potentially hazardous to your health., While the eggs are cooking in the hot water, fill a large bowl with cold water. Dissolve another 1/4-1/2 teaspoon of salt in the water, then add ice to lower the temperature further. When the eggs are done cooking, you will carefully move them into this bowl to stop them from cooking any more.

, After your eggs have cooked for the desired amount of time, gently drain the hot water from the pan, then move the eggs to the bowl of ice-water to stop the cooking process. Remove the eggs one by one with a slotted spoon to avoid cracking. Carefully drop the eggs into the bowl of ice water to bring their temperature down. Let them cool for 2-5 minutes.

, Once the eggs are cool enough to hold in your hand, put them in the refrigerator for 20-30 minutes to loosen the shells. If you're not particular about how pretty your peeled eggs are—or if you like your eggs warm—you can skip the refrigerator and start peeling them immediately after chilling them.

, Spin an egg on a table to test whether it is hard-boiled without breaking it open. If the egg twirls quickly and easily, it is hard-boiled. If it wobbles, let it cook for longer.

, Press each egg into a clean, flat surface and roll it in your hand to crack the shell. Start peeling from the fatter end of the egg, where there should be a small empty space under the shell. This makes it slightly easier to peel.


Rinse the eggs under cold water as you peel them. This helps keep bits of shell and membrane from sticking to the egg.
It is usually easier to peel eggs once they are cracked. Put the eggs back in the pot with the lid on. Shake the pot back and forth to crack the shells before you begin peeling. You may need to do this several times to crack them all.

, Pinch off a small section of shell and membrane from the large end. Slip the spoon inside the shell and membrane so that it cups the egg. Then, simply slide the spoon around to peel off sections of shell.

, The eggs are ready to eat as soon as you peel them. Store the leftover eggs in a sealed container, and cover them with a wet paper towel. Change the paper towel each day to keep the eggs from drying out. Eat the eggs within four to five days, before they go bad.


You can also store the eggs in cold water. Change the water each day to keep the eggs from breaking down.
You can store hard-boiled eggs for several days before you crack and peel them. Keep in mind, however, that they tend to grow somewhat dry and rubbery. It's usually better to keep peeled eggs moist in the fridge than to leave the eggs unpeeled.

Place your eggs in a single layer in the bottom of the bowl. Do not stack the eggs on top of each other and be careful not to crack the eggs., Pour enough water over your eggs so that they are completely covered with water. There should also be about a centimeter (or half an inch) of water above the eggs. If the eggs are not completely covered with water, then they may explode.








To speed up the cooking process, you can pour boiling water over the eggs instead of room temperature water. You will still need to cover the eggs completely with water., Measure out a tablespoon of salt and then sprinkle it into the water. The salt will help to prevent the eggs from exploding while they are in the microwave.








, Set your microwave on medium power and begin microwaving the eggs. The eggs may take anywhere from six to 12 minutes to become hard boiled, depending on your microwave. The eggs may be ready sooner if your microwave is high-powered or if you prefer your eggs softer.








If you poured boiling water over your eggs, then you can just cook them for three to six minutes on high.You can check to see if your eggs are done by taking an egg out of the water, putting it in ice cold water for a few minutes, and then cracking it. However, if you do not want to check, then just cook your eggs for a little longer than you think they will need.

, When the eggs are done, the bowl and water will be very hot, so wear an oven mitt when you take the eggs out of the microwave. Do not reach into the bowl or touch any of the eggs until they have cooled down.








You can also drain the hot water and refill the bowl with cold water to speed up the cooling process. This will also prevent the eggs from becoming overcooked., After your eggs have cooled down completely, you can crack them open and enjoy them. Eat them or use them in a recipe. For example, you can use your hard-boiled eggs to make deviled eggs, egg salad, or Easter eggs.

Let the egg stand for two or three minutes.",How to Hardboil Eggs in a Microwave2," Breaking the egg apart also breaks the first step in hard-boiling, but if you're using a microwave, this is highly recommended. Cooking the egg yolk and white separately ensures that each part is cooked just as ""hard"" as you want it, and removes the risk of a scalding explosion.


This method of microwaving eggs is sometimes called ""hard-cooking,"" since it doesn't involve any water, but results in an egg with a hard-boiled texture.

, Rub the inside of two small, microwave-safe bowls with butter or butter substitute, using a paper towel. Custard ramekins work well if you are only cooking one egg, but you can use any size container.

, Crack the egg open carefully, then separate the two halves of shell, with the egg still inside one of them. Pour the egg yolk from one half of the shell to the other repeatedly, until all of the egg white has separated from the yolk. Put the yolk into one bowl, and the egg white into the other. If you are cooking more than one egg, repeat this step, keeping all yolks in one bowl and all whites in another.


If this is too tedious, you can just drop the entire egg into one bowl. This can lead to a runny white or an overcooked, rubbery yolk, since the two parts cook at different rates in the microwave., Even the thin membrane holding the yolk together will build up pressure as the moisture inside heats up, eventually exploding messily. Prevent this by piercing each yolk with the tip of a knife, skewer, or fork to let the steam escape., Contrary to rumor, plastic wrap can be safely used for this purpose, as long as it does not touch the food itself. Parchment paper or wax paper can be used instead.

, If your microwave oven has a medium or low power setting, use it whenever cooking eggs or egg dishes, since eggs are easily overcooked to a rubbery, superheated mess. Because it's difficult to control the temperature of microwaved food, it's best to cook in short bursts, checking frequently. Follow these guidelines for typical, large chicken eggs:


Most importantly, take the egg white out while it is still slightly underdone, before it is completely hard. The egg will continue to cook from its own heat after removal.
Cook 1 egg white (or 1 whole egg) for about 30 to 60 seconds.Cook 2 egg whites for about 45 to 75 seconds.Cook 4 egg whites for about 2 minutes 30 seconds to 3 minutes 15 seconds., Remove the bowl containing white and put in the yolk. Still on medium or low power if the option is available, cook the bowl of egg yolk for about 20 to 30 seconds per yolk.If cooking more than one yolk, stop every 30 seconds to check on progress. Remove the yolk once it's slightly softer than you prefer.

, Microwaves heat up the fat in the egg much hotter than a pot of boiling water does. This heat will continue to cook the egg after it is removed. If part of the egg isn't hard enough after three minutes, cook it for another 10 to 20 seconds.


There is no way to make an overcooked egg softer, so it's usually better to aim for a slightly soft ""hard-cooked"" egg.

, This will help to trap the heat in and cook all parts of the egg.


There are 3 parts of the egg that you need to cook in this process: the yolk, the inner white around the yolk and the outer white. The outer white cooks the fastest, but the inner white takes a while to set.

, It should take 1 to 1.5 minutes for the inner white of the egg to set. Leave the egg until the inner white turns milky and is no longer clear.


If you are cooking 2 eggs, it is likely to take at least 1.5 minutes for the inner white to set on the first side and 35 seconds for the eggs to cook on the other side when flipped.

Place 2 to 3 tbsp.,Place the yogurt into a fridge until you are ready to make mozzarella cheese.,
Repeat this process to continue making kefir yogurt.,
Pour 1 gallon of milk into the cooking pot.,
Warm the milk to 88 to 90 degrees F. To accomplish this, place the burner on low and warm very slowly while occasionally stirring the milk until reaching the desired temperature.,
Pour the diluted rennet in the milk.,
Test for a clean break by poking your finger through the coagulated milk.,
Chop up the coagulated milk with a whisk into small chunks and cover for 4 hours.,
Scoop the curds into a strainer and press the whey from them.,
Test the pH using the pH meter by testing the whey accumulated in the holes.,
Cover and the fermentation continues.,
Place the curd onto a cutting board.,
Place the 3 mixing bowls on a counter, side by side.,Heat a large pot of water to approximately 180 degrees F.,
Pour 1 to 2 cups of hot water into the bowl with the cheese curds.,
Let sit for two minutes and dump the water out.,
Take the stirring spoon and begin to push all the cheese curds together.,Take the 2-inch strip and fold small sections over itself 3 times.,
Force it through your index finger and thumb forming the mozzarella ball.,
Place the fresh mozzarella ball into the bowl with cool water.,
Place the mozzarella balls into the ice-cold water.",How to Make Mozzarella Cheese with Cultures," of kefir grains into a jar. Add ½ to ¾ cup of raw or non-homogenized milk and let sit in a dark environment for 24 hours.
,,

If it’s thick and creamy, drain the yogurt from the Kefir grains using a strainer.

, Stir in ¼ to ½ cup of kefir yogurt., Always test the temperature while stirring to obtain the exact temperature. While waiting for the milk to warm, dilute ¼ tsp. of liquid animal rennet into ¼ cup of purified water., Stir for 30 to 60 seconds and cover for 1 hour., If you have a clean break, it should like Jell-O and will leave a hole. If it is still liquid like, cover for another 30 minutes and try this step again., Resist the urge to keep checking on the milk; it needs to retain the heat for the fermentation process to begin.

After 4 hours, the curds should have sunken to the bottom of the whey and will have connected back together.

, Try your best to make one solid level piece similar to a pie. Poke several holes on the top of the curd. You will then see whey accumulate in the holes that you created., This should be done right away to get a base line of the pH. Normally, it will be around 6.2 at this point, but it will vary., As a rule of thumb, the desired pH is 5.2. However, this is subjective. For a tougher and denser mozzarella, a desired pH would be 5.3 to 5.4. For a softer mozzarella, a desired pH would be 5.0 to 5.1.

The fermentation process can range from 2 to 18 hours depending on the amount of cultures present in the kefir and the climate that you live in. Test periodically after the initial test and then every hour once the pH has reached 5.5 to 5.6 range.

, It should be one solid dense piece at this point. Cut the curd into half inch squares., Place the chopped-up curds into the first bowl, fill the second bowl with cool water and the third with ice and water.,, Do not pour directly onto the curds, but rather around the rim of the mixing bowl., Sprinkle 1 tbsp. of salt onto the cheese curds and then dump 2 to 3 more cups of hot water into the bowl and let sit for 1 more minute., If they are ready for stretch, they should stick together and not fall apart. Scoop the curds up and let gravity do its work. The cheese should stick to the spoon and begin to stretch on its own.

You can assist the stretching by grabbing the bottom of the cheese and pulling it down. If it is too hard to stretch, simply place all the cheese back in the hot water and let it sit a little longer. Stretch into a long 2-inch-wide strip and fold over 3 to 4 times.
Do not over work the stretching because doing so will make for a tough and dry mozzarella cheese. Once you have repeated this process 3 – 4 times and the mozzarella is smooth, it’s time to form the fresh mozzarella balls.

,, Squeeze the bottom of the ball and break it off., Repeat this step until you have made all of the mozzarella balls and let them sit in the cool water for 10 minutes or until they have all cooled down., This preserves the shape of the fresh mozzarella.

There you have it: you have made fresh mozzarella using cultures. It is ready to eat at this point and is always best right after the stretch.

Allow the pan to warm up until the butter/oil is hot, but not browning.,
Break the first egg into a small dish or bowl and pour it in, or crack the egg right in the pan.,
Cook the eggs, undisturbed, until the clear edges turn white.,
Cover the pan and lower the heat once the edges have turned white.,
Observe the hardness of the yolk by lifting the pan lid and gently poking it with your finger.,
Lift the egg out of the pan with a quick, firm slide of the spatula.",How to Fry an Egg1," Use a pan with enough space to allow for some running between eggs. An 8-inch pan is perfect for one egg, while you'll need a 12"" or bigger for 2-3 eggs at once., 1/2 a tablespoon or so should be enough per egg. As it heats up, swirl it to coat the entire bottom of the pan in your oil. Monitor the burner temperature to avoid browning the oil or butter.


Using too big of a pan can result in sticking, since your oil is spread too thinly to cook just one egg on its own. Add a little more oil if this is the case.
For incredibly rich eggs, use a small pat of bacon grease.
Cooking sprays are a quick and easy ways to ensure your entire pan is coated., A lower temperature is better; too high and you'll burn the oil and eggs quickly. You want the oil to just start shimmering or the butter to just start bubbling. When you add the egg the whites should sizzle just a little bit.

, You want to be gentle cracking so you don't break the yolk. Cracking the egg into a bowl first can help you get out any shells before cooking. As you drop the egg in, you should hear a slight sizzle, but there shouldn't be popping or violent splattering.

, Once you can't see the bottom of the pan, since the whites have cooked closest to the surface, you're ready to go on to the next step. Do not try and move the eggs now, as they are gelatinous and will likely fall right back into place.


This usually takes 1-3 minutes., Put a lid on the pan. This will trap some steam in the pan, cooking the tops of the eggs and helping the whites set. This is the best way to keep the yolk runny, as too much direct heat can cook the yolk from underneath before the white has totally cooked.

, When there are no more jelly-like, clear bits of uncooked egg on the whites, your egg is ready. You can keep cooking for harder eggs, or flip it off and serve immediately.


For your average, runny egg this process takes roughly 5 minutes from the second the egg hits the pan until it's done., You want to move quickly lifting and removing the egg to avoid breaking it. Serve it and enjoy.

, Crack the eggs into a separate bowl and add the milk, salt, and pepper. Beat well by hand with a wire whisk until all of the ingredients have been combine and the mixture appears mildly frothy.


The eggs are the only essential ingredient, so you can choose to opt out of the milk, salt, and pepper if desired. Milk creates a richer taste, however.






If you beat the eggs lightly, the final result will be fairly dense. If you beat the eggs significantly, though, you will beat more air into the mixture and your scrambled eggs will have a lighter texture as a result., Add the beaten eggs to the hot skillet and allow them to cook until they begin to set around the edges.


Cook the eggs on medium heat to avoid overcooking or burning them.






Note that the eggs should still look liquidy along the top surface when you prepare to turn them for the first time.







, Once the eggs begin to set around the edges, use a heat-resistant spatula to carefully pull the eggs toward you, flipping them over so that the bottom portion comes to the top while the liquid underside gets swapped to the bottom.


Pull the eggs toward you by scraping the spatula beneath them from the side opposite you and dragging the spatula toward you so that the eggs are flipped over.






Periodically flip the eggs as they cook, resting 20 seconds or so in between each flip. Do not move the eggs around too frequently. Otherwise, they may end up breaking into pieces that are too small and difficult to eat.






Keep turning the eggs in the pan until all traces of liquid have been removed.

You could also use an omelet pan, if you have one. The pan you do use should be the same diameter as the diameter you want for your finished omelet.;
, Combine the egg whites, salt, and pepper. Whisk the ingredients together until the egg whites become frothy.


You can adjust the amount of salt and pepper according to personal preference. Start with only a dash of each if you don't know how much you'd prefer.

, Pour the whisked egg whites into the preheated pan. Quickly turn the pan so that the egg whites spread over the entire bottom.

, Cook the egg whites without disturbing them for 1-1/2 to 2 minute, or until they seem evenly set all across the bottom.Note that the top of the egg whites should still appear glossy and slightly runny during this stage.

, Slide a rubber spatula beneath the set egg white. Carefully tilt the pan, allowing the raw egg to run off the top of the whites and beneath the set omelet.


If tilting the pan is too difficult, try tilting the egg whites to help drain off the remaining raw egg.
Allow the remaining raw egg white to cook for at least another 15 to 30 seconds.

, Sprinkle the chopped tomatoes and feta cheese crumbles over half of the omelet. Use the spatula to fold the other half over these toppings.

Place eggs in a pot of water.,
Bring the water to a boil.,
Turn off the heat and cover the pan.,
Place the eggs in cold water.,
Peel and enjoy.",How to Cook Eggs2," Put your eggs in a medium to large saucepan and fill the pan with enough water to cover the eggs completely.


Note that the eggs should be at room temperature before you begin to boil them for best results, as this generally prevents eggs from cracking as they boil. You can use cold eggs, but cold eggs are more likely to crack.
Also note that older eggs are better to boil than fresh eggs. The shell will be easier to remove from the fully cooked egg if you start with an egg that is at least a few days old. The closer the eggs are to their expiration date, the easier it will be to peel them once done.

, Heat the water over medium-high heat until it reaches a rolling boil.


Do not salt the water since doing so will increase the length of time needed to boil the water.

, As soon as the water begins to boil, turn the heat off, cover the saucepan, and let the eggs cook in the still-hot water for several minutes until they reach desired doneness. The precise time will vary based on how large your eggs are and whether you want them to be soft-boiled, medium-boiled, or hard-boiled.Soft-boiled eggs have a firm white but a runny yolk. Achieve this by cooking medium eggs 4 minutes, large eggs 4 to 5 minutes, and extra large eggs 5 minutes.
Medium-boiled eggs have a firm white and a semi-firm yolk with some hint of liquid running throughout. Achieve this by cooking medium eggs 5 minutes, large eggs 6 minutes, and extra large eggs 7 to 8 minutes.
Hard-boiled eggs have a firm white and firm yolk. Achieve this by cooking medium eggs 12 minutes, large eggs 17 minutes, and extra large eggs 19 minutes.

, As soon as the eggs have finished cooking, remove them from the water with a slotted spoon and dunk them into a bowl of cold ice water.


Let the eggs sit for at least 10 minutes in the ice water.






This is not a crucial step, but dunking the eggs in cold water will stop the cooking process and ultimately make it easier for you to peel the eggs.







, If eating medium-boiled or hard-boiled eggs, gently crack the shell against a hard surface and use your fingers to peel the shell from the egg white. If eating soft-boiled eggs, slice a portion of the side away and eat the egg out of the shell with a spoon.

",How to Boil an Egg So That It Peels Easily1," Try to use eggs that are at least 7 to 10 days old. Many people find that the fresher an egg is, the more difficult it is to peel.







;
, Whatever you use, make sure that the eggs are under 2 inches (5.08 centimeters) of water. If you don't use enough water, the eggs may not cook evenly.







, This will help the eggs cook slowly at first. They will continue to cook, even after you turn the heat off later on.









, Keep the saucepan on the burner during this time. The heat from the burner will continue ""cooking"" the eggs. If your burner doesn't stay hot after you turn it off (such as gas), reduce the heat to low, simmer for 1 minute, then turn it off.








If the eggs are small or medium-sized, cook them for 11 minutes.
If the eggs are large or extra large, cook them for 13 minutes., Fill a large bowl with cold water and lots of ice. When you put the eggs into this, the coldness will ""shock"" the eggs, and make the shell easier to peel off.









, Use a slotted spoon or a pair of tongs to lift the eggs out of the water and place them into the bowl. During this time, the eggs will cool down; cold eggs are easier to peel than hot eggs.









, Keep the bowl of water handy. You can dip the eggs into the water once you peel them to get rid of any broken shell bits.









, Try to crack both ends of the shell first, as this is where the air pockets tend to be. To make the shell even easier to peel, roll the egg across the counter with your palm. This will help loosen the membrane from the whites., From time to time, dip the egg into the cold water. This will help loosen the shell from the whites even more. It will also help rinse away any broken shell fragments that might be stuck the to whites.









, At this point, you can use the eggs in your recipe, or you can store them in a sealed container in your fridge. If you do store them, be sure to eat them within 3 to 5 days.

, Tap the egg on your counter or the side of your pan to gently crack the shell. Break the egg open, dropping it directly into the pan.


Cook one egg at a time to prevent the whites from running together.






Drop the eggs carefully so that the yolks do not break.







, After 2 or 3 minutes, the egg whites should be completely set on the bottom and mostly set on the top.


Note that the yolk will still be runny.


, Gently slide a spatula under your egg and flip the egg over so that the yolk is now on the bottom. Let cook for another 1 or 2 minutes, or until the yolk is set.


This must be done very carefully so that the yolk does not break as you flip it. Even if the yolk does break, however, the egg will still be edible, even though it may not look visually impressive.

, Gently slide the egg out of the frying pan and onto your serving plate using a spatula.

Understand how conventional eggs are produced.,
Know what organic means.,
Consider purchasing free-range eggs.,
Choose omega-3 enriched eggs for heart health.,
Be aware of hormone and antibiotic use.,
Be wary of unregulated labels.",How to Choose Eggs1," Conventional eggs often come from hens that have been kept in small cages in crowded facilities. Also, conventional eggs often come from hens that have eaten a diet of corn, soy and cottonseed meal, which is then filled with commercial additives. Conventional eggs are safe to eat and still make a good choice of protein. However, many researchers believe that eggs from chickens raised in these conditions are nutritionally inferior.;
, Eggs labeled “organic” by the USDA come from chickens that are kept cage-free with outdoor access. These chickens have not had antibiotics and eat a diet free of animal by-products. In addition, the hens’ diets cannot contain crops grown with chemical pesticides, fertilizers, irradiation, genetic engineering or sewage sludge.

, Hens that are “free-range” are not only cage-free but are also given access to the outdoors. However, free-range does not necessarily mean that the hens were pastured; it simply means that the hens had the option to go outside. To ensure that you eat truly free-range eggs, purchase eggs from pastured hens. Pastured hens often eat diets that include greens, seeds, worms and bugs, which are more akin to a natural chicken’s diet. Studies have shown that eggs from pastured hens may have more omega-3 fatty acids, more vitamins and less fat and cholesterol.

, Omega-3 enriched eggs come from hens that were fed a diet rich in omega-3 sources, like flaxseed or algae. Consequently, their eggs are richer in omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3’s are thought to promote a healthier nervous system as well as a healthier cardiovascular system.

, The USDA forbids the use of hormones for egg production. Also, the use of therapeutic antibiotics is forbidden unless hens are ill. However, the only way to ensure that the hens that laid the eggs were antibiotic-free is to purchase organic eggs.

, Terms like “natural” and “cage-free” are often used in labeling, but these claims may not necessarily be true. Claims on eggs with the USDA shield have been verified by the Department of Agriculture, so always look for the shield when you purchase eggs from a store.

Fill a medium-sized saucepan halfway with water and bring it to a boil over high heat.,
Gently place the eggs into the water.,
Reduce the heat to a simmer and cook for 11 to 13 minutes.,
Prepare an ice bath while the eggs are cooking.,
Place the cooked eggs into the ice bath, and wait 5 to 15 minutes.,
Take the eggs out of the ice bath and set them down someplace where they won't roll away.,
Crack the egg, then roll it across a hard surface.,
Peel the shell away from the egg.,
Dry the eggs off with a paper towel.,
Finished.









",How to Boil an Egg So That It Peels Easily2," Don't add the eggs to the water yet; it needs to be boiling first.

, Avoid dropping them into the water, or you will risk cracking them. Instead, consider using a slotted spoon, a pair of tongs, or even a wire basket.

, If the eggs are smaller, cook them for 11 minutes. If the eggs are larger, cook them for 13 minutes.









, Fill a bowl with cold water, and lots of ice. When you put the cooked eggs into the icy water, the coldness will ""shock"" the eggs, and make the shell easier to peel away.

, Once the time is up, use a pair of tongs or a slotted spoon to transfer the eggs from the saucepan and into the ice bath. During this time, the eggs will cool down; it is easier to peel cold eggs than hot eggs.









, Keep the ice bath nearby. You can dip the eggs into the water after you peel them to get rid of any broken shell bits.









, Tap both ends of the egg against a hard surface, then roll the egg across the surface with your palm. This will help loosen the membrane from the whites, and make the egg easier to peel.









, You may want to dip the egg into the cold water from time to time. This will loosen the shell from the whites even more, and help rinse away any broken shell pieces. 







, At this point, you can add the eggs to your recipe, or store them in a sealed container in the refrigerator. If you do store them, be sure to eat them within 3 to 5 days.

Get everything ready before you start cooking poached eggs.",How to Poach an Egg1," Timing is everything when it comes to good poached eggs.









All the different parts of the meal, such as toast, meats and hash browns, should be finished at the same time.
If cooking for a few people, it may be necessary to keep the other parts of the meal warm in the oven, a sunny window or a container on top of a pan of hot water. This is fine, but always do the eggs last. You will be amazed at how quickly three minutes goes by. While you are messing around pouring your juice, the perfectly poached egg becomes a hard-boiled egg in the blink of an eye.

"
"
Always purchase eggs from refrigerated cases.,
Choose eggs with clean, uncracked shells.,
Avoid buying out-of-date eggs.,
Look for the USDA-grade shield or mark.,
Choose the appropriate grade.,
Select the most useful and economical size.",How to Choose Eggs2," Generally, eggs are transported to stores in vehicles in which the ambient temperature doesn’t exceed 45°F (7°C). Keeping eggs refrigerated helps to prevent foodborne illness like salmonella.

, Take the time to open an egg carton and inspect the eggs for cracks or breakage. Salmonella tends to live on the exterior of the eggshell and can travel into the interior via cracks.

, Over time, the yolk begins to absorb water from the egg white. The egg white becomes thinner, losing some of its thickening and leavening abilities, and the yolk becomes flatter, larger and more easily broken. Eggs may be kept in your refrigerator for 3 to 5 weeks after you bring them home from the store, even if the sell-by date passes during that time.

, A shield bearing the USDA grade of the egg means that the egg has been examined and certified to meet strict quality standards. These eggs have not been previously packed and shipped, and they have not been doused in non-USDA-approved cleansers. USDA-grade eggs are coded to identify both the location where the eggs were packed and the day of the year when the eggs were packed.

, Grade AA eggs have thick, firm whites and high, round yolks. This grade of egg is virtually free of defects and is best for frying, poaching or other cooking applications where the appearance of the egg matters. However, most stores sell Grade A eggs. These eggs are the same quality as Grade AA except that the white is categorized as “reasonably” firm. Grade-B eggs are seldom found in retail stores because they are used to make liquid, frozen and dried egg products.

, The sizing of eggs is determined by their weight, not by their dimensions. Many recipes are very specific about the size of egg that should be used, particularly in baking. Large eggs are best for most applications.

"
"
Choose certified organic eggs.,
Select medium or small eggs.,
Nesting hens should be kept in a fenced area.,
Eggs should be collected before 10:00 a.m. and preferably twice per day.,
Eggs should be stored large end up at a temperature between 50 and 55°F (10 and 13°C).,
Bring your own carton in which to carry eggs home.,
Finished.

",How to Choose Eggs3," Farms selling eggs that have earned the certified organic label are visited annually by an Organic Program Food Inspector, which ensures their quality. Also, certified organic eggs must come from chickens that have been fed organic feed, kept in humane living conditions and kept free from antibiotics or hormones. Many farmers may call their eggs “organic,” but certification is the only way to know for sure.

, These eggs tend to have thicker shells than large eggs and are less likely to become contaminated by bacteria.

, If hens are allowed to nest anywhere they choose, then farmers will have no idea how old the eggs are or with what they have been in contact. Also, nest litter should be kept clean and dry and changed frequently.

, The longer an egg remains in the nest, the more likely the egg will become dirty, broken or lose interior quality.

, The relative humidity in the room should be about 75 percent.

, Recycling a previously used egg carton is not recommended, and it is illegal in many places for farmers to sell eggs in a carton bearing the name of another farm.

Select a suitable pan for poaching.,
Add the water.,
If you'd like to help the eggs to set, add 5-10ml (1-2 teaspoons) of white vinegar to the water.,
Select the eggs.,
Poach at an easy pace.,
Crack an egg into a ramekin, small bowl or soup ladle.,
Turn down the gently boiling water to a simmer.,
Spin the simmering water to cool down the water before you drop in the single egg.








,
Carefully lower or drop the egg into the center of the barely simmering whirlpool.,
Wait 3-5 minutes until cooked.,
If poaching multiple eggs at once, do not spin the boiling water.,
Remove the poached egg with a slotted spoon.,
Serve.",How to Poach an Egg2," The pan must be shallow and wide, as the trick to poaching well, without an egg poacher is to gently slip the egg into a wide, shallow pan filled with simmering water. The pan should be able to take about 1.5 liters (2 3/4 pints) of water, or 10cm (4"") depth of water.






;
, Fill the pan about two-thirds or a bit more with water and bring to a gentle boil.









Milk can be used in place of water if you're seeking a richer taste.

, It's not essential but it improves the egg's appearance because the vinegar coagulates the egg white.









Other vinegars (balsamic, red wine vinegar, apple cider vinegar) are fine, and sometimes taste great when poaching eggs, but will possibly affect the final coloration.
Larousse Gastronomique recommends 1 tablespoon of vinegar to be added per 1 liter (1 3/4 pints, 4 1/3 cups) of water. On the other hand, chef Michael Romano recommends adding one teaspoon of vinegar per liter (1 3/4 pints).Lemon juice can also help set the egg but its flavor will also come through. Some people advise to add salt but it can hinder coagulation so it's best not used.
If vinegar is used, the eggs will have a vinegary taste. Chef Michael Romano advises that in commercial restaurants, poached eggs are usually plunged into another pan of hot water which is salted but vinegar free and that this both seasons them and removes the vinegary taste., The fresher an egg is, the better it will poach because its white is thicker. Use eggs that are as fresh as possible; an egg straight from the chicken will poach without any need for vinegar as it will coagulate immediately.








, For the best results, only poach one egg at a time. More than one egg risks merging into other eggs when cooking. If you need to poach more than one at once, stop at four because any more will throw out the timing and merging mess is inevitable. The instructions following deal with both a single egg and up to four eggs at a time.








, Do this gently so as not to harm the appearance of the egg. Alternatively, crack the egg onto a small, flat plate as this makes sliding the egg into the pan of water easier. Don't break the yolk when cracking the egg.









Given the possibility of breaking the egg when moving it from a bowl or plate to the pan, some people prefer to skip this step and break the egg straight into the water. If you do this, be careful and only add one at a time. And note that by cracking the eggs separately into a cup and not straight into the water, the cracked eggs have the chance to set back up into their little ""protein cocoon"". You might like to experiment to work out what works best for you.

, The water should be barely simmering and the temperature about 160-180ºF (71-82ºC).









Make sure that you do not drop the egg into boiling water (100ºC/212ºF), as this will toughen the eggs and make them unpalatable.

,, To help maintain the shape of the egg, swirl around it in a circular motion.









Chef Michael Romano recommends using a basting method to envelop the yolk with the white, shaping it like this for about 20 seconds or until the white sets., You will know that the egg is cooked when the whites are set and the yolks begin to thicken.








, Place the first bowl with its side just breaking the surface of the water. With a gentle quick motion, dump the egg into the water.









Quickly repeat this step with the other eggs, adding them at 10-15 second intervals. Leave plenty of space for the eggs in the saucepan. Depending on the size of the pan, two or three eggs at a time is about right.
Remove each egg in succession after they have cooked for three minutes each.

, Work quickly to transfer each egg onto the plate, letting excess water drip back into the pan. Larousse Gastronomique advises to refresh the egg in cold water and then drain on a cloth. Chef Michael Romano recommends dipping the eggs into simmering, salted water for 30 seconds and placing them on a dry tea towel to dry.









If the edge isn't neat enough, trim with kitchen shears––the cook's secret.

, Poached eggs should be served as soon as they're removed from the water and drained. They cool down quickly and once cold, they're not as desirable for the diner.

Read your recipe all the way through.,
Crack your first egg.,
Separate the egg whites.,
Prepare to whisk.,
Whisk the eggs.,
Keep beating.",How to Beat Egg Whites," It may require extra steps such as the addition of sugar into your beaten eggs. Be sure you have all the required ingredients at hand and are familiar with the instructions in your recipe before you begin.;
, You may do this by sharply tapping the egg on a flat surface or against the lip of a container, and then gently pulling the two halves apart.

, There are several ways to do this, but the easiest is to very carefully pass the bright yellow yolk of the egg from one half of the shell to the other over a bowl, allowing the clearer white of the egg to dribble out. Do this several times until most of the egg white has dripped into the bowl. Place the yolk in your second bowl. Be careful not to allow any pieces of eggshell into either bowl. Carefully pick them out if necessary.

, Take the whisk firmly but gently in your dominant hand. An overhand grip works best. With your other hand, grip the bowl firmly so as not to make a mess.

, Lower your whisk into the egg whites and begin to move it in tight circles by moving your wrist sharply up and down in a circular motion. Start slowly and then speed up. You don't want to go too fast, and consistency is key., The recipe you are working from will probably describe to you the ideal consistency of the egg whites. Take your whisk out of the bowl and point the whisking end up to form peaks, allowing you to judge the stiffness. Whisking can be tiring, and you may be tempted to switch hands. This is fine as long as both hands can keep up a consistently quick rhythm.


If the recipe asks for soft peaks, the peak at the end of your whisk will be formed, but will melt back into itself.
If it asks for firm peaks, the peak will hold a shape, but the tip will droop downward.
If it asks for stiff peaks, stop when the egg whites firm up and begin to form peaks that stand up sharply on their own."

Check the expiry date on the packaging.,
Check how the butter has been stored.,
Cut a small slice of butter from the block or stick.,
Smell the butter.",How to Test the Freshness of Butter," This should be the first indicator of the butter's freshness. Close to the use-by date or past it, and the butter is less likely to be fresh.;
, Butter should not be exposed to light during storage. This is why it is thoroughly wrapped and it is best if wrapped in foil. If it has been unwrapped, it risks turning rancid faster than even the suggested use by date.

, Look at the color. If the inside of the butter is the same as the outside, it is still fresh. However, if the inside of the butter is lighter than the outside of the butter, this means it has oxidized. As such, the butter is no longer fresh.

, Some people are better at using this method than others; if you use and consume butter a lot, it should be obvious when butter no longer smells fresh.


A small taste test can also tell you much; it will taste sour or bad if it is no longer fresh.

In spite of what was said about serving immediately, as noted by Julia Child and other chefs like Michael Romano, it is possible to make poached eggs in advance for the busy cook with a crowd to feed.








,
Make the poached eggs as outlined above.








,
Simply plunge the poached eggs into plain icy water to chill.,
Drop them into a pan of simmering, salted water for 20-30 seconds (and no more than one minute) and they're ready to serve immediately.",How to Poach an Egg5,",, Place in the refrigerator and leave until it's time to serve - they keep well for up to a day in the refrigerator.








, Do not cook them any further than this. Use the serving suggestions above.

If the yolk breaks in the water, do not panic.,
If the careful mixing doesn't work and the shape is not respectable, scoop out the egg (when cooked) with a slotted spoon.",How to Poach an Egg6," Simply use a slotted spoon and gently mix the water from the edges of the pan to obtain a round shape. Serve as informed above.

, Serve onto a piece of crisp garlic bread or French bread. Add seasoning and vegetables to the egg and any sauce of your choice (preferably Hollandaise, mayonnaise or Thousand Islands). This will cover up the broken yolk.


Leftovers such as pasta, kebabs, lobster, ox tongue, meringue, rolls and soup can be used as side dishes to divert the guest's attention.
Note: This save method is preferable for one egg. More eggs could be hidden between toast or inside another dish.

However, you will inevitably forget to do this from time to time. You can speed up the softening process by cutting the butter into chunks.;
, If your recipe calls for a specific amount of butter, it may be better to measure out the correct quantity for softening, so you can return the unneeded butter to the refrigerator. Use the markings on the butter packaging to measure the correct amount, or use a kitchen scales.

, Use a sharp knife to cut the measured butter into small, one inch chunks. The increased surface area of the butter will allow it to soften faster.

, Leave to sit at room temperature until the butter yields to light pressure.

Know that, while not necessary, decarboxylating is a simple process that makes the most of every bud.,
Pre-heat the oven to 240°F (115°C).,
Hand-crumble the weed into in a rimmed baking sheet, spreading so there are no holes or gaps.,
Bake the buds for 30 minutes or so, mixing it every 10 minutes to prevent burning.,
Grind the bud until it is a course mixture, with recognizable buds.,
Optionally, soak your cannabis in water for 20-60 minutes before cooking.",How to Prepare Marijuana Butter1," Also called ""pre-baking,"" this step leads to stronger bang for you bud. Marijuana is filled with many compounds, some of which are medicinal/psychoactive, and some of which are not. You can get rid of the not so useful ones if you decarboxylate the weed first, which simply means baking it at a low temperature. This vaporizes compounds like THCA, which doesn't get you high, leading to a stronger butter.


You can also use shake, leaves, or a mixture of buds and leaves if you'd like.;
, You want a nice, low temperature. While a higher temp will remove the compounds faster, it will also cause wanted compounds, like terpenes (which give each strain it's unique aroma and flavor) to leak out too. 240°F is a good, safe temperature.

, You want smaller pieces of bud, roughly 1/2"" or less in diameter, though exact measurements aren't needed. Use a baking sheet just big enough to contain all of the weed. Empty space will heat up the pan quickly, which causes uneven ""cooking.""

, When done, the weed will be a light brown color and will crumble easily in your hands.

, Don't grind it into a powder -- you just want it to be in small, manageable bits, like small pieces of gravel. You can use an herb grinder or simply pulse it quickly in a blender or food processor.

, This will remove some of the chlorophyll, dirt and fertilizers from the plant matter which can cause a ""grassy"" taste in your butter. THC and other cannabinoids are not water soluble, and will not be affected by the soak.


When done, strain out the water with a colander and pat dry with paper towels.

Preheat the oven to 325 degrees Fahrenheit (165 degrees Celsius).,
Break the eggs into the prepared ramekins.,
Shift the yolks, if desired.,
Spoon the milk over the eggs.,
Add your desired seasonings.,
Bake for 10 to 15 minutes.,
Serve hot.",How to Bake Eggs1," In the meantime, lightly coat four small ramekins or custard dishes with nonstick cooking spray or butter.You actually have a few different options for your cooking container, but the dishes you use must be oven-safe.

If you only plan to serve one egg per guest, use four 4 to 6 oz (125 to 185 ml) ramekins or custard cups.
To serve two eggs per guest, use two 10 oz (315 ml) ramekins. Flat oval ramekins make a nicer presentation, but tall round ramekins will also work.
If you don't have ramekins or custard cups, you could prepare baked eggs using a standard muffin/cupcake tin. You'll only use one egg per muffin cup. Grease as usual; do not use cupcake liners.

;
, Break one or two eggs into each greased ramekin, depending on the size and amount of ramekins you prepared. Work carefully to avoid breaking the yolks.


Use cold eggs since the yolks are less likely to break.Hold each egg within 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) of the top of the dish to minimize the impact it will make upon falling into the dish. This should also help minimize the risk of breaking the yolk.
Consider breaking the eggs into a clear, small dish before sliding them into the prepared ramekins. Doing so will make it easier to inspect the eggs for unwanted pieces of shells. Remove any shell fragments you find.

, Using a spoon, carefully move the yolks toward the centers of the prepared ramekins.Press to the side of the yolks; do not poke into the yolks directly.
This step is not necessary, but doing so can create a nice presentation.

, Spoon the milk evenly over the prepared eggs. You'll need about 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of milk per dish.If you don't have milk, you could also use half-and-half or light cream.
Spooning liquid over the eggs can help prevent them from drying out inside the oven. Only spoon the liquid on top; do not stir it into the eggs.

, At minimum, you should season the eggs with a light dash of salt and pepper. You can also sprinkle 1/2 tsp (2.5 ml) of fresh chopped herbs, like parsley, on top of each egg.


Other herbs work considering include tarragon, chives, rosemary, cilantro, and dill.
Note that you can also experiment with several other toppings, including shredded cheese, bread crumbs, cooked spinach, chopped tomato, bacon bits, cooked sausage crumbles, and chopped ham. Amounts can vary, but do not use so much that you completely cover the eggs.

, Place the eggs on the middle rack of your preheated oven. Bake them until the whites are set and the yolks are thickened.


The exact amount of cooking time will vary depending on the number of eggs per dish and the number of toppings added.
If the eggs do not appear to be cooking evenly, rotate the dishes after 5 or 6 minutes.
Traditionally, the yolks should thicken without becoming hard, but you can cook the eggs a bit longer if you prefer firmer yolks. Also note that the eggs will continue to cook for a few minutes after you remove them from the oven.

, Remove the eggs from the oven and allow them to set for about 2 to 3 minutes. Enjoy them as soon as they finish setting.

, Beat the butter using a hand-held mixer or the paddle attachment of a stand mixer. Use a low speed to begin with, then increase the speed as the butter begins to soften. Once the butter is soft enough, you can simply add in the additional ingredients necessary for your recipe.

Don't allow the butter to melt.",How to Soften Butter7," Measure the correct amount of butter for use in your recipe, using the markings on the packaging or a kitchen scales. Place the remaining butter back in the refrigerator.

, You can leave the butter in its wrapper if it's made from paper, but if it's in metal packaging, you should remove it.

, Alternatively you can use the ""Soft/Melt"" feature on your microwave, if it has one.

, If the butter yields to your touch, leaving the imprint of your finger, it is soft enough. If not, return to the microwave for another five second burst, and repeat until the butter is soft enough.

, Microwaving should really be your last resort when it comes to softening butter. This is because it is very easy for butter to melt in the microwave, and melted butter produces a very different effect from softened butter when used in a recipe. Melted butter will cause your cookies to spread and make your cakes too dense. Therefore, if you are using a microwave, keep a very close eye on your butter to make sure it doesn't melt."

Bring a 1/4 cup of water and 1 lb butter to a light simmer on medium heat.,
Whisk in the cannabis and lower the heat to low.,
Let the mixture simmer for anywhere from 2-5 hours, stirring every half hour and adding water as needed.,
Line a fine-mesh strainer with a cheesecloth and place over a glass bowl.,
Pour the liquid butter through the strainer into your glass bowl.,
Fold the cheesecloth over and squeeze to remove any last butter.,
Refrigerate the liquid butter, covered, for 3-5 hours, then scrape off the water on top.,
Use cannabutter anywhere you might use regular butter.",How to Prepare Marijuana Butter2," Use a small saucepan, and dump the butter and water in together. Turn on the heat, stirring until bubbles start to rise to the surface but the mixture isn't boiling.


This recipe uses a ratio of 1 oz. of marijuana to 1 lb. of butter. Adjust accordingly if you have less weed.
If you have a candy thermometer, this moment is at roughly 190°F, Take your pre-ground cannabis and mix it in thoroughly, lowering the heat a few notches to low. The key to great cannabutter is ""slow and steady,"" which will release the essential oils and compounds without denaturing them.







, Depending on your desired strength of the butter, you can leave it in for longer or shorter. If you leave it in for closer to 5 hours you'll get the strongest butter, but you'll have to be diligent about adding more warm water occasionally if it starts to evaporate out.









Three hours is the most common cooking time, but two hours will be enough for usable butter, too.
If you know you want to cook the butter for 4-5 hours, add the extra water in advance, roughly 1-2 cups total instead of a 1/4 cup of water.

, Use the bowl you plan to store the butter in when finished. The strainer and cheesecloth together will get rid of any useless chunks of plant matter left in the butter when it is done cooking.

, Pour slowly, and don't wait for the butter to cool off. Use the back of a wooden spoon or spatula to press excess butter out of the solids remaining.









Feeling extra fancy? You can also use a French press to simply strain and mash your buttery liquid.

, Make sure you get every last drop out of the cheesecloth to avoid wasting any weed. When done, you can throw the cheesecloth and remaining solids out.








, As the butter cools, the water will separate from the butter. Simply pour or scrape this off and then return the butter to the fridge.

, You can spread cannabutter on toast or use it to make your classic chocolate chip cookies. It will keep in the refrigerator just as long as normal butter, and can be substituted into just about any recipe.

Use a slow cooker for hands-free marijuana butter.,
Try using clarified butter (ghee) for a smoother-tasting cannabutter.,
Spray your toasted buds with a little high-proof alcohol, like Everclear, before adding to the butter.,
Blanch your marijuana beforehand for a relatively scentless, flavorless butter.",How to Prepare Marijuana Butter3," You can keep everything else the same, since the water is there to prevent burning, not actually diluting the butter. Keep the butter and water ratio the same and simply adjust the amount of bud you grind in. You can also adjust the cooking times, cooking less for less potent weed, but this is just a waste of weed -- fewer buds cooked for a longer time will get the same results.


1 ounce of buds will lead to some strong, strong butter, but you should probably use 1 1/2 ounces if you only have shake or leaves.If you use a lot more than 1 ounce, you will want to add more butter to absorb all of the THC. However, 1-ounce weed per pound of butter is usually more than enough marijuana.

, The following method is for smaller batches, and reliably turns out a half cup of marijuana butter quickly and easily. This method does not require a ""pre-bake."" To make it:


Finely grind up 1/4 ounce of cannabis buds (not shake or leaves)
Heat 1/2 cup of butter until melted in a saucepan on medium heat
Add the buds slowly, stirring frequently.
Simmer for 45 minutes, stirring often. There should only be small bubbles on the butter's surface.
Strain through a strainer and cheesecloth.
Chill and use., A simple Crockpot is the perfect way to get the ""long and slow"" cooking that you're after. To pull it off, all you need to do is:


Mix 1 cup water, 1 lb butter, and 1-ounce ground marijuana in the slow cooker.
Turn the cooker on low and stir.
Cover the cooker and let simmer for 8-24 hours, stirring occasionally., Clarified butter has been separated, isolating the essential milk fats. It will absorb the THC better and cook much more cleanly, with less smoke if you accidentally overheat things., This scientific little trick helps break down the cellulose in your buds, leading greater THC release and a less green final color. However, this only works if you do the decarboxylation step (pre-bake). Simply spray the buds after the come out of the oven and let them sit for 10-15 minutes while you start melting the butter., This recipe uses the nifty cooking trick of blanching, rapidly heating and cooling the buds, to remove chlorophyll and other stinky chemicals. To pull it off, you need to be prepared to pre-bake as well, so get ready for a several-hour cook. That said, blanching is easy:


Bring a large pot of water to a boil.
Set aside another bowl and fill it with ice water.
Place your ground up weed in a tea ball, then dunk it in the boiling water for 5 minutes.
Remove weed ball and place immediately in the ice bath for 1 minute.
Repeat until all the weed is blanched
Pre-bake the weed at 220°F for one hour to dry out.
Make your cannabutter like normal."

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit (200 degrees Celsius).,
Pour the tomato sauce into the ramekins.,
Break the eggs into the ramekins.,
Spoon the milk over the eggs.,
Add the toppings.,
Bake for 8 to 10 minutes.,
Serve hot.",How to Bake Eggs2," Meanwhile, lightly grease two to four ramekins with nonstick cooking spray, oil, or butter.Use four 4 oz to 6 oz (60 to 125 ml) oven-safe ramekins if you wish to serve one egg per person.
Use two 10 oz (315 ml) oven-safe ramekins if you wish to serve two eggs per person. Both round and oval ramekins work equally well.

, Evenly divide the tomato sauce into each of the prepared ramekins. Ideally, you should use about 1/4 cup (60 ml) of sauce per egg.Tomato sauces are the most common sauce type paired with baked eggs, but you can experiment with different options. Unseasoned sauce will create the most mild flavor, but marinara will give the dish more dimension without distracting from the taste of the eggs. You can try spicy tomato sauces, heavily seasoned tomato sauces, or homemade tomato sauces, as well.

, Carefully break the eggs over the sauce and into the ramekins. Vary the number of eggs based on the size and number of dishes.


To reduce the risk of breaking any yolks, use cold eggs. You should also break the eggs within 1 or 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) of the dish to minimize the amount of drop force the yolks will need to endure.
Inspect the eggs for shell fragments and remove any you find. If you're concerned about shells, you can break the eggs into a separate dish first, inspect them for fragments, and slide them into the ramekins afterward.

, Carefully pour about 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of milk on top of each egg. Only top the eggs with milk; do not stir the milk into them.


The milk adds an extra layer of defense against the drying heat of the oven. The cheese used in this recipe will provide a similar effect, though, so you may omit the milk if desired.
Note that you should be able to use any type of milk, half-and-half, or light cream.

, Sprinkle 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of Parmesan cheese over each dish. Follow with salt and pepper, to taste, and 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of chopped fresh cilantro per dish.


If desired, you could use other types of shredded cheese (e.g., mozzarella, Romano, Italian cheese mixes) or other herbs (e.g., basil, parsley). You may also choose to omit these additions completely.

, Place the eggs on the middle rack of the preheated oven, and bake them until the egg whites are solid and cooked through.


If the eggs do not appear to be cooking evenly, rotate the ramekins halfway through the baking process.
While the egg whites must be cooked through, the egg yolks should be thick yet still soft. If you prefer firmer yolks, however, you can bake the eggs a few minutes longer.

, Remove the eggs from the oven and allow them to set for another 2 to 3 minutes. Enjoy them while they're still hot, and consider serving them with freshly toasted bread.

Serve hot.",How to Bake Eggs3," Meanwhile, lightly coat four 10 oz (315 ml) ramekins with nonstick cooking spray.You can use oven-safe bowls or similar dishes if you don't have ramekins, but the dishes should be able to hold at least 10 oz (315 ml), if not more.
Note that this baked egg dish will only include one egg per serving, so you should have an equal number of dishes and eggs.

, In a medium to large mixing bowl, combine the shredded hash brown potatoes, 1/4 cup (60 ml) shredded cheddar cheese, 1/2 tsp (2.5 ml) salt, and 1/4 tsp (60 ml) ground black pepper until evenly mixed.

, Spoon equal amounts of the hash brown mixture into the greased ramekins. Use your fingers to create indentations in the center of each dish.Essentially, you need to create a ""nest"" of hash browns with a 2-inch (5-cm) deep and 2-inch (5-cm) wide indentation for each egg. Press the mixture into the bottom of each ramekin and up the sides, leaving the centers empty.

, Place the hash brown nests on the middle rack of the oven. Bake them until they become golden brown and crisp, but not burnt.


The hash brown nests require a much longer cooking time than the eggs, so they need to be baked first. Furthermore, baking the nests first gives the eggs a more solid base to rest on, which may prevent them from seeping into the hash brown mixture.

, Remove the hash brown nests from the oven. Allow them to cool for about 5 minutes, then break one egg into the center of each nest.


Use cold eggs to minimize the risk of accidentally breaking any yolks. Also note that holding the eggs just 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) above the top of each dish when breaking them should reduce the impact of the fall and further minimize the risk of breakage.
Inspect the eggs for stray shell fragments and remove any you find.

, Sprinkle each egg with additional salt and pepper, to taste. Add up to 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of diced tomato and 1/2 Tbsp (7.5 ml) cooked bacon bits or sausage crumbles per egg. Top each egg with 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of additional shredded cheddar cheese.


The toppings are easy to customize according to your own preferences. Others worth considering may include chopped fresh herbs, like parsley or chives, or other types of cheeses.
Note that the additional cheese is highly recommended. Adding a layer of cheese can help prevent the the eggs from drying out in the heat of the oven.

, Place the eggs on the middle rack of the preheated oven. Bake until the whites are set and the yolks are thickened.


You can cook the eggs until the yolks reach your desired level of doneness, but traditionally, the yolks are left soft. Also note that the eggs will continue to cook for a few minutes after you remove them from the oven.
Watch the nested eggs carefully and do not allow the potato nests to burn. If the potatoes look too brown before the eggs are finished, try covering the dishes with a small piece of aluminum foil before you finish baking the eggs.

, Remove the eggs from the oven and allow them to set for about 2 minutes, then enjoy them while they're still hot.

Use a mixture of half butter and half cooking oil.,
Keep the food moving.,
Use a high quality cooking pan.,
Use clarified butter or ghee.",How to Stop Butter Burning," Olive oil is a good choice. Heat moderately slowly before adding the ingredients.


It is important to add the ingredients before the fat becomes hot enough to smoke.;
, Use a wooden spoon to keep stirring; this will help prevent the butter from burning.


Remove the pan from the heat as soon as you see it is starting to burn. This means you also need to get the food straight out of the pan, as it will continue to cook with the residual heat in the pan.

, The greater the thickness of the pan, the easier it is to heat butter without burning it, as there is more protection from the direct heat. However, good quality thick pans are expensive.


Do not use a pan that isn't flat. If it's uneven, the butter will pool in one place and burn.

, The benefit of using this is that it lacks moisture or impurities. As such, it won't burn when used to sauté or fry food.

Know the history of butter.,
Pour single cream into a churn/bowl.,
Add vanilla essence.,
Churn the butter.,
Shape the butter.",How to Make Vanilla Butter," The making of butter goes back thousands of years. During the summer months, cattle herds were often taken to hills and mountain pastures by women who herded and milked the cows and lived in 'booley huts’. They stayed in these huts throughout the summer months, only coming down for Mass and to bring the butter in firkins (barrels). In time the kitchen became the traditional place for housing and using the churn. , A churn is a special type of gadget made specifically for churning butter. Though you can just use electronic whisks (or your arms) instead, churns are still used by many dairy lovers. The traditional type of Irish churn, the dash churn, was a strong vessel, stave-built, with a conical body and splayed top into which fitted the lid., This is the secret to making the butter taste sweeter and like vanilla. The recommended amount would be 2 1/2 tsp for maximum flavour, but you may alter it depending on how sweet/strong the vanilla will be.

, If you are an experienced butter-churner, you will know what to do from here, but for the beginner you either use the churn (if that is what you have chosen) or use a whisk to churn the cream. It may take a few minutes with an electric whisk, but it will take a little bit longer if you use your arm and a plain whisk.

, After you're happy with the product and removing it from the churn/bowl, shape it however you like. A plain rectangle is fine, but use your imagination. Once done, wrap up with kitchen paper, place in a plastic container and store in refrigerator for later use.

The butter should be cut into small chunks; this makes the combining a lot easier and it will fit better into the food processor.;
, When they are smooth and well combined, stop processing. This will take anywhere from 1 to 3 minutes. Expect the result to appear like a liquid; this is normal and it will firm up when refrigerated again.

, These types of containers are the best for storing fats that easily soak up flavors.

, If the container lacks a lid, use a layer of wax paper topped by a layer of kitchen foil. A rubber band can be place around the edges to keep it down firmly. Place back in the refrigerator, preferably in the butter section. Let it firm up before use.


Keep stored in the refrigerator when not being used.

, It's very simple; just dip the butter knife in, take the amount needed and spread. The oil in the butter will make it spread much more easily than the usual hard refrigerated butter.

",How to Make Mascarpone," Gas stoves work best. As the pans and water heat up, you may reduce and readjust the heat.;
, Heat, stirring constantly, to a steady temperature of about 180 degrees F (about 82 C). The cream should barely simmer.

, You will notice the mixture beginning to thicken almost immediately after incorporating the tartaric acid. You might want to switch quickly between a high heat rubber spatula to skim the sides, and your whisk or spoon, in order to maintain an even temperature and consistency throughout the thickening mascarpone. Be very aware of the temperature.

, Any higher temperature will burn the cream. Continue to stir for at least two minutes. Have at the ready your chinoise mousseline, (lined with damp cheesecloth if desired). This should be in place over a stainless steel vessel suitable for storing overnight in the fridge.

,, (Bain-marie pots are perfect for this function.) To facilitate the passing process, you may use a small ladle to press the cream through the bottom of the sieve.


Cover well, and refrigerate at least 8 hours or overnight.
Glass or porcelain may be used to store the mascarpone if stainless steel is unavailable, but avoid using any 'reactionary' metals like aluminum, as the acid in the mascarpone will undergo a chemical reaction with the metal.

, Try balancing the tart flavor with a slightly sweet ingredient and making ice cream.

, A classic, simple dessert may be prepared by slicing fresh strawberries and placing in a martini glass or ice cream bowl. Drizzle in a bit of balsamic syrup or Chambord liquor, or even Champagne or framboise Lambic. Top with creamy mascarpone.


You might notice many recipe ideas for desserts like strawberry mascarpone 'parfaits', or mascarpone cream online. These will call for whipping together the dense version of mascarpone with heavy cream. Because this creamy version has not been strained, this recipe is already perfect for use as a berry or fruit accompaniment––no additional cream is necessary.
Creamy mascarpone may be whipped, like cream. This is fantastic served with rich desserts like a fallen chocolate souffle cake.
If you'd like to experiment with flavoring the mascarpone for particular desserts, add the desired ingredients (like vanilla beans and molasses) to the cream before the tartaric acid is introduced. This way, the flavors will really meld and develop, and any detritus, like vanilla bean pods, will be strained out before chilling. If you want to add flavoring to the final product, incorporate very well, and consider straining once more before using in your recipe.

, If you'd like the creamy mascarpone to be a bit sweeter, experiment with flavoring it with vanilla sugar syrup, molasses, or honey before serving. When serving with unsweetened fresh fruits like berries, green mission figs, peaches, or poached pears, the tart but slightly sweet smoothness provides a perfect juxtaposition.

, You can use freeze-dried DVI (direct vat inoculated) cultures, because they are amazingly convenient and easy to use, and there are different kinds for different cheeses., Let the milk ""ripen"" for 15 minutes (for other cheese, this takes an hour)., Rennet contains enzymes that coagulate the milk. It is extracted from the fourth stomach of a calf. You could alternatively use vegetarian rennet. The rennet is slowly going to thicken the milk., Cut too soon, and the curds are too soft, and if you wait too long, the curds are going to be too tough.

Room temperature is considered to be about 72°F. If your house is any cooler, the cream cheese mixture will take slightly longer to set., Line a colander with a butter muslin cloth. Then pour the cream cheese mixture into the muslin-lined colander. Gather the corners of the muslin cloth and tie to form a bag. Use some string to hang the bag from the handle of a kitchen cupboard. Place a bowl underneath the bag to catch the whey.


If you do not have suitable cupboard handles to to hang the bag from, try tying the bag around the handle of a wooden spoon and balance the spoon over a jug or bowl.

, The length of time you allow the bag to drain will determine the consistency of your cream cheese. A shorter draining time will result in a softer cheese, while a longer draining time will result in a firmer cheese. Find the consistency that works for you - there is no right or wrong, just personal preference.


Use a shorter draining period to produce a soft cream cheese that works well in spreads and dips, or use a longer draining period to produce a firm cream cheese more suited for baking or cooking.Once the cream cheese is finished, you can chill it in the refrigerator, which will also lend it a firmer consistency.

, After the cream cheese has finished draining, remove it from the muslin bag and place it in a bowl. Add a teaspoon of sea salt, if desired. At this point you can also add in the flavor of your choice. Here are some ideas:

Choose the right pan.,
Add the butter, lard/bacon fat or oil in the frying pan.,
Heat the fat until it is just hot enough to sizzle a drop of water.,
Break the egg gently so that it breaks in half.,
Repeat with any additional eggs, making sure to space them far enough apart so that the whites don't touch.,
Baste butter or oil over the top of the eggs for added flavor.,
Consider covering the pan.,
Cook the eggs until the whites and yolk reach the desired consistency.,
Remove from the heat.,
Serve immediately.",How to Make Sunny Side up Eggs," The best pan for making fried eggs is a heavy iron cast skillet.






;
, You'll need just enough to coat the pan––this is one of the secrets to getting the yolks to cook just right.









Bacon fat is considered to make especially good fried eggs.

, One tip to ensure perfectly fried eggs is to wait for the whites to set and the edges of the egg to be cooked. To make this happen, add 1/2 a teaspoon of water per egg before adding the eggs.If a drop of water immediately sizzles and evaporates on the pan, it's hot enough to hold the eggs in the right form when you add them.









Don't wait too long before adding the eggs. If the pan gets too hot, the edges of the eggs will burn before the whites are finished cooking.


, Hold it over the frying pan as you break it, and let it gently drop into the hot fat. Immediately lower the heat and do the remaining cooking over low heat.









If you have trouble cracking eggs so that none of the shell gets in it, crack each one into a bowl, check for shell fragments, then pour into the pan, one egg at a time.

, With practice, you'll be able to keep the yolk centered within the white. You could also use an egg ring instead, which will keep the eggs nice and round and separate.









Alternatively, you can deliberately let the whites mingle and separate them after they're cooked by slicing with a spatula or knife.

Optional: Break the whites apart right around the yolk with a spatula or spoon. This will help the whites spread into a thinner layer so that they cook more thoroughly.

, Although this addition is optional, it does rev up the taste and texture of the sunny-side egg!









The addition of salt and pepper at this stage is suggested by chef Michael Romano.However, other chefs disagree, citing the tendency of eggs to lose moisture and to turn rubbery when salt is added during cooking. Salt may also cause the eggs to cook unevenly.It might be worth experimenting, to see which approach you agree with – salt during or after cooking.

, Covering the pan can accelerate the cooking process but care must be taken to avoid overcooking the yolks. If you cover the pan, the top of the whites (including the layer over the yolk) cooks and turns white and firm, rather than remaining clear and slippery. This is more similar to over-easy eggs, which are actually flipped over so that the ""sunny"" side cooks.









If you do cover the pan, keep an eye on the time and check at the 3 minute point without fail. A pan with a clear cover can be helpful for watching the progress easily.
You can also pour about a tablespoon's worth of water on the pan before covering it. This will steam cook the tops of the eggs more thoroughly. One tip to ensure perfectly fried eggs is to wait for the whites to set and the edges of the egg to be cooked and then to add 1/2 a teaspoon of water per egg., Usually this means that the whites are firm and the yolk is thick but not firm but whether you prefer the yolk runny or set is a purely personal preference. You can check the consistency of the yolk by shaking the pan gently and observing how the egg jiggles. With experience, you'll learn just how long to cook the egg to fit your taste.









Another technique is to cook the egg for one minute covered, then remove the pan from heat (still with the cover on) and wait for the white around yolk to become opaque white (usually 3-5 minutes).In order to kill any possible bacteria, the eggs need to reach a temperature of 140ºF (60ºC). At that point, the whites are completely set, and the yolks have begun to thicken, although the center may still be runny.If the eggs don't reach this temperature, there is a risk of food poisoning (see ""Warnings"" below).

, Slip the spatula under each egg, and gently place the fried egg on a plate ready for serving.









It's a good idea to have a warmed plate for serving as this helps keep the warmth in the fried eggs.

, These eggs should be served straight away once cooked, from the pan to the plate. Have accompanying items ready in advance, such as beans, toast, cooked tomato, sausages, bacon, etc. Some serving suggestions include:









Serve with toast; this lets the diner use the pieces of bread to wipe up all the yolk that remains on the plate.
Serve over white rice, grits, or corned beef hash.
Serve with a favorite sauce.
Try adding some extra butter or oil and using a spoon, ""baste"" the egg yolks with the oil.

"
"
Do the Prep.,
Set the burner on a medium to low setting, before that you begin adding the cheese product.,
Wait until the Velveeta has melted lower the heat somewhat and add in the (Rotel) tomatoes.,
Add in the Jalapeno peppers, and black olives if desired.,
Cheese sauce is at its best if served very warm.",How to Make Cheese Sauce with Jalapeño Peppers," First cut the Velveeta in to tiny squares and set aside. Have the can of (Rotel) tomatoes opened, drained and ready to be used. Have the amount of Jalapeno peppers that are desired set aside. If someone should choose to use black olives have them set aside, also. Be sure to have a medium size pot ready and set on top of the stove burner. See tips below on side dish ideas.;
, Then add in the blocks of Velveeta. Be sure to stir the cheese product, constantly, until melted.

, Be sure to continue to stir.

, Over very low heat, and with a lid on allow sauce to simmer, for at least (5-10) minutes. This will allow the flavor to develop, after adding the Jalapeno peppers.

, The sauce needs to be creamy and not real solid. So it is best not to allow the sauce to cool down much, if any at all.

Preheat your oven to 325º Fahrenheit (163ºC).,
Get your eggs and put them into the muffin tin.,
Once at temperature, put your muffin tin into the oven and set your timer for 30 minutes.,
Before time is up, prepare a bowl of ice water large enough to contain the eggs.,
Immediately put the eggs in the ice water once they are removed from the oven.,
Remove them from the water and peel them.",How to Make Hard Boiled Eggs in the Oven," If your oven is a little on the weak side or if you're baking a dozen large ones, you might want to vamp it up to 350ºF (177ºC).






;
, If you have a mini muffin tin, even better. They won't roll around as much.









If you're not using the entirety of the pan, put the eggs in the center. When the weight of the tin is balanced, it's easier to maneuver.

, Go watch an episode of your favorite TV show, read a chapter of that book you've been meaning to finish, or, heck, jog around the block. Your work here is done. And who said you couldn't cook?









When you bake eggs, the shells get little brown dots. This is totally fine! When you soak them in water the brown spots should all disappear.

, This keeps the eggs from cooking more and turning that nasty shade of green around the yolk. It'll also speed up the time you'll spend waiting for them to cool down and peel them.








, They'll be very hot -- use tongs to avoid burning your fingers. Let them sit in the cold water for 10 minutes.








, Their peels should just about slide right off. You'll never boil eggs again. Eat them whole, make 'em deviled, turn them into a salad, and save the rest for later.









Keep this in mind for when Easter comes around! Baking batches of eggs for dying is completely stress-free this way.

Prick the end of your egg.,
Cover the eggs with cold water.,
Bring the water to a boil and turn off the heat.,
Cook the soft-boiled eggs to your liking.",How to Make a Soft Boiled Egg1," To prevent eggs from cracking and to make them easier to peel, gently prick the end of each egg. You can carefully use a small pin or tack to poke a very small indentation through the shell at the large end of the egg. Take care not to poke very far or the white will leak out of the egg.You could also use something with a slightly rounded point to poke the egg. For example, you could use a wooden pestle. If you use this, just tap the larger end of the egg.;
, Put your eggs into a small saucepan and pour enough cold water to cover the eggs by 1-inch (2.5 cm).If you want to cook more than 4 eggs, consider using a larger pot or cooking them in batches. This will ensure that you can remove the eggs quickly, so they won't overcook.

, Turn the heat on to medium-high and keep the lid off of the pan. Once the water begins to boil (bubble vigorously), turn off the heat and start your timer right away.If you continue to boil the eggs over such a high-heat, they may bounce around in the pan and crack as they bump into each other. That's why it's important to turn off the heat (or simmer them gently if you're using a hot start method of cooking).

, You'll need to keep a close eye on the timer, since every minute makes a difference when boiling eggs. Leave the eggs in the hot water to get the desired consistency. Try cooking the eggs for:2 minutes to get a raw yolk and very soft egg white
4 minutes to get a really runny, thick yolk and set white
6 minutes to get a mostly set yolk and set white
8 minutes to get a tender, but set yolk and fully set white

, You can take a teaspoon and tap around the top of the egg. Use the spoon or a butter knife to cut and lift away the egg cap. You can also whack the top of the egg, but this could get shell into your soft-boiled egg if you use too much force.You can also use tools designed to open soft-boiled eggs. These may look like small scissors, suction cups, bottle openers, or cigar cutters. They're made to easily slice off and remove the top cap of the egg.

, Malaysian style eggs and toast is a popular breakfast in Malaysia and Singapore. Crack one soft-boiled egg into a small ramekin, so the soft yolk is contained. Use a soft-boiled egg with a very soft white. Pour a little soy sauce over the egg and serve it with toast.You can also sprinkle the eggs with white pepper and serve the toast with coconut jam.

",How to Make Feta Cheese Triangles," Put the chunks in a mixing bowl.;
,, If you don't have an immersion blender, you'll need to find a way to fully blend the feta and the mint leaves.

, Be careful as filo pastry is very delicate; if there are too many holes in the pastry, then the filling will drip right out of it.

,, Here's how you do it:


Take the upper right corner of the filo pastry sheet.
Fold the corner down and to the left so that the sheet's upper edge is aligned with the sheet's left edge. This should create a small triangle surrounding the filling.
Fold the triangle down. This should create a rectangle-shaped sheet again.
Take the upper left corner of the sheet and fold the corner down and to the right, just like you did with the right corner.
If there's still a piece of filo pastry left, fold it around the triangle.

,, Here's how you do it:


Take a frying pan and put it on the stove on a low to regular heat.
Add a dash of (olive) oil and let it heat up for a bit.
Take a few feta cheese triangles and put them in the frying pan. There shouldn't be any triangles lying on top of each other in the pan.
Flip the triangles every few seconds until they are golden-brownish.
Keep adding a dash of oil every now and then, otherwise the triangles will burn and stick to the pan easily.

Sort the eggs and place them in a saucepan or pot.,
Fill the pan with cold tap water.,
Place the pan on medium heat.,
Remove from heat when the water boils.,
Chill the eggs to stop the cooking process.,
Peel the eggs when you're ready to eat them.,
Store eggs in the refrigerator for 5 days.",How to Hard Boil an Egg1," Gently place your eggs at the bottom of a heavy-bottomed saucepan. Stack them very gently to avoid breaking. Don't stack them more than four-deep.If you're unsure whether your eggs are fresh, test them by placing them in a bowl of salt water. If the egg sinks to the bottom, it's fresh. If it floats to the top, get rid of it.
To keep the eggs from cracking as they boil, you can try placing a folded cheesecloth at the bottom of the pot to pad them. However, this isn't required.;
, Cover the eggs gently with at least one inch (3 cm) of water. Add a pinch of salt. You can steady the eggs with your hand as you add the water to keep the eggs from breaking. Alternatively, just point the stream of water at the side of the pan.









Cold water helps to keep the eggs from overcooking. Never drop eggs directly into a pot of hot water, or the shells will crack and the egg will run (giving you poached eggs).Salted water helps to make the egg white firm up more quickly. It also helps plug small leaks if the shell cracks during the cooking process., Cover the pan with a lid. Let the water come to a gentle boil. The water will boil a bit more quickly with the lid on, but it's fine to leave it off if you'd rather keep an eye on the eggs.


You can stir the eggs very gently every now and then to make sure they've not settled at the bottom, where they'll cook less evenly and break more easily. Use a wooden spoon to stir and be very gentle.

, As soon as the water reaches a full boil, turn the heat off. Leave the lid on the pan. The heat of the water and the remaining warmth from the burner will be enough to finish cooking your eggs. Depending on how hard or soft you like your eggs, you can leave them like this for about 3-20 minutes:










If you like your eggs soft-boiled, remove them from the water in three minutes or less. The whites should be set, while the yolks should be runny and warm.If you like your eggs medium-boiled, remove them from the water in 5-7 minutes. The yolks should be semi-soft in the very center and the whites should be very firm.

If you like your eggs hard-boiled, leave the eggs in the hot water for up to 10-15 minutes. The yolks should be firm all the way through. It's difficult to overcook eggs this way.

, As soon as you've waited for your eggs to finish cooking, drain the hot water from the pan gently. You can also remove the eggs one by one with a slotted spoon. Place the eggs under cold running water or drop them carefully into a bowl of ice water to bring their temperature down quickly. Let them sit in cool water for about five minutes.









Once the eggs are cool enough to hold in your hand comfortably, put them in the refrigerator for 20-30 minutes to loosen the shells.
If you're not particular about how pretty your peeled eggs are, you can skip the refrigerator and start peeling them right after chilling them.
To test whether an egg is hard-boiled without breaking it, whirl it on a table. If it spins fast and easy, it is hard boiled. If it wobbles, it needs more time.

, Press each egg into a clean, flat surface and roll it in your hand to crack the shell. Start peeling from the fatter end of the egg, where there should be a small empty space under the shell. This makes it slightly easier to peel. Rinse the eggs under cold water as you peel them to keep bits of shell and membrane from sticking to the egg.









Quick peeling tip: Put the eggs back in the pan you cooked them in and put the lid back on. Shake the pan back and forth to crack all the shells at once.

, After peeling the eggs, they're ready to eat. You can store leftovers in a bowl with a plate on top or a sealed container. In both cases, cover the eggs with a wet paper towel. Change the paper towel each day to keep the eggs from drying out.Eat the eggs within four to five days.









You can also store the eggs in cold water. Change the water each day to keep the eggs from breaking down.
Hard-boiled eggs can be stored several days before cracking and peeling them, but they tend to get a little rubbery and dried out. It's usually better to keep peeled eggs moist in the fridge with water or a paper towel.

Assemble the items needed and the ingredients.,
Heat the vegetable or olive oil in the pan or pot.,
Crack an egg into a small cup or bowl.,
Carefully slide the cracked egg onto a ladle.

,
With one hand, carefully tilt the pan or pot to one side and gently slide the egg into the boiling oil.,
Using a wooden spoon, quickly roll or baste the egg with the oil.,
Use the slotted spoon to lift the egg out of the oil.,
Drain the deep fried egg on either a cloth tea towel or on kitchen paper.,
Season to taste.",How to Make Deep Fried Eggs," Some of the things are listed below under ""Things You'll Need"". It is important to have everything ready because the cooking process happens very quickly and you don't want to overcook the eggs while looking for something missing.


Set up the drainage area and slotted spoon now.;
, Heat over a high heat. The temperature should read 190ºC/375ºF or close about.

, When doing this, take care not to break the yolk.

,, Be very careful with this step to avoid splashing any hot oil onto yourself.

, It should take on an oval shape and you'll only see white, with the yolk safely tucked away inside. Continue doing this for 1 minute.


You may find it easiest to use two wooden spoons to do the turning or rolling around of the egg.

, The deep fried egg is ready when it looks set and has a light color to it. Once you see the white turning to brown, that's the time to remove the deep fried egg.

, Do this quickly, as the egg must be served before it loses its airiness (which happens rather quickly).

, Add salt, pepper or other condiments as wished prior to eating. Serve as quickly as possible and enjoy what is quite a luxurious treat.


The deep fried egg goes well on freshly made toast. Place it on a plate, as the yolk will run gooey.
Try serving it on top of grilled cheese on toast. Quite an experience!
Serve on top of croutons with cooked tomato pieces.

Heat water to boiling in a microwave-safe bowl.,
Remove the bowl and carefully add the eggs.,
Cover the bowl and let sit.,
Remove the eggs and chill as normal.,
If your yolks are grayish-green, cook for less time.,
If your egg is too runny, cook for more time.,
Steam fresh eggs to make them easier to peel.,
Crack and soak eggs that are difficult to peel.,
Add vinegar if an egg cracks in the water.",How to Hard Boil an Egg2," The microwave generally doesn't work quite as well as the stove for hard-boiled eggs, but with a little patience it can work in a pinch. Here, you'll want to boil the water in the microwave without the eggs first. See our guide to boiling water in the microwave safely for important information.


This bears repeating: don't heat unbeaten eggs in the microwave. Even out of the shell, a build-up of pressure in the yolk can cause them to explode, damaging your microwave., Using a towel or oven mitt, take the bowl out of the microwave. Use a slotted spoon to add the eggs one by one. Make sure each is covered completely by the water.









Don't drop the eggs directly into the water. Not only can they break when they hit the bottom, but they can also splash boiling-hot water upward.

, Once all the eggs are added, cover the bowl with a lid or a plate. Let it sit — the eggs will cook in the heat of the near-boiling water. Your cooking time will vary depending on how hard you want your eggs. In general, you should expect your eggs to take slightly more time than they would on the stove. This is because they did not have a chance to cook while the water was heating up.










If you like your eggs soft-boiled, let them sit for 10 minutes or less.The yolk should still be somewhat runny.

If you like your eggs medium-boiled, let them sit for about 15 minutes.The yolk should be semi-soft and the whites should be quite firm.

If you like your eggs hard-boiled, let them sit for 20 minutes or more.The white and yolk should be completely firm without being an unappealing grey-green color.

, After you've let your eggs sit, remove them from the water with a strainer or a slotted spoon. At this point, the rest of the process is the same as for eggs you've cooked on the stove. See below:









Cover the eggs with cold water or set them in an ice bath for about five minutes so that they cool.
When the eggs can be comfortably held, you can crack and peel them right away or stick them in the fridge for 20-30 minutes to make this easier.
Store the eggs under a moist paper towel or submerged in water in the fridge. Eat the eggs within four or five days, changing the towel or water every day.

, Letting boiled eggs cook for too long will give the yolks a gray-green ring and a sulfur-like smell. There's nothing wrong with these eggs and they are perfectly safe for eating. However, if you find this unappetizing, simply reduce the amount of time you let your eggs cook for next time.


The gray-green color is formed when iron from the yolk reacts with hydrogen sulfide from the white.This reaction occurs after the rest of the egg has finished cooking.
Extra heat also tends to over-coagulate the proteins in the egg. This can give rubbery whites and dry yolks.

, If you don't use enough heat when cooking your eggs, you may find yourself with the opposite problem as the gray-green yolks above. Eggs that don't cook long enough may have yolks that aren't as firm as you'd like. Extremely undercooked eggs may even have whites that aren't completely set. If you notice that the first egg you peel and crack is undercooked, return the rest to hot water and allow to sit.


Undercooked eggs can pose a risk of salmonella infection. The FDA recommends cooking all eggs until the yolks are firm or using eggs that have been in-shell pasteurized.As noted above, you can spin an egg on a hard surface to test whether it is hard boiled. If it spins evenly (like a top), the egg is finished. Undercooked or uncooked eggs will wobble or spiral off to one side.

, When eggs are just a day or two old, the membrane sticks to the shell, making the egg difficult to peel.The best eggs for hard-boiling are about 7-10 days old. If you have to boil very fresh eggs, try steaming them first to help separate the membrane from the shell:


Place the eggs in a metal colander and rest the colander on top of a pan. Boil an inch or so of water in the pan for about 10 minutes, turning the eggs frequently. After, boil the eggs as normal.Some people also like to add a teaspoon of baking soda to the water when boiling eggs that are very fresh. This can add a sulfuric taste to the eggs, however.

, If you notice the white of the egg sticking to the shell as you peel it, roll the egg around to make lots of little cracks in the surface of the shell. Then, place the egg in a bowl of cold water and let it sit for 5-10 minutes. This often helps to loosen the shell up and separate the membrane, making it much easier to peel.








, This is a common problem, especially with eggs that are very cold. If you notice that an egg has cracked, a teaspoon of vinegar in the water helps the proteins in the egg white coagulate faster, plugging the cracks in the shell.Try to be quick here — if you add the vinegar to the water as soon as you notice a crack, the egg should still boil evenly.









You may notice a little whiteness creeping out of a cracked egg. If you don't get to it with the vinegar in time, don't worry. It should still boil fine, but it may look a little funky.

Inspect your eggs.,
Dry clean the eggs with a sanding sponge or a loofah.,
Decide whether you want to wash and sanitize your eggs.,
Fill two bowls with warm/hot water.,
Make sure the water you use is warmer than the egg itself.,
Clean each egg individually.,
Store the eggs.,
Collect your eggs twice a day.,
Allow one nest box for every four hens.,
Regularly clean your nest boxes.,
Ensure roosting boxes are higher than nest boxes.,
Encourage strong shells.",How to Clean Eggs," If an eggshell has any cracks or breaks, you should discard the egg immediately. If the shell has cracked, bacteria may have entered the egg and it will be unsafe to eat. If the shell is already clean, consider leaving it alone. There are many egg enthusiasts out there who don't believe in cleaning eggs at all. They consider it to be unnecessary, or even harmful, as cleaning eggs can remove their natural protective coating - called ""bloom"" - which prevents harmful bacteria from entering the egg.


Of course, this only goes for eggs that are clean to begin with. If the eggs have any dirt, feathers, or hen droppings attached to them, it is more hygienic to clean the egg.
This is especially true if you plan on giving your eggs to friends and family or selling the eggs, as people who are used to store-bought eggs may be squeamish about dirty eggs.;
, Most dirt can be removed using a sanding sponge or a loofah. All you need to do is gently rub the egg with the sponge or sandpaper until the dirt comes away. Be careful not to crack the egg as you clean.


Try not to rub the areas that are already clean, this will keep as much of the bloom intact as possible.
Other items you can use to dry clean the egg include fine-grit sandpaper, steel wool, emery cloth or a toothbrush.If you use a sponge or brush to clean the eggs, it is a good idea to sanitize them between uses. This prevents bacteria being transferred from one batch of eggs to the next.

, Sometimes it will be necessary to wash your eggs in water if you can't remove all of the dirt with dry cleaning alone. This is often the case when the contents of a cracked egg become stuck to another egg's shell. But aside from necessity, some people just prefer the idea of clean eggs.


Be aware that washing the eggs in water will remove the ""bloom"" from the shell. This makes the porous eggshell more susceptible to drawing in bacteria, thus decreasing the egg's shelf life.
However, dirty, unwashed eggs can also be a health hazard, and if you plan on using the eggs quickly and follow the correct storage procedures, the removal of the bloom will make little difference.If you plan on selling your eggs, you will need to comply with your state's regulations regarding the proper cleaning and safety procedures for farm-fresh eggs.

, To one of the bowls, add a little cleaning agent, such as an unscented dishwasher or laundry detergent or a specific egg cleaning product. To the other bowl, add a small amount of bleach - about 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon should do the trick.


Wear rubber gloves to protect your hands from becoming irritated by either the detergent or bleach.
If you don't like the idea of using detergent, you can simply rinse the eggs in plain water instead. If you are not comfortable using bleach, make an alternative sanitizer from one part water and one part distilled white vinegar., The temperature of the water you use to clean your eggs it very important.


Cold water is a major no-no. If you use cold water to wash your eggs, it will cause the contents of the eggs to contract, creating a vacuum which pulls bacteria into the egg. This contaminates the egg.
The ideal temperature for washing your eggs is at least 20°F (11°C) warmer than the egg itself. Therefore, depending on the freshness of the egg, water temperatures should usually be between 90 - 120°F (32.2 - 49°C).
The warm water causes the contents of the egg to expand, thus pushing microbes out of the shell., One at a time, dip each egg into the water with the cleaning agent and use your fingers to clean off any hardened dirt. If necessary, use a small scrub brush.


Rinse the egg in hot water to clean off any detergent, then dip the egg in the bleach (or vinegar) solution to sanitize. Set the egg on a piece of clean paper towel to dry.
Repeat the process with the remaining eggs. If you're washing more than three dozen eggs, it will be necessary to refresh the bowls of water.
It is important that you only dip the eggs in the warm water, rather than leaving them to sit or soak. Otherwise, they may start to cook!, Once the eggs have been washed, sanitized and dried, you will need to store them correctly. Place eggs in a clean carton or flat, with the narrow end pointing downwards. Date stamp the carton or use color coded stickers for easy identification.


Eggs should be stored in the main part of the refrigerator, at temperatures between 35°F to 40°F. They should not be stored on a shelf in the door, as this part of the refrigerator is warmer.
Don't store eggs beside odorous foods such as onions, garlic or fish, as the eggs can absorb these odors, thus affecting their flavor.
If stored correctly, eggs can stay fresh for more than three weeks., The longer eggs are left in the nest box, the more chance they have of becoming dirty. To avoid this, make an effort to collect your fresh eggs at least twice a day, and three times if necessary., Overcrowding of nest boxes is another factor which contributes to dirty eggs. You should supple one nest box for every four egg-laying hens., Dirty nest boxes lead to dirty eggs. Nest boxes should be cleaned out once a week to remove dirty litter and manure and replace fresh hay or wood shavings., Sometimes hens will decide to roost in their nest boxes rather than their roosting boxes. This results in the roosting boxes becoming dirtier much more quickly. Avoid this by placing your roosting boxes higher than your nesting boxes, as chickens like to roost in highest place possible in their coop., Strong shells are less prone to cracking. This is good for two reasons. Number one: you avoid the contents of the cracked egg from coating the other eggs and making them dirty. Number two: you have more eggs! To encourage healthy shells, add oyster shell to the hen's feed. It is available at farm supply stores."

Make a chocolate and almond butter toast.,
Try banana and almond butter toast.,
Create spicy almond butter rice cakes.,
Try it in oatmeal.",How to Make Snacks with Almond Butter2," Choose whatever kind of bread you prefer. A grainy bread is a good choice. Toast a slice lightly, then spread it with almond butter. Sprinkle chopped chocolate or mini chocolate chips on top. Stick it back in the toaster or oven under the broiler for a few minutes until the chocolate just begins to melt. Use a knife to smooth out the melted chocolate into the almond butter.Make sure you don't cook the bread too long, as the chocolate can easily go past melting to burning.

, Toast the bread of your choice. Try rye bread or a whole-grain bread. Spread a layer of almond butter on top, then add slices of bananas on top of that. This snack pairs slow-burning carbohydrates with protein, a good combination.You can also try sliced peaches on top., Use two plain (or whatever flavor) rice cakes.

Gather your ingredients.,
Blend the almonds and the salt.,
Add the honey.",How to Make Snacks with Almond Butter4," You'll need whole roasted almonds, salt, and honey to taste to make almond butter. Add about 1/2 teaspoon of salt for every 1 1/2 cups of almonds you use. Start with 1 1/2 to 2 tablespoons of honey, though you may want a bit more, depending on your taste preferences.


Roasted almonds make for a more flavorful spread. If you have raw almonds, you can toast them on an unlined baking sheet for 12 to 15 minutes at 325 degrees Fahrenheit (163 degrees Celsius)., Use a food processor to blend the almonds and the salt together. You may need to pulse it a few times at first. Keep blending the almonds and salt together until they form a relatively smooth paste.


If it's not smooth enough for your tastes, you can add a bit of a neutral oil, such as grapeseed oil, to help smooth things out., Next, pour the honey into the food processor. Blend the mixture again until the honey is fully mixed in. Taste the almond butter to see if it needs more salt or honey. Adjust as needed, and blend again. Place in an airtight jar, and use as you would any almond butter.


Another good addition at this point is a dash or two of cinnamon, which brings warmth to your almond butter."

Choose your salt.,
Clarify butter.,
Heat coconut oil or canola oil in a pan.,
Make the popcorn.,
Add the salt right after the popcorn is popped.,
Toss in melted clarified butter.",How to Make Movie Butter for Your Popcorn1," Many movie theaters use salt processed using the Alberger process, as the many jagged edges on the salt crystals help it stick to the popcorn.Diamond Crystal is the only consumer salt brand in the United States that uses this process.You can get a similar effect from extra-fine powdered salt, which is often sold as ""popcorn salt"" and stocked next to the popcorn.You can create powdered salt at home by grinding any salt in an electric coffee grinder, hand-turned salt mill, or mortar and pestle. If using a coffee grinder, grind a small amount of coffee beans afterward to remove the leftover salt.;
, Theaters that do use real butter (rather than butter-flavored oil) often use clarified butter. Clarification removes some moisture from the butter, which prevents the popcorn becoming soggy.You can clarify butter at home just by melting it over low heat until the bubbling stops and the liquid turns clear, about 30-40 minutes for 1 lb (0.45 kg) of butter.Strain the liquid through a damp cheesecloth and let cool to make clarified butter. Discard the milk solids left in the cheesecloth or at the bottom of the pan.


The famous ""buttered popcorn"" smell of a movie theater comes from artificial butter flavor. Actual butter won't replicate this perfectly.

, You may want to save the clarified butter for later drizzling, as it will likely brown or burn if you try to pop kernels in it. Coconut oil used to be the standard in movie theaters (and many still use it), but you may wish to follow a more recent trend and switch to canola oil, which has less saturated fat and a higher smoking point.Whichever you choose, pour just enough oil to cover the base of a large pan. Heat on a stovetop until the oil shimmers.


Note that most theaters that use canola oil actually use a more hydrogenated version that contains more fat than consumer canola oil.
If using coconut oil, the oil should melt completely.
You'll need a pan with a lid, but you do not need to cover it now.

, Throw in a few unpopped kernels and cover the pot. Once these kernels have popped, add the rest of the popcorn. Use ⅓ cup (80 mL) popcorn kernels for a 6 quart (5.6 L) pot.Cover and heat, shaking occasionally, until most of the kernels are popped. Pour popped corn into a large bowl whenever the pot gets full.


Leave the lid slightly ajar so some of the steam escapes, preventing soggy popcorn.
To reduce the number of burned or unpopped kernels, remove from heat right after adding the kernels. Wait for thirty seconds so the kernels reach an even temperature, then return to heat.

, You'll need about ⅓ tsp (1.5 mL) of fine grained salt in this recipe.The exact size of the salt crystals affects the flavor, so you may need to adjust to taste. Add the salt right after the popcorn is popped, since the steam clinging to the popcorn will help the salt stick., Pour the popcorn into a large bowl. Add 1 or 2 tbsp (15–30 mL) room temperature clarified butter to the hot pan, according to taste. It should melt quickly in the hot pan without additional heat. Drizzle it onto the popcorn when the butter is still yellow or only slightly brown.

Pop your popcorn in coconut oil or canola oil.,
Add flavored salt during or after cooking.,
Drizzle on butter flavored popcorn topping.",How to Make Movie Butter for Your Popcorn2," These are the two most common oils used by movie theaters. Heat a thin layer of oil until shimmering in a large pot. Add a few test kernels, then add the rest of the popcorn when they pop. Remove from heat for thirty seconds so the kernels reach an even temperature. Return to heat then cook, shaking occasionally, until popped.


You'll need about ⅓ cup popcorn kernels for a 6 quart (5.6 L) pot.

, Many theaters add a salt product that contains artificial butter flavor, often sold under the brand name Flavacol.You can order this online to add to your own popcorn. Since 1 tsp (5 mL) Flavacol contains 116% of the FDA-recommended daily sodium limit, it's best to sprinkle sparingly.Theater employees typically toss in the Flavacol before popping. However, Flavacol does release airborne chemicals when heated which could cause harm over long term use.This is unlikely to happen if you only make popcorn for personal use, but you can add the Flavacol after cooking if you are concerned.

, The Flavacol should already add that artificial butter flavor, but if you want that greasy feel on your tongue and fingers, you can buy a jug of ""popcorn topping"" online. Drizzle this on top to taste after your popcorn is ready.


As you might imagine, this is mostly hydrogenated fat, and not the best for your health.These products may also contain diacetyl or other ingredients linked to respiratory problems and (less conclusively) to Alzheimer's, although these are only likely to cause harm over long periods of time."

Cool and store the rhubarb butter.,
Bring a deep pot of water to a boil.,
Transfer the cooked rhubarb butter to a canning jar.,
Place a lid and canning ring on the jar.,
Boil the canned rhubarb butter for 10 minutes.",How to Make Rhubarb Butter," Slice off the broad green leaves and the ends of the stalks. Place the rhubarb stalks in a colander or grip a bunch loosely in one hand and run them under a stream of cool water. Scrub off any visible dirt and remove damaged or discolored spots with a paring knife.Fresh rhubarb can be found seasonally (late spring to early summer) at most supermarkets and specialty food stores.Because they grow in the ground, it’s necessary to give rhubarb stalks a thorough cleaning before adding them to the food you eat.;
, Go down the length of each stalk using a sharp kitchen knife and cut the rhubarb into large pieces. If you wish, you can then coarsely chop the pieces into a more manageable size. This will help the fibrous stalks cook down faster and result in a smoother butter.Larger pieces can be strained to eliminate stringy pulp, whereas utilizing a fine chop or running the rhubarb through a food processor will save you an added step but may let some of the plant fiber get through.

, Gather whatever flavor additives you prefer to use for your rhubarb butter. For a simple sweet butter that highlights the tart flavors of the plant, some sugar and a dash of cinnamon, ginger and vanilla will do nicely. For a more richly spiced butter, try a couple teaspoons of ground cardamom, nutmeg, cloves or anise.Go easy on the spices—there aren’t many foods that taste quite like rhubarb, and you want the vegetable to speak for itself.
Use brown sugar, palm sugar, honey or agave in place of granulated white sugar to change the profile of the sweetness and tailor your rhubarb butter for special dietary needs., Drop the sliced rhubarb pieces into the bottom of the saucepan, along with 2 (60 ml) cups of water, 2 ½ cups of sugar (480 g), ½ teaspoon ground cinnamon, ¼ teaspoon freshly grated ginger and a splash of fresh lemon juice. Give everything a stir so that it’s evenly distributed before you begin cooking.The pot or saucepan you use should be large enough to comfortably hold several cups of liquid.
For bigger batches of butter, add to the recipe as you see fit and use cookware of a suitable size.

, Turn on the cooktop to high heat and bring the ingredients to a boil gradually. As the mixture boils, the heat will break down the rhubarb, releasing its tangy, bitter flavors and mingling them with the sweetness of the sugar and spices.Stir every 5 minutes with a rubber spatula.
Keep an eye on the heat—it needs to be hot enough to cook down the ingredients, but not so hot that it scorches the sugar or boils over.

, Stir the mixture frequently as it simmers. Lowering the heat will allow the mixture to continue cooking down without burning. By the time it’s finished simmering, the rhubarb butter will have reduced to the consistency of applesauce.There will naturally be a little variation in cook times, depending on the type of rhubarb you use, your individual cookware and the intensity of the heating element. Set a kitchen timer and use your best judgment to determine when the butter has cooked down sufficiently.
For an extra smooth finish, press the butter through a strainer or food mill to trap stringy pulp and excess moisture., Turn off the cooktop and remove the saucepan from the heat. Have a pint jar or tupperware container nearby that you can pour the hot rhubarb butter into and give it a chance to cool and thicken. Once it’s set up, the butter will have a perfect spreadable texture, and will make a great addition to toast, waffles, roasted chicken, biscuits and countless other dishes!Allow the rhubarb butter to cool to room temperature before placing it in the refrigerator or freezer. Changing temperatures too suddenly may cause the jar to crack or alter the flavor of the finished product.
Rhubarb butter will stay fresh in the refrigerator for 6-8 weeks, and a year or longer when frozen.
Freeze unused rhubarb butter and thaw it out whenever you want to use it as a topping or ingredient., Fill a canning bath or stockpot with enough water to hold multiple cans. Let it heat up gradually until it just comes to a boil. Look for small, consistent bubbling rather than deep swells from the center of the pot. This will indicate that the water is the right temperature.If you don’t plan on using all of your rhubarb butter right away, or you’re preparing a large batch to freeze and store, canning will be the most useful solution.
Use a separate pot from the one you used to cook the butter, and make sure it’s clean.

, After you’ve finished cooking the rhubarb butter, pour it into an 8 oz. wide-mouthed jar. This should be done while the butter is still warm, prior to any chilling or refrigeration.The recipe outlined here will produce about 1 cup of rhubarb butter, which will be just enough to fill an 8 oz. jar.
Leave the lid off of the jar for a minute or two to let most of the steam escape.

, Fit the lid onto the rim of the jar and press it firmly into place. Then, set the ring down over the top of the jar, twisting it until it’s secure. Once it’s heated in the water bath for a few minutes, the increased pressure will cause the lid to seal, preserving the fresh rhubarb butter.It’s important to ensure that the jar is tightly closed in order for it to seal properly.
Poorly enclosed jars run the risk of breaking or filling with water.

, Carefully lower each jar into the boiling water, making sure that there’s enough water to completely submerge them. Set a timer for 10 minutes. You should be able to hear a faint audible popping sound as the jars seal. Carefully remove the jars using a jar lifter or metal tongs and let them rest before storing them in a cool, dry place.Canning will preserve both the flavor and the texture, making it a superior alternative to freezing.
After the jars are sealed, the rhubarb butter will stay good for months or even years.

Serve the honey butter in a small decorative bowl.,
Present honey butter with your favorite bread or rolls.",How to Make Honey Butter1," Since honey butter is made with so few ingredients, make sure each one is fresh and of fine quality. You might be able to find local honey at a farmer's market. Taste the honey before you decide to use it to make honey butter, since its strong flavor will dominate the spread.


Raw honey is a fine alternative to pasteurized honey. It has a deep, earthy taste and is often grainier in texture.
Choose either salted or unsalted butter. If you decide to use salted butter, you can leave out the salt when you're mixing the honey and butter.;
, Remove the butter from the refrigerator and set it out about an hour before you plan to mix up the honey butter. This will give it time to soften and become easier to work with.


Don't use melted butter to make honey butter. Be sure the butter is still stiff enough that it's spreadable. If it melts, it could separate, leaving you with a strangely-textured final spread.
To quickly bring butter to room temperature, set it in a warm, sunny window. You can also place it on the stove while something is baking in the oven - perhaps a batch of biscuits you plan to slather with honey butter.

Eat pecan butter with a spoon.",How to Make Pecan Butter," It's best to purchase raw pecans that do not have any salt added to them. This will allow you to roast them yourself, which will taste better, and to control the amount of salt added to your pecan butter.;
, You will need a small baking sheet or roasting pan, a food processor, a spatula, and a jar with a lid to store the pecan butter in.

, While you could make your pecan butter without any ingredients other than pecans, it improves the flavor to add just a few. To bring out the flavor of the pecans you will need a bit of salt and cinnamon. You can also add some sugar if you choose.

, Toasting brings out the flavors and oils of the pecans is a very nice way. The pecan butter you make with toasted pecans will be much more flavorful than pecan butter made with raw pecans.


If toasting in the oven, preheat your oven to 300 degrees. Put the pecans on a small baking sheet or in a small roasting pan and bake for 5 to 10 minutes. Be sure to keep a close eye on the pecans. They can go from toasted to burnt in a matter of seconds, so if you begin to smell them, take them out of the oven.
If toasting in a pan on the stove, simply toast in a dry pan over medium heat until slightly toasted. Be sure to move the pecans around in the pan often.
Let the pecans cool before moving on to the next step.

, Pause every few seconds to scrape down the sides with a spatula. This will assure that your pecan butter is a uniform consistency.


It will be crumbly at first but will eventually turn into a creamy paste.
If you like a chunky nut butter, simply stop blending before the butter gets totally creamy.

, You can also add a 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract if you like.Blend the butter again briefly to work the seasonings into it.


Taste the butter after you have blended the seasonings in. Make any adjustments to the nut butter you feel it needs, whether it's more cinnamon or a touch more salt. If you added too much salt or cinnamon, you can simply add more roasted pecans to the food processor and blend again.

, Pecan butter does not need sugar to be delicious but it is a matter of taste.


If you are used to the major brands of peanut butter, which contain a large amount of sugar, then adding a touch of sugar to your pecan butter may make it more enjoyable to you.
If you would like your pecan butter to be a little sweet but would like to avoid a lot of sugar, try adding a tablespoon of honey. It will sweeten up the butter but is better for your health.
If you add sweetener, don't forget to briefly blend again to incorporate it into the pecan butter.

, Your pecan butter should last like this for weeks, if you can resist eating it all before then.

, Spice up your usual PB&J by substituting pecan butter for the peanut butter. The taste will be a little bit different but delightfully tasty.

, Make your usual smoothie but add a dollop of pecan butter to the blender. It will give your smoothie a kick of flavor and a kick of protein to boot.

, Use your traditional peanut butter cookie recipe, but substitute pecan butter for the peanut butter. You will get a cookie with a stronger, and more delicious, nut flavor.


Because the pecan butter you made has little to no sugar in it, you may need to up the sugar in the recipe a bit to get the sweetness you expect from this cookie.

, If you need a quick and delicious snack just pick up a spoon and grab a spoonful of pecan butter. It's rich, creamy, and delicious, as well as being packed with protein and other nutrients that will help you get through your day."

Pour the Irish cream into a large clean jar.,
Pour the Irish cream into a mixer.,
Store the butter in the refrigerator or freezer.

",How to Make Irish Butter,"


Shake the cream until it reaches an oatmeal consistency state. This can take a while, approximately 15 to 20 minutes. The idea is to agitate the cream so the fat globules destabilize, creating fat clumps.
Strain the semi solid Irish cream through cheesecloth to separate the butterfat liquid from the whey, the currently clumpy cream.
Use the buttermilk for cooking, baking or drinking.
Knead the whey, which should now have a light yellow color. This will further thicken the whey to transform it into butter and release more water. As you knead it, the yellow color will become brighter.
Add salt to taste as you are kneading the butter, if you wish for salted Irish butter. Other ingredients can be added here as well such as garlic and herbs.
The Irish butter is done when it is soft and smooth and not releasing any more water.;
,


Start the mixer on slow. As the cream thickens, change the speed of the mixer to medium.
Up the speed to medium high as the cream begins to resemble thick strings when you lift the whisk. The Irish cream will become whipped cream with soft peaks.
Continue mixing on medium high and the whipped cream will thicken. As it mixes, the Irish cream will get crumbly and have a light yellow color.
Continue mixing to create Irish butter. Clumps of butter will form while separating from the liquid, or buttermilk.
Set the mixer to low speed.
Drain the buttermilk as it collects in the mixing bowl and use it for cooking, baking or drinking.
Continue mixing after draining the buttermilk to help release more water.
Knead the Irish butter until it is smooth and soft. This will also help release any extra liquid.
Add salt if desired or other ingredients such as garlic and herbs. Mix well.

Brush the pumpkins with oil and place facedown on a parchment paper lined baking sheet. Roast for 45-50 minutes at 350F. They are done when the skin is slightly darker and wrinkled and you can easily poke it with a fork. Let them cool, then remove the skin.Make sure you get sugar pumpkins, which are smaller at about 2-3 pounds and sweeter, and not larger carving pumpkins.

, Place the pumpkin and apple juice in a blender to puree. Blend until the pumpkin flesh is very smooth.


You can use apple cider instead of juice if you prefer.

, After the pumpkin is completely pureed, add the brown sugar, maple syrup, and spices. Blend well.


You can also add whiskey if you want. Try adding nuts and apple slices to the butter. You can increase, decrease, or substitute other spices, such as ginger and allspice.

, Spoon the puree into a medium saucepan. Cover and prop the lid open with a wooden spoon. Boil over a medium-high heat., Reduce the heat to low and let it simmer for about 15-20 minutes.


Change the cook time depending on the thickness you want.

Make your own yoghurt (optional).,
Prepare a draining container.,
Refrigerate for 12–48 hours.,
Store the cheese.",How to Make Cheese at Home1," You may skip this step and start with store-bought yogurt for an even easier recipe. But if you'd like a recipe that involves fermentation, you can make an extra-thick ""yoghurt cheese"" from scratch. To do this, add the following steps to the recipe:


Heat 1 quart (1 liter) milk to exactly 110ºF (43ºC) with the help of a cooking thermometer. Avoid UHT or ultra-pastuerized milk for best results.
Stir in one packet of yoghurt starter culture, available from cooking supply stores and online cheese-making stores. Alternatively, use 2 tbsp (30mL) plain yoghurt with live active cultures.
Instead of draining in the refrigerator as described below, let drain in a yoghurt maker for 12–16 hours. This keeps the yoghurt around 100ºF (38ºC), encouraging bacterial fermentation.;
, Line a colander with at least four layers of cheesecloth, and place the colander over a large saucepan. Spoon as much yoghurt as you like onto the cloth.









You can tie the yoghurt up in the cheesecloth and hang it over a pot instead.

, The liquids in the yoghurt will drain away until you get a soft, cream-cheese like consistency. The longer you let the yoghurt drain, the thicker and more complex the cheese will be.








Optionally, you can occasionally smooth out the ""cheese"" with a spoon for a creamier texture.
Letting it drain at room temperature will speed up the process, but risks introducing harmful bacteria.

, Once the yoghurt is done draining, transfer it to a ramekin or bowl, using another clean cloth underneath. Cheesecloth will leave a beautiful printed pattern on the cheese, but you may use anything you like. Eat before it spoils, usually within a week or so.









Optionally, stir in salt and herbs for a cracker topping, or sugar for a light dessert.
You may discard the whey or use it as a substitute for milk in baking.

Gather your ingredients.,
Pour a quart of raw milk into a pot and bring it to a boil.,
Add two tablespoons of yogurt starter.,
Pour the raw milk into a large mason jar.,
Place the jar(s) in a cooler and fill with hot water.,
Let the yogurt sit overnight.,
Place cheese cloth over a large container.,
Spoon the yogurt into the cheese cloth.,
Cover the container and place it in the refrigerator.,
Drain whey from the container as needed.,
Season as desired.",How to Make Cheese from Raw Milk," If you have some raw milk and you want to turn it into some farm cheese, then it is a pretty simple process. However, you will need some special ingredients and materials to make cheese from raw milk. You will need:raw milk
yogurt starter or plain store bought yogurt
a large pot
a heat proof whisk
a large mason jar or multiple smaller jars
a cooler or crock pot
water
a spoon
plastic containers or more jars for draining
cheese cloth
rubber bands
herbs, spices, and other seasonings of your choice;
, Stir the milk constantly with a whisk as it warms up. Watch the milk closely to ensure that it will not boil over.








If you have a food thermometer, then turn off the heat when the milk reaches 110 degrees Fahrenheit.You can use more or less milk if you want, just make sure that you add an equivalent amount of yogurt starter.

, You can use two tablespoons of plain store bought yogurt starter or use a special yogurt starter product. Whisk the yogurt starter into the warm milk.








If you notice that any foam has started to form on the top of the milk, then skim it off with a spoon., You can also use several small jars if you do not have one big one. After you pour the yogurt into the mason jar, cover it and make sure that the lid is tight.







, Place the jar of yogurt into a cooler and pour enough hot water into the cooler to nearly cover the jar. Then, close the lid of the cooler.








You can also place the jars in the center of a crock pot and pour hot water into the crock pot.You can also cover the cooler or crock pot with a towel to help insulate the yogurt.

, The yogurt will need to sit for at least six hours, so you may want to leave it overnight. In the morning, the raw milk will have transformed into yogurt.Place the yogurt into your refrigerator to chill for about one hour or until you are ready to start turning it into cheese.







, Any large container with a lid will do, such as another large mason jar or a plastic container with a tight fitting lid. Place the cheese cloth over the opening of the container and then use a rubber band to hold the cheese cloth in place.








Make sure that the cheese cloth dips down into the container enough for the yogurt to drain, but not so low that the yogurt will be touching the whey that is drained from the yogurt.
If you have a lot of yogurt to turn into cheese, then you may need to have multiple containers and cheese cloths.

, Fill the cheese cloth about ¾ of the way with the yogurt. Make sure that there is an inch or two of space below the cheese cloth to allow the yogurt to drain.








You may need to tap the bottom of the container against your counter to distribute the yogurt evenly in the cheese cloth.

, Next, secure the lid on your container and place the container in the refrigerator. The yogurt will need to drain for at least a couple of days, but you may leave it to drain for up to two weeks.








The longer you wait, the denser the cheese will become.
There may be some excess cheese cloth hanging over the edges of your container. You can tie the excess cheese cloth on top of the lid or use another rubber band to secure it.

, As you wait for the cheese to form, you will need to drain the whey from the container as it collects. Check the container once or twice per day and pour out any excess whey that has collected in the bottom of the container.








To drain the whey, open the container and then remove the rubber band holding the cheese cloth in place.
Then, use the cheese cloth to pick up the cheese and pour the whey out of the container as you do so.
Then, replace the cheese cloth, secure it in place with the rubber band again, replace the lid, and return it to the refrigerator.

, After you have drained your cheese to the desired consistency, you can enjoy it as is or you can add some seasonings.For example, you could add salt, fresh ground black pepper, garlic powder, fresh basil, dried thyme, or any other combination of herbs and spices that you would like to add.


Try serving your homemade cheese with some freshly baked bread, crackers, or in an omelet.
Store your raw milk farmer cheese in the refrigerator for up to two weeks.

Pour whole milk into a saucepan.,
Stir acid into the milk.,
Heat the acidified milk.,
Drain out the whey.,
Eat or refrigerate.",How to Make Cheese at Home2," You must use whole milk for this recipe. Non-homogenized milk gives the most flavor, but homogenized milk will work. Do not use milk labeled ultra-pasteurized or UHT.








, Stir in the acidic ingredient while you test the milk with a waterproof pH meter. Continue to the next step once the pH reaches 5.9–6.0.Lemon juice adds a tangy citrus flavor. Fresh lemon juice has better, cleaner flavor than bottled juice.
Distilled vinegar is more precisely controlled, giving you predictable results each time you follow the recipe.
Baker's citric acid adds less flavor than either of the other options, which some people prefer. Look for it at a grocery store or baking supply store.

, Slowly heat the acidified milk to 176–185ºF (80–85°C), while stirring constantly. It is very important to constantly stir the milk or it will burn. Keep it at this temperature for 15–30 minutes.Stop stirring once the milk separates into solid curds and liquid whey. Take care not to break the curds into smaller pieces.









An infrared thermometer is a reliable way to measure the milk temperature.

, Spoon the curds onto a thick, fine cheesecloth or muslin handkerchief. Squeeze the cloth around the curds to get most of the moisture out.









You can use a draining spoon if you don't have cheesecloth, but you'll lose some of the curds.
Optionally, you can rinse the curds in clean water for a more mild-flavored cheese.

, Let drain for five minutes for a ""cream cheese"" consistency, 15–20 minutes for a moist spread, and 2–8 hours in the refrigerator for a relatively firm cheese.Refrigerate all leftovers in a close container and eat before it goes sour, usually within 2–4 days.









To reduce the risk of harmful bacteria, do not leave the ricotta at room temperature for longer than 20 minutes.
Stir in salt for significantly more flavor and a slightly longer shelf life.

Purchase cheese-making cultures.,
Buy rennet.,
Heat the milk in a non-reactive pan.,
Add the bacterial culture.,
Cover and let sit.,
Warm the milk and add the rennet.,
Cover and let sit for 4-12 hours.,
Drain some of the whey.,
Cut into cubes and heat.,
Finish the cheese.,
Learn about other cheese recipes.",How to Make Cheese at Home3," You might find these in a grocery store, but more likely you'll have to order it online from a cheese-making supply store. For this recipe and most other cheeses, use any mesophilic culture. These bacteria thrive in temperatures below 102ºF (39ºC).Their job is to acidify the milk and get it ready for the rennet. These ""good"" bacteria also make it more difficult for harmful bacteria to take hold in the milk.


As a last resort, you can use a dash of buttermilk instead. However, store-bought buttermilk is an unpredictable source of cultures. The cheese could fail to form, or the flavor could be affected., Traditionally taken from animal stomachs, rennet is now available in vegetarian forms as well. You may use any type to form your cheese. The rennet will separate the acidified milk into curds and whey.


This is also available from cheese-making supply stores.
If using dry rennet, follow the label instructions to convert drops of liquid rennet into tablet amounts. Make sure the tablets are 100% rennet.

, Use an infrared thermometer to measure the milk, heating until it reaches 86ºF (30ºC). Non-chipped enameled pans or stainless pans are your best options. Stay way from copper and aluminum, which leach chemicals into your cheese due to the cheese's acidity.


You may use raw milk or pasteurized milk, although cheese made from pasteurized milk may have trouble holding together. Ultra-pasteurized milk will not work.
You can use milk with any fat percentage. Whole milk typically has a richer flavor than low-fat or skim milk.

, Let sit for two minutes. After two minutes, stir with an up and down motion to mix it into the milk.

, Leave the milk in a warm room away from light. The label on your starter bacteria may specify the length of this step. If it does not, or if you are using buttermilk, continue after two to four hours.The milk should still look like ordinary milk. If it thickens, you've used too much acid or left it too long. (This is easy to do, since it's difficult to predict exactly how active the bacteria will be.) You can still use it to make cheese, but it may have trouble staying together.

, Heat the milk up again to 86ºF (30ºC). Dilute liquid rennet in ¼ cup (60 mL) cold water, or dissolve dry rennet in cold water according to label instructions. Stir just as you did with the culture, in an up and down motion.


Filtered water is less likely to interfere with the cheese-making., Leave it at room temperature, and completely undisturbed. You're ready to continue once the cheese has formed a thick, custard-like curd. Ideally, a clean finger poked into the cheese should come out clean, and a clear, liquid whey should fill the hole. If it sticks to your finger, cover and try again in 30–60 minutes.


If it's still not set after 12 hours, continue anyway. Your cheese may have trouble draining, ending up soft and wet.

, Cover a colander with butter muslin cheesecloth. Place the colander over a pot to catch the draining whey. Spoon the solid curd into the colander. Stir gently with long, slow movements for about fifteen minutes, to allow excess whey to escape.


Fabric sold as cheesecloth is not always fine or thick enough to drain this cheese. You can experiment with other options, but butter muslin is your best bet.

, Gently cut the curd into roughly equal cubes, without squashing it. Place these cubes in a double boiler (a raised pan inside a pan of hot water). Heat over very low heat, stirring frequently, until the curds reach about 100ºF (38ºC). This may take a full hour.Don't stop heating until most of the liquid is gone. The curds should hold their shape, but fall apart in your hand when you pick them up., When you are happy with the consistency, stir in the salt to halt the acidification and preserve the cheese. Optionally, you can shape the cheese, and/or mix in herbs, fruit, or nuts. You can eat it soft, or allow it to dry a little if you prefer.


Store the cheese in the refrigerator or another dark, cool location.

, You can create hundreds of different cheeses by using different bacterial cultures, rinsing the curd, draining more or less whey, aging the cheese, and other variations. Try your hand at mozzarella and cheddar, or talk to dairy farmers in your area to learn more.

When the milk reaches the desired temperature, add either 1 packet of direct set mesophilic culture or 1/8 t. bulk mesophilic culture to the milk, stir the culture and milk together, and cover it, allowing it to ferment for 1 hour. Stir the ingredients to homogenize the milk., Add ¼ tablet vegetable rennet dissolved in ½ cup cool water to the mixture. Stir up and down to ensure that the rennet and milk combine thoroughly to make the most cheese. Let the cheese set for 1 hour, or until the whey starts to separate from the curd. There should be a layer of mostly-clear whey that floats to the top of the crud as the curd pulls away from the sides of the pot., Use a knife to cut the curds into 1/4-inch cubes. Allow the cubes to set for 5 minutes to solidify their shape. Do not stir the curd., Slowly heat the curds to 29.5°C (100°F) over the course of 30 minutes. Stir the curds frequently. They will shrink as you stir them. Once they reach the desired temperature, maintain the temperature and keep stirring the curds for another 30 minutes. Then, stop stirring and let the curds settle to the bottom of the pot, which should take about 20 minutes., Return the colander and curds to the cheese pot and let it drain for 15 minutes. Then, take the colander out of the pot and turn the curds out on a cutting board. This should have made gelatinous mass. Pour the whey out of the pot and cut the mass into five slices. Then, return it to the pot and cover the pot., Keep their temperature at around 29.5°C (100°F) and turn the slices every 15 minutes for the next 2 hours. This is the cheddaring process that will make the cheese distinct from other cheeses. After this time elapses, the curds should be shiny and firm. Remove the curds from the pot and cut them into 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) cubes., Cover them and place the pot in the sink filled with hot water. Let them sit there for ten minutes and then stir the curds gently with a wooden spoon. Repeat this process two more times.

Then, store the starter at 25-30°C (77-86°F) until it thickens for 12-24 hours. You need to do this before you make the Gouda cheese., To prepare the milk, heat it to 32°C (90°F) and add the calcium chloride solution. This solution is made up of 2 ml. of calcium chloride dissolved in 1/4 cup of cool water (only add the cool water if you're using homogenized milk.) Then, add the prepared starter to the ingredients. Cover the ingredients and allow them to ripen for 10 minutes., of cooled boiled water. The Annatto will give the Gouda cheese its yellow coloring., Stir the Annatto through the milk until the color is consistent., Cover it and allow it to set for 60 minutes or until you get a clean break. To test for a clean break, slide your knife into the curd at an angle and lift some curd on the side of the blade. If the curd breaks cleanly around the knife and the whey runs into the crack that you've made, then the curds are ready to cut and you've made a clean break., To cut the curds, use a long knife to cut vertically across the curd one way, and then cut it again perpendicularly to the first cuts. Insert your knife at an angle to make horizontal cuts. Cut these curds into 13 mm. cubes. Let the cubes stand for 10 minutes to set., You should drain off about 1/3 of the whey to drain it to the level of the curds. To do this, stir continuously while adding just enough 80°C water to raise the temperature of the curds to 34°C. After you've done this, allow the curds to settle for 10 more minutes., To do this, stir continuously while adding just enough 80°C water to raise the temperature of the curds to 34°C (93°F). Keep this temperature steady for 15 minutes and continue to stir. Let the curds set for 30 minutes. Then, pour off the remaining whey.,, Quickly place them in the basket, taking care to break them as little as possible. Press the cheese at 9 kg. for 20 minutes., To do this, take the cheese out of the basket, carefully peeling away the cheesecloth. Turn the cheese over, dress it again, and press it with 18 kg. for 20 minutes., Repeat the process, pressing the cheese with 22 kg. for 12-16 hours this time., To brine the cheese, you must first make a brine solution, which should consist of 300 g. of salt and 800 m. of water. Remove the pressed cheese from the basket, peel away the cheesecloth, and soak it in brine for 12 hours in the fridge., To air dry the cheese, simply remove the cheese from the brine and pat it dry. Air-dry it for 3 weeks at 10°C (50°F) to complete the process., Melt the cheese wax using a waxing brush, and coat the cheese thoroughly., Age the cheese at 10°C (50°F) for 3-4 months, turning it 3-4 times a week., When the cheese is ready, enjoy it on its own, or with a tasty met or bread."

Fill a small bowl with ½ cup (118 ml) of warm water and place it in the center of your workspace.The water should be 110°F (43°C) so it’s warm enough to activate the yeast.;
, After you’ve filled the bowl with warm water, sprinkle 1 package (¼ oz./7 g) of active dry yeast and a pinch of granulated sugar over it. Stir the mixture well to help the yeast dissolve.If you have a larger container of active dry yeast, you’ll need 2 ½ teaspoons (7g).

, Once you’ve stirred the yeast mixture together, allow it to stand for about 10 minutes. You’ll know that it’s ready to mix into the dough when it starts to foam., Add ½ cup (113 g) of melted, unsalted butter,¼ cup (50 g) of sugar, 1 ½ teaspoons (9 g) of salt, 2 teaspoons (10 ml) of vanilla extract, ¾ cup (177 ml) of lukewarm milk, 3 eggs, and 1 cup (125 g) of all-purpose flour to a large bowl. Stir the mixture together until it is completely blended.The milk should be between 98 and 105°F (37 and 41°C).
If you prefer, you can replace the eggs with egg substitute.

, Once the other ingredients are combined, pour the yeast mixture into the bowl. Mix well until it is fully blended in., After you’ve stirred the yeast mixture into the dough, gradually begin to mix in the remaining 3 cups (375 g) of flour. Work in a little at a time, stirring well until the flour is fully incorporated before adding any more. Continue mixing until a sticky dough forms.You can use an electric mixer or stand mixer to mix up the dough if you are having trouble stirring it by hand.

, When your dough has come together, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface. Use clean hands to knead it for approximately 10 minutes, or until it becomes smooth and elastic.If you prefer, you can knead the dough in a stand mixer with the dough hook attachment in place.

, After you’ve kneaded the dough until it’s smooth, set it in a bowl that’s been lightly greased with butter. Turn the dough over once so it’s coated with butter on both sides, and cover the dough with plastic wrap.It helps to work the dough into a round or ball shape before you add it the bowl.
The dough will expand so make sure that the bowl that you place it in is large enough for it to double in size.

, Once you’ve covered the bowl, place it in a warm area and let it rise at room temperature until it’s doubled in size. It should take approximately 1 to 2 hours., To make the cheese filling for the babka, add 1 ½ cups (640 g) of softened cream cheese, ⅓ cup (66 g) of sugar, 1 ½ tablespoons (22 g) of sour cream, 1 egg, 1 teaspoon (5 ml) of vanilla extract, and ½ teaspoon (2 g) lemon zest to a large bowl. Use an electric mixer on medium speed to beat the ingredients together until they’re smooth.You can substitute farmers cheese for the cream cheese if you prefer.

, After the dough has doubled in size, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface. Use a rolling pin to roll it out into a 20-inch by 16-inch (51-cm by 41-cm)rectangle, with the long side facing you.If you don’t have a rolling pin, you can use a heavy cylindrical object, such as a wine bottle, thermos, or jar, to roll out the dough.

, When the dough is rolled out into a rectangle, take 2 tablespoons (28 g) of melted butter and brush it over the dough with a pastry brush. Make sure to cover the entire surface of the dough with the butter.If you don’t have a pastry brush, you can use a piece of parchment or wax paper folded into a strip to apply the melted butter to the dough.

, After you’ve covered the dough rectangle with the melted butter, spread the cheese filling over it as well. Use a spatula to carefully cover the entire surface of the dough., To bake the babka, you’ll need a bundt pan. Lightly grease the interior of the pan with butter to ensure that the babka won’t stick after baking.You can use nonstick cooking spray to grease the bundt pan if you prefer.
You can also use loaf pans for the babka; you may need to cut the dough in half and place it in two separate pans, though.

, When the babka dough is covered with the cheese filling, begin rolling it up like a jelly roll, starting with the long end. Once it’s tightly rolled, twist it 6 to 8 times to form a rope.Twisting the dough is optional, though it gives the babka a more decorative look.

, After you’ve rolled and twisted the babka, use your fingers to pinch the ends together and seal them. Next, place the dough in the greased bundt pan so it forms a circle., Once the babka dough is arranged in the pan, cover it loosely with plastic wrap. Let it rise until it nearly doubles in size again, which should take approximately 1 hour.It helps to place the dough in a warm spot when you’re waiting for it to rise.

, To ensure that the oven is hot enough to bake the babka, you must preheat it. When the babka is nearly finished rising, set the temperature to 350°F (177°C), and allow it to fully preheat., When the oven is preheated, place the pan inside. Let the babka bake until it is a deep golden brown, which should take approximately 40 to 50 minutes.You can test the babka’s doneness by inserting a cake tester or toothpick in the center; it will emerge clean if the babka is finished baking.

, Once the babka is finished baking, remove it from the oven. Allow it to cool in the pan for minutes without trying to remove it., After the babka has cooled in the pan for a few minutes, carefully turn it out onto a wire cooling rack. Allow it to cool completely for at least 2 hours before cutting it into slices and serving it.Store any leftover babka in an airtight container in the refrigerator. It should stay fresh for 3 to 5 days. Allow it to sit out at room temperature for 15 to 20 minutes or heat it up briefly before eating the leftovers.

Increase the pressure and continue pressing.,
Increase the pressure once more and continue pressing.,
Let the cheese air dry.,
Wax your cheddar cheese.Cheese wax prevents hard cheeses, like cheddar, from drying out and growing mold as they age.,
Let the cheese age in your refrigerator.",How to Make Cheddar Cheese," Pour the milk into your stockpot and heat it over medium heat until it reaches an even temperature of 90 degrees Fahrenheit (32.2 degrees Celsius).You can use either cow's milk or goat's milk, but either way, it should be raw.
The temperature can be as low as 85 degrees Fahrenheit (29.4 degrees Celsius) when you begin. Check the temperature with an instant-read food thermometer.;
, Sprinkle the culture over the surface of the milk and whisk it in, making sure that it is thoroughly combined and dissolved.

Let the cultured milk ripen for 1 hour.
Note that you could also use 1 packet of direct-set mesophilic culture instead of bulk mesophilic culture.

, Slowly pour the diluted rennet into the milk, whisking continuously as you add it and for at least 5 minutes after all the rennet has been added.

Let the milk set for 1 to 2 hours. A curd should develop in this time, and it should be firm enough for you to cut cleanly with a knife.
If you do not want to use liquid animal rennet, you could use 1/4 tsp (1.25 ml) double-strength liquid vegetable rennet dissolved in 1/2 cup (125 ml) water or 1/4 tablet vegetable rennet dissolved in 1/2 cup (125 ml) water.

, Use a long knife to cut the curds into 1/4-inch (6.5-mm) cubes. The cubes do not have to be perfectly even, but they should be approximately the same size.

Let the curds sit for an additional 15 minutes, or until they get a little firmer.

, Gradually raise the temperature of the milk until it reaches 100 to 102 degrees Fahrenheit (37.8 to 38.8 degrees Celsius). Stir the curds with a long-handled spoon every few minutes to prevent them from matting or clumping.

It will usually take about 30 to 45 minutes for the curds to reach this temperature.
After the curds reach your desired temperature, let them continue to cook for another 30 to 45 minutes. Again, stir gently every few minutes to prevent matting.
Remove the curds from the heat if they get too hot.
During this time, the curds will begin to shrink considerably.

, Place the colander in a large, clean sink or basin and line it with enough cheesecloth to cover the sides completely.

Meanwhile, let the curds settle to the bottom of the pot for about 20 minutes.

, Pour the contents of the pot through your cheesecloth-lined colander. Rest the colander over a clean sink, basin, or the empty stockpot.

Drain for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally to prevent the curds from becoming too clumpy or matted.

,

When you turn the curds out onto your cutting board, they should be semi-solid. The texture will resemble that of jelly or gelatin.
Return the sliced curds to the dried, empty stockpot. Cover well with the lid or with aluminum foil.

, The water should be about 102 degrees Fahrenheit (38.8 degrees Celsius).

Make sure that the basin or sink is at least as deep as your stockpot, and fill it 1/2 to 2/3 full so that the part of the stockpot where the cheese rests will be completely submerged.

, Place the stockpot in the basin, making sure that the water does not reach the lid or seep into the pot itself.

The curds need to be kept at a consistent temperature of 100 degrees Fahrenheit (37.8 degrees Celsius) for 2 hours. Refresh the water, if needed, to keep the contents of the stockpot hot.
Turn the slices of cheese curd every 15 minutes.
This process is known as ""cheddaring,"" and it is thanks to this process that cheddar cheese has its trademark flavor.

, Once the 2 hours pass, the curds should be very firm and have a slight shine to them. Remove them and cut the slices into 1/2-inch (1.25-cm) cubes.

Place the curds back in the stockpot once cubed.

, Cover the stockpot and return it to the hot water. Let it sit in the hot water for another 30 minutes.

Make sure that the water is still 102 degrees Fahrenheit (38.8 degrees Celsius).
Stir the cheese curds with your fingers every 10 minutes during this stage.

, Remove the pot from the hot water and add the salt. Stir it in gently using your hands.

The salt should completely coat the curds.

, Place a clean piece of cheesecloth over the bottom of the cylinder compartment. The cheesecloth should be large enough to extend up to the top of the cylinder basin.

A home cheese press is all you need for this. These presses usually consist of a round cylinder, in which you will put the cheese, with guide rods on both sides. There should also be a pressure arm that allows you to change the amount of pressure applied to the cheese.
Cheese presses are needed for the creation of hard cheeses, including cheddar cheese.

, Place the curds in the bottom of the cheese press and wrap them up with the cheesecloth.

Crank the pressure arm until the gauge indicates that you are applying 10 lbs (4.5 kg) of pressure. Let the cheese sit in the cheese press for 15 minutes at this pressure.

, Increase the pressure to 40 lbs (18 kg) and press for 12 hours.

Flip the cheese over and change the cheesecloth to a fresh piece before continuing to press the cheese.

, Bump up the pressure to 50 lbs (22.5 kg) and press for an additional 24 hours.

Flip the cheese over and change the cheesecloth to a fresh piece before continuing to press the cheese.

, Remove the cheese from the cheese press after the 24 hours pass. Place it on a cheese board and let it dry for 2 to 5 days.

The cheese should dry at room temperature. Keep it in a fairly light, dry location and away from excess humidity or moisture.
The exact amount of time it takes to dry the cheese will vary depending on how humid the air is.
When ready, the cheese should be dry to the touch. It should have also developed a protective rind.

,

Prepare the cheese for waxing by wiping the surface with a small piece of cheesecloth dipped in white vinegar. This will get rid of any visible or unseen mold. Chill the cheese in your refrigerator for a few hours before you apply the wax.
Remove a 4-inch by 4-inch (10-cm by 10-cm) piece of cheese wax.
Place the cheese wax in the top part of a double boiler and fill the bottom with water. Heat it over medium heat until it melts and reaches about 210 degrees Fahrenheit (98.9 degrees Celsius).
Dip a natural bristle brush into the melted wax and coat the wheel of cheese with the wax, working with one surface at a time. Let the wax on one surface cool before waxing another surface.
You should apply at least two coats of wax over the entire surface. Let dry completely.

, Place the cheese in your refrigerator and store it there for at least 60 days before enjoying.

The cheese should ideally sit at a temperature between 55 and 60 degrees Fahrenheit (12.8 to 15.6 degrees Celsius).
If you prefer a sharper flavor, age the cheese for 3 to 24 months. The longer you age the cheese within this time frame, the sharper the flavor will be.
Ages and flavors:

Mild: 3-4 months
Sharp 4-12 months
Extra Sharp 2 years
Older cheeses are just referred to by age

Gather your ingredients.,
Melt 4 tablespoons of butter.,
Whisk in 4 tablespoons of flour.,
Add 3 cups of milk.,
Add 1 teaspoon spices.,
Remove the sauce from the heat.,
Stir in the shredded cheese.,
Serve immediately.,
Store any leftover sauce in an airtight container in the refrigerator.",How to Make a Simple Cheese Sauce1," The quality of your ingredients can affect the quality of your cheese sauce. Start with a sharp cheddar cheese, shredded or in a block. If the cheese comes in a block, use a grater to make 2 cups of shredded cheese.You can substitute cheddar cheese with other cheeses such as Gouda, or Swiss cheese.
To spice up the basic sauce, add salsa, hot sauce, beer, or wine for a little extra flavor.;
, In a saucepan over medium heat, slowly heat the butter for your cheese sauce. Keep an eye on the butter as it melts. You don’t want the butter to brown or turn a dark, burnt color, as this will change the flavor of your sauce., Slowly add the flour to the butter, blending evenly with a whisk. Then, add flour and mix until flour is completely blended with butter.Allow the mixture to cook for several minutes, until it just begins to change color slightly. Be careful not to burn the mixture, as it will make your cheese sauce taste burnt.

, Slowly pour in the milk, stirring constantly until the mixture gets thick.Try to avoid lumps in the mixture. Pouring the milk slowly and stirring constantly will help you avoid lumps.

, Add 1 teaspoon salt, pepper, cayenne pepper, or other spices such as dried rosemary or thyme. Get creative and amp up the flavor of your cheese sauce. Start with 1 teaspoon of your chosen spice. You can adjust the sauce to taste once you add in the cheese.Use caution when adding salt. Too much salt is difficult to remove, and many cheeses have a high salt content already. The sauce may also have salt in it already if you used salted butter.

, Removing the sauce from the heat before you add the shredded cheese will prevent the sauce from separating or curdling., Add the shredded cheese one handful at a time. Stir the sauce with a spoon and allow the cheese to melt each time before adding more cheese.

, The cheese sauce may harden as it cools, so serve it right away, drizzled over chips, on a baked potato, or over steamed vegetables., It should keep for up to three days.Don’t reheat leftover sauce over high heat, or reboil it. This will cause it to become stringy or separate. Reheat any leftover sauce on low heat, stirring it constantly until it is ready to serve.

Preheat the oven.,
Cut and trim the cauliflower.,
Boil the cauliflower.,
Drain and dry the cooked cauliflower.",How to Make Cauliflower Cheese1," To ensure that your oven is properly heated when the cauliflower cheese casserole is ready to bake, it’s important to preheat it. Set the temperature to 400 degrees Fahrenheit (200 degrees Celsius), and allow it to fully heat.Keep an eye on your oven so you know when it’s reached the correct temperature. Most models will sound an alert or flash a light to let you know that they’re preheated.;
, Take 1 medium head of cauliflower and cut it into quarters with a sharp knife. Trim away the tough core that’s at the center of the head from each quarter. The cauliflower will fall apart into large florets when you cut out the core -- cut them into 1- to 2-inch (2.5 to 5 cm) florets.While a knife makes cutting the large florets into small ones easier, you can often use your fingers to snap the florets into smaller pieces as well.

, Place the cut cauliflower into a medium pot and add enough water to cover the pieces. Bring the pot to a boil on medium-high to high heat, and allow it to cook for approximately 10 to 15 minutes or until the cauliflower pieces are just tender.It’s a good idea to add some salt to the water before boiling to help season the cauliflower. Mix in 1 ½ to 2 teaspoons (8.5 to 11 g) before turning on the heat.

, Once the cauliflower pieces have boiled long enough to just become tender, remove the pot from the heat. Pour the cauliflower into a colander to drain it, and then set the pieces on a towel to absorb any additional moisture as you work on the sauce."

Gather your ingredients.,
Mix ½ teaspoon sodium citrate with ½ cup liquid.,
Heat the liquid mixture.,
Add the grated cheese to the pan.,
Serve the sauce.",How to Make a Simple Cheese Sauce2," This recipe calls for sodium citrate, which is a type of salt that works as an emulsifier. This means that when it is added to cheese sauce, it reduces the cheese’s acidity, makes the proteins in the cheese more soluble, and prevents it from separating. Instead, it helps to create a smooth, creamy texture to your cheese sauce.Look in speciality food stores and online for sodium citrate. It looks like salt and tastes salty and slightly sour. You will only need a very small amount of sodium citrate in the sauce for it to do it’s job, so it is not upping the sodium level of your cheese sauce.
If you can't find sodium citrate, you can use 2 teaspoons of citric acid (or sour salt) and 2.5 teaspoons of baking sodium as a substitute. Citric acid, or sour salt, can be found in the kosher section of most grocery stores.
You should also use high-quality cheese for your fancy cheese sauce, such as Pepper Jack, Gouda, or Gruyère. These cheeses will likely come in blocks. Use a grater to make 1 cup of your chosen fancy cheese.

, In a medium saucepan, mix together the sodium citrate and the water, beer, or wine.There should be enough liquid mixture to just cover the bottom of your saucepan; the entire ½ cup may not be necessary so pour the liquid in a little bit at a time.

, Place the medium saucepan on a medium heat and bring the liquid to a low simmer, but not a full boil. There should be small bubbles forming on the surface of the liquid.

, Add the cheese to the pan and stir with a spoon until the cheese has melted and is blended with the liquid. Thanks to the sodium citrate, the sauce should have a smooth, creamy consistency., Put your sauce in a bowl and dip chips or vegetables into it, or pour it over chips to make nachos. You can even pour it on top of steamed vegetables to make them more delicious.


The sauce should maintain its creamy texture, even as it begins to cool.
This sauce can be stored for up to a week in the refrigerator."

Gather your ingredients.,
Prepare the zucchini.,
Cook 5 small potatoes by roasting them or steaming them.,
Mash up the cooked potatoes with a fork.,
Add the cooked zucchini to the the blender.,
Blend the ingredients together until smooth.,
Taste and season the sauce.,
Add any extra toppings.",How to Make a Simple Cheese Sauce3," Sometimes people who are vegan or lactose intolerant may crave cheese sauce. While nothing really replicates the cheesy goodness of the perfect cheese sauce, a vegan cheese-style sauce may help you kick the craving. The key to making good vegan cheese sauce is using starchy vegetables like zucchini and potatoes to give the sauce a creamy texture and keep it from separating.You will need access to a high powered blender, food processor, or Vitamix to create a creamy texture for this sauce.
Nutritional yeast can be found in health food stores in the form of flakes or powder. It has a strong, savory flavor that is nutty and tangy. The deactivated yeast is a popular vegan substitute for cheese in recipes.If you are allergic to soy sauce, you can substitute it for vegan worcestershire sauce, sold at most health food and speciality food stores. It will give the sauce a similar flavor, but you will need to add more salt to make up for the saltiness that soy sauce provides.

, Preheat your oven to 415 °F (213 °C) and line a sheet pan with parchment paper. Peel all the green skin off the zucchini with a vegetable peeler. Then, slice it into ¼ inch slices and place the slices on the sheet pan.Season the slices with a dash of salt and pepper. Bake the zucchini for 15 minutes until they appear tender and soft to the touch.
Peeling the zucchini will prevent the sauce from coming out a strange green-yellow color.

, Peel the potatoes and cut them into quarters. Place the potatoes on another sheet pan and into the oven with the zucchini for about 10 minutes, until they appear soft.You can also cook the potatoes fast in the microwave for about 5 minutes, covered, until they are very soft to the touch.
Do not boil the potatoes, as they will get water-logged and make your cheese sauce runny.

, Then, use a dry measuring cup to measure out 1 cup of mashed potatoes. It’s important to measure the mashed potatoes for accurate results and a solid vegan cheese sauce.Add the 1 cup of mashed potatoes to your high speed blender, food processor, or Vitamix.

, Then, add ¼ cup nutritional yeast, ½ teaspoon garlic powder, ½ teaspoon onion powder, ½ teaspoon fine sea salt, ¾ teaspoon smoked or regular paprika, 2 teaspoons low-sodium soy sauce or vegan worcestershire sauce, and 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) fresh lemon juice to the blender.Pour in ¾ cup of water and add more if needed, stopping at 1 cup.

, You may need to stop and scrape the bottom and sides of the blender to make sure all the ingredients are combined. Do not add more than 1 cup of water until you’ve blended the sauce for several minutes on high.The sauce will seem very thick at first, but it will start to turn very smooth from all the water in the zucchini. Keep blending until the sauce gets thick and creamy.
If the sauce still seems too thick after several minutes of blending, add a very small amount of water to just blend it. If the sauce seems a bit too thin, you can add 1–2 tablespoons (14.8–29.6 ml) of mashed potatoes to thicken it up.

, You may want to add extra lemon juice, salt or other spices to bring out a stronger flavor in the sauce. If you are using the worcestershire sauce to substitute for soy sauce, you will likely need to add more salt., Sprinkle a dash of red pepper flakes, a few sliced jalapenos or a ¼ cup of chopped tomatoes to add freshness and tanginess to the sauce. This recipe makes 2 ½ cups of sauce.Drizzle the sauce over macaroni, a baked potato, or roasted vegetables for a delicious vegan meal.

Melt the butter on the stove.,
Add the flour and cook the mixture for a few minutes.,
Stir in the mustard powder and pepper.,
Whisk in the milk.,
Season the mixture with salt and bring it to a simmer.,
Mix in the cheddar cheese.",How to Make Cauliflower Cheese2," Place 4 tablespoons (55 g) of unsalted butter in a medium saucepan, and heat it on medium-high heat. Allow the butter to melt completely, which should take approximately 3 to 5 minutes.Cutting the butter into pieces can help it melt more quickly.
Keep an eye on the butter as it melts. It can burn very easily.

, When the butter is melted, mix 4 tablespoons (30 g) of all-purpose flour into the pan. Use a whisk to ensure that the butter and flour are fully combined. Lower the heat to medium and let the mixture cook for 1 to 2 minutes to help get rid of any floury taste.When you’re whisking the flour and butter together, make sure to blend until the mixture is as smooth as possible.
Continue to whisk the flour and butter mixture while it’s cooking to ensure that it doesn’t scorch.

, After you’ve cooked away the flour taste from the butter and flour mixture, add 2 teaspoons (10 g) of mustard powder and a few grinds of black pepper to taste to the pan. Stir well to combine all of the ingredients.You can swap cayenne pepper for the black pepper if you prefer. Just add 1 to 2 pinches of the cayenne depending on how much heat you want to add to the dish.

, Once you’ve seasoned the butter and flour mixture, it’s time to add the milk. In a slow, steady stream, drizzle 2 cups (475 ml) of milk into the pan. Make sure to whisk the contents of the pan as you pour to ensure that the mixture doesn’t become lumpy.Whole milk will help create the creamiest sauce for the dish, but you can use a low-fat milk if you prefer.

, After you’ve mixed the milk into the mixture, season the sauce with salt to your taste. Bring the pot to a simmer, but stir the contents the entire time with a spoon. Allow the sauce to simmer for approximately 2 minutes or until it thickens up., When the sauce has thickened, add 1 ¼ cups (125 g) of grated cheddar cheese to the pan. However, be sure to stir the cheese in a handful at a time, and allow each batch to melt fully into the sauce before adding another. That will keep the cheese sauce as smooth as possible.Once you’ve added all of the cheese, it’s a good idea to taste the sauce and see if you need to add any more pepper or salt before assembling the casserole.

Place the cauliflower in a baking dish.,
Spread the cheese sauce over the cauliflower.,
Mix the breadcrumbs and cheese together and add it to the top.,
Bake for approximately 30 minutes.,
Finished.

",How to Make Cauliflower Cheese3," Check on the cauliflower pieces to ensure that they’re dry. Next, set them in the bottom of a 2-quart (1.89 l) baking dish. Take the time to spread them out in as even a layer as possible.Make sure that your baking dish is ovenproof or it may crack when placed in the oven to bake.

, Once the cauliflower is in the bottom of the baking dish, pour the cheese sauce over the florets. While you can add the sauce directly from the pan, it usually helps to use a spoon to spread the sauce so you can be sure that all of the cauliflower is covered., To create a topping for the dish, combine 2 to 3 tablespoons (30-45 g) of breadcrumbs with 2 tablespoons (30 g) of grated cheddar cheese in a small bowl. Sprinkle the mixture over the top of the sauce-covered cauliflower in an even layer.You can customize the topping to your taste. For example, you might omit the breadcrumbs if you prefer and use only cheese.

, Place the baking dish in the preheated oven, and allow the cauliflower cheese to cook for approximately 30 minutes. You’ll know the dish is ready when the top is golden brown and the sauce is bubbling.If you want to add a garnish to the casserole, you can sprinkle chopped chives or flat-leaf parsley over the top once it comes out of the oven.

Soften the butter.,
Mince the garlic.,
Add herbs and spices.,
Beat ingredients together.,
Use immediately or store for future use.,
Freeze the garlic butter for extended shelf life.",How to Make Garlic Butter1," Let the butter sit, covered, at room temperature until it’s soft and can be easily spread with a knife. Put the softened butter into a medium-sized bowl.









For a dairy-free alternative, try margarine.
Olive or coconut oil can also be used. Coconut oil has a very strong coconut taste, and olive oil is liquid so it will not become whipped and fluffy.;
, Press the garlic through a garlic press, or mince finely with a knife. Add the garlic to the butter.









Garlic powder can be used instead of fresh garlic. Substitute one to two teaspoons of garlic powder.

, Add salt, pepper, and Italian seasoning. You can substitute the seasoning with fresh herbs, but they will give the butter a different flavor than the dried herbs.









Rosemary, parsley, and thyme all go well with butter. Basil or sage could also be used.
For an extra decadent garlic butter with some zing, add one-quarter cup of Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese.
To add heat, add chili flakes or powder.

, Use a whisk or electric beaters to combine all the ingredients. This will help incorporate air into the mixture and make it light, fluffy, and whipped.








, Spreadable garlic butter can be used right away, or it can be covered and refrigerated for later use, though it will be harder to spread when it’s cold.









While butter can safely be stored on the counter, unused garlic butter should be refrigerated. Garlic-in-oil is best used immediately, but unused portions must be refrigerated, and should be used within a week to prevent botulism.Garlic butter can be spread on bread, toast, corn on the cob, burgers, or anything else.
Substitute garlic butter for any savory recipe that calls for plain butter to add some extra zip, such as scones or biscuits, cream sauces, or to cooked vegetables.

, Put the garlic butter on wax paper and roll it into a log. Chill in the fridge until it has started to harden. With a knife, divide the butter log into disks that are one-half to one-inch thick. Once it’s frozen, these can be pulled out individually and used without thawing the whole log. Cover the butter in the wax paper and freeze for two to three months.







"
"
Clarify the butter.,
Add minced garlic, salt, herbs, and spices to the clarified butter.,
Use immediately or store for future use.",How to Make Garlic Butter2," Clarified butter is butterfat that has been separated from the water and milk solids. It has a higher smoke point and longer shelf life than fresh butter.








Put the butter in a heavy-bottom sauce pan. Heat on medium until it’s melted. Turn down the heat, and keep on a low boil until the top layer begins to froth and foam.
Skim off the foamy layer with a spoon. What’s left in the pan will be a liquid layer of butterfat in the middle, and the separated milk solids on the bottom.
Continue heating on low until the milk solids begin to turn a light brown. Remove from the heat.
Gently pour out the liquid into a separate sauce pan, being sure the leave the milk solids in the bottom of the sauce pan. If you have a strainer and cheesecloth, strain the liquid butterfat into the new sauce pan.
Discard the milk solids, or keep them to add into gravy, mashed potatoes, or other recipes.

, Heat on low for at least 20 minutes, so the garlic and herb flavors permeate the butter.









You can use garlic powder instead of fresh garlic, and you can add any of the extra herbs or spices according to your taste.
Cooking oils (like olive) can be substituted for the clarified butter at this stage, but be warned that different oils have different smoke points.

, Although clarified butter has a longer shelf life than regular butter, adding garlic reduces the shelf life. Store unused portions in the refrigerator in a mason jar or covered container. Refrigerated clarified butter will not remain liquid, but can easily be melted into a sauce again.









Strain out the herbs and garlic before use if you like, or leave them in for texture and additional flavor.
The garlic butter sauce can be brushed on meat, fish, tofu, or vegetables, drizzled on breads, or used as a fondue sauce.

Melt the butter in saucepan and add the flour to make a roux.,
Add the milk in batches and stir or whisk well until smooth and thickened.,
Take the sauce off the heat and add the cheese and beat well until melted.,
Allow to cool.",How to Make a Cheese Soufflé1," This is just like making an ordinary white sauce.;
, Keep stirring to prevent burning. It is important to cook the flour taste out of the soufflé sauce, just like an ordinary white sauce as this ensure a lovely smooth soufflé at the table.

, Once it has cooled to approximately blood temperature, add the egg yolks. The temperature is just warm enough that the sauce is still soft and smooth, but not hot enough to cook the egg yolks. Stir well to ensure the yolks are smoothly blended in.

, You may refrigerate this sauce overnight as well, which makes the process much easier when preparing soufflés for a special event. On the next day, allow it to come to room temperature and (as the sauce would have set), stir the sauce until smooth again.

Using a large spoon, stir 1/4 to 1/3rd (precision is not essential) of the white into the sauce.,
Scoop deep into the sauce bowl to ensure it all gets mixed.",How to Make a Cheese Soufflé2," Remove all top racks and have the rack at the lower part of the oven. Look at your soufflé dish and estimate its height twice over - the soufflé may rise this much so will need this much room in the oven.
It is preferable to cook the soufflé without the oven fan on as the fan can make the soufflé rise unevenly, overcook one side or even push the semi-cooked light batter over the side of the dish. If you have an oven thermometer, use that to ensure your oven is heating to the right temperature. If you serve the soufflé and it is undercooked and very runny in the middle, simply scoop out the cooked portions and serve those. Just like cakes, soufflés unfortunately don't rise again if you put them back in the oven to cook a little more.

, You want the top rim to be coated to prevent the souffle sticking and rising lopsided.

, Add the breadcrumbs to the dish and swirl to cover the base. Then tilt the dish and continue turning it to cover. Tip the dish slightly downwards to get the surplus out towards the sides.

, Beat the sauce again to ensure it is as smooth or ""soft"" as possible as that will make incorporating the egg whites much easier and make a more successful soufflé.

, You can use electric beaters on a low setting and the whites should form stiff peaks when you lift the whisk or beater out. If it flops quickly or forms a ribbon trail, keep beating a little longer.

, Using the spoon or the whisk stir gently to incorporate the whites, be gentle, but the first batch of whites is slightly ""sacrificial"" so they won't need to retain their light fluffiness.

, When well incorporated, fold in the remainder of the whites and fold through. Be more gentle on this batch.

Transfer the batter into the soufflé dish.,
Place into the oven.,
Before you serve them, gather the diners as these really will not wait.",How to Make a Cheese Soufflé3," If desired,lightly run your finger around the outside edge of the batter without disturbing the crumbs. It's not essential, but can make a nice ""top hat"" style finish.

, Bake for 15-20 minutes until well risen and golden. Only open the oven door when you are ready to serve to prevent them sinking. If you prepared them in individual ramekins, it is 8-10 minutes as a rule. Ideally the soufflé will have a tender, semi-molten centre and with practice you can refine your skills to recognise when the soufflé has reached this stage.
If it is too runny, it is a sign your oven is not efficient at retaining heat, or it may have an inaccurate thermostat.

, If the kitchen is not on the same floor as the dining room, it may be best to gather guests in the kitchen. Serve immediately with a crisp salad, bread or as is.
A good trick is to serve the soufflé dish on a heated serving plate, or at minimum a cork or silicon mat to prevent them cooling (and sinking) quickly. Scoop each portion out onto the plate using a sharp knife and a spoon, or allow guests to eat directly from their own ramekin.

Decide whether to make melted or clarified butter.,
Melt the butter over low heat.,
Flavor the butter.",How to Make Drawn Butter1," ""Drawn butter"" is an ambiguous term. Depending on which chef you ask, it can mean plain melted butter or ""clarified"" butter: pure butterfat separated from the milk solids and water.Each option has its advantages:Plain melted butter has more flavor, making it a good dipping sauce for seafood. Read on for simple instructions and flavor ideas.
Clarified butter has a more subdued flavor, which some people prefer. It also has a higher smoking point, useful for searing food. Skip ahead for the recipe.;
, Cut the butter into pieces and melt it in a pan over low heat. Stir the butter occasionally to prevent burning, especially if you have a cast iron or stainless steel pan (which tend to create hot spots).









You can also melt butter in the microwave, but it can easily burn if you do it in one go. Cut into pieces, cover with a paper towel, and heat in ten second increments, stirring in between.

, You can serve plain drawn butter as a dipping sauce, but it's usually paired with other ingredients. Here's a simple, traditional sauce for lobster or other seafood:








½ cup (120 mL) melted butter
Juice of one lemon
Salt and pepper to taste
For a spicier sauce, add 2-3 cloves crushed garlic, or replace the black pepper with cayenne.

"
"
Melt unsalted butter over low heat.,
Skim off the milk solids.,
Ladle out the clarified butter.,
Make ghee instead.,
Add other flavors.",How to Make Drawn Butter2," Cut the butter into pieces and put it in a pan with an even temperature. A heavy aluminum pan is ideal, but thin copper or aluminum pans should work as long as you do not overheat them. If your only options are cast iron or stainless steel, stir the butter frequently to distribute the heat.








Do not use salted butter, as the salt will become extra concentrated during clarification.
You'll lose about ¼ of the butter's volume during clarification. If the recipe calls for 1 cup drawn butter, start with 1⅓ cup butter.

, When butter melts, it separates into three components: a layer of milk solids on top, butterfat in the middle, and water at the bottom.Once the milk solids (a white foam) are floating on the surface, skim them off and set aside.









You can use the milk solids to flavor popcorn or anything else that pairs well with butter.

, The clear layer in the middle is clarified butter, or in other words pure butterfat. Transfer this to a new container.









Discard the water left at the bottom of the pan.

, Ghee is an Indian variation on clarified butter. The process is more difficult (it's easy to burn the butter), but it adds a nutty flavor and doesn't waste any butterfat to skimming. Although traditional ghee starts with a fermented milk product, there is a common labor-saving alternative that some people use to make ""drawn butter:""








Bring the butter to a gentle boil over medium-low heat.
Wait for the foam to break apart and sink to the bottom.
Turn off the heat once the bubbling has mostly stopped. This means the water has boiled away.
Simmer for a little bit longer, until you see and smell the milk solids browning lightly at the base of the pan. Take care not to burn them.
Pour the butter through a damp cheesecloth or coffee filter to strain out the browned solids.

, Optionally, transfer the clarified butter to a clean pan to stir in other ingredients. One minute of sautéing with a couple cloves of finely chopped garlic adds a delicious aroma and flavor.Lemon juice, tarragon, or chives are also popular additions, as is a simple sprinkle of salt and pepper.

Learn about beurre monte.,
Warm a little water.,
Whisk in a small cube of butter.,
Keep whisking in butter.,
Fix broken sauces.,
Use the beurre monte promptly.",How to Make Drawn Butter3," Although not nearly as common as the versions above, some chefs use the term ""drawn butter"" as a synonym for beurre monte.This is melted butter in the form of an emulsion, meaning the milk solids and liquids are distributed evenly instead of separated. This is an excellent sauce to use when poaching lobster or pan-roasting meat., Heat about two tablespoons (30 mL) water in a saucepan or double boiler. Bring to a simmer, than immediately reduce heat to low. You'll need to keep the heat even at just below boiling. This is easiest in a heavy pan over a gas stove.









It doesn't matter how much beurre monte you want to make — you always start out with just a little water. There's already plenty of water in the butter; you just need a little extra to get the emulsion started.

, Chop the butter into small pieces. Add one of them to the water and whisk in slowly. Once melted, it should form a milky, homogenous liquid.









If the mixture boils or if you stop whisking, the milk solids may separate and form a scum on the surface.

, Repeat this process, whisking in butter one chunk at a time. You can add as much butter as you like, but don't plan on saving leftovers; the sauce will separate in storage.








, If the butter starts to separate, you might be able to fix the sauce:









If you see little droplets of fat start to form, it's just beginning to break. Stop adding butter and whisk in a little more water until the fat is mixed in.If the sauce broke completely, try vigorously whisking in a spoonful of heavy cream.If the sauce breaks after you took it off the stove, blend it with a spoonful of very hot water., It's best to use the beurre monte within the hour, before it separates. If you need to wait longer than that, cover it with a tight lid or plastic wrap, and keep in a warm place for a few hours.








The ideal temperature for poaching in beurre monte is about 180ºF (80ºC).Do not let it boil, or it will separate.

Make nut-free baked goods.",How to Make Coconut Butter," To make coconut butter, you simply process shredded or flaked coconut in a food processor or high-quality blender for about 20 minutes. Depending on the size of your blender or food processor, you can work in batches as large as 7 cups (651 g) of coconut at a time. The best machines for this process are:Food processor
Ninja
Vitamix
Blendtec;
, Turn your food processor on high and mix the coconut. As you process the coconut, it releases oils and becomes a spreadable paste with the consistency of peanut butter.If you're pressed for time, you can speed up the process by adding 1 to 2 tablespoons (6 to 12 ml) of melted coconut oil to the mix as well.
The melted coconut oil adds moisture and lubrication to the coconut. This helps to keep the coconut together better, meaning you won’t have to stop as often to scrape down the sides.

, As soon as the blades start spinning freely and stop catching the coconut, stop the machine. Remove the lid and use a spoon or silicone spatula to scrape down the sides of the food processor and pack all the coconut back around the blades.


You will have to stop to scrape down the sides every 30 seconds to a minute during the processing.

, Turning shredded coconut into coconut butter will take about 20 minutes of blending, and during that time you'll have to stop 20 to 40 times to scrape down the sides of the food processor to get the coconut blending again.The coconut butter is ready when it’s thick but slightly runny and spreadable.

, Once you’ve achieved the desired consistency, you can use your coconut butter right away.


If there are any leftovers, transfer them to a clean glass jar with an air-tight lid (such as a mason jar). You can store the coconut butter on the shelf for a couple months, or keep it in the fridge to make it last even longer., Toasting the coconut before you process it into coconut butter gives the butter a delicious hint of toasted caramel. There are three ways that you can toast coconut, and one of the more popular is baking it in the oven.


Spread the coconut out on a baking sheet or two, depending on how much coconut you're using to make your butter. Make sure the layer is thin so that it cooks evenly.
Place the coconut into an oven preheated to 300 F (149 C).
Toast the coconut in the oven for about 20 minutes. Mix it around every five minutes to ensure it cooks and toasts at an even rate.Remove the coconut from the oven and allow it to cool to room temperature before using it for coconut butter.

, Another way to toast coconut involves cooking it in a skillet on the stove. You will likely have to work in batches, especially if you're making seven cups of coconut butter.


Spread the coconut out in a large skillet. Place it over medium heat and cook the coconut for about five minutes.Stir the coconut frequently to prevent burning and promote even cooking. The coconut is ready when it turns a golden brown.
Remove from the heat and cool before processing.

, A third way to toast coconut involves cooking it in the microwave in short bursts. Coconut can burn easily in the microwave, which is why you want to cook it in small sessions.


Spread the coconut out on a microwave-safe plate or dish. Set your microwave to high and microwave the coconut in 30-second increments. Stir between every cooking session.The coconut will take about eight minutes to cook. It’s ready when it turns golden brown.
Give the coconut a few minutes to cool down after toasting, then transfer it to your blender for coconut butter processing.

, The oil in coconut meat becomes liquid around 76 F (24 C), so if your house or fridge is colder than that, you will have to warm the coconut butter before you can spread it.To warm the coconut butter, you can:Use a knife to cut out the desired amount. Transfer the coconut butter to a glass bowl and place it in a larger bowl full of hot water.
Alternatively, if you want to warm the entire jar, place the whole jar in a saucepan full of water and warm it on the stove.
Heat a small portion in the microwave. Heat it on medium heat for about 15 seconds at a time. Stir, and heat again if necessary.
Wrap the entire jar in a heating pad. Let it sit for about half an hour.

, Coconut butter makes a delicious, raw, and dairy-free alternative to butter. You can spread coconut butter on toast, pancakes, waffles, muffins or any other baked good you like.


You can also put this butter on sandwiches and other savory breads, but it will give your baked goods a slight coconut flavor.
If you find the coconut butter isn't spreading easily, divide out a portion that you want to use for spreading and return it to the food processor. Process it for a few more minutes, and add in a drizzle of melted coconut oil to help make it smoother and more spreadable.Depending on how much of the coconut butter you're processing, add anywhere between 1 teaspoon and 2 tablespoons (6 to 15 ml) of oil.

, You can drizzle coconut butter on fruits and desserts the same way that you would chocolate or butterscotch syrup. If you chill the fruit beforehand, the coconut will even become hard and form a delicious candy-like shell on top!For a really decadent treat, cover whole strawberries in a layer of coconut butter and put them in the freezer to harden. Serve as you would chocolate-covered strawberries.

, Coconut butter is a creamy and healthy way to make breakfast a little more interesting. You can mix it in with cereals, granola, oatmeal, and other breakfast foods and snacks.Try drizzling a little coconut butter into your yogurt, or add some to your morning smoothie.

, As long as you don’t mind the hint of coconut, you can use coconut butter as a substitute for milk and cream in many recipes. You can try:Using it in coffee instead of milk or cream
Replacing the dairy in cream sauces
Making hot cocoa with coconut butter

, There are lots of people who are allergic to peanuts and other nuts, and coconut butter is an excellent alternative that won’t cause an allergic reaction.When making peanut butter cookies or any other baked goods that require nut butter, use equal amounts of coconut butter instead to make a nut-free dessert.

Give cashew butter as a present.",How to Make Cashew Butter," Cashews are readily available in the bulk section or nuts section at most grocery stores. They can often be found either raw or roasted. Keep in mind that approximately 2 cups of cashews will make 1 ¼ cups of cashew butter. Use this as a guideline for determining the amount of cashews to buy.


Cashews are not available to purchase with their shells still intact. Cashews are in the same family as poison oak and poison ivy, meaning that their shells release a toxin called urushiol that produces skin irritations and rashes. The nuts themselves are typically roasted or, if sold as “raw” in stores, are typically steamed to eliminate the toxin.Cashews are also available already flavored, such as honey roasted cashews. These can be used to make cashew butter as well.;
, If you are purchasing cashews as a replacement for peanuts because of a peanut allergy, you need to make sure that the cashew processing plant does not also process peanuts. The risk of cross-contamination can be dangerous or even deadly for those with peanut allergies. Also, check to make sure the person with a peanut allergy does not also have allergies to other types of nuts. Peanuts are ground nuts, while others, like walnuts, hazelnuts and cashews, are tree nuts. Some people are only allergic to peanuts, while others are allergic to all kinds of nuts.

, If you purchased raw nuts, you may decide to soak and dehydrate them first before processing them into cashew butter. To soak nuts, place 4 cups of nuts into a glass or ceramic bowl. Fill the bowl with water so the nuts are completely submerged, and add 1-2 tablespoons of unrefined salt. Cover the bowl and let it stand for about 2-3 hours.Raw nuts contain high levels of phytic acid and enzyme inhibitors, which can cause irritation and digestive difficulty, and can inhibit the absorption of some of the nutrients contained in nuts. Soaking nuts can neutralize the acid and enzyme inhibitors, maximizing the health potential of nuts.

, Use cool water to remove any salt residue that remains on the cashews.

, Spread the cashews in a single layer on a cookie sheet or on a dehydrator rack. Heat your oven or dehydrator to 150 °F (66 °C). Periodically check on the cashews and toss them to ensure they dry on all sides. Monitor them to ensure that they do not burn. Dry the cashews until they are slightly crispy, or about 12-24 hours., Heat your oven to 325 °F (163 °C). Preheat a ceramic dish for 5 minutes, and then place a single layer of cashews in this dish. Bake them in the middle of the oven for approximately 20 minutes. If so desired, add a little olive oil or salt to coat the cashews at this time. Stir the cashews thoroughly.

, Cashews, like most nuts, are dense and heat can get packed away inside them. Giving the nuts time to cool will reduce the risk of burning yourself when processing them into butter.

, You will need at least 2 cups of cashews to produce 1 ¼ cups of cashew butter. You may also want to add salt; for this amount of cashews, include ¼ teaspoon of salt. You do not need any other ingredients, such as oil, water or flavorings, unless you are planning to make a flavored cashew butter. Plain cashew butter consists of only cashews and a little salt if desired.

, Have a food processor ready, as well as a spatula. The food processor should be sturdy and able to operate for an extended period of time. Alternately, you can use a coffee grinder (which will likely process smaller quantities of cashews at a given time), or a high-powered blender. Using a Ninja Master Prep blender will reduce the amount of time you need to blend the cashews. Have storage containers ready to transfer the cashew butter when you are finished processing it. You might use glass jars, freezer-safe containers, or other food storage containers.

, Turn the processor on high speed to chop up the cashews. Watch the consistency of the cashews, which will transition from big chunks to fine grain after a few minutes, and to a sticky paste after another 4-5 minutes. Adding oil or water is not necessary, as the cashews will turn to butter after several minutes of processing.

, Your food processor may overheat slightly and could use a rest from running. Take a break for 2-3 minutes to let the food processor cool down. Use this time to scrape the sides of the bowl and give a little stir to the cashews.

, As you resume processing the cashews, they will start to release oils, which causes them to get sticky. Process the cashews for another 2-3 minutes as they begin to turn into a creamy butter. Stop to scrape the sides of the bowl again, and continue to process until you reach the desired consistency. The entire process can take up to 15-25 minutes, depending on your equipment, so be patient.The food processor might seem like it is just spinning and not mixing anything. It is still working on turning your cashews into cashew butter, so keep at it. Give your machine a rest every few minutes so you don’t risk a blown-out machine.

, If you choose to add salt, use ¼ teaspoon of unrefined salt per 2 cups of cashews. Honey, raw sugar or maple syrup (1-2 tablespoons) can also be added to sweeten the cashew butter. Blend the cashew butter to mix in additional ingredients thoroughly.

, If you want crunchy cashew butter, add more pieces of cashews that have not turned into butter in your food processor. These finely chopped cashew pieces will add a little crunch to your butter and give it more dimension.

, Transfer cashew butter in a glass jar with a tightly sealed lid. Store in the refrigerator and use within one week. The oil and solids will separate after sitting, so you will need to give it a good stir every time you use it.

, Pour cashew butter into candy molds or ice cube trays. After they are frozen, you can store these mini-blocks of cashew butter in a freezer-safe container or storage bag for approximately 4 months., Cashew butter has a creamy, buttery, rich flavor, which many people prefer over peanut butter's flavor. The butter is rich in protein and unsaturated fats, making it an ideal healthy energy snack.

, Put a frozen cube of cashew butter in a small container and include it in a sack lunch with some crackers, celery sticks or apple slices. After sitting for a couple of hours, the butter will be nicely thawed and easy to dip into, but it won't have sat so long that its oils and solids separated.

, Cashew butter is especially useful and flavorful in Indian, Thai, Chinese or West African cuisine (such as cuisine from The Gambia or Senegal). Cashew butter can be mixed into recipes as a nut flavor or as a thickener. It can be used in Szechuan chicken dishes, spring rolls, curries, chicken tikka masala, and soups. It can also be a replacement for any recipe that calls for peanut butter, almond butter or tahini.

, Substitute cashew butter in a peanut butter cookie recipe for a nuanced flavor change in this classic cookie. Because of cashew butter's softer texture, you may need to experiment with the quantity that you are substituting in a peanut butter cookie recipe. Add more flour if the cookie batter seems too runny. Shape the cookie dough into balls and roll them in sugar before baking. Or, use a fork to make the criss-cross pattern in the dough before baking.Bake the cookies according to the peanut butter recipe's directions. Watch them carefully to make sure they do not burn; sometimes, ingredient substitutions can change the time necessary to bake the perfect cookie.

, Make batches of cashew butter and store them in pint-sized mason jars. Make personalized labels for the jars and tie a ribbon around the jars. Give your homemade cashew butter to friends or family as birthday or holiday presents.

",How to Make Flavoured Butter1," If you used unsalted butter, you may add a pinch of fine sea salt if desired, but do not use salted butter for sweet variations.


It's desirable to use fresh rather than dried flavourings as the dried flavours can be stale or musty and never as piquant as fresh ingredients.

Correct sour or not ""fresh"" butter.,
Correct butter that is either too soft or too warm.,
Correct waxy butter that doesn't melt in your mouth.,
Correct butter that sweats too readily.",How to Make Butter from Raw Milk," Let your raw milk set in a clear container for at least a day in the refrigerator until you can easily see a distinct cream line on the top. Two days should be enough for the cream to separate from the milk.


Depending on what kind of cow the milk came from, as well as the season during which the milk was harvested, the cream content of the milk will change. For example, during the winter, the cream content in the milk will increase, whereas it will generally decrease during the summer months.

, From one whole gallon of raw milk, you can expect about 2 - 4 cups of cream — sometimes more, sometimes less. Pour the cream into a glass jar with an accompanying lid.

, You don't have to let your butter culture, but if you do, you'll get richer, more flavorful butter.In days of yore, people use to culture butter to keep it from spoiling. Nowadays, aficionados culture butter because it makes the spread transcendent. There are two ways you can let your cream culture:


Set out on the counter for about 12 hours or until the cream is between 70° - 75° F (21° - 24° C) and smells slightly sour.This is a natural way to let the cream culture and develop a slight acidity in the butter.
Hasten the process by adding some culture yourself. The live cultures inside yogurt or buttermilk work great for speeding up the process. For every 2 cups of cream, add one tablespoon of yogurt or buttermilk. Stir to incorporate. In a warm environment, the cream should be cultured in about 5 - 6 hours instead of 12., If your butter is in a sealed mason jar, agitating is as simple as shaking the jar back and forth, for anywhere from 5 to 15 minutes. You should feel the weight of the jar changing as the butter solids coagulate. When the cream starts sloshing against the jar and you feel the weight of the solids, start agitating slower.


A quick way of agitating is to use a mixer or blender. Fill it up to half full with cream. Mix on medium low to begin with, until either the motor pulls down or you see lumps floating on top, and then use the slowest setting to finish the churn.

, You can save the buttermilk for use in cooking or baking.

, When covered completely with cheesecloth, run the butter through a bowl of ice-water. This process will ""clean"" the butter, further separating any cream from the butter solids to achieve a richer butter.


When the ice-water bowl becomes milky, dump it out and fill it with more ice and water. Repeat the cleaning process until the water no longer becomes milky after running the butter through it.

, Ditch the cheesecloth (you can re-use it if you want) and dump the butter into a bowl. With a wooden spoon, knead the butter. This process will again small amounts of water and/or cream from the butter, making the butter richer. Do this until the butter is free of liquid.

, While you're still kneading the butter, add salt if you like your butter salted (butter without salt is much sweeter). If salting, try 1/2 teaspoon of salt per 1/2 lb. of butter and work your way up from there. If you wish to add herbs or spices to your butter, try experimenting with any of the following for just the tip of the iceberg:


Chives
Orange, lemon, or lime rind
Rosemary or thyme
Garlic or ginger
Parsley
Honey

, A nice little butter mold will add a dainty touch to your butter while allowing you to serve the butter in individual portions. Refrigerate or freeze any butter you are not serving immediately.

,, If your butter tastes a little sour or not fresh, there's a good chance that the milk was allowed to rest too long before the cream was skimmed. If you purchased the raw milk from a farmer, ask for extremely fresh milk.;
, We're accustomed to butter that has just the right give when slightly cooled. Getting butter to this consistency is not too difficult, but problems do arise sometimes:


If butter is too soft: The cream may have been warmer than 75° F (24° C) when it was agitated or it wasn't agitated long enough.It should take at least 5 - 10 minutes to agitate by hand, but no longer than 30 minutes. If you got butter before you hit 5 minutes of agitation, chances are you started off with cream that was too warm.
If butter is too hard: Either the cream was too cold when it was agitated or it was agitated for too long. Again, butter should be agitated when it's 70° - 75° F (21° - 24° C) and not take longer than 30 minutes to agitate by hand.

, This kind of butter was usually overworked during the final stages of kneading.

, If you see moisture forming a bit too easily on the surface of your butter after all is  said and done, it either means it wasn't rinsed properly or the salt wasn't incorporated evenly.

If you find the flavor lacking, season it lightly with a dash of sea salt and cracked black pepper. It’s also common for people to enjoy their cottage cheese with crackers or other crispy items, which can add extra dimension to the texture.


Since it’s high in protein, calcium and other beneficial nutrients, cottage cheese makes a well-balanced snack on its own.
Cottage cheese can be eaten like yogurt, with lots of different stir-ins and additives from granola to chocolate to crushed pistachios.;
, Pair cottage cheese with slices of fresh peaches, apples or tomatoes, or scoop it up with baby carrots and celery sticks. The sweet and tangy notes of the fruits and veggies will provide a pleasant contrast to the smooth, subtle flavor of the cottage cheese.A veggie tray with cottage cheese for dipping can make a light, refreshing poolside snack in the summertime.

, For the first meal of the day, skip the butter and go with a more wholesome dairy alternative. A layer of cottage cheese will soften the crunchy toast and keep it from being quite so bland. Devour your loaded toast as-is, or top it with other ingredients like savory nut butters, raisins or a drizzle of honey.You could also try cottage cheese on a bagel or toasted muffin.
Cottage cheese is higher in protein than both milk and cream cheese, and lower in fat, too., Along with beets, herbed croutons or toasted almonds, a spoonful of cottage cheese can provide the finishing touches to a hearty salad worthy of a meal. Cottage cheese is a staple of many salad bars for good reason—it complements the many different components well without making the salad soggy the way dressings tend to do.Cottage cheese can be used to hold together other types of salads, as well, like chicken or tuna salad."

Use this method to drain freshly-made ricotta, or to prepare ricotta for use in recipes.,

Cover the ricotta.,
Place anything heavy over the setup.,
Time the draining according to intended use.,
Stir the ricotta if it is slow to drain.",How to Drain Ricotta Cheese1," If you make your own ricotta, you'll need to drain the liquid away once the hot ricotta has sat for fifteen minutes.You may also use this method to transform moist, cream-cheese consistency ricotta into a ricotta with firmer curds for use in cooking.;
, A fine mesh strainer may do the best job of draining thoroughly, but a colander will also work.Line the entire inside surface with cheesecloth, or another fine mesh cloth. Some people have even reported success with two layers of sturdy paper towels., You'll need a bowl to catch the draining moisture from the ricotta. Find a bowl or soup plate that the strainer can stand on, or rest the strainer on the lip of a tall bowl.


Don't use a setup where the strainer mesh is touching the base of the bowl, since this will keep the ricotta sitting in its own moisture.

, Resist the temptation to pour or drop the ricotta in, since this will include all the liquid. Instead, spoon it in bit by bit, abandoning excess liquid at the bottom of the previous container.

, Use any clean cloth or paper towel to cover the ricotta, or a plate that fits inside the strainer. Don't use a plate that rests on the strainer's lip, since the ricotta will need to be compressed as described below.

, Compress the ricotta to help it drain by placing a heavy object on top of the cloth or plate resting on the ricotta. This could be a large can of food, a bag of stones, or any other reasonably clean object.


If you cannot find anything suitable, press the ricotta down with a spoon for a minute or two instead.

, Common ricotta draining times used in recipes vary from one to eight hours. Instead of following a single recipe's instructions every time, use these suggestions to get ricotta of various consistencies depending on your preference and intended use.Keep in mind that the following times are guidelines only, and will vary with each batch of ricotta and with the size of the cheesecloth's mesh:


If eating plain, drain for five minutes to get a moist, spreadable ricotta, or until you reach a consistency you enjoy more.
If cooking in moist, savory dishes, approximately twenty minutes should achieve a cottage cheese consistency, with small, moist curds. Lasagna, ravioli filling, or dips can be made with this ricotta. Ricotta for cannoli may require an additional ten minutes or more, to prevent the shells from becoming soggy.
For most other purposes, drain from two to eight hours in the refrigerator. Pastries and baked goods in particularly use dry, crumbly ricotta to avoid ruining the texture of the dessert.

, Some batches of ricotta may be slow to drain due to variables in the cooking process. Speed these up by occasionally scraping the ricotta from the sides of the cheesecloth, allowing water to run through."

, Stir cottage cheese into sauces or stews as they simmer to bulk them up and make them more filling without the need to add meat. When heated, the soft curds will set up particularly well in dishes with creamy bases, such as vodka sauce or stroganoff.Stir cottage cheese into your leftovers just before you reheat them to keep them from getting too dry.
Reach for a carton of cottage cheese instead of a can of creamed soup when you’re whipping up a savory casserole., The next time you bake a pound cake, cookies or cornbread, mix in a few ounces of cottage cheese once you’ve combined your wet and dry ingredients. The finished product will be rich, flavorful and have a remarkably smooth consistency right out of the oven.Try making dense confections like biscuits and scones with cottage cheese instead of buttermilk.

Serve and eat.",How to Drain Ricotta Cheese2," This method only takes a few minutes, but it may not thoroughly remove all the ricotta's moisture.It is not ideal for draining warm, just-made ricotta, but if your store-bought ricotta is soaked or dripping, this can quickly improve its texture and flavor before eating.This is also an acceptable, though not perfect, method for lasagna and other savory dishes, which do not require as much draining as ricotta used for pastries., Traditionally, ricotta is drained using heavy-duty, fine mesh cheesecloth. Fine-mesh nylon bags should also work, as will high quality men's handkerchiefs.If none of these are available, try a fine muslin or linen cloth or pillowcase, as long as it is freshly laundered.

, This method is more efficient than pouring or dropping the ricotta in, since liquid at the bottom of the ricotta container will not be added to the cloth.

, Lift the four corners of the cheesecloth and tie them together to form a bundle of ricotta. Alternatively, simply twist them together and keep a tight hold of them.

, Squeeze firmly but slowly, working from the top of the bundle to prevent the ricotta from squirting out. Continue squeezing and gently shaking to remove as much water as possible.

, Ricotta that still has a somewhat moist, spreadable consistency is harder to use in recipes, although savory dishes such as lasagna are less affected by the extra moisture than pastry dishes. Better yet, serve this ricotta plain or with some of these additions:Atop crostini or toast

, These include:


Buffalo mozzarella. This was traditionally made from buffalo milk, although nowadays is more likely to be made from cow milk if purchased from the supermarket. Ask your supplier for details on its milk origins.
Fresh mozzarella. This is slightly sweet, and milky. It's usually shaped in a ball about the size of your fist.

Bocconcini. This is the Italian for ""little mouthfuls"" and refers to its smaller ball shape.
Cherry mozzarella. This is mozzarella in cherry-sized balls.
Aged mozzarella. This is the traditional pizza cheese and is a lot drier than the fresh version, as well as a different colour.

, Mozzarella has a short shelf life and goes sour when not eaten quickly. After purchase, eat it within a few days.

, Correct storage is important to maintain freshness and flavour of fresh mozzarella. Place it in the refrigerator in its original packaging and liquid. Cover it with fresh water to stop it from drying out any more.


Drain cloudy water off, clean the container, and replace with fresh water.

Knead out excess buttermilk if you're not using your butter right away.,
Add herbs to your butter.,
Use your butter in baking.,
Add butter to bread-based items.",How to Make Butter in a Jar," Simply pour the cream into the jar. You do not need to fill the jar more than halfway.The precise amount of whipping cream you use depends on the size of your jar, but it's usually around 2/3 of a cup., Seal the jar and shake it vigorously until the cream begins to form into butter. This takes a great deal of effort and it may be awhile before you see results. Have patience and keep shaking the jar. Eventually, butter will begin to form.After awhile, you will see the heavy whipping cream solidifying. It will begin to form a yellowish color resembling butter.
You will also see some liquid separating from the butter. This is a normal part of the process. Not all of the cream will form into butter. It's normal to have some buttermilk on the top.
Keep shaking the jar until there is a clear separation between the butter at the bottom of the jar and the liquid on the top.

, Open your jar and select another container, such as a Tupperware container. Slowly pour out the liquid from the top of the jar. This is buttermilk, which is used in a variety of baked goods. If you bake frequently, it may be worth it to save the buttermilk.If a little butter slips out when you're pouring out the buttermilk, do not worry. You can use a spoon to scoop it out of the container and place it back in the jar.
As butter may slip out, do not drain the buttermilk over the sink. Even if you intend to discard the buttermilk, drain it into a container.

, A little salt will enhance the flavor of your butter. Butter may taste a little dull if you don't sprinkle some salt onto it. Sprinkle salt over yoru butter until it reaches your desired taste.If you plan to use your butter for a recipe that calls for unsalted butter, refrain from using salt.

, Keep your butter in the fridge. This will prolong its shelf life. You can use your jar as a storage container or place the butter in a Tupperware container., Homemade butter has a shorter shelf life than butter you would purchase at the store. If you're not going to use your butter for a bit, you should knead out excess buttermilk. This will make homemade butter last slightly longer.Run cold water over your butter as you knead it. Work the butter with your hands until it's firmer and a lot of buttermilk has leaked out. This will take several minutes.
This is a very messy process. Expect that your hands will get dirty when kneading homemade butter.

, You can add some flavor to your butter with your herbs. If you're adverse to using salt, herbs can also make your butter flavorful. If you're using your butter for a particular dish, like garlic bread, herbs can help.Choose a combination of herbs you enjoy. If you're going for, say, an Italian seasoning, opt for herbs like basil, oregano, and garlic powder.
Things like rosemary and thyme also taste good in butter.

, Homemade butter can work great in baked goods. Homemade butter may give baked goods a fresher, creamier taste.As homemade butter can be a litter runnier than regular butter, you may want to knead butter under running water before using it in baked goods.

, You can use your homemade butter as a spread. Many people find the taste of homemade butter fresher and tastier than other types of butter. Try using homemade butter on things like toast, bagels, English muffins, and other bread-based items."

, What's your favorite kind of cheese... cheddar, swiss, gouda? Decide which you like best, depending on what you're doing with it.

, Selecting cheese is basically ruling out cheeses you'd rather not buy. Example: Say, you're choosing between edam, cheddar, and swiss. First, if you know the tastes, find the one you like least, for example edam. Now, depending on what you're doing with the cheese, for example, you're making french onion soup, which would be better, cheddar or swiss? Swiss., They are often little triangle shaped foil parcels that offer a type to try cheaply, rather than buy a big portion.

, A lot of gourmet delis also allow you to try a sample before you buy, but supermarkets don't offer this service. It is recommended to buy something as a thank you for free tasting days.

, They may also advise seasonal variations when a particular type is worth going for at this time of year.

Prepare the strainer.,
Heat the milk, cream and salt.,
Slowly add the vinegar.,
Let the mixture sit until it's thick.,
Ladle the curds into the strainer.,
Let the ricotta drain.,
Spoon the ricotta into a bowl.",How to Make Ricotta Cheese1," Line the fine-mesh strainer with a large piece of cheesecloth, and set it over the nonreactive bowl. Set this contraption on your work surface so to have it ready for the cheese mixture.


If you don't use cheesecloth, it will be difficult to separate the cheese curds from the whey. You can substitute a double layer of paper towels or a thin cotton dishcloth in a pinch.;
, Place the milk, cream and salt in the saucepan and heat the mixture over medium-high heat. Allow it to heat until it reaches 200 degrees F. When the mixture is hot enough, turn off the heat and move the saucepan so the milk can begin to cool. It should take about 5 minutes to reach the correct temperature.


Stir the mixture as it's heating to prevent it from scorching on the bottom.Use your candy thermometer or an instant-read thermometer to determine whether the mixture has reached the right temperature. If you don't let it cook long enough, the curds won't separate from the whey. If you overcook it, the texture will be ruined.

, Use one hand to stir constantly while the other hand slowly pours the vinegar into the heated milk and cream mixture. The vinegar will cause the curds to coagulate and separate from the whey. You'll see solid bits forming and floating to the top of the liquid. Keep stirring until all of the vinegar has been added.The curdling agent in this case is vinegar, but some people prefer to use other substances. Try substituting 3 tablespoons (44.4 ml) of lemon juice for a different flavor.
For a more traditional touch, try using animal rennet as your coagulant.Mix 1 teaspoon of rennet with 1/4 cup of cold water, then stir it into the milk mixture.

, Wait about 10 - 20 minutes for the coagulant to go to work and cause the curds to separate from the whey. It's ready when the curds have floated to the top to form a thick layer, leaving the liquid whey underneath.

, Scoop out the thick top layer of curds and ladle them over the cheesecloth-covered strainer. Keep ladling out the curds until all that's left in the saucepan is the whey. You can discard the whey at this point.

, Wait at least an hour for the last of the whey to drain from the ricotta through the cheesecloth into the bowl. It will take about half an hour for the ricotta to fully drain. Don't attempt to stir it or push it through the cheesecloth, as this will just push the curds into the cloth.


If you'd like a creamier final product, stop draining the ricotta after 5 - 10 minutes. For a drier final product, wait an hour for it to drain., The finished ricotta is now ready to use in your favorite recipe. It's delicious as part of a savory dish or a dessert. Ricotta will keep in the refrigerator for about a week.

Heat the milk to 34ºC/93.2ºF.,
Cover the milk with cling film, or the pot lid, if available.,
Let sit 30 minutes until a ""clean break"" is formed.,
Using a knife, cut the curds into 1 centimeter (0.4 in) cubes.,
Transfer the curds into the colander lined with a tea-towel or cheesecloth.,
Wrap the Haloumi in the cloth.,
Slice the curd mass into wedges or thick slices of haloumi.,
Heat the whey to simmering and add the salt.,
Add the haloumi slices.,
In your sterilized storage container, add the optional mint (to taste) and some whey to fill one-quarter of the container.,
Store the cheese in the refrigerator until required.,
Serve.",How to Make Haloumi Cheese," Add the rennet, stirring well.;
, Set in a warm place, wrapped in towels to keep it warm.

, A clean break is when the curd separates cleanly when you insert a knife and pull it gently to one side. If it's similar to scrambled eggs, you are close, but not quite there; keep it warm and test again in 10 minutes. (See tips).

, Let rest for 15 minutes, then agitate the curds with a slotted spoon. Let rest another 15 minutes.


Heat the pan gently to 38ºC/100.4ºF, rest another half an hour. During this process the curds will expel more whey.

, This is easiest done with a slotted spoon, mesh-straining spoon, or a sieve. Do not throw away the surplus whey––put the lid or cling film onto the pan again and set the whey aside after all curd has been removed.

, Place a large heavy weight on a saucer, then place this on top of the curds to compress them and expel more liquid. This will take at least 1 hour.


5kg / 11lb is a recommended mass. A large pot full of water works well. Pressing the weight to expel more whey does speed up the process, but should not be done to excess as you will split the curds and make them crumble.

, Aim to cut slices that will fit easily into your storage container.

, At this stage, any remaining milk proteins will knit together and rise to the top. Skim this into a bowl.


The ricotta is an additional treat to eat with sugar and cinnamon to taste, but for this quantity, you may only get 4 or 5 tablespoons worth.

, Simmer until the slices float, then poach for another 15 minutes. After poaching, drain on a clean cake-cooling rack.

, Add the slices, then top with whey until the cheese is fully covered. Agitate the container gently to ensure that the mint is evenly dispersed.

, Let it at least sit overnight if you added the mint; this will allow the flavour to penetrate.

, While the haloumi cheese can be eaten as it is, it can also be served in one of the following ways:


Cut the cheese into slices or cubes, then fry haloumi in a little olive oil until crisp and browned.
Fry as above, then add some fresh herbs and cherry tomatoes into the pan and briskly cook until tomatoes are hot and just starting to break open. Season with black pepper, a lemon wedge and a little salt to taste. Great with a good bread such as Turkish bread to sop up the juices.
Use fried haloumi in tapas or antipasto style snacks. It is also a delicious vegetarian alternative to white meats.

Save the whey from making cheese in a non-reactive pot.,
Heat the acidified whey.,
Remove the whey from heat and wait for it to curdle.,
Strain the ricotta.,
Drain the whey through the cloth.,
Remove the ricotta from the cloth.",How to Make Ricotta Cheese2," When you make homemade cheese, you'll have curds at the bottom of the pot, and you'll pour off the whey. Filter as many of the curd particles out as you can since they would otherwise form tough ""beads"" in the final ricotta. Cover the whey and let it sit for at least 12 hours at room temperature to develop sufficient acidity.


Acidified whey acts as its own coagulant, making it unnecessary to add vinegar or lemon juice to separate the curds.

, Pour it into a saucepan and heat it while stirring, taking care to avoid sticking or burning. Heat until the temperature has risen to about 175 degrees Fahrenheit and a white appears on the surface. Continue heating and stirring until the temperature reaches 200 degrees Fahrenheit.


Note that the foam will build up somewhat. Be careful. If it boils, it can boil over.

, Cover it and allow it to cool undisturbed until comfortable to the touch. The curds will soon appear like clouds suspended in the whey, while the whey will be clear and yellowish green.

, Do not stir up the curd. Instead, set up a receiving pot with a large strainer and a fine clean cloth on top. Ladle the curds into the cloth, leaving the whey in the saucepan. Discard the whey.


Be sure to scoop out the curds gently. Because the curds are very fine and delicate, they can stop up the cloth easily. This will cause very slow draining if they are broken up.

, It can take 2-3 hours for the whey to completely drain. If you prefer, you can set the strainer in the refrigerator and let it drain overnight.

, Pack it into a container, cover it and store in the refrigerator. Use it soon after making.


Ricotta will keep up to a week in the refrigerator. Alternatively, ricotta freezes very well.

Let 50g butter warm to just below room temperature.,
Beat in the sugar.,
Cream the butter-sugar mixture (optional).,
Beat in the brandy a splash at a time.,
Store in the fridge.,
Switch to raw or brown sugar.,
Flavor with vanilla extract and citrus.,
Toss in a pinch of holiday spices.,
Mix in almond meal.,
Freeze the brandy butter into molds.",How to Make Brandy Butter," It's easiest to make this recipe when the butter is still cold and fairly solid, but soft enough that the back of a spoon leaves an impression. The butter should reach this point after 30–60 minutes out of the fridge, depending on how hot your kitchen is.If you are using an electric mixer, you can throw in the butter straight from the fridge. Beat the butter on low speed for about a minute to soften it, then continue to the next step.;
, Pour in 60g (½ cup) icing sugar slowly as you beat it into the butter. Continue beating until the ingredients are thoroughly combined. Scrape down the sides of the bowl periodically with a rubber spatula.


If using an electric mixer, keep it set to medium or medium-low to avoid overheating the butter.
If beating by hand, use the back of a fork to slice the butter into thin ribbons. This saves you some effort by working more air into the mixture., If you prefer a light, spreadable brandy butter, continue beating to incorporate more air bubbles. This creaming process makes the butter expand to almost twice its size and turn much lighter in color.This happens fast in an electric mixer — within a couple minutes. Take care not to beat too much, as you still have another ingredient to add. Over-creaming can cause the ingredients to separate into a greasy, gritty texture.

, Adding too much brandy at once will curdle the butter. Pour in about 5 mL (1 tsp) and beat to combine before adding the next spoonful.Taste the brandy butter after each addition and keep adding until you achieve the desired flavor. Add about 10 mL (2 tsp) for moderate brandy flavor, or 25 mL (5 tsp) for a strong sauce.

, Keep the butter in an airtight container or under plastic wrap so it doesn't absorb other flavors. Serve on Christmas pudding or other desserts within two weeks.You can freeze leftover brandy butter in an airtight container or cling wrap. Use within three months for best quality, letting it thaw in the fridge overnight.

, These sugars have a deep molasses flavor that works well with alcohol and Christmas pudding. Raw, unrefined sugar such as muscovado works particularly well.However, this will add a slight graininess to your brandy butter compared, unlike the icing sugar version.

, After beating in the brandy, stir in 1 mL (¼ tsp) vanilla extract, and/or 8 milliliters (0.5 U.S. tbsp) orange or lemon zest., A small pinch each of cinnamon and nutmeg contributes to the holiday feel.

, Some households like to add a nutty flavor with roughly 25g (¼ cup) ground almonds. As always, stir in this extra ingredient at the end of the process, when the butter and sugar are already combined.

, Press the brandy butter into candy molds and freeze into a decorative shape. When ready to serve, run lukewarm water over the back of the mold to help you lever the butter out. Even frozen butter will melt quickly on a hot Christmas pudding, so serve in a separate container or wait until the family has gathered before you put it on."

Store in the refrigerator or freezer.",How to Make Butter," Heavy whipping cream has the highest fat percentage, making it easier and more productive to turn into butter. For a more unique flavor not available in stores, try buying raw cream from a local dairy. If this is not available, vat-pasteurized cream will produce the best flavor, followed by ordinary pasteurized cream, with ultra-pasteurized (UHT) cream a last choice option.Avoid cream that contains added sugar.
The fat percentage listed on the cream tells you how much of the cream will end up turning into butter. A minimum of 35% is recommended.
In the US, you can search Real Milk Finder for local sources of raw milk.;
, A colder bowl will prevent the butter from melting. Chilling a second container of water may also be useful at this stage, especially if your tap water tends to be on the warm side.

, Don't fill it to the brim, since the cream will expand with air before it turns into butter.

, If you skip this step, you'll be making sweet cream butter, a mildly flavored variety that includes almost all commercial butter sold in the United States and the United Kingdom.If you want a more complex flavor, similar to butter sold in continental Europe, introduce a slight, acidic fermentation to make ""cultured butter"" instead. This acid also speeds up the breakdown of fat and liquid, shortening the churning time.


One easy option is to add either buttermilk or plain yogurt with added cultures. Use one tablespoon (15 mL) of the sour addition for each cup (240 mL) cream.Alternatively, buy mesophilic cheese culture online. Mix in ⅛ tsp (0.6 mL) for every quart (liter) cream.

, If you added cultures, leave the cream out for between 12 and 72 hours, checking every few hours. The cream is cultured once it is slightly thick, foamy, and smells sour or tangy.For sweet cream butter without culturing additives, just leave out the cream until it reaches about 50–60ºF (10–16ºC). This will make it easier to churn, but is still cold enough that the butter should be firm and easy to handle during the later stages., If you have a butter churn, churn the handle for approximately 5 to 10 minutes. Churning is very easy and efficient with a well-built butter churn. If you have an electric mixer, use the whisk attachment and start it on low to prevent spatter. Otherwise, seal the cream in a Mason jar and shake it. Mixing typically takes 3 to 10 minutes, while shaking takes roughly 10 to 20 minutes.


To speed up the shaking method, drop a small, clean, glass marble into the jar before shaking.
If your mixer only has one speed setting, cover the bowl with plastic wrap to catch spray.

, The cream will go through several stages as you mix it:Frothy or slightly thick cream.
Soft peaks. Raising the mixer will leave a standing peak with a drooping tip. You can now increase the speed of the mixer.
Whipped cream, forming stiff peaks.
The cream will start to look granular, and become very pale yellow. Reduce speed again before liquid appears, to prevent spatter.
Break down: Finally, the cream will suddenly separate into butter and buttermilk.

, Continue to mix the butter and pour off more liquid as it appears. Stop churning once the solid looks and tastes like butter, or when almost no more liquid is coming out.

, If any buttermilk remains with the butter, it will spoil very quickly, so this needs to be done unless you eat the butter within 24 hours.


Pour ice water or chilled water into the butter.
Knead it with a clean hand, or use a wooden spoon to press the butter.
Pour out the ice water through a strainer.
Repeat until the water is mostly clear. This takes at least three washings, and sometimes several more.

, Use your hands and the back of the spoon to press any water remaining in the butter. Strain this out of the butter.

, Add sea salt to taste if you prefer salted butter; try ¼ tsp (1.25 mL) per ½ cup (120 mL) butter.Homemade butter is delicious by itself, but you can try all kinds of additions for variety. Consider dried herbs or finely minced garlic. You can even make a sweet spread by mixing in honey until smooth.


Be aware that the added flavors may taste significantly stronger after freezing and thawing the butter.

, Homemade butter typically stays good in the fridge for at least a week, and up to three weeks if you thoroughly pressed out all the buttermilk.In the freezer, unsalted butter will stay top-quality for about five or six months, while salted butter can last as long as nine months before taste is affected.Unlike many foods, tightly wrapped butter will not suffer in texture when frozen.

If you didn't add citric acid to the recipe, make sure to add it before storing.",How to Make Avocado Butter," Search supermarkets, farmers markets, and local fruit stands. Look for avocados that are firm, unblemished, and uniformly brown. Review these qualities to determine whether an avocado is ripe:



Check the color and appearance: Choose avocados without dark blemishes or deep indentations on the skin. California Hass avocados ripen into a dark green or black shade; if they are green at all, they probably aren't ripe. Florida avocados on the other hand, have lighter-green skin with a yellowish tone, even when they are ripe.Feel the avocados for ripeness: Gently squeeze the avocado to test its firmness. Don't squeeze very hard with your fingertips, or you'll risk bruising the fruit. A ripe avocado is soft, but it gives in to the pressure of your thumb and other fingers. Under-ripe avocados will be firm and hard; overripe avocados will be mushy to the touch, and often unevenly so.Check the spot where the stem meets the fruit: Use your fingernail to pick away the circular remainder of the stem. This should reveal a small hole in the skin through which you can note the color of the avocado. If the ""meat"" is green, it's either ripe or ripening. If the inside of the avocado looks brown, black, or any other color, it's either overripe or moldy.;
, Purchase unripe, firm avocados if you plan on using them in a few days. Store unripe avocados in a paper bag at room temperature between 65 and 75 degrees Fahrenheit (18.33 and 23.88 degrees Celsius) for up to 5 days or until they are ripe.If you want to slow the ripening process, store your avocados in a refrigerator. Only ripe or soft avocados should be refrigerated. Ripe fruit can be refrigerated until it is eaten, and should last for at least two more days., The citric acid adds a tangy flavor, but its primary function is actually to preserve the avocado butter so that it will last longer. The citric acid also prevents the avocado butter from oxidizing and turning brown. If you don't add lemon juice, the avocado butter will begin to go brown within hours of preparation.


If you don't have access to lemons, you can use any concentrated citrus juice: lime, orange, grapefruit, etc. Generally, the more sour the fruit, the more citric acid it contains. You could even use pre-bottled lemon or lime juice.
Avoid using citrus juice that has been sweetened, pasteurized, or infused with chemical additives. Only use citrus concentrate.

, You can also use margarine, a butter substitute, or 1/4 cup olive oil.Lukewarm or room-temperature butter is much softer and more spreadable than cold butter. Because room temperature butter is softer, it's much easier to mix into avocado butter. If you have butter stored in the fridge, move it to room temperature and let it ""thaw"" before you use it.


If you don't want to use butter, you can simply mash up the avocado with all of the other ingredients. Your butter-less ""avocado butter"" will not have quite the same texture as its buttery counterpart, but you'll be able to use it in all of the same situations.

, The crux of the recipe is the avocado, the butter, and the citric acid – so everything else that you add is purely a matter of taste. Try adding one clove of minced garlic, one tablespoon of fresh-chopped cilantro, two teaspoons of cumin, and salt and pepper to taste.


Feel free to use fewer seasonings for a simpler avocado butter, or more complex seasonings for a spicier butter. Try various seasoning combinations to figure out what you prefer.

, Rinse each avocado under running water, and make sure that you wash it thoroughly. It doesn't matter whether you grew the avocado yourself or found it laying on the sidewalk, it's important that you rinse any chemicals and bacteria from your produce before you eat it.


Dry the avocados with a clean towel afterwards to remove any persistent debris.

, Use a sharp knife to cut around the avocado lengthwise. Carefully hold the avocado in your hand or place it on a cutting board, and start slicing at the top of the avocado. Rotate the avocado and knife so you cut around the entire avocado and meet up with the initial slit. Then hold the two halves of the avocado and twist them in opposite directions to open the fruit.

, Use a sharp, sturdy knife, and hold the pit-containing half of the avocado in one hand. Thwack the knife solidly into the avocado pit (1/8-1/4 inch deep) so that it won't easily budge. Then, hold the avocado firmly and twist the knife (and attached pit) until the pit dislodges from the fruit. Tap or slide the pit off of the knife into a garbage can or compost bin.


Exercise great caution when using a knife. If you don't want to use a knife, you can remove the put with a spoon.
If you use a spoon, try to wedge your tool beneath the seed and separate it from the surrounding meat so that you can scoop out the pit., Now that you have two avocado halves, cut the avocado halves in half again, to make 4 wedges. Then pull the dark outer skin away from the green flesh of the fruit. Peel the fruit by sliding your thumb in between the skin and meat of the fruit, and peel the skin back away from the meat.


If you slice the avocados open and scoop out the meat using a spoon, you don't need to peel the avocado. However, many people favor peeling off the skin of the avocado because it ensures you retain the dark green, high-nutrient layer of avocado meat closest to the outer skin.
Consider cutting away the tough area where the stem meets the avocado. If you don't remove it now, you might find it amid your avocado butter later!, You can hand-mash the fruit in a bowl, or you can grind it in a food processor.Either way, mash the avocado until there are no large chunks remaining.


If you are hand-mashing the avocado, use a fork or a mortar and pestle. Chop the avocado into chunks first to make it easier to mash. You want the mixture to be smooth like guacamole.
If you are using a blender or food processor, put the avocado chunks into the machine, add all of the ingredients, and close the lid. Process until there are no large remaining chunks. This method is best if you're making a large quantity of avocado butter – it will be much easier than hand-mashing.

, The avocado butter will be freshest if you eat it right after you prepare it. Consider refrigerating it for 1-4 hours (in a covered bowl, or wrapped in parchment paper) before eating, if you'd like it cold. Consider the following ideas for eating avocado butter:



Spread avocado butter on toast. You can spread it thickly onto bread, English muffins, tortillas – anything onto which you'd spread regular butter.

Use avocado butter in a sandwich. You can use a lot of avocado butter as the key ingredient, or you can spread it thinly onto the bread as a condiment. Be aware that the more butter you used to make your avocado butter, the less you may want to eat in one sitting.

Mix avocado butter into a salad. This treat can make a great salad dressing. Serve it on the side, or toss it directly into the mix.

Eat avocado butter with any number of snacks. Dip chips or crackers; spread onto deviled eggs; dip your french fries into it; or eat it straight.

, You want to store the avocado butter in an air-tight container. To help the avocado keep its green color, you can put a layer of plastic wrap on top of the avocado butter (so it's touching the top surface).


Fresh avocado butter should keep for three days in the refrigerator or a week in the freezer., The avocado will begin to brown within a few hours if isn't protected with concentrated lemon, lime, orange, or grapefruit juice. Don't add more than a few drops – otherwise, you may impair the taste.

Store your butter.",How to Make Almond Butter1," Preheat your oven to 250 degrees Fahrenheit (121 degrees Celsius). Arrange your nuts on a baking sheet. Cook them for 10 to 15 minutes.Roasting temperature and time may vary by oven. For your first time, start with the lower temperature of 250 degrees F (121 degrees C) to avoid burning the nuts. Once you have a better sense of cooking time, use a higher temperature (350 degrees F or 177 degrees C) for a quicker roasting time (about 8 to 10 minutes.Pay attention to their coloring as they cook. Remove when they have toasted to a slight brown, before they can burn.This step is not strictly necessary, but heating the nuts’ natural oils will make blending them easier.;
, Alternately, use a food blender if that is all you have, but a food processor will blend the nuts more thoroughly without needing as much added oil.Slowly pour the almonds in while running the processor on pulse. Allow the processor to start chopping the nuts a little at a time rather than dumping the whole load in at once.








Set aside some nuts to add later if you prefer a chunky butter., Run the processor for approximately 10 minutes, at which point the nuts’ released oils should begin to smooth the mixture. Turn the machine off as the blended nuts start to build up along the container’s sides. Remove the lid and use a spatula to push the mixture back down toward the blades. Replace the lid and resume blending until you need to push the mixture back down again. Repeat as needed.








The amount of time may vary according to the strength of your food processor and the amount of nuts.

, After approximately 20 minutes of constant blending, expect the mixture to attain a creamier consistency.If clumpiness persists, add a teaspoon of olive oil to soften the mixture. Continue blending and adding oil until it reaches your desired consistency.








Add salt as desired and continue blending to mix it in.
Add extra roasted almonds and process briefly for chunky butter.

, Unplug the machine and detach the canister from the base. Use a serving spoon to transfer the bulk of the butter from the processor to an airtight container. Remove the S-blade and use your spoon or spatula to push any clinging butter into the container. Then rake up any butter clinging to the processor’s sides. Seal your container when finished and store it in the refrigerator.Refrigerated almond butter should last up to 3 weeks."

Add ⅓ cup of these to every 2 cups of almonds during the blending process., For quicker roasting and blending, use this softer nut instead. Save money by purchasing them in raw chunks from the bulk section, since whole pieces may be more expensive than almonds. They also tend to be drier, so be sure to have oil on hand to blend them to your desired consistency.When roasting, start checking their coloring no later than 7 minutes into cooking.

Slice your butter.,
Add it to a thick-bottomed saucepan.,
Place over a medium heat.,
Watch the color closely.,
Take the pan off the heat.,
Use in a variety of recipes.",How to Brown Butter," Cut your butter into tablespoon-size slices. Use the measurements indicated on the butter packaging or just approximate. The most important thing is that the butter slices are all approximately the same size, so they will melt evenly.


Unsalted temperature is best for making brown butter, and is what most recipes call for anyway.
Don't worry about the temperature of the butter - it can be mushy at room temperature or rock-hard from the fridge. You're going to be melting it, so it doesn't make a difference.;
, Place your butter slices in a thick-bottomed saucepan - this is important as thin saucepans may heat unevenly and create hot spots - which is bad for your butter.


It's also better to use a light-colored saucepan, such as stainless steel, as this will allow you to see the color of its contents more accurately, which is essential when making brown butter.

, Place the saucepan over a medium heat and begin stirring with a wire whisk. Once you start whisking - don't stop!


It is possible to make brown butter more quickly on a high heat, but this greatly increases the chances of it burning. Play it safe with a medium (or low) heat.

, Once the butter has completely melted, it will begin to bubble and foam. This is when the water evaporates and the milk solids separate from the butterfat. Then, the foaming will subside and little brown specks will begin to appear. This is the milk solids starting to brown.


Keep stirring the butter while all of this is happening. This will help the milk solids to brown evenly and prevent burning.






Once the milk solids start to brown, you will begin to notice a wonderful hazelnut-scented aroma filling your kitchen. In fact, the French term for brown butter is beurre noisette, which translates as ""hazelnut butter"".







, Once the brown specks begin to form, turn off the heat and take the saucepan off the stove. Keep stirring the butter though, as the residual heat from the saucepan will continue to brown the butter.


As soon as the butter has achieved a beautiful amber-brown color (about 30 seconds), transfer it to a heat-proof dish to stop the cooking.






If you wait too long, or leave the butter sitting in the saucepan, the milk solids will start to blacken and burn within a matter of seconds. In that case, you will need to start all over again.

, Brown butter can be used to add a roasty, toasty buttery, nutty goodness to a whole range of foods. Try:


Pouring it over roasted winter vegetables (adding a little sage for added flavor), such as butternut squash or potatoes.
Swapping it with normal butter in any butter-based sauces.
Using it to make brown butter ice cream or brown butter cake frosting.
Using it in any cookie recipes that call for melted butter.
The possibilities are endless.

Choose the right type of fondue pot and fuel.,
Light alcohol fuel carefully.Alcohol fuel is cheap and simple, but it is highly flammable, so you need to exercise as much caution as possible.,
Try gel fuel for a slightly safer alternative.,
Know how to light a candlelit burner.",How to Make Fondue1," The type of fondue pot you need will be determined by the type of fondue you are preparing. The right fuel is determined by this, as well.


A cheese fondue pot will have a wide mouth and space for alcohol or gel fuel.
Dessert fondue pots are smaller and shallower than cheese fondue pots, and they only have space for a tea light candle instead of fuel.
Broth and oil fondue pots have a smaller mouth and are made with steel or copper. They are heated with alcohol or gel fuel.;
,


Make sure that the alcohol burner is completely cool before filling it.
Never overfill the burner.
Remove the burner and take it to a kitchen counter or kitchen sink. Carefully pour the alcohol into the burner, stopping once you see the liquid approaching the holes or mesh along the sides.
Wipe off any fuel that may have spilled onto the outside of the burner and place it, unlit, below the fondue pot.
Strike a match and bring it to the air holes in the burner. Make sure all the air holes are completely open, and put out and discard the match once the fuel lights up.

, You must still exercise caution when lighting a gel burner, but is less likely to spill than liquid alcohol, so it can be a little easier to stay safe with it.


Remove the metal mesh canister usually used for fuel and insert a gel cartridge into the remaining metal casing. Replace the top of the burner when done.
If using pourable gel instead of a cartridge, you should still remove the mesh fuel canister. Pour the gel into the bottom of the burner and replace the top.
Open the air holes and bring a lit match to them. When the fuel catches fire, put out the match and discard it.

, Most dessert fondues require very little heat to keep the fondue in a liquid state, so a small tealight is the only source of fuel you need.


Melt the ingredients in a double boiler on your stove before transferring it to your fondue pot.
Place an unscented tealight candle below the fondue pot and light it with a match or lighter. Put the match out and discard it when done.

Use 1 lb (450 g) of cheese.This is usually enough for four people, when used as an appetizer, or two people, when used as a main meal.,
Choose an acid to add to the cheese fondue.,
Mix the acid with a thickener.,
Combine the cheese and acid mixture on the stove.,
Rub the fondue pot with a garlic clove.,
Transfer the cheese to your fondue pot.,
Serve the fondue with a variety of foods.",How to Make Fondue2,"


More specifically, you need about 3.5 oz (100 g) of cheese per guest when used as an appetizer and 7 oz (200 g) of cheese per guest when used as a main meal.
Most find that the best flavor results when multiple cheeses are mixed together.
Cheeses that usually work well for fondue include Swiss, fontina, gruyere, emmentaler, cheddar, and monterey jack.

, An acidic ingredient is necessary because it breaks up some of the stringiness of the cheese, thereby making it suitable as a dip. Wine is the standard acid of choice, and you usually need about 1 cup (250 ml) of wine per 1 lb (450 g) of cheese.


Dry white wine is ideal. A few good options include Chenin Blanc, Dry Vermouth, Muscadet, Pinot Blanc, Pinot Grigio, Sauvignon Blanc, and Viognier.
For a non-alcoholic option, substitute the wine for milk and add 2 to 3 Tbsp (30 to 45 ml) of lemon juice.

, Flour and cornstarch are the most common options. Add about 1 to 2 Tbsp (15 to 30 ml) of your chosen thickener per 1 lb (450 ml) of cheese.


Whisk the liquid and thickener together over low heat on the stovetop to combine. The liquid should be smooth and without lumps.

, Even though you might be able to melt the cheese in your fondue pot, melting it on the stove will make it smoother.


Shred the cheese before you melt it. Doing so will speed the process up.
Add the cheese to the thickened liquid in your saucepan one handful at a time, stirring with each addition. Do not let the cheese boil or simmer.

, Cut a clove of garlic in half and rub the exposed inside around the bottom and sides of your fondue pot.


Rubbing the garlic on the pot will add extra flavor and aroma to the fondue without creating an overpowering garlic taste.

, Pour the cheese into your fondue pot, scraping the sides of your saucepan to get as much of the liquid cheese out as possible.


Light your fondue pot using an alcohol or gel fuel.

, Cheese fondue goes great with a variety of foods, included cubed bread, lightly steamed cauliflower or broccoli, or chunks of fried potatoes. You can also use fruit like apples or grapes.


For fruit and vegetables, prepare enough for 1 to 2 pieces of fruit per person.
For bread, prepare 2 to 3 servings of bread per person.

Pick your dessert fondue.,
Try a traditional chocolate fondue.,
Mix things up with a white chocolate fondue.,
Prepare a caramel fondue.,
Serve the fondue with a variety of dipping options.",How to Make Fondue3," Chocolate fondue is the most popular dessert option, but there are many different dessert options available, so you should experiment some to find some new favorites.


No matter what dessert fondue you choose, you should prepare the fondue itself on the stove in a small saucepan before transferring it to your fondue pot.
The fondue pot should already be warm before you add the fondue to it.
After you transfer the fondue to the pot, light your candle to keep it warm.

, Chocolate fondue is rich and creamy, so it's hard to go wrong with this classic choice.Boil 1/2 cup (125 ml) water in a small saucepan. Dump the water after it reaches a boil but do not dry the pan.
Pour 1 1/4 cup (300 ml) of heavy cream into the same saucepan and heat over medium for about 2 minutes, just long enough for it to heat up.
Add 1/2 lb (250 g) dark chocolate morsels and 3.5 oz (100 g) milk chocolate morsels to the hot cream and stir until melted and smooth.
Place 10 large marshmallows in the chocolate mixture and stir until melted.

, White chocolate fondue can be a real treat for guests that have an especially strong sweet tooth.Heat water in the bottom half of a double boiler using medium heat. Let it reach a slow simmer.
Add 11 oz (310 g) white chocolate morsels to the top portion of the double boiler and combine them with 1/4 cup (60 ml) milk. Stir until melted.
Transfer the fondue to your fondue pot.

, Caramel is another fondue favorite and makes a great choice for guests that may not enjoy chocolate.Combine 1 cup (250 ml) evaporated milk, 2 cups (500 ml) white sugar, 4 Tbsp (60 ml) butter, and 4 Tbsp (60 ml) corn syrup in a small saucepan. Heat over medium, stirring frequently, until it reaches a boil.
Allow the mixture to thicken at a boil for 5 minutes before transferring it to your warm fondue pot.

, Small pieces of fruit, cake, and bread are usually your best choices for dessert fondues. Prepare 1 to 2 pieces of fruit per person or 2 to 3 servings of cake and bread per person.


In particular, chocolate fondue goes great with strawberries, banana slices, grapes, cherries, pound cake, marshmallows, quartered oranges, pineapple, apple slices, kiwi slices, pear slices, bread, donuts, croissants, and melon, as well as various nuts.
White chocolate fondue goes good with salted pretzel rods, pineapple, crystallized ginger, and mango slices.
Caramel fondue works well with sliced peaches, strawberries, banana slices, grapes, cherries, pound cake, marshmallows, unsalted popcorn, pineapple, apple slices, kiwi slices, mango chunks, raspberries, pear slices, donuts, and croissants, as well as various nuts.

Know the best types of oil to use.,
Pick a broth that goes well with your meat choices.,
Heat the oil or broth on the stove.,
Transfer the liquid to your fondue pot.,

Serve the dippings with a few fondue dips.,
Finished.

",How to Make Fondue4," Both of these options are used to cook raw pieces of meat, seafood, and vegetables, but there are a few pros and cons of each.


Oil fondue tends to be a little unhealthier than broth fondue.
On the other hand, oil fondue is a little more versatile because you can use it to prepare a variety of different dippings without affecting the taste of each one. Broth, however, will season the dippings with the taste of the broth.

, Standard options include beef, pork, lamb, chicken, seafood, and vegetables. Tender cuts of meat are usually preferred to tough cuts since the meat cooks fast.


Prepare 1/2 lb (225 g) of meat per guest.Prepare 6 oz (180 g) of seafood per guest.
Prepare 1 to 2 servings of vegetables per guest.

, Each piece of meat should be cut into 3/4-inch (2-cm) pieces.


Blot the meat with paper towels to remove excess moisture and refrigerate it until ready to use.
Keep different types of meat separated while still raw to avoid cross-contamination.

, If you decide to go with an oil fondue, choose an oil with a moderate smoking point. Peanut oil and canola oil are your best bets.


If neither of these oils is available, however, you could opt for vegetable oil, grape seed oil, or clarified butter.

, Since the flavor of the broth will affect the flavor of the dippings you use, choose a broth that matches or otherwise enhances the flavor of your dippings.


Vegetable broths work for most fondue dippings and chicken broth works well for chicken, lamb, and pork. Beef broth is best for cooking beef, and seafood broth should be used for seafood.
Prepare 6 to 8 cups (1.5 to 2 L) of broth for a single 4-serving pot.

, Pour the oil or broth into a small saucepan and heat it over medium-high heat.


Broth should be heated to a steady boil.
Oil should reach a temperature of 350 to 375 degrees Fahrenheit (180 to 190 degrees Celsius). Check using a deep frying thermometer or candy thermometer, or test it by dropping a piece of bread into the oil. The oil is ready when it takes 30 seconds or less to turn golden brown., Carefully pour the hot liquid into an already warm fondue pot.


Light the burner beneath the fondue pot as instructed.
Pour the hot liquid into the fondue pot carefully to avoid burns.
The fondue pot should be 1/2 to 2/3 full.

, Skewer your dippings with a long fondue fork and cook them, one at a time, for a couple of minutes or until cooked through.


Always check your meat before eating it to verify that it has fully cooked.
Let the dippings cool slightly before eating them to avoid burning your mouth.
Note that the liquid level may decrease over time when using broth, so you might have to pour more in as time progresses.

, When cooking oil or broth fondue, you would usually serve the dippings with a variety of dips. Roughly 3 to 5 dips is standard, and each guest will use about 1/2 cup (125 ml) of the various dips.


For chicken or pork fondue, consider honey mustard or barbecue dips.
For lamb fondue, mint dips, sour cream dips, or cottage cheese dips.
For meatballs or beef fondue, try sweet and sour dips, mushroom dips, and mustard dips.
For seafood dips, try tartar sauce or cocktail sauce.

",How to Fondue Meat,"


Use a metal, enamelware or cast iron pot to fondue meat. Ceramic fondue pots are best suited to cheese and chocolate fondues.
Choose an electric, alcohol or butane powered burner. Fondue pots that use candles as a heat source do not stay hot enough to cook meat.
Look for a pot that has edges that curve inward at the top to reduce splashing of hot liquid.;
, Fondue forks are long 2-tined forks that are usually color-coded to prevent mix-ups between diners.


Prepare bamboo skewers for cooking if you do not have fondue forks. You must soak bamboo skewers for 30 minutes prior to cooking to reduce the chance of burning.

, When you fondue red meat, you typically only cook it for 30 to 60 seconds. Cuts of meat that require braising or roasting will be tough and sinewy if you use them for fondue.

,,,,


Consider broth if you want to add more flavor to the meat. You can infuse broth with herbs and spices. Choose a broth that corresponds to the type of meat you are using.
Use oil for a more traditional meat fondue. Suitable oil types include vegetable, canola, grapeseed, and peanut. Thoroughly dry meat pieces before cooking to prevent oil from splashing out of the fondue pot.

, The temperature should reach around 375 degrees F (190.5 degrees C). Check the temperature using a deep-frying thermometer.

,, Pour until the pot is 1/3 to 1/2 full. Be careful not to burn yourself with the hot liquid.

, You want to make sure the liquid remains around 375 degrees F (190.5 degrees C) as this is the ideal temperature for cooking the meat.


Re-test the temperature using a deep-frying thermometer if you let the cooking liquid cool at all before transferring it to the fondue pot. Place the thermometer in the hot liquid and note the reading.
Use a cube of bread to test the cooking liquid temperature if you are using oil and you don't have a deep-frying thermometer. Toss the bread cube in the hot oil and wait 30 seconds. If it becomes golden brown, the oil is the correct temperature.

,


Skewer a piece of meat with a fondue fork or bamboo skewer.
Dip the piece of meat in the cooking liquid. Cook red meat 30 seconds for rare, 45 seconds for medium-rare, or 1 minute for well done. Poultry requires 2 minutes of cooking and lamb and pork 1 minute.
Remove the cooked meat from the fondue pot and dislodge it from the fondue fork with a table fork.

Finish your omelet.,
Serve and enjoy.",How to Make a Tuna Egg Omelet1," Use a frying pan or skillet and add about 1 tbsp of cooking oil to it. Warm it over medium heat. Don't let your pan get so hot that the oil begins to smoke. Once the oil is shimmering and covers the surface of the pan it's ready.


You can also use a tbsp of butter. If you use butter, make sure not to let it burn or turn brown. This can add a burnt taste to your omelet.;
, Open 2 cans of tuna and drain the liquid. Scoop the tuna flakes into a bowl and sprinkle with a small amount of salt and pepper to taste. Set the bowl aside. You can use tuna canned in oil or in water. Here are some things to consider:


Tuna can be a great source of Omega-3 fats, but to get the most out of your tuna, choose tuna packed in water. When tuna is packed in oil, the oil mixes with some of the tuna’s natural fat, so when you drain oil-packed tuna, some of its Omega-3 fatty acids also go down the drain. Water packed tuna won't leech any of the Omega-3.
Oil-packed tuna will give you a richer-tasting and more flavorful tuna right out of the can. Of course, you can add your own seasonings and oil to the tuna yourself and you won't have to miss out on any of the valuable Omega-3s.

, Crack your eggs into a medium bowl. Use between 2 and 4 eggs depending on the size of the omelet you'd like. Use a fork or egg whisk to beat your eggs in the bowl until combined and set the bowl aside. You can use the entire egg or just the egg whites. Here are some things to consider:


Whole eggs, overall, are healthier for you. The more important consideration is where the eggs come from. Pasture-raised eggs from chickens that are roaming around eating plants and insects are the best choices. Look for organic eggs from hormone-free, cage-free chickens.If you are concerned about high-calorie counts and high cholesterol, combine whole eggs with egg whites to help keep important nutrients in the diet while cutting down on the fat and cholesterol.
If you are looking to make an extra fluffy omelet, add a splash of milk to your egg mixture and whisk it in., Pour your eggs into the preheated pan and reduce the heat to medium-low. Let your eggs cook for about a minute until the edges start to bubble. Use a rubber spatula to carefully peel up the edge and check the bottom for firmness and color.


If the bottom of your omelet is a pale yellow, let it cook until it begins to turn golden-brown.

, Use a fork to evenly distribute the tuna on the surface of your egg omelet. Try to avoid getting large chunks of tuna anywhere. This might make it difficult to fold your omelet later.


You can also flake your tuna all onto one side of the omelet and flip the other side to cover it later.

, Use a spatula to gently lift one side of the egg and fold it over the other. Place your spatula at one edge of the omelet and gently work it under one edge and fold the egg over itself.


If you have added all your tuna to just one side, fold over the side without tuna to cover the tuna.

, Flip your omelet after your fold has set (about 30 seconds) and cook until the underside is firm, golden brown, and crispy.


Take care not to overcook your omelet. This can cause it to dry out.

, Use your spatula to gently lift your omelet from the pan and onto a plate. Accompany with a piece of bacon, toast, or bowl of freshly sliced fruit and enjoy with hot sauce, grated cheese, or ketchup.

, After adding a little dash of salt and pepper, try some diced garlic, chili powder, parsley, chive, Worcestershire sauce, or anything else you'd like.

, Create your own unique mixture of your favorite ingredients and flavors. Mix your tuna in a bowl with diced onions, fresh cilantro, sliced mushrooms, grated cheese, spinach, bell pepper, or anything else you'd like. You can get as creative as you want.

, If you would like to add filling after cooking, don't fold your omelet. Instead, sprinkle your tuna over the entire surface and flip your omelet at one flat piece.

Turn the heat to medium-high, and allow the oil to heat until it starts to shimmer, which should take approximately 5 minutes.You can substitute butter for the olive oil if you prefer.;
, When the oil is hot, add a quarter of a large onion that’s been diced to the skillet. Allow the onion to cook until it is soft and tender, which should take 5 to 7 minutes.Stir the onion frequently with a wooden spoon or heatproof spatula while you’re sauteing it to ensure that it cooks evenly.

, Once the onion is soft, mix in 1 cup (175 g) of diced red bell pepper. Cook the pepper with the onion until it is tender, which should take 3 to 5 minutes.You can substitute your favorite type of pepper, such as yellow, green, or orange, for the red bell pepper.
You can add and/or substitute any of your favorite vegetables. Mushrooms and asparagus are tasty options.
Soft vegetables, such as tomatoes or avocado, don’t require sauteing. You can mix them into the eggs with the cheese and meat.

, When the pepper is soft, add ½ cup (115 g) of spinach that’s been shredded into ½-inch (1.3-cm) pieces to the skillet. Turn off the heat, and stir the spinach in until it’s just wilted, which should take about 1 minute.You can substitute your favorite leafy green for the spinach. Arugula and Swiss chard are delicious options. If you’re not a fan of leafy greens, leave out the spinach.

, To ensure that the oven will be warm enough to cook the omelettes, it’s important to preheat it. Set the temperature to 350 degrees (177 degrees Celsius), and allow it to heat fully.Make sure that you understand how your oven indicates that it’s reached the desired temperature. It will probably flash an indicator light or beep to let you know.

, For the omelettes, you’ll need 2 8-ounce (237 ml) glass mason jars. To ensure that the omelettes don’t stick, spray the inside of the jars with a generous amount of nonstick cooking spray.If you prefer to use butter to grease the jars, soften it slightly and use a pastry brush or piece of parchment paper that’s folded into a strip to apply it to the inside of the jars.

, Add 4 large eggs, 4 egg whites, and 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of milk to a medium bowl. Whisk the ingredients together until the eggs are fluffy and thick.To separate the whites from the eggs, break them on a flat surface, such as a countertop or table. Separate the egg into two halves over a bowl, allowing the yolk to fall into the lower half. Move the yolk back and forth between the halves, while the white drips out into the bowl below. Continue moving the yolk until all of the white is removed.
You can substitute heavy cream for the milk if you want your omelettes to have a richer texture.

, After you’ve beaten the eggs, add salt and pepper to the mixture to taste as well as a ½ tbsp (5 g) of garlic powder. Whisk the seasonings in until they’re fully incorporated.You can omit the garlic powder if you prefer. You can also substitute or add your favorite spices or herbs, such as chopped parsley, basil, thyme, crushed red pepper flakes, or cayenne pepper.

, Once the eggs are mixed, you can begin preparing the jars. Divide the sauteed vegetables evenly between the two jars and add 2 tablespoons (20 g) of the shredded cheese of your choice and 2 tablespoons (27 ½ g) of the chopped, cooked meat of your choice to each jar.Use your favorite cheese in the omelettes. Swiss, cheddar, monterey jack, pepper jack, and mozzarella are tasty options.
Use your favorite meat in the omelettes. Bacon, sausage, and ham are delicious options.
For a healthier version of the omelettes, consider using turkey bacon or sausage.
You can use vegetable meat substitutes, such as veggie bacon strips or veggie sausage patties, if you're a vegetarian.
If you prefer, you can also omit the cheese and/or the meat completely.

, When you’ve added the vegetables, cheese, and meat to the jars, divide the egg mixture between the two jars. You should fill them approximately three-quarters of the way full. Next, place the lids and shake the jars well to mix all of the ingredients through the eggs.You shouldn’t fill the jars all the way to the top because the eggs puff as they cook.

, After you’ve mixed the omelettes, remove the lids from the jars. Place the jars on a baking sheet, and set them in the preheated oven. Allow them to cook until the tops of the omelettes start to brown, which should take approximately 15 to 20 minutes.If you like, you can sprinkle a pinch of shredded cheese over the top of the jars before placing them in the oven.

, When the omelettes are finished baking, remove them from the oven. Allow them to cool for 5 to 10 minutes before serving them.You can eat the omelettes directly from the jar or run a knife around them to loosen them from the jar so you can turn them out on plates.

, If you are making the omelettes ahead of time, allow them to cool for 10 to 15 minutes. Place the lids on them, and store them in the refrigerator .They will keep for up 5 days.You can reheat the omelettes in the microwave. Heat them on high in 30 second intervals until they’re warm enough.

Crack your eggs on the edge of the pan or with anything else including your knuckle, and break them into the pan.

,
Whip the eggs with chopsticks or any plastic or wooden utensil; metal would scratch the teflon finish.,
Put the pan on medium heat.,
Flip the omelet to cook the other side, using a plastic spatula, or chopsticks, or even, if you dare, by tossing it into the air in such a way that it lands the opposite side down.

,
Add any other ingredients at this point: pre-grilled onions or mushrooms, or some slices of cheese, on top of the omelet.

,
Continue cooking for another few minutes; if the top was already cooked before you flipped it, another minute should be sufficient to brown it nicely.

,
Fold it over if you wish, especially if there's cheese on it, as it helps to melt the cheese.,
Eat with a plastic fork or chopsticks.",How to Make a One Pan Omelet," You can maybe skip this step if you really trust the teflon.;
,, About one minute is usually enough to get the eggs to a uniform consistency. Of course the oil gets thoroughly mixed in with the eggs too, but it doesn't seem to matter.

, Cook until at least half the top is cooked, usually 5 to 10 minutes.

,,,, You might want to let it sit for a few minutes before eating, or microwave it for 30 seconds to finish cooking the filling without risk of scorching the omelet (the latter approach, of course, eliminates the ""one pan"" advantage, since you cannot microwave anything in a metal container).

, Wipe out any remaining crumbs with a paper towel, shirt, or whatever, or wash it in mild Castile soap.

Mushrooms
Scallions
Spinach
Tomatoes
Onions (especially yellow)

, Any meat that you add should already be cooked; it won't continue to cook once you add it in. Meats that go well in omelets include:Bacon
Ham
Sausage

, You can use fresh or dried herbs. Most recipes will call for about 1 tablespoon of fresh herbs. If you are using dried herbs, reduce the amount to 1 teaspoon. This is because dried herbs are much more potent.


Basil
Chervil
Chives
Cilantro or parsley
Tarragon
Thyme

, You will need 1 to 2 tablespoons of shredded cheese. Cheddar cheese is the most popular, but you can also use other types as well, including mozzarella and parmesan. You can even try crumbled goat cheese or feta cheese!

, You will need 2 to 3 tablespoons of shredded Cheddar cheese, 2 tablespoons of cooked, diced ham, and 1 tablespoon of diced, fresh bell pepper., Add ½ cup (100 grams) of diced, fresh tomatoes to your omelet, along with 1 tablespoon of chopped basil and 1 tablespoon of parmesan cheese., Fill the omelet with 2 tablespoons of shredded Mexican cheese blend.

",How to Make a Frittata," Add 1 tablespoon of butter to your pan and turn the heat on to medium-high heat. Let the butter melt and heat your pan. You can cook your frittata in a 12-inch nonstick saute pan or cast-iron skillet. The pan doesn't have to have shallow sides since you won't be flipping or folding the frittata.Make sure the pan you use is oven-safe since you'll be finishing the frittata in the oven or under the broiler.;
, As the butter melts and your pan heats up, add any pre-cooked vegetables and meat to quickly warm them up (about 2 minutes). You can use leftover vegetables or meat that you have in your refrigerator. Spread them so they form a single layer on the bottom of the pan.You can start with 1/2 cup of veggies and 1/2 cup of meat, although you can add more if you'd like to make a bigger frittata.
If you're cooking raw vegetables, be sure to completely cook the vegetables (the time will vary depending on what veggies you're using).

, Add 1 ounce of grated Parmesan cheese, 6 whole eggs, and 1 teaspoon of ground black pepper into a mixing bowl. Whisk the mixture until it's completely combined.








You can transfer or make the base in a mixing bowl with a pouring spout. This can make it easier to pour the egg mixture into your pan.

, Pour the egg base evenly in your pan so that it touches any vegetables and meats you're using. Stir and cook the frittata over medium-high heat for 4 or 5 minutes. The eggs will just start to firm up. If you want to use any chopped fresh herbs, sprinkle them over the top now.


Use a heat-proof rubber spatula to stir the eggs. This will also prevent the spatula from scraping and ruining the bottom of your nonstick pan.

, If you'd like to ensure a golden color on the top of your frittata, heat your broiler to high and place the frittata under the broiler for 2 to 4 minutes. The frittata should brown and puff up. If you're not comfortable with broiling, you could bake the frittata to finish it. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Bake your frittata for 8 to 10 minutes or until the eggs are set.








Broiling the frittata will also create a crispy top. Just keep a close eye while broiling the frittata since it will finish cooking very quickly.

, A frittata made with a 12-inch pan and 6 eggs can get between 6 and 8 slices. Slice the frittata using a sharp knife or pizza cutter. You can serve the frittata hot, right out of the oven or cooled to room temperature.








Always take care when using sharp knives. You should also remember to use oven mitts to take your frittata out of the oven or from under the broiler.

, While it's true that you can use whatever cheese you happen to have in your refrigerator, choosing a specific cheese or two will give your frittata a distinctive flavor. These cheeses are known for the following characteristics:Feta: use this cheese if you want a sharp, salty flavor.
Ricotta: use just a little of this cheese for a really creamy taste.
Goat cheese: pick this cheese for a tart and rich flavor.
Cheddar: choose this cheese for its great melting quality and traditional taste.
Smoked gouda or mozzarella: a smoked cheese can make your frittata taste richer.

, It's easier and faster to use leftover vegetables that have already been cooked. Roasted vegetables have an extra dimension of caramelized sweetness that works really well in a frittata. Of course, if you want to cook your vegetables in the frittata, ensure that they're totally cooked before you add the egg base to your pan. Good vegetables for frittatas include:








Diced potatoes
Roasted or grilled asparagus
Diced onion
Broccoli
Bell pepper (can be roasted)
Sliced mushrooms
Sliced leeks
Fresh herbs: like parsley, oregano, basil

, Although you can cook raw vegetables in the frittata pan, you should really use already cooked meats when making the frittata. Frittatas don't need much meat, so you can use a combination of whatever meats you have left in your refrigerator. Try using:Shredded chicken, beef or pork
Diced ham or sausage
Crumbled bacon
Tofu

, Many classic Italian frittatas use a variety of cheeses. You can even use a high-quality ricotta for a light and creamy frittata. Italian frittatas also use rich meats. Try one of these cured meats:Salami
Soppressata
Mortadella
Prosciutto

, If you're planning on serving the frittata as a main dish, you can make it even more filling by adding leftover pasta. Use cooked pasta that isn't covered in sauce or the frittata may not set up properly. You'll want to add about one cup of pasta along with your other ingredients.Rice is another good starch option to add some substance to your frittata. Add 1 cup of cooked rice along with your other ingredients.

, Although frittatas are great on their own, you can round out your meal by serving the frittata with toast and gourmet cheeses. For something more exciting, you could serve the frittata with arugula (a peppery leafy green) or sauteed greens.


If your frittata is very creamy, greens can offset some of the richness.

, A frittata made in a 12"" pan will make 6 to 8 slices of frittata. But if you want to feed more people, you can make a frittata in a 9x13"" pan which will serve 8 to 10 people. To make a larger frittata, saute your veggies, meats, and other add-in ingredients before placing them in a greased 9x13"" pan. Beat 12 eggs with about 1/4 cup of milk and pour it in your pan. Sprinkle cheese over the frittata and bake it at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 45 minutes.Let the frittata cool for a few minutes before cutting it into as many squares as you like.

, To make the sandwiches, bake a 9x13"" frittata for a crowd. Use biscuit cutters to cut out rounds of frittata. Sandwich a frittata circle between a slice of cheese and sliced English muffin. To make frittata muffins, simply divide the frittata batter in a greased muffin tin. Bake the mini frittata muffins at 350 degrees F (170 degrees C) for 25 to 30 minutes. Serve these immediately.You can also let the sandwiches or muffins cool completely, wrap them individually and freeze them.

",How to Make a Mushroom Omelette2," For a lighter omelette, use 4 egg whites instead.The water will evaporate when you fry the eggs, and help make them fluffier in the end., If you are using whole eggs (instead of whites), make sure that you break the yolks up. You won't be scrambling the eggs once you add them into the frying pan.

, The butter will start to sizzle and foam. Don't add the eggs yet. Instead, wait until the foam starts to disappear., Once you have the eggs on the pain, continue tilting the pan around until the entire bottom is evenly covered with the egg mixture.If necessary, use the tip of your spatula to help spread the egg mixture across the bottom of the pan.

Consider the nutritional value of egg yolks.,
Substitute egg whites to limit cholesterol.,
Buy local, cage free, and organic.,
Use whole eggs and egg whites together.",How to Make a Healthy Omelet1," Though whole eggs contain a bit more protein than egg whites, their relative value comes from nutrients and vitamins that are plentiful in the egg yolk. For instance, even a small raw egg contains meaningful amounts of iron, phosphorus, zinc, and folate. Further, yolks also contain good vitamins A and D, as well as a bunch of choline, lutein, and zeaxanthin, all of which your body needs., One small whole egg contains 54 calories and 47% of your daily allotment of cholesterol, while the equivalent amount of egg whites contains only 17 calories and 0 cholesterol. If you’re counting calories or watching your cholesterol intake, egg whites may be the better option. Otherwise, whole eggs may be the better option, as they contain many healthy vitamins and nutrients.For egg whites, there is variation in flavor and consistency between different brands. If you don’t like the first type of egg whites you try, switch brands and try another - some cook more easily than others too.
Follow the container for the equivalent amount of egg white to use in exchange for whole eggs. Usually, two of the “equivalent” amount will cook up to about as much as one whole egg, in terms of size.
You can also make your own egg whites by removing the yolks from eggs yourself. There are several easy ways to do so at home.

, The best place to get eggs is a local farmer’s market. Not only will they be fresh and flavorful, they often come from healthier hens. At the grocery store, opt for cage-free, organic eggs or egg whites. These will ensure that the hens were not fed unhealthy food that may translate into health risks for you., A solid compromise is to use egg whites along with a whole egg. For a personal omelet, use one whole egg and two egg whites. (This is the rough equivalent of four egg whites or two whole eggs.) This effectively maximizes the protein to calorie ratio of your omelet. "
"
Strengthen an omelet with spinach.,
Bulk up the omelet with bell peppers.,
Make a mostly veggie omelet.,
Add black beans.,
Use light cheese and lean meat.,
Mix in some quinoa.",How to Make a Healthy Omelet2," Spinach adds several healthy benefits to your omelet. In particular, it’s got a ton of iron, which will help you stay healthy and gain strength. It’s also got a good amount of filling fiber and a bunch of magnesium, which is vital to both neurological and metabolic health. Perhaps best of all, there is no need to worry about how much you add - throw in as much as you’d like.For example, make a spinach and low-fat cottage cheese omelet. Add tomatoes, and season with salt and pepper., Another great vegetable to add to your omelet is bell pepper. Just ¼ cup of chopped peppers will provide more than enough vitamin C. Add whichever color bell pepper you prefer. Aside from supporting your immune system, vitamin C can help your body burn fat and convert carbs into usable fuel. Further, it can even help your muscles grow and recover after a workout.

, There a plenty of veggies you can add to your omelet. In fact, creatively changing up your omelets can help make a staple meal into an ongoing (and delicious) experiment of new dishes. For instance, adding two or three ounces of a cooked vegetable can make an omelet both healthier and more filling.Especially enjoyable additions include asparagus, zucchini, mushrooms, eggplant, tomato, and avocado.

, Another way to add fiber - and good fiber at that - is by adding beans to your omelet. The benefit of doing so is two fold: you’ll stay full for longer, and your body will lose body fat more easily. Soluble fiber also helps reduce some of your cholesterol levels, counteracting some of the cholesterol found in eggs.


Add diced tomatoes, garlic powder, and cayenne for a southwest-inspired flavor profile.

, Cheese is one of the main sources of saturated fat and cholesterol in many people’s diets. Meat is another. The healthiest route is foregoing meat and cheese in your omelet altogether, but you can get away with using a bit of reduced fat cheese and lean meat options.For instance, make a ham and cheese omelet with two egg whites, ¾ ounce of reduced fat Swiss cheese, an ounce of extra-lean ham (about ¼ cup, cubed), and scallions to bring out the omelet’s flavor.

, Omelets aren’t just for breakfast anymore. You can make an especially savory omelet by adding quinoa, which will add both flavor and texture normally foreign to egg-based dishes. Plus, quinoa is the grain with the most protein, and contains especially healthy unsaturated fats as well as filling fiber.Try adding a ¼ cup of cooked quinoa with spinach, tomatoes, and kalamata olives. Season this one with cumin.

"
"
Opt for coconut oil.,
Ensure your omelet won’t stick.,
Limit stirring.,
Season predominantly with pepper.",How to Make a Healthy Omelet3," While extra-virgin olive oil is a perfectly good option, coconut oil can actually help you lose weight. As such, it’s one of the best options to grease your pan. Use a tablespoon or so, and let it fully melt before adding eggs.The coconut flavor will be subtle, if you even notice it. If you do, add turmeric to season the omelet. These two lead to great flavor combination.
While butter will work, it's much less healthy. If you insist on using butter, don't overdo it. Two teaspoons is plenty to grease your pan.

, Add oil to the pan. Both eggs and egg whites are notorious for sticking to cookware. Even with a well-seasoned cast iron skillet, you’ll want to make sure your pan is ready to resist your omelet’s likely stickiness. Wait for the pan to heat up before adding the eggs. The oil should be sending up thin wisps of smoke, so that when the eggs hit, they’ll sizzle.
Don’t cook anything in the pan beforehand. Residue from other ingredients will cause egg whites in particular to stick. If you want to cook other ingredients before you put together your omelet, do so in a separate pan or wipe the pan clean before cooking the eggs.

, Leave eggs or egg whites alone for 15 seconds after you put them in the pan. Use a spatula to push back eggs that have set every couple seconds thereafter, with the burner on medium to medium-high. Tilt the pan to help uncooked egg get into contact with the pan, and continue as such until the egg no longer runs.Turn the heat down to low add whatever ingredients you’re including. Finally, fold one half of the omelet over onto the other, let it settle for a few minutes in the pan, and viola!

, Black pepper contains a compound called piperine, which can add spice to your omelet, and fight the formation of new fat cells too. As a rule of thumb, use a bit more pepper than salt. (This helps keep your salt amount low too.)Feel free to mix in other herbs and spices at liberty. These will offer additional flavor that add to the enjoyment and fulfillment you derive from your meal. Try basil, turmeric, dill, rosemary, thyme, and more.

Use a spatula to scramble the eggs further.,
Remove the eggs from the pan.",How to Make Scrambled Eggs Without Milk," You'll need a bowl large enough to contain your eggs, and something to beat the egg mixture. A whisk or a fork can work well for this.;
, Carefully crack the eggs against the lip of the bowl, or against the countertop if the bowl isn't heavy (but be careful not to get egg everywhere!). Pull the shell apart, making sure not to get any shell into the bowl.


If you do get shell into the bowl, remove it with a spatula or spoon.

, Take your fork or whisk and scramble the eggs together, making sure that the egg whites get fully mixed with the yolks. Be careful not to scramble the mixture too vigorously; you don't want your egg to fly out of the bowl.

, If you've chosen to add in herbs or spices, now is the time to add them. Ensure that the pieces are flake-sized, and sprinkle them into the egg mixture if they are. Then scramble it thoroughly again to ensure they get properly mixed in.


If the pieces are not flakes, you may want to wait to add them until you cook the eggs.

, Grease the skillet with butter to make sure that the eggs don't stick to the pan. Use minimal amounts of butter; you don't want your eggs to be drowning in it! Once the pan sizzles slightly, it's ready to cook the eggs.


Don't use oil to grease the pan; this changes the taste of the eggs. If you're worried about your fat intake, try using a low-fat substitute such as margarine.

, Don't worry about whether or not it covers the whole pan; just make sure that the eggs get in.

, After you pour the eggs into the pan, scatter in other food ingredients, such as large herbs, vegetables, cheese, or anything else you wanted to add. Take care to make sure these don't overcook while you cook the eggs.

, Move the eggs around in the pan with a spatula to make sure that they get cooked thoroughly. You may wish to use the spatula to separate some of the pieces, which can make it easier to cook since it's in smaller amounts. Once you've cooked one side of the eggs, flip them over to make sure the other side gets cooked, as well.


The definition of ""thoroughly cooked"" scrambled eggs may vary. Some people prefer slightly runny scrambled eggs, while others prefer for them to be cooked all the way through. In either case, make sure that the eggs don't ""leak"" - there's a difference between ""slightly runny"" and undercooked, and undercooked eggs carry the risk of transmitting disease.

, Once you're sure that the eggs are thoroughly cooked, use the spatula to remove the eggs from the pan and place them on a plate. If using other ingredients, feel free to top the eggs with more of it; you can also garnish the eggs with herbs if you like, maybe add some vegetables to the side, and serve it alone or alongside another food such as bacon, toast, or bagels.

Pour the goat's milk into a small to medium sauce pot and heat over low to medium-low heat until it reaches the appropriate temperature, stirring often to avoid scalding it by mistake. Do not allow the milk to boil, since the proteins can be damaged at boiling temperatures.;
, Cover the pan, and allow the milk to cool at room temperature to about 105 degrees Fahrenheit (40.5 degrees Celsius).

, As the milk sits, a skin will start to develop over the top. This skin is not harmful, but it can create an unusual texture in your final product, so you would benefit from removing it. Pour the milk through a fine mesh strainer and into a separate bowl or pot.

, Use a glass measuring cup or pour it into a glass bowl.

, Stir the fiber into the milk until completely dissolved. This will allow the powdered fiber to reach a more suitable temperature for the rest of the milk.

, Whisk the milk well to ensure that the fiber spreads into the entire batch.

, Once more, use a glass measuring cup or glass bowl.

, Add the culture starter into the separated milk, stirring until dissolved. As with the powdered fiber, adding the culture starter to a smaller amount of milk gradually brings it up to temperature, ensuring that it spreads better into the larger batch.

, Whisk the milk thoroughly to spread the culture starter throughout.

, The jars need to be made of glass since chemicals from metal and plastic can bleed into the yogurt. The jars must also have lids. Leave at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) of empty space in between the surface of the milk and the rim of the jar so that the yogurt has room to expand.

, The temperature should be between 80 and 90 degrees Fahrenheit (27 to 32 degrees Celsius) at minimum. You could try storing the jars on top of your refrigerator, or you could also place the jars on top of a saucer placed above a heating pad set to the lowest possible setting., Wrapping the jars in clean dish towels traps heat from the surrounding location and further insulates the jars.

, In order to form yogurt, the cultured milk needs between 6 to 12 hours to incubate in warmth.

, Since yogurt made with goat's milk tends to be thinner than yogurt made with cow's milk, you may want to drain some of the liquid out before consuming it. Place the cultured yogurt in a wire mesh strainer lined with cheesecloth. Place the strainer above a bowl so that the sides of the strainer rest on the rim of the bowl, allowing the liquid to drain out. Place the strainer and bowl in the refrigerator for an hour or until you achieve the desired thickness. If you allow the yogurt to drain too long, it will take on a cheese-like consistency.

, As is, this organic yogurt is not very sweet. You can sweeten it by adding a little bit of raw organic honey. If you prefer flavored yogurts, you can mix in some berries or granola, as well.

, It should chill for an additional 5 to 7 hours before you eat it. The yogurt itself can last up to 2 weeks when kept sealed and chilled.

Use fat free milk to help make your yoghurt thicker.,
Add 1/2 cup of milk powder to the milk before you start heating it.,
Heat the milk to a higher temperature - 200ºF (95ºC).,
Allow the milk to cool sufficiently, then add the yoghurt culture.,
Let the yoghurt sit for a minimum of seven hours at a temperature close to 110ºF (45ºC).,
Strain the yoghurt for a longer time.,
Use the yoghurt from this batch to start the next batch.

",How to Make Homemade Yoghurt Thicker," Try fat free milk and you will notice that it makes a thicker yoghurt than regular milk.;
, This, too, helps thicken the final product.

, Keep the milk at the higher temperature for a full 20 minutes, stirring occasionally and monitoring continually.


This is a higher temperature than is normally recommended and allows the moisture in the milk to evaporate, resulting in a thicker yoghurt.
If you have one, use a double boiler as this will make it easier to maintain the temperature with little stirring.
Make sure to use an accurate thermometer that covers the temperature range 90-212ºF (30-100ºC) and do not let the milk get too hot or become scorched. A candy thermometer is great for this.

, It is best to use cold running water reduce the temperature below 120ºF (50ºC), but don't let it to go below 90ºF (32ºC).

, The longer the yoghurt sits, the thicker it will become, so let it sit longer than you normally would, certainly for at least seven hours.

, It is very important to strain the yoghurt through a colander lined with cheesecloth to remove whey, the yellowish, watery liquid in the yoghurt. Place the strainer over a bowl to catch the whey and place the assembly in your refrigerator during the straining process. You can strain it for a few minutes or overnight, depending on how thick you want it to be - the longer, the better for creating thick yoghurt.

Be creative!",How to Make Plain Yogurt Sweeter," This is a healthy way to sweeten the yogurt. You can mix it only slightly to give the yogurt a swirly touch, or you can mix thoroughly. Taste it, and, if you wish, add more. Remember: you can always add more honey, but you can never take away honey.
, This is actually not less healthy than adding honey. It is usually less natural, however, and you can't make swirls using them. Instead, sprinkle some on your yogurt, give it a mix, and taste. You can add more if you wish. The same goes for sugar, too. You can't take away the sugar you've put into it., Berries, cantaloupe, and mangos work well, as well as other soft fruit. Demolish the fruit into little bits, or just place them into the yogurt. Large fruits, such as cantaloupe and mangos, will need to be cut into bite-size pieces. Choose sweet, juicy fruit, although other types of fruit will still work. Dried fruit, like raisins or craisins, work well also., Jam surprisingly also works very well. Some people like taking out the little tidbits of fruit in them, but some people enjoy the contrast of texture. You may also mix it in swirls, or mix it thoroughly, just like honey., All types of chocolate can be added: dark chocolate or light chocolate or melted chocolate. Make sure they are all crushed into bite-size pieces or melted. Dark chocolate tends to be more healthy., Your additions to your plain yogurt are definitely not limited to these options. Experiment with what you add and how much you add. Apple butter, peanut butter, sun butter, granola, extracts, anything!"

Prepare the milk.,
Let the milk cool down.,
Add the yogurt or culture packets.,
Keep the yogurt warm for approximately 4 to 12 hours.,
Strain the yogurt.,
Serve.",How to Make Greek Yoghurt1," Pour 1 liter (¼ gallon) of milk into a clean saucepan and let it heat until it's just nearly scalding. When it reaches a temperature of about 176° F (80° C), remove it from the burner.





;
, You can use an ice-bath if you like, or simply let it cool on its own. When the milk cools down to a temperature of 108° to 115° F (42° to 46° C), transfer it into a glass or earthenware bowl. Do not use stainless steel. Allow to cool down until it's just warm.









Why shouldn't you use stainless steel as a receptacle for the milk? Yogurt is made using bacteria cultures, which need very specific environments to survive and breed in. Using metal (stainless steel) can interfere with the bacteria culture.

, First check that the milk has cooled to the right temperature. Feel the side of the bowl with your hands. If it has cooled down enough, whisk in 3 tablespoons of live yogurt or one yogurt starter package until completely incorporated.









If you incorporate plain yogurt into your milk, make sure the yogurt you use contains a live culture. Check the label on the yogurt packet to make sure that ""live culture"" is written on there somewhere. (Some commercial yogurt products don't contain a live culture.)
If using a yogurt starter packet (which contains the necessary bacteria culture), follow the manufacturer's directions about which proportions to use.

, Cover your not-yet-yogurt with a clean towel, turn on the oven to its warm setting, and let rest for at least 4 hours but preferably overnight. If you can, try to set the oven's temperature so that it stays at a steady 108° F for the entire time.








Why does the bacteria need heat to make yogurt out of milk? 108° F is approximately the temperature at which the yogurt cultures begin consuming the lactose in the milk. This process is called fermentation, and it's the same process that produces beer from wheat or wine from grapes.

, The next morning, the yogurt should look like a white firm custard. Next, place the cheesecloth or muslin cloth into the sieve, with a glass bowl placed underneath. Ladle the yogurt into the cloth and allow it to strain, until it achieves your desired consistency.









As the draining process will take several hours, it's best to transfer it into the fridge. This process gets rid of all the excess water and makes your yoghurt thicker and much creamier.
If you don't have muslin cloth or cheesecloth to strain the whey from the yogurt, use an old t-shirt that you aren't particularly tied to.

, When your yogurt has reached the consistency that you wish, it is ready to eat. It can be enjoyed plain, with nuts or honey, fruit, or even be used for the base for sauces like tzatziki. Enjoy!

Make use of the whey.,
Pay your bacteria forward.,
Use your yogurt in dozens of delicious recipes.",How to Make Greek Yoghurt2," Instead of discarding the whey that becomes a by-product of Greek yogurt, find a use for it instead. If you're really intrepid, you can drink it straight up, although it may not taste very appetizing. Here are some ideas you can tweak to make use of your leftover whey:









Freeze it up in an ice cube tray and add it to your smoothies for added nutritional content.If you don't want to hassle with freezing it, you can just add it as-is to your smoothie.
Replace buttermilk, milk, or water with whey in your baking. Have a recipe that requires one of those three? Why not try whey instead? Use whey to bake bread or even pancakes.

, Once you make your own yogurt, you can use the bacteria cultures present in it to serve as the starter for your next batch of yogurt. The third or fourth generation starter, however, might not be as tasty as a first generation starter, so be sure to invest in some new bacteria after the third or fourth batch of yogurt.








, Yogurt is fantastic on its own, especially if it's homemade. You can also use yogurt in a number of great-tasting recipes if you accidentally make a too-big batch and don't know what to do with it. Here are some ideas for you to ponder:

",How to Make Lemon Yogurt," Put your bigger stock pot in the sink, and place the smaller pot inside it. Fill the larger pot with water until you get about halfway up the side of the smaller pot. During this step, your milk and starter yogurt should be at room temperature.


This step is optional, but it can help keep your results consistent and prevent the milk from scalding. If your milk scalds, you will not be able to use it to make yogurt.;
, Place the thermometer and spoon in the large pot full of water, and place your smaller pot upside-down on top of it. Bring the water to a boil. Use tongs or an oven mitt to remove the tools from the boiling water, and dry them with a towel.


This step is also optional, but because you have to bring water to a boil regardless, you should ensure that everything you are using is sterile.

, Add the milk to the pot. If you did not create a water jacket with the 2 pots before starting, you can heat the milk in its own pot. Make sure you constantly stir it to prevent scalding. Pour the milk slowly because the small pot will try to float in the boiling water. Clip your thermometer onto the side of the pot with the milk.

, This step is necessary to get the milk proteins ready for the culture. You can do this without a thermometer, but you need to watch carefully for the milk to froth. Constantly stir the milk, and keep the water boiling. Hold the milk at this temperature for a 30 minutes if you want a thick yogurt consistency.

, This is the temperature the milk needs to be to get the cultures to reproduce on their own. You can either fill a sink with cold water and cool down the milk with a water bath, or allow the milk to cool on its own.

, If you do not have plain, active cultured yogurt, you can use freeze-dried cultures. This is the only batch of yogurt you will need for the starter. All subsequent batches can be started using a portion of the previous batch.

, Place it in a corner where it will not be bothered, and cover it with a lid. Put a heating pad set to medium on top of a cutting board, and put the pot of milk on top of it. Cover the pot with a towel.

, Use a spatula to ensure the milk has curdled. Stir the yogurt to mix curds and liquid.

, Usually old yogurt or ricotta cheese containers work well. Put in the back of the refrigerator where it is the coldest. Allow the yogurt to chill undisturbed overnight.

, Do not attempt to add flavoring or sweetener to the yogurt before the bacteria have had their chance to work. Since there is no added sugar in the formula, this is a healthier option. Add honey or Stevia if you want a natural or calorie-free sweetener. Save a few tablespoons (30 to 45 mL) for starting your next batch.

Strain the almond milk mixture to remove unblended parts of the nuts from the liquid. You can use cheesecloth, a tea ball, or a nut milk bag available from specialty foods stores for this step.;
, Because culture starter products are different, you'll need to check the package directions to determine the exact amount of culture starter to add to the almond milk. Many culture starter products recommend preparing the culture starter and almond milk mix when the almond milk is at room temperature. If necessary, you can warm the yogurt on a low setting on the stove.

, Whether or not you use a yogurt maker, the fermentation process usually takes about 8 hours.


An automatic yogurt maker will alert you when the fermentation process is complete.
If you do not have a yogurt maker, you can put the almond mixture into a Dutch oven and place it in an oven on the warm setting for 4 to 6 hours, place it into an insulated thermos for 8 hours (transfer the mixture to a clean container for cooling in the next step), or place it into a sealed crock pot that you have warmed but unplugged for 8 hours.

Keep it at this temperature for at least 10 minutes. Optionally, for every gallon of milk you can add a cup of sugar and a pinch of salt. This helps the bacteria work and improves the taste of the resulting yogurt without decreasing it's nutritional value.;
, You'll need a thermometer to do this as temperatures are important. This milk now is referred to as tempered milk.

, This is the starter. The culture can be store-bought yogurt with live cultures in it, packets of yogurt culture bought online or at your local health food store, or from prior yogurt you have made and kept refrigerated or frozen. This step is extremely important as the culture has the bacteria in it that you needs to be distributed throughout the yogurt. You can use flavored yogurt. The final yogurt may taste faintly of the flavor you use. Keep the amount of any store-bought yogurt culture you use to under 5 tablespoons (73.9 ml) or you will risk curdling the milk before it starts to turn to yogurt. Yogurt has acid in it which can curdle milk.

",How to Make Yogurt," Using two large pots that fit inside one another, create a double boiler. This will prevent your milk from burning, and you should only have to stir it occasionally. If you cannot do this, and must heat the milk directly, be sure to monitor it constantly, stirring all of the while. If you do not have a thermometer, 185ºF (85ºC) is the temperature at which milk starts to froth. It is highly recommended that you obtain a thermometer in the range of 100 - 212ºF, especially if you plan to make yogurt on an ongoing basis.You can use any kind of milk, including whole milk, 2 percent, 1 percent, nonfat, pasteurized, homogenized, organic, raw, diluted evaporated, dry powdered, cow, goat, soybean, and more. UHP, or ultra-high pasteurized milk, is processed to a higher temperature, which breaks down some of the proteins that the bacteria need to make the milk into yogurt. Some have reported difficulties in making yogurt from UHP.;
, The best way to do this is with a cold water bath. This will quickly and evenly lower the temperature, and requires only occasional stirring. If cooling at room temperature, or in the refrigerator, you must stir it more frequently. Don't proceed until the milk is below 120ºF (49ºC), and don't allow it to go below 90ºF (32ºC); 110ºF (43ºC) is optimal.

, The starter is the bacteria that you add to the milk, which in turn cultivates more bacteria--bacteria that is necessary for the creation of yogurt. Let the starter yogurt sit at room temperature while you're waiting for the milk to cool. This will prevent it from being too cold when you add it in.All yogurt needs ""good"" bacteria. The easiest way to add this is to use existing yogurt. The first time you make your own yogurt, use store-bought plain (unflavored) yogurt. Be certain it has ""active cultures"" on the label. Yogurt cultures die over time so try and find the freshest yogurt that has a tart flavor, but no added flavors or other additives. Taste various plain yogurts before you get started. You will find that different kinds taste a bit different. Use one you like for your own starter. The different flavors are due to other bacteria than the two main bacteria needed to create yogurt.
Alternatively, instead of using existing yogurt, use freeze-dried bacteria cultures (available in specialty stores or online), which are more reliable as a starter.
In a pinch, you can use a flavored yogurt, but the taste of the resulting cultured yogurt will not be exactly the same as using plain yogurt.

, Adding about 1/4 cup to 1/2 cup dry milk at this time will increase the nutritional content of the yogurt. The yogurt will also thicken more easily. This is especially helpful if you're using nonfat milk.

, Add 2 tablespoons of the existing yogurt, or add the freeze-dried bacteria. Stir with a whisk or use a blender (such as a stick blender) to evenly distribute the bacteria throughout the milk. If you still have stringy ropes you may be heating your milk too fast or too long (scalding). Use a double boiler in that case, or at least stir regularly and check temperature with a thermometer. At high altitudes this can be more of a problem.

, Pour the milk into a clean container or containers. Cover each one tightly with a lid or plastic wrap.You could also use bell jars if you are so inclined, but these are not necessary.

, Keep the yogurt warm and still to encourage bacterial growth, while keeping the temperature as close to 100ºF (38ºC) as possible. The longer the mixture incubates, the thicker and more tangy the yogurt will be.


Keep the yogurt still during incubation. Jiggling won't ruin it, but it makes it take a lot longer to incubate.
After seven hours, you'll have a custard-like texture, a cheesy odor, and possibly some greenish liquid on top. This is exactly what you want. The longer you let it sit beyond seven hours, the thicker and tangier it will become.

, Use a thermometer to make sure the temperature stays consistent. Choose the method that is most convenient and consistent for you. The most common way is to use a yogurt maker. The proper way to use a yogurt maker is detailed in the following steps.You could also use the pilot light in your oven, or preheat the oven to the desired temperature, turn it off, and then leave the oven light on to maintain the temperature.Turn your oven on periodically, as needed to maintain the temperature. This method is tricky; make sure that it doesn't get too hot. Or, you could use the bread proof setting if your oven has one.
Other methods include using a food dehydrator, a rice cooker’s warm setting, a heating pad set to low, or a crock pot set on its lowest setting.
If you have none of these things, you could use a sunny window or a car in the sun. Note that light exposure may degrade the nutrition in the milk. It is best to maintained the temperature below 120ºF (49ºC), don't allow it to go below 90ºF (32ºC); blood temp to 110ºF (43ºC) is optimal.Additionally, you could place the container of yogurt in warm water in a sink, large bowl, or small picnic cooler.

, There are several categories of retail yogurt makers available today, if you decide to use a yogurt maker (which is recommended.) Yogurt makers allow for the safest and timeliest incubation of the yogurt bacteria.


The untimed, resistance heated yogurt makers are generally popular because of their low cost. They tend to be less expensive because they are designed with no control over the temperatures needed to properly incubate the yogurt bacterial culture(s) in the dairy product used. They are designed for average home temperatures but higher or lower environmental temperatures can change the time it takes to make the yogurt and quality of the yogurt produced. They generally come with smaller cups and must be used repeatedly throughout each week to provide for daily consumption of yogurt. With larger families, they can become impractical because of the time it takes to make a given quantity of yogurt.
The temperature regulating yogurt makers are more expensive as they require more electronic components to be able to maintain temperature settings. There are two types within this category:
Another type has an (optimal) factory temperature setting which is maintained regardless of environment. You cannot adjust the temperature setting in this type.
There are yogurt makers which combine some of the features found in some of the above categories. For example, one yogurt maker provides a factory set regulated temperature with a time - display and cut-off feature. This unit is capable of producing a quality yogurt result in as little as 2 hours as the temperature setting is well above popular home yogurt culturing temperatures. It allows the user to use more than cup-sized containers, although they are supplied in several sizes with the yogurt maker. You can use a gallon size container or 4 wide-mouth quart containers to make as much as a gallon at a time. However, with the taller jars, either a larger cover may be needed or towels may be used to cover the gap between the supplied cover and bottom (heating and control) unit.

, The user can adjust the temperature setting of the yogurt maker to maintain the proper temperatures associated with the bacterial strain(s) used in the culturing of the yogurt. Once set, they will maintain the setting, regardless of how warm or cold your home or kitchen may be.


Yogurt makers which allow the user to set the amount of time the yogurt maker applies heat to the containers. While this time setting may be handy should you need to leave the yogurt maker unattended, it is suggested the user remain in the general area (home) so that if anything should go wrong (like the unit failing to shut off) - granted a rare occurrence - may deal with the situation.

, Make sure they are evenly spaced out and standing up straight (you wouldn’t want them to tip over or the yogurt could leak out.)

, That maintains the containers at a temperature which, hopefully, allows the bacteria in the tempered dairy product in the containers go grow and thrive to make yogurt.

, In due time - depending on bacterial strain(s) used, temperature and food available in the dairy product - the dairy product will firm up to a yogurt consistency. This can take as little as 2 hours and can last 12 hours or longer. The shorter times usually result in less tart yogurts and longer times provide completion of the bacterial growth. For those lactose intolerant folks, the longer times may produce a more digestible yogurt.

, Once the yogurt has gotten to the consistency and time desired, the containers are removed from the yogurt maker and placed in a refrigerator to cool for storage until consumption. The containers, which may be supplied with the yogurt maker, can be small cups so that the user can eat the yogurt right out of the cups. Containers as large as a gallon or more can be held by some yogurt makers for those who need large amounts of yogurt on a regular basis.

, Try gently jiggling one of the containers - the yogurt will not move if it is ready and you can take it from the yogurt maker and put it in the refrigerator then. Or you can wait and let it get more tart for 12 hours or more.

, Put the cheesecloth in a colander and put the colander in a large bowl to catch the whey, which is a thin yellow liquid. Put the yogurt in the colander, cover the colander with a plate, and put it all in the refrigerator. Strain for a couple of hours for greek yogurt. Strain overnight for a very thick yogurt, almost like soft cream cheese.

, Place the yogurt in your fridge for several hours before serving. It will keep for 1 to 2 weeks. If you're going to use some of it as starter, use it within 5 to 7 days, so that the bacteria still have growing power. Whey will form on the top. You can pour it off or stir it in before eating your yogurt.Many commercial yogurts include a thickening agent, such as pectin, starch, gum, or gelatin. Don't be surprised or concerned if your homemade yogurt has a somewhat thinner consistency without these thickeners. Putting the yogurt in the freezer to cool it before to moving it to the refrigerator will result in a smoother consistency. You can also stir or shake in the lumps.

, Experiment until you develop a flavor that your taste buds fancy. Canned pie filling, jams, maple syrup, and ice-cream fudges are good flavorings. For a healthier option, use fresh fruit, with or without a small amount of sugar or honey.

Select a brand of yogurt.,
Freeze the yogurt.,
Enjoy the frozen yogurt.",How to Make 100 Calorie Strawberry Frozen Yogurt," Finding the healthiest one is essential, as some yogurts include more calories and fats than others. Although yogurt is generally an excellent source of nutrition, it can quickly become unhealthy when unnecessary fat - such as crushed candies or extra sugar - is added to the product. In order to ensure that you make the healthiest choice, you should read the nutritional facts on the backs of the products. Check the list of ingredients to ensure that they are all natural. You should also take note of the amount of calories, as well as the fat. Recommended brands are Yoplait and Stonyfield.


The process of creating yogurt is simple since it requires few ingredients. Therefore, avoid yogurts that have long lists of ingredients. They most likely contain unnatural substances, such as artificial flavors and colors.;
, Once you have found the healthiest brand, stick it in the freezer to allow it to harden. It is best that you place it as far back as possible in order to help it freeze as fast as possible. Leave it in the freezer for a few hours to ensure that it thoroughly hardens. Avoid disturbing it, as you may hinder its progress.

, Once a few hours have passed, take it out from the freezer and pry off the lid. Gently press a spoon to the top of the yogurt and test its hardness. If it doesn't crumble to the touch, it is ready to eat. However, if it does, place it back into the freezer for another hour.

Purchase skyr, if necessary.,
Use a spoon to eat skyr.,
Eat skyr as a main dish, a side, or a snack.",How to Eat Icelandic Yogurt1," Skyr is becoming more common internationally, but depending on where you live, it may be somewhat difficult to find. Skyr is often stocked in the dairy or yogurt section of grocery stores, like Whole Foods and Aldi. Some flavors that might be available include:Blueberry
Papaya
Peach
Plain
Raspberry
Strawberry
Vanilla;
, If you have a large container of skyr, spoon out a portion for yourself into a bowl. If your skyr came in a single serving pack, open this. Then spoon the skyr from the container up to your mouth and enjoy.


There's no special trick or dining etiquette for eating skyr. Generally, traditional Icelandic dining is relaxed and similar to most European countries.Be careful not to take too much on the first bite. Skyr is quite thick, and can be a little overwhelming in large quantities.

, Due to the wide range of flavors and its nutritional value, skyr is a flexible food. Much like yogurt, it can be served with breakfast as a side. You might even mix it with granola or cereal to give a healthy start to your day. However, since many Icelanders consider skyr an on-the-go treat, single serving cups equipped with a disposable spoon are common.


You can add ingredients to your skyr to transform its flavor. For example, you might add berries, a splash of cream, a sprinkling of brown sugar, and so on to your skyr."
"
Try drykkur, a drinkable king of skyr.,
Use skyr as a dipping sauce.,
Top desserts with sweet skyr.",How to Eat Icelandic Yogurt2," This thinned out version of skyr retains its creaminess. Drykkur tends to be sweeter, and is often flavored with fruits like blueberries, peach, raspberries, papaya, and so on. Some flavors, like vanilla, may be more dessert oriented.


You can find drykkur at most stores and gas stations in Iceland, though it may be more difficult to find elsewhere.
You may have the best luck of finding this drink at either a traditional Icelandic restaurant or a store with a large selection of international foods.If you have difficulty finding this product, you can also order it online through a marketplace, like Amazon, or you could buy it directly from a skyr producer.

, Using skyr in this fashion is referred to as skyr-nnaise. Take a small side dish or bowl and dollop a thick glob of skyr onto it, then use the skyr as a dipping sauce. You may want to choose the flavor of skyr according to what you'll be dipping into it. For example:Sweet flavored crackers and cookies might pair better with sweeter flavored skyr, like vanilla or strawberry.
When dipping foods that are more savory into the skyr, a plain or savory flavor will likely pair best. Try mixing a little olive, salt, and pepper into it and eating it with crackers.

, Much like whipped cream and ice cream are often used to top pies, cakes, and other desserts, skyr can also be used in this way. Keep in mind that skyr is very dense. Top your desserts with skyr sparingly to prevent it from overpowering the dessert."

Gather your ingredients.,
Wash and cut your fruit.,
Blend your ingredients in your blender.,
Pour the blended mixture into a glass and enjoy.",How to Eat Icelandic Yogurt3," This recipe combines various fruits with skyr to create a convenient, nutrient rich drink. If you are a person who participates in athletic activity, this drink might be the perfect thing to help your muscles recover quickly. You'll need:


Blender
Drinking glass
Fresh mango, pineapple, strawberries (¼ cup each)
Ice
Knife (for cutting fruit)
Skyr (at least 2/3 cup), Rinse your fruit under a stream of cool water then pat it dry with a clean dishcloth or paper towel. You can also let the fruit air dry.After it dries, measure out ¼ cup each of mango, pineapple, and strawberries.


Larger fruit, fruit with a rind, and stone fruit will have to be peeled, pitted, and cut into pieces with a knife. Then measure ¼ cup of the pieces.
Feel free to add different combinations of fruit, like blueberries, bananas, and so on to your smoothie to create new flavors.

, Measure and add 2/3 cup of skyr to your blender. Then add your washed and measured fruit, each a total of ¼ cup, to the blender. Last, put in three to five ice cubes. Then seal the top of the blender, plug it in, and press the ""blend"" button.


Blend your mixture until it becomes the consistency you desire. Blending your drink for longer will make a smoother mixture.
If you cannot find skyr, you can substitute Greek yogurt for a comparably healthy alternative., The pitcher of most blenders disengages from the motor with a simple twist release. Release the pitcher, then pour the mixture into a glass or bottle. Extra smoothie can be transferred to a container, put in the refrigerator, and saved for later.


Generally you can expect your smoothies to stay good, when refrigerated when stored in an airtight container, for 12 hours to a day, depending on the ingredients you've used.
When storing your smoothie, fill its storage container to the very top. Excess air in the container will cause nutrients to oxidize and break down."
