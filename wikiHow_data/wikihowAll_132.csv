Heat the oil in a large skillet.,
Cook the onion and garlic.,
Add the chili powder.,
Stir in the rice, water, and other primary flavor ingredients.,
Simmer for 20 to 25 minutes.,
Add most of the black olive slices.,
Serve hot.",How to Make Chipotle Rice1," Add the oil to a room temperature skillet and place on the stove. Heat the oil over medium-high heat for a minute or two.


The oil should be glossy and smooth, but it should not smoke at any point during the cooking process. If the oil begins to smoke, it means that the fat has begun to break down, which, in turn, means that the flavor will be thrown off.;
, Add the chopped onion to the oil and cook, stirring frequently, for about 5 minutes. Add the minced garlic and cook for an additional 1 minute.


Both the onion and garlic should be tender and fragrant when ready.
Do not add the garlic simultaneously with the onion. Wait until after the onion has already gotten somewhat tender before adding the garlic; otherwise, the garlic may burn.

, Sprinkle the chili powder over the onion and garlic, stirring it in and cooking the contents of the pan for another 1 minute.


The onion and garlic should be evenly coated by the chili powder.
After cooking the contents with the chili powder, the fragrance of the chili powder should be drawn out, as well.

, Add the rice, water, undrained tomatoes, chipotle peppers, peas, salt, and black pepper, as well as 1 Tbsp (15 ml) or more of the reserved adobo sauce.


The adobo sauce provides the ""kick"" associated with chipotle flavor. If you prefer a milder rice, stick with 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of sauce. If you like it hot, though, go ahead and add a little more.
Bring the contents of the skillet to a boil, stirring occasionally.

, Reduce the heat to medium-low and cover the pan. Cook the rice until the liquid is fully absorbed.


Clear a path in the pan by running a wooden mixing spoon along the bottom. If juices flow into the empty space it leaves behind, cook the rice for a little longer. If the empty space stays clean and clear of juices, the rice is ready.

, Stir in three-quarters or more of the black olive slices.


Also add more salt and pepper if necessary.

, Transfer serving sizes to individual serving dishes and sprinkle with the remaining black olive slices.

Grind the coriander.,
Combine the coriander with the other spices.,
Transfer spice blend to a resealable container.,
Combine the rice, water, and butter in a microwave-safe dish.,
Microwave on full power for 8 minutes.,
Season cooked rice with 1 Tbsp (15 ml) prepared chipotle seasoning.,
Serve hot.",How to Make Chipotle Rice2," If working with whole coriander seeds, grind 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of these seeds into a powder using a mortar and pestle.


Place the coriander seeds into a mortar and break the seeds into a fine, ground powder by smashing them against the side of the little dish using the pestle.
If you do not have a mortar and pestle, you could improvise by placing the seeds into a small but durable ceramic bowl and grinding them using the handle end of an ice cream scoop or meat tenderizer. You could also try grinding a larger amount of coriander seeds in a coffee bean grinder.

, Mix the coriander, ground chipotle pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, black pepper, cumin, oregano, seasoned salt, and cayenne pepper in small dish until evenly distributed.Stir the seasonings together for a minute or two using a spoon. You will not be able to verify whether or not all the seasonings are truly and evenly dispersed, but in general, if the speckling seems consistent throughout the mixture, the seasonings are probably sufficiently blended.

, Place the chipotle spice blend in a resealable plastic food container. Set aside.


You will not use this entire batch of chipotle seasoning for this recipe. Store the rest of the seasoning in an airtight container so that you can use it for another recipe later on.

, Stir slightly with spoon to make sure that the rice is submersed completely beneath the water.


Note that the instructions for instant white rice may vary depending on the brand you use. These instructions are fairly standard, but you should always check the instructions provided on your label and proceed according to those.

, Cover the dish with a lid or loose, microwavable plastic wrap and microwave until the water has been absorbed by the rice.


Let sit for another 2 minutes or so inside the microwave. Doing so will allow the rice to finish absorbing the water.
When done, the rice should be tender. “Fluff” it with a fork or spoon before proceeding.

, Stir the chipotle blend into the cooked rice until the rice is evenly coated with it.


Note that more or less chipotle seasoning can be added according to personal preference. The more you add, the spicier your rice will be.
Store the rest of your chipotle seasoning in an airtight container in a cool, dry location.

, Spoon the cooked, seasoned rice onto a serving plate and enjoy.


If multiple people are enjoying the rice, you can place the container out on the table so that everyone can add as much or as little seasoning as they would like.

Soak the rice for 10 minutes.,
Combine the oil, rice, and sugar in a skillet.,
Add lime juice.,
Stir in the water and salt.,

Add chopped cilantro and additional seasonings.,
Serve hot.,
Finished.

",How to Make Chipotle Rice3," Put the rice in a large mixing bowl. Fill the bowl with just enough cool to lukewarm water to cover the rice completely.


Strictly speaking, this step is not absolutely necessary. Doing this can separate the grains of rice more effectively, though, which means that the rice will be less mushy when done.
Drain well and drain carefully once the rice has had a chance to soak.

, Cook the three ingredients over low heat, stirring frequently, for 1 minute or less.


The rice should be well coated with the oil and sugar when done. It should also begin to release a pleasant aroma.

, When the rice becomes fragrant, cut open 2 limes and squeeze the juice from both into the rice. Stir and cook for an additional 1 minute.


Make sure that the lime juice evenly coats the rice before proceeding.
The smell of the lime juice should also be intensified as you cook it.

, Stir slightly to make sure that the rice is completely submerged by the water.


Reduce the heat down to medium-low so that it drops to a steady simmer.
If you prefer rice with more ""bite"" or ""crunch,"" reduce the amount of water down by half.

, Cover and cook the rice until all the water has been fully absorbed.


Once ready, the rice should be tender and no longer soupy.

, Add the chopped cilantro and give the contents of the skillet another quick, light stir.


If you prefer a stronger citrus twist, squeeze the juice of one or two more limes into the rice and stir.

, Let the rice sit for another 1 to 2 minutes with the lid on. Then, transfer it to a serving dish and enjoy.

",How to Make Kale Salad,"


Once all the dressing ingredients are in your jar or bowl, make sure to stir/shake well.
Allowing the dressing to sit for a while helps the strong flavor of the shallots to dissipate and the flavors to combine.
You may also want to crush (""macerate"" is the technical term) the shallots a bit once they are in the olive oil as this will help the process along.;
, The bowl should be large enough for mixing and tossing the ingredients of the salad. Note that any kind of kale will do - some people prefer lacinato (""dino kale"") or flat leaf kale due to the tendency of curly green kale to be sold a bit more mature and therefore tougher. It also has a grittier texture and relative lack of flavor.Take the kale leaves and either shred them by hand or chop them up into small strips. For tougher, more mature kale, you may want to shred or chop into smaller pieces as this will help the dressing to soften the texture.Put the chopped or shredded kale into the bowl.

,


You might start by adding a few tablespoons so as not to ""over-dress"" the salad. Remember, it's easy to add more dressing, but it's impossible to remove it!
Massage the dressing into the kale. The best way to do this is with your hands (or a friend's hands). Note that you should gently squeeze or squish the kale as you mix in the dressing, as this helps break down the cell walls of the leaves and allows the acid in the dressing to soften things up by breaking down cell walls and fibers.Once you have mixed in all the dressing and massaged all the kale in the bowl, taste a bite to see if it has enough dressing for your liking (remember, we'll be adding a few more ingredients too!).
If necessary, add more dressing and repeat the massaging and tasting process until you feel the flavors are balanced and delicious.

, Because kale leaves are so sturdy, they need a little time for the acid in your dressing (lemon juice or vinegar) to break down the leaves and make them softer.Note that if you plan to let your salad sit for more than an hour, you may want to refrigerate it during this time.

,


This recipe calls for sliced avocado, cucumber, and feta cheese.
You can also add any other ingredients that appeal to you.

,


Lightly toss the salad to incorporate all the ingredients. No need to massage anything at this point as doing so will probably turn everything but the kale into mush.
You might garnish the salad with additional black pepper, herbs, and/or any other accompaniments you like.

, The acid is necessary to break down the fibers in kale so that it is tender and easy to chew. Creamy dressings like ranch or blue cheese might seem like a good idea because kale is so substantial, but they will leave your salad too chewy., This is one of the most common dressings for kale salads. It pairs particularly well with strong cheeses like pecorino or parmesan. Here are the standard ingredients:1/2 cup shallots, finely chopped (about 1 large shallot)
2 tablespoons fresh squeezed lemon juice (about 1 lemon)
1 tablespoon white wine vinegar
1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil
Fresh ground black pepper and salt to taste

, Let sit at room temperature for 20 minutes, then add the olive oil and wisk to combine.


Use different types of vinegar (apple, rice, balsamic) to make a slightly sweeter dressing.
Replace the oil with 2 teaspoons of honey for a sweeter, less tart dressing.Replace the oil with 1.5 tablespoons of Dijon mustard for a dressing with a little more kick., Miso is an inexpensive ingredient made from fermented soybeans. Look for it in the refrigerated section in grocery stores. It will produce a thicker, creamier dressing, like this tahini maple dressing:1/4 cup tahini
2 tablespoons white wine vinegar
2 teaspoons white miso
2 teaspoons maple syrup
pinch of red pepper flakes
1/4 cup water

, Add water last and whisk until the mixture is smooth and creamy.


If your dressing is too thick, add more water or vinegar, to taste.

, Replacing lemon with lime and lime zest will make for a milder dressing with more of a southwestern flavor. Adding brown sugar or white sugar can make for a sweeter dressing., Because it is such a robust leaf, kale does well with lots of toppings., Pecorino Romano and shaved Parmesan are popular on kale salads.Aged cheddar also works, or for a salad with more of a Greek feel, try feta., Toasted almonds are delicious along with Parmesan and dates or raisins.Cashew pieces or walnuts can add rich flavor. Sunflower seeds are delicious in summer salads., Dried cranberries, raisins, cherries, or dates add welcome sweetness. Particularly in summer, also try fresh fruits like blueberries, strawberries, or mango., Carrots, bell peppers or cucumber are delicious, as are thinly sliced Brussels sprouts.Red onions or sweet white onions will also add a little kick to your salad.

, You can top your salad with a poached or boiled egg, grilled meat, tofu, or tempeh.

, Kale is a great platform for experimenting with in-season ingredients. For example, try roasted or boiled beets in the winter, or sliced apples in the fall.

, Start with the ingredients:


1 bunch kale
1/2 (16 oz) package frozen shelled edamame, thawed
1/4 of a medium red onion, sliced thin
1 cup shredded carrot
2/3 cup fresh blueberries
1/2 cup sweetened dried cranberries
1/2 cup cashew pieces
1/2 cup shelled, roasted sunflower seeds
3/4 cup white sugar
1/2 cup vinegar
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil

, This will make them easier to eat.

, Whisk sugar, vinegar, salt, pepper, and olive oil together in a bowl until the sugar is dissolved. Set aside.

, Take a bunch of leaves in your hands, squeeze them with moderate pressure, and then pick up another bunch and squeeze again. Continue until the leaves become darker and more fragrant. Massaging helps to brake down cell walls and fibers, making the leaves softer.

, Toss with the kale.

, This will allow the leaves to soften even more.

Get into some finger-lickin’ fun with the Meatball Marinara sub.",How to Make Subway Sandwiches at Home," Subway offers five staple selections of bread (as well as some limited-time only choices). In order to create your own Subway sandwich making station, you’ll need to purchase some great. The five main breads offer at Subway include:


9-grain wheat
9-grain honey oat
Italian
Italian herbs and cheese
Flatbread;
, Cheese is arguably one of the best parts of any sandwich. Don’t skimp on your selection while making your subs. Of course, if you come across a cheese you want to have more than the ones offered at Subway, get it! Subway’s selection varies from store to store, but depending on where you are, you might come across:


American
Monterey cheddar.
Feta
Mozzarella
Natural Cheddar
Natural Pepper Jack
Natural Provolone
Natural Swiss.

, Of course, the main staple of a sub (apart from the vegetarians varieties) is the meat. There are a lot of different kinds of cold cuts (and some hot ones) to choose from. Aside from the hot selections that include meatballs, steak, chicken teriyaki, and buffalo chicken, the cold cuts you should lay out for your own subs include:


Turkey
Black Forest ham
Salami
Roast beef
Bologna
Pepperoni
Tuna salad
Bacon

, Of course, no sandwich would be as interesting if it didn’t have some delicious toppings. Fresh vegetables are a must so head to your local farmers market to get your supplies for your sandwiches. Items you should look for include:


Cucumbers
Lettuce
Tomatoes
Red onions
Green Bell Peppers
Spinach
Banana Peppers
Jalapenos
Olives
Pickles

, To complete your awesome Subway sandwich, you’ll need some really great sauces. Stick to just one, or try a combination of many--the choice is up to you. Don’t forget salt and pepper along with the sauce of your choice. Among the sauce selections are:


Oil
Vinegar
Regular or light mayonnaise
Mustard
Honey mustard
Sweet Onion
Ranch
Chipotle Southwest

, This will accommodate the length of the bread and will keep any dropped topping from getting on the table (so you can just stick them back on the sub). Lay your bread down on the paper and slice it in half lengthwise so that it opens up like a mouth (to gobble up all of those tasty ingredients).

, Once you have opened up your bread, flatten it down so that it stays open. Place your slices of meat on the half of the bread that has the top. The amount of meat you put on is up to you (since you’re making it at home and there’s no limit to how much you can put on!). Spread the meat out so that it covers the top.

, At Subway, their cheese is cut into triangles. If you are going for really authentic, then cut your cheese into triangles. Whether you do this or not, lay the cheese out over the meat slices.


If you did cut them into triangles, tessellate the cheese. This means to alternate the slices so that they don’t overlap.

, If you like your cheese melted, turn on your oven and place your sandwich on a baking sheet. Stick it in the broiler or toaster oven for a couple of minutes (until the cheese melts and the bread starts to toast). If you prefer your sandwiches less toasty, skip this step.

, Make sure they are spread out. Again, since you are making your sandwich at home, there is no particular order you have to put your veggies on your sandwich in (plus everyone wants different things on their sub). In general, you might consider starting lettuce on first and then working your way through the larger vegetables and on to the olives/pickles/smaller things you might want..

, Again, the amount of sauce you put on your sandwich depends on your personal preference. Don’t hopelessly drown your sandwich though or your might end up with some really soggy bread. Put your sauce on top of the meat and cheese side and close that baby on up. It’s time to eat.


You might want to consider cutting your sandwich in half to make it more manageable.

, Choose the sort of bread you want (Italian or Italian herb and cheese are popular choices for this sandwich) and then layer slices of spicy pepperoni, Genoa salami, and Black Forest ham. Make it with cheese, or choose to skip the formaggio (cheese in Italian) and go straight for the veggies. Top it all off with some oil and vinegar., This sandwich is packed with delicious meats and gooey cheese. Try out the 9-grain wheat and lay down some slices of ham, turkey, and bacon. Next, layer some slices of your favorite cheese on top and pop the whole thing into the oven for a couple of minutes. When the the sandwich comes out all melted and toasty, throw on some veggies and your favorite sauce for the final, delicious touches., Whip up some fantastic meatballs and pour some marinara on top. Next, add your favorite cheese (mozzarella is always a good way to go) and stick it in the oven until the cheese melts. Delicious!"

Make all decisions (the type of bread, meat, vegetables, and cheese) before you approach the counter.,
Request the type of sandwich you want.,
Pay at the register the amount you are told.,
Say thank you.

",How to Order a Subway Sandwich," Do not wait until you're asked to decide. If you're unsure, allow others to order first.


Ask any questions you have before beginning the order process. This can include any questions about vegetarian-friendly sandwiches, general meals, prices, etc. Many Subway restaurants have sticker labels on the glass displays about the different cheeses and breads available.
It is a good idea to ask about Halal options first. In some Subways in the UK, the ham is turkey (ham), as is the bacon. In others the turkey is turkey, the ham is pork ham.;
, Know that Subway also carries flat breads and salads.


Know that sandwiches come in either 6-inch or foot-longs. If you have a friend, a foot-long can easily be split in two to save money.
Tell the staff the type of bread you would like. It may differ from store to store, but the choices can include Italian, white, wheat, honey oat, Hearty Italian (Italian bread sprinkled with cornmeal), or herbs and cheese.
Add cheese, if desired. Not all Subways carry the same kinds of cheese, and some cheeses look similar, so be specific. Do not just say the white cheese as almost all Subway cheese varieties are white.
Decide upon warming. Would you like your sandwich placed in the oven and toasted or microwaved? Toasting a sandwich is a good idea if it is a wet sandwich like meatballs or with a hot meat like steak or chicken. Try cold cut subs hot for a different taste. Note that the Subways in the UK no longer allow the microwaving of sandwiches, only the meats.
Tell the worker what types of vegetables you would like in your sandwich. Be specific with amounts, such as ""light lettuce"" (for a small amount) or ""a lot of pickles"". Also be specific with names. Telling the worker you want peppers is not helpful because more subways carry green peppers, mild peppers, and jalapeno peppers.
Order condiments, such as mayonnaise, mustard, sweet onion sauce, etc. All vinegars, salt, and ground black pepper are also in this area. If you're not ordering off the menu, nothing is 'automatically' put on.

, Unless the price seems very unreasonable, do not argue or comment about the price because it is preset by the computer. Unless a wrong item was rung up, there is nothing a member of staff can do to change the price. However, if you wish to save money, avoid going for the combo deal. Also, you can ask for water and they will provide you with a free cup.

For a ham, lettuce and tomato wrap (HLT wrap): Use three pieces of ham.",How to Make Sandwich Wraps," The next time you're at the market, look for foods you like. A good rule of thumb is that if they would work well in a sandwich, they would work well in a wrap, but because a wrap is enclosed, you can also include things that might not handle well on a sandwich.;
, The anchor for a good wrap is usually a large flour tortilla, though you can use corn if you prefer them. You may be able to find colorful variations that include things like tomatoes or spinach. If you don't want to buy tortillas, or you can't find them, remember that you can also make your own.


Whatever tortilla you use, lay it on a plate or clean cutting board and arrange the contents on top of it.






Warm the tortilla in a pan with a bit of oil, if you want it warm.







, You can use cold cuts or you can prepare your own meat by grilling, pan-frying, or any other method you want. Don't forget to season the meat if you're cooking it yourself. Chicken, turkey, beef, ham, and pork are casual options.

, Shrimp and fish make good, lighter additions to wraps. You can also use canned tuna or salmon, inside or outside of a tuna salad mixture.


Generally, use meats or seafood. Seafood tends to have more of a delicate flavor and texture that can be overwhelmed by heavier meats.

, The sky is the limit, metaphorically, so try all kinds of things. This is a great way to pack some delicious nutrition into a compact package. You can make an entire portable salad right there inside the tortilla if you want.


Try lettuce of all kinds, spinach, sprouts, chopped bell pepper (cooked or raw), broccoli (steam it lightly if you prefer), tomatoes, olives, mushrooms, and anything else you like.







, While they're not as frequent an addition to sandwiches or salads, you may find you like the bit of sweetness or tartness that fruits add. Try bits of pear or apple, grapes, raisins, or any other fruit you think might taste good with your combination of fillings.

, Slivered almonds, toasted, chopped walnuts, sunflower seeds, or sesame seeds can add a pleasant crunch and a bit of elegance to your wrap.

, Watch the fat content if you're dieting. If you love mayonnaise, cheese, cream cheese, or ranch dressing, you can compromise and use a smaller portion. Otherwise, try to add flavor with less fatty foods. Try mustard, barbecue sauce, low fat sour cream, yogurt, kefir, light salad dressings, or oil and vinegar.

, Salt and pepper are common choices, but don't forget other fresh or dried herbs and spices, like basil, oregano, cinnamon, or chili powder.

, Place the fillings down the center strip, stopping short of the ends. Fold about three inches of each end in toward the middle. Then roll the rest of the tortilla over around the fillings. Roll snugly.

,,, Lay down lettuce pieces, then the ham slices, then cheese over the ham. Lay a slice of tomato, pepper and cucumber on top of the cheese, all stacked. Sprinkle oregano, salt and pepper over the wrap. Add a little oil if wished. Wrap up and enjoy.

Select your tuna.,
Start mixing the marinade.,
Divide the mixture into two equal portions.,
Add the rice wine vinegar to the marinade mixture.,
Marinate the tuna.,
Press in the sesame seeds.,
Heat a grill or cast iron skillet.,
Sear the tuna steaks.,
Serve.",How to Make Tuna1," Ahi tuna can refer to yellowfin or bigeye tuna, either of which makes a fine tuna steak. Albacore is generally cheaper and still a favorite of some cooks. Nowadays, frozen fillets at a fishmonger can be high quality, and much cheaper than the fresh stuff.Look for cuts that are neatly trimmed, with firm, dark red flesh. Avoid any with discolored flesh around the bone, or with a brown tinge.Thick cuts are necessary to create a seared crust without overcooking the inner flesh. Aim for a cut at least 1¼"" (3.2 cm) thick.;
, In a medium bowl, mix together the soy sauce, mirin, honey and sesame oil with a whisk.If you can't find mirin, use white wine or sherry, with a small pinch of sugar stirred in., Set aside one portion to use as a dipping sauce.

, Whisk until incorporated.

, Place the marinade and tuna in a sealable plastic bag and refrigerate. Leave it for up to 2 hours to allow the flavors to blend. Some chefs recommend keeping this to 30 minutes or less, or even just briefly rubbing in the marinade. The shorter marinade could result in more tender meat, but a more fishy flavor., Remove the tuna steaks from the bag and drain off excess marinade. Cover them in a crust of sesame seeds, pressing gently to adhere them to the surface.


Use both white and black sesame seeds for an attractive presentation.

, Searing requires very high temperatures. If using a gas grill, bring it to 450ºF (230ºC). If using a stove, use a heavy skillet good at conducting heat, preferably a well-seasoned cast iron pan. Add peanut oil, refined (non-extra-virgin) olive oil, or another oil with a high smoking point. When the oil shimmers or just begins to smoke, the pan is hot enough for the tuna.

, Sear until brown on the outside and opaque in the center, with a golden-brown sesame seed crust.This will take about 1–2 minutes on each side.


Sear for just 30 seconds on each side if you prefer a rare center. Due to risk of parasites, this method should only be used for tuna that's been frozen., Remove the steaks from the skillet and serve with the reserved dipping sauce.

If you're using a more expensive can of tuna packed in olive oil, skip this step. Use the oil it was packed in instead of the mayonnaise.
Empty oil in the trash can, not the sink.

, Add the mayonnaise, mustard, lemon juice, chopped celery, and pepper. Stir thoroughly to combine.

, Lightly toast two pieces of bread, then spoon the tuna mixture between them. Fresh-baked, crusty bread such as ciabatta or sourdough delivers the best taste.

, Balance the sandwich with arugula, lettuce or cucumber for a fresh taste.

, You can add many other ingredients to your tuna mixture, such as a small spoonful of capers or a dash of hot sauce. Turn it into a tuna melt by adding a slice of cheese and heating the sandwich until crisp with a frying pan, broiler, or toaster oven. Check out even more variations here.


When making a tuna melt, add the arugula or other fresh veggies after the sandwich is toasted.

"
Mix tuna with mayonnaise or olive oil.,
Mix in ingredients.,
Add spices and garnish.,
Serve immediately or chilled.",How to Make Tuna3," Tuna salad begins with just enough oil to hold the tuna together. Drain the canned tuna, then spoon in mayonnaise or high-quality olive oil and stir until combined. With mayonnaise, it will stick together as a moist mixture. Olive oil will make a looser salad, so just break apart the tuna chunks and stir until coated.


For a low-fat salad, use plain, low-fat yoghurt instead.If your tuna is packed in flavorful olive oil, you can skip this step.

, Mayonnaise and tuna isn't bad on its own, but tuna salad has more potential than that. Try mixing it with one of these recipes:


Cranberries, apple, and green onion(See top of page for quantities)

½ stick celery and ⅛ red onion, diced, plus 1 tsp (5 mL) pickle relish1 clove crushed garlic, several chopped and toasted walnuts, handful of sproutsRead this article for more variations

, Add sea salt, and black pepper to taste. Optionally, squeeze a wedge of lemon over the tuna salad, or garnish with fresh Italian parsley, dill, basil, or cilantro.

, Most cooks prefer to chill tuna salad under plastic wrap in the refrigerator, but it can be served at room temperature. Here are a few serving suggestions:


On a bed of spinach or lettuce leaves
Topped with sliced tomatoes and/or avocado
Stuffed into a hollowed out tomato
Shaped into a cylinder using a mold (for firm salads only)

You can serve this in the avocado skin, garnished with a sprig of cilantro and a wedge of lemon.

, Invented near the French city of Nice, this salad packs enough weight to serve as a whole meal. Its many variations almost always include tuna, boiled potato, hard-boiled eggs, and black olives.

, Picky children and tired parents have popularized this easy dinner. Mix together canned tuna, cooked pasta, peas, and cream of mushroom soup. Top with cheese and bread crumbs, then bake until it forms a crust.


You can make this even faster by cooking the noodles in a skillet, then using the leftover water to make a cream sauce., Fry breaded tuna salad into a crisp shell with a piping hot interior. Serve with Worcestershire sauce, lemon, or Dijon mustard.

, Tuna is the most popular choice for sashimi, or slices of raw fish. Because the dish is served raw, you should only use frozen fish from a trusted fishmonger. But ignore the terms ""sushi grade"" or ""sashimi grade"" — these have no legal weight in the US.There are numerous varieties of tuna sashimi, based on the species of tuna and the location of the cut.Get started with high-quality tuna fillets, cutting them into thin slices or chunks."

Delicious, delectable bacon. Turn a burner on your stove to medium heat and place a large or medium-sized frying pan on it. When the pan is hot (you'll know it's ready if water flicked on to immediately sizzles), add your bacon strips and let them begin to fry. Use tongs or a long fork to periodically turn your bacon strips as they cook to avoid burning. When they have achieved a pleasing brownish color, transfer them to a plate lined with paper towels. The entire process shouldn't take longer than 10 minutes or so.


While waiting for your bacon to cook, you can proceed to the next few steps to save time. Just keep an eye on your bacon to make sure it doesn't burn.
As an alternative to frying, you can bake bacon by placing it in a shallow cooking pan and leaving it in an oven set to 375o F (190o C) for about 15 to 20 minutes.
The ""correct"" crispiness of bacon is a subject of endless debate among bacon aficionados. Some people like their bacon soft and chewy, while others like it burnt to a crisp. Ultimately, it's up to you. The earlier you remove your bacon from the pan, the softer it will be.;
, Next, take out two slices of bread and lay them flat on a clean, clear cutting board or work area. Spread mayonnaise (or a substitute like Miracle Whip) on one slice of bread. Then, spread mustard over the mayonnaise. Finally, add any optional spreads or condiments that you care for. For instance, some like to add a little ""kick"" to their BLTs with a splash of Tabasco sauce.


If you like, you can toast your bread to give your sandwich a crispy texture before applying your spreads.
Obviously, if you don't care for mayonnaise or mustard, there's no need to add either to your sandwich. You may find that having at least one spread helps your sandwich ""stick together"", though it's certainly not necessary.

, Next, grab a tomato, turn it on its side, and make a few vertical cuts to produce several circular slices. Lay these evenly over your bread. Your tomato layer may be as thick as you like — some people like lots of tomatoes, while others prefer just a few thin slices.


You can use whichever type of tomato you like for your BLT. Traditional, ""standard"" BLTs are often depicted with large slices of beefsteak tomato, but you can also use a more flavorful varieties like heirloom or Roma tomatoes if you wish.

, If you haven't already done so, wash your lettuce thoroughly in cold water to remove any dirt and make the leaves crisp and cold. Lay a few leaves of lettuce over your tomatoes. Again, the amount of lettuce you add is up to you. Many find a leaf or two to be sufficient.


As with tomatoes, the variety of lettuce you use is your choice. While many enjoy ordinary iceberg lettuce, other types, like romaine lettuce, are great alternatives. You can even use a different green, like spinach, if you prefer, though in this case your sandwich won't technically be a BLT.

, If your bacon hasn't finished cooking at this point, wait for it to do so. When you've removed it from the stove, lay it on a plate lined with paper towels for a few moments to allow any excess grease to be absorbed. Then, transfer the bacon to your sandwich. The amount of bacon you use is up to you — some folks like a thick mouthful of bacon, while others prefer just a taste. Depending on the size of your bread, 3-4 strips is usually enough to provide a satisfying crunch.

, Congratulations! Your sandwich is ready to eat. At this point, you can either enjoy your delicious BLT or continue adding fillings to create a double-decker sandwich.


If your sandwich fillings are stacked too high and your sandwich falls apart when you try to eat it, you may want to spear your sandwich with a toothpick to keep it together.

, Sometimes, an ordinary sandwich just doesn't cut it. If you're feeling especially hungry, consider adding a second layer of ingredients above your existing sandwich, then capping your double-decker with a third piece of bread. This second layer can contain all of the fillings you've used thus far or just the ones that you wish.


For example, if we wanted to add a second layer with all of the ingredients in the sandwich, we would spread mustard and mayonnaise on top of our current sandwich, add a few tomato slices, add a leaf of lettuce, add a few strips of bacon, and finally add another piece of bread on the very top.

Assemble a classic BLT, minus the final piece of bread.,
Add a few avocado slices.,
Optionally, add a spritz of lemon juice.,
Add your final piece of bread.",How to Make a BLT Sandwich2," As noted in the intro, there are hundreds of ways to make a BLT. This variation adds a little west coast flair to the standard BLT by adding some of the key ingredients in a California club sandwich. To start, you'll want to build a BLT as directed above until the point just before you'd normally be finished. In other words, cook some bacon, then spread a little mustard and mayonnaise on your bread, and finally add tomato, lettuce, and your cooked bacon to your sandwich. From here, we'll be adding a few extra touches to make our sandwich unique.


For a true west coast classic, you may want to consider using sourdough, San Francisco's signature bread.

, Peel and cut a ripe Hass avocado into several thick french-fry sized slices. Lay these slices down above your final layer of bacon. The avocado gives the sandwich a creamy, satisfying quality not present in an ordinary BLT. The smooth texture of the avocado contrasts especially well with crunchy toast.


Avocados are best when they're ripe. Ripe Hass avocados (the most common variety on the west coast) have dark green-to-black skin and a firm, yet yielding texture. The fruit should feel somewhat weighty and should have no obviously flattened or ""smooshed"" patches. If you're unsure whether an avocado is ripe, check under the brown stem remnant at the bottom of the avocado. If the skin underneath is bright yellow-green, you've picked a ripe avocado. If it's brown, your avocado may be bruised or overripe., After adding your avocado, you may want to squeeze a thin slice of lemon over your sandwich to produce a few drops of lemon juice. If you do so, be conservative — you want just a hint of lemony zest, not a BLT that makes you pucker. If done correctly, the BLT will have a slight tangy flavor which, for some, is absolutely mouthwatering when paired with the meatiness of the bacon and the smoothness of the avocado.

, Congratulations! Your California BLT is ready to eat. If you desire, you can add another layer of ingredients and an additional piece of bread to create a double-decker. If you're looking for a truly Californian experience, you may want to opt for this — California clubs, the state's signature sandwich, are customarily served as double-deckers.

Cook your bacon, saving the grease.,
Assemble a classic BLT, minus the final piece of bread.,
Fry an egg in your bacon grease.,
Add your fried egg and cheese to your BLT.,
Add your final piece of bread!",How to Make a BLT Sandwich3," This BLT variation is great for early birds looking for a satisfying sandwich on the way to work. To begin, start cooking your bacon as normal, but, when you're finished, save some of the grease, which will be used for frying an egg.


If you don't like the idea of frying an egg in bacon grease, you may dispose of the grease and instead use another form of fat to fry your egg, like butter, oil, or margarine.

, While you're waiting for your bacon to finish cooking, you'll probably want to make the most of your time by doing most of the work to assemble your sandwich. Lay down a piece of bread, add any spreads you desire, and add tomato, lettuce, and bacon (when it finishes cooking). As above, you'll build on this basic BLT template to create your new sandwich.

, When you've transferred all of your bacon out of the frying pan, drained it, and added it to your sandwich, crack an egg over your frying pan. Wait for your egg to cook to your desired level of hardness, monitoring as it cooks to ensure it doesn't overcook or burn.


See How to Fry an Egg for specific egg-frying techniques. Essentially, you'll want to fry your egg in the pan for several minutes until its edges are white, then drop a spoonful of water in the pan next to the egg and cover both the egg and the water with a lid. This steams the upper side of the egg, ensuring it cooks. After this point, cook to your desired level of hardness, checking under the lid several times to observe your progress. Transfer the egg out of the pan when it's done — you shouldn't ever need to flip it.

, When your egg is finished cooking, gently place it on top of your sandwich. Then, add a few slices of your favorite cheese on top of the egg. Almost any type of cheese pairs well with these ingredients, though standard omelet cheeses like cheddar, jack, and Swiss are all safe bets.

, Congratulations! Your Breakfast Special BLT is ready to eat. The fried egg and cheese make this hearty, satisfying meal that tastes something like an entire American breakfast in one sandwich.


If you're eating on the go, bring a napkin — the egg yolk can be quite runny, depending on how you've cooked it.

Fry pancetta.,
Spread burrata cheese on a brioche bun.,
Add arugula.,
Add heirloom tomato slices.,
Add your cooked pancetta.,
Drizzle the top half of the bun with oil and vinegar.,
Place the top half of the bun on top of the sandwich.",How to Make a BLT Sandwich4," For the BLT variations above, we've stuck to the same basic template: bread, spreads, tomato, lettuce, bacon, and bread. As far as the specifics of these ingredients are concerned, we've left the choices up to you — you may have used anything from white bread to rye, supermarket bacon to gourmet butcher's cuts, and so on. However, with this dignified, elegant recipe, there's no settling for standard fare. Start by frying up some high-quality pancetta for a taste that's second-to-none.


Pancetta is an Italian variety of bacon that is unsmoked (by contrast, most American bacon is smoked) and often flavored with various aromatics.Pancetta is cooked in the exact same way as bacon — either fried several minutes per side in a pan or baked in the oven.

, Rather than opting for the standard bread and mustard/mayonnaise combo for this sandwich, this time, we'll use more indulgent ingredients. Cut a gourmet brioche bun in half and spread fresh burrata cheese on the bottom half. Be generous with your burrata — unlike mustard and mayo, you can get away with applying a fairly thick spread here.


Brioche is a rich, tender French pastry bread made with a high egg and butter content. This bread is sweet, light and fluffy, which allows it to contrast with the heavier flavors in the sandwich.
Burrata cheese is a soft cheese made from mozzarella and cream that makes a creamy, luxurious spread for BLTs and many other sandwiches. The outer portion of the cheese is often pure mozzarella, while the inside is the characteristic mixture of cheese and cream. Use the inside portion for spreading.

, Next, on top of your tomato slices, sprinkle a handful of arugula greens. Since arugula comes in the form of many small leaves rather than one or two large leaves like lettuce, it can be tricky to get them to stay in the sandwich. However, if you put the arugula into your sandwich now, before you add the tomatoes, the leaves will be held in place by the sticky burrata cheese, ensuring a tidy (or at the very least tidier) sandwich.


Sometimes called ""rocket"" greens, arugula is a more nutritious alternative to ordinary iceberg lettuce. Arugula also has a somewhat nutty, peppery taste and a noticeable fragrance, making it a stimulating addition to almost any sandwich.

, Next, you'll want to add flavorful slices of tomato to your sandwich. While there are many valid choices, heirloom tomatoes) sometimes called ""heritage"" tomatoes) are a great bet. These tomatoes, frequently described as ""rich"" and/or ""rustic"", have a splotchy appearance that can range from yellowish to red to green or even brown and have a sweeter, more succulent flavor than ordinary varieties.Note that heirloom tomatoes don't keep particularly well, so buying fresh, when possible, is best.

, At this point, if you've been cooking your pancetta while you've been assembling your sandwich, it should be almost done. When the pancetta is finished cooking, remove it from the pan and allow it to drain on a plate lined with paper towels. After draining for a few moments, move the pancetta to your sandwich.


You may add as much as you like, but, as with bacon, 3-4 pieces is often enough.

, We're almost done with our gourmet BLT! Add a final tangy, savory garnish to your burger by making your own vinaigrette from oil and vinegar. Combine three parts olive oil and one part balsamic vinegar in a small bowl. Use very small amounts of each — aim to make no more than a few spoonfuls of vinaigrette total. Drizzle about a spoonful of your vinaigrette evenly over the top bun.


If you have leftover vinaigrette, don't drench your bun. Using too much can make your sandwich a sloppy mess. Instead, combine it with leftover arugula for an improvised side salad!

, At last, you're done! Turn your top bun over and enjoy your premium, top-of-the line sandwich.


As a side, try using the aforementioned arugula and vinaigrette salad, or, for a decadent alternative, some homemade fries!

(Red) tongs = used to pick up cooked patties.;
, Marking condiments on the wrap enables the front counter staff to accommodate special customer requests, e.g. a Whopper Burger with lots of bacon, or no tomatoes, or plain burger etc. It effectively allows customers to have the burger their way and enables the counter staff to recognize which burger (remember the burger is wrapped when you put it in the chute) contains what ingredients with regards to special requests. So to ensure the customers get what they want, and that the front counter staff pick up the correct burger, make sure you note any special request on the burger wrap. So, here is the key to marking condiments:

H means heavy.
L means light.
O means only ingredient.
+ means PLUS that ingredient (e.g. if someone requests a Whopper Burger PLUS bacon, so you would mark + over the bacon icon on the wrap).
- means minus that ingredient (e.g. if someone requests a Whopper Burger but NO mayonnaise, you would mark - over the mayo bottle icon on the wrap).
___________ line through condiment icons means PLAIN burger (i.e. nothing but the burger and bun).

,, There is no longer a holding time for Whopper burgers. They are now MTO (Made to order).,, You now have a heel+patty., After spreading the mayo on to the crown, do NOT put the crown on the wrap. Instead, move your hand over to the lettuce pan and holding the crown over the lettuce pan, grab 21g of lettuce and sprinkle it on the crown. You now have a crown+mayo+lettuce. Now take this crown+mayo+lettuce and put it just above the center of the wrap. Then take 2 sliced tomatoes from the tomato pan and place them on top of the lettuce, side by side but not overlapping, Make sure the pickles are not overlapping.,,, Try to prevent spillage of lettuce etc., Take the top half of the wrap and pull down over bun. Then twist the ends and fold under the wrap.,,"

Salt the patties after forming the burgers.,
Always use dry seasoning on the outside, not the inside.,
Use seasoning liberally.,
Err on the side of simplicity.,
Experiment.,
Make your own season-salt.,
Try a curry spice mix.,
Try integrating fresh ingredients into the ground beef.,
Brush marinade or wet rub on the outside of the burgers before cooking.",How to Season Hamburgers," Depending on your taste and on the kind of burgers you want to make, the variety of add-ins, spices, and combinations you use to season them is almost endless. You can add different spices at different points in the making of the burgers, but one thing is always necessary: salt. Just before you put your burgers on the grill or on the stove, season both sides with a generous portion of kosher salt.


Salt dissolves muscle proteins, drawing out water. Adding salt into the raw hamburger before you form the patties will result in tough and dry burgers, losing much of the flavor and texture associated with a good one. However you end up cooking your burgers, wait to salt them, and salt them on the outside.;
, If you're in search of more delicious seasoning options because your burgers tend toward the dry and flavorless, it may be because you're over handling the meat. It's not important to integrate seasoning into the burgers themselves. Seasoning added to the outside of the meat will make more flavorful burgers.


Burgers should be formed quickly, into portions of about 4 oz with a small indent in the middle, with as little fuss as possible, then seasoned before cooking.
Don't ""rub"" it. If you want to use the same ""dry rub"" you use on ribs, go for it, but there's no reason to massage it into the meat. Handle the burgers as little as possible.

, Sprinkle a generous pinch of any dry seasoning you use on your burger patties from several inches above, evenly and liberally. One of the biggest differences between those great burgers at the restaurant and the ones you make at home is the amount of seasoning used on the meat. It takes a lot, more than you're probably using.


Ground beef isn't the most flavorful meat on the planet. Even good quality beef patties can have a tendency to be somewhat bland if not seasoned properly. Go big, or you might as well eat a salad instead. Sprinkle on a generous portion of salt and fresh-cracked black pepper, enough that you'll get plenty in each bite.

, Sometimes, the best things are the most simple. Burgers seasoned simply with salt and pepper and topped with American cheese provide a delicious and in many ways ideal burger, amenable to all sorts of toppings and additions after it's cooked. Why mess with perfection?



To make a good burger, get fancy after you've got it off the grill, adding all the toppings and condiments you want. Like raw onion and ranch dressing? Go for it. Don't let anyone to tell you what's good.

, There's no right way to season a burger if it tastes good to you. Mix up your own spice mixtures with spices available to you and organize a taste test, trying different combinations on a few different burgers, to see what you and your family likes the best. Just handle the raw burger as little as possible, sprinkle it on right before it hits the heat, and you'll be in great shape.

, If you like spice mixtures by McCormick or Lawry's, why not try your own? It's likely you've got everything you need already in your cabinet and in your kitchen. If not, use whatever you like to create your own.To make a simple season-salt appropriate for hamburgers and other meats, start by finely mincing an entire bulb of garlic. To prepare the mix quickly, throw the peeled cloves with the ends trimmed off in the food processor to get the party started.Pulse the processor on and off until they're thoroughly minced and to the garlic add:


A cup of salt
1 tablespoon of sweet paprika
1 tablespoon of chili powder
1 tablespoon dried basil
1 tablespoon of white pepper
1 tablespoon of celery seed
1 teaspoon of ground ginger
1 teaspoon of dried mustard
1 teaspoon of dill
Mix the ingredients thoroughly and store in an air-tight container in the refrigerator. This can be used to season hamburger and any other kind of meat. It's a basic and versatile fresh seasoning mix.

, If you want to try burgers with warm and fragrant Indian spices, it can be a nice and surprising change-up from the regular salt-and-pepper.To create a delicious curry spice perfect for burgers, vegetables, or chicken, toast the following spices by keeping them moving around in a dry skillet over medium-high for a few minutes until they become fragrant and slightly browned:


1 tablespoon of cumin seeds
1 tablespoon of coriander seeds
1 teaspoon of mustard seeds
1/2 teaspoon fenugreek seeds
1/2 teaspoon fennel seeds
Remove the spices from the skillet and crush them in a mortar-and-pestle, or crush them with the flat side of a kitchen knife on the cutting board and mix together. This goes excellent on a burger with fresh coriander and a spicy chutney.

, As long as you do it gently, adding some chopped up onion, basil, or other green herbs into the meat can be an excellent way of adding interesting flavors and aromas during the cooking process. Some burger-lovers like raw garlic in the beef, while others swear by the addition of oregano. Use what you like. Depending on the kind of toppings and flavors you want to use on the burgers after cooking them, adding some fresh ingredients to the meat can be a nice addition.

, Mixtures of Worcestershire, brown sugar, horseradish, ketchup, soy sauce, and even hoisin can be delicious when added to ground beef.If you want to mix up a wet rub or a sauce to brush onto the burgers just before they hit the heat, it can be an excellent way of caramelizing and creating a delicious crust.


Working in wet mixtures is less recommended, but still possible. It can be a good way of over-handling the beef and breaking down the proteins, but gently massaging some Worcestershire in shouldn't be too much of a problem.

Know what meat you want.,
Evaluate fat content.,
Buy equal portions.,
Check the expiration date.,
Look for freezer burn.,
Inspect the packaging.,
Have the butcher make them.,
Try something new.",How to Buy Burger Patties,"


Pr-made burgers are available in beef, chicken, pork, veal, turkey, bison, ostrich and several combinations. Know what type of burger you want to serve, then focus on finding burgers that fit your price range and look good.;
,


Fat content is the ratio of fat to meat in a burger patty.
Extra lean ground meat is usually labeled as 93/7, which means it's 93 percent meat and 7 percent fat. This content is healthier than others found in burger patties, but the meat can dry out faster and be less flavorful.
A patty with 80/20 meat is 80 percent meat and 20 percent fat. These burger patties will be more juicy and flavorful and get a better sear on the outside.

,


Burger patties should be uniform in size and thickness. This will ensure even cooking times.
Patties portioned by a machine can be identified by the uniform-shaped edge. These are portioned out to an exact weight so they will always be the same size. Hand-made patties will be rounder, but should still be roughly the same size.

,

Packaged burger patties will have a stamp reading ""Use By"" or ""Cook or Freeze By"" on the outside of the package. This is the expiration date for the burger patties, after which they could be unsafe to consume. Be sure to buy patties with an expiration date that will give you time to cook your patties or freeze them for future meals.

,


Patties could have freezer burn from being at an extreme temperature or being refrigerated too long. Look for discoloration along the surface of the burger or gray coloring or cracking around the edges of the patties.

,


Properly packaged burger patties will be wrapped tightly with no gaps, tears or loose sections of the packaging. Patties should not have juice leaking out of the packaging or be sitting in a pool of juice or water in the package. These encourage bacteria growth and should be avoided.

,


Most grocery stores have a butcher on staff that can grind your meat and make burger patties for you while you wait. This will ensure that the meat is fresh.

,


Try burger patties made from a meat you've never tried before. Many grocery stores now carry more exotic burger patties made from ostrich or bison. These burgers are often lower in fat and cholesterol than beef burgers.

Congrats.You've made your own burger with your bare hands.",How to Make the Perfect Hamburger,"


Wet your hands so the ground beef won't stick to them. Then, fold the seasoning into the beef until it is mixed well.;
, Grab a handful of ground beef and flatten it into a patty between your two hands. Size and thickness are up to you. Just remember that patties shrink up to 20% when you cook them.


Using your thumb, create an indentation in the middle of each patty. This helps the patties keep their shape on the grill. You can use wax paper to keep the patties separate.

, You can cook them over a grill or a barbecue. Close the lid, and grill for 5 to 10 minutes. Keep a close eye on them. Hamburger meat contains a lot of fat which can cause flare-ups and burned burgers.


Flip the patties only once and leave them to cook for another five minutes, or until they've reached perfection.
Remove the patties and turn the heat to low. Toast the hamburger buns for 30 seconds.

, Add lettuce, pickles, then the beef. Finish with a slice of tomato, onions and mustard and ketchup.

",How to Make Tasty Turkey Burgers," Take half a medium onion, and use the fine side of a grater to grate the onion. You should wind up with approximately 2 tablespoons (30 g) of grated onion, as well as some juice, which you can discard.If you don’t have a grater, you can finely dice the onion with a knife. Keep in mind that the onions will be more noticeable in the finished burgers if you dice instead of grating, though.;
, In large mixing bowl, combine 1 pound (approximately 454 g) lean ground turkey, the grated onion, 1 clove of minced garlic, 1 tablespoon (approximately 30 ml) Worcestershire sauce, 2 tablespoons (approximately 34 g) ketchup, ¾ teaspoon (approximately 4g) salt, and freshly ground pepper to taste. Use a fork to mix the ingredients until they are thoroughly combined.You may find it easier to use your hands to mix the ground turkey with the other ingredients. Just make sure to wash your hands well before and after mixing.

, Once all of the ingredients are well mixed, divide the mixture in 3 or 4, depending on how large you want your burgers to be. Shape each bit of the meat into a patty that’s approximately 1-inch (25.4 mm) thick.If you’re having trouble forming uniform patties for your burgers, take the lid from an old peanut butter or other jar, line it with plastic wrap, and use it as a mold to form a perfect patty., Find a skillet that’s large enough to hold your 3 or 4 patties without crowding them, and place it on the stove. Turn the heat to medium-high, and add 1 tablespoon (approximately 30 ml) of olive oil or canola oil. Heat the oil until it starts to shimmer, which typically takes 1 to 2 minutes.Instead of a skillet or frying pan, you can also use a griddle to cook the turkey burgers.
If you prefer, you can use a non-stick cooking spray in place of the oil.
You can make sure that the pan is hot enough to add the burgers by placing your hand over it. If you can feel the heat, it’s ready for the burgers.

, Once the skillet is hot for cooking, place the burgers patties in the pan. Make sure that they’re not crowded too closely together. Cook the patties for approximately 4 to 5 minutes, or until the bottoms are brown.To check if the bottoms of the burgers are brown, use a metal spatula to carefully lift an edge so you can take a peek.

, Once the bottoms are brown, use the metal spatula to carefully flip the burgers to the other side. Allow them to cook for another 4 to 5 minutes on the other side until it is brown and the burgers are cooked through.Turkey burgers are cooked all the way through when their internal temperature reaches 165 degrees Fahrenheit (approximately 74 degrees Celsius). Have a meat thermometer on hand, so you can check your burgers to see if they’re done.

, Like a classic cheeseburger, your turkey burgers can become even more delicious if you melt some cheese on them. If you are a fan of cheese on your burgers, place a slice of the cheese of your choice on the burger about 1 minute before it will be done.You can use any type of cheese that you like on your turkey burger, but American, cheddar, swiss, and gouda are tasty options.
Instead of sliced cheese, you can sprinkle shredded cheese on your burgers. It usually melts more quickly than slices, though, so you can wait until 30 seconds before you’re going to take the burgers out of the pan to add it.

, When you’re sure that the turkey has been cooked through, remove the burgers from the pan with a spatula and place them on hamburger buns. You don’t necessarily have to use buns that are marketed specifically for burgers. Use your favorite sandwich rolls or bread.If you prefer a low carb option, use one or two leaves of iceberg, butter, or green leaf lettuce to wrap around the burgers in place of a bun or bread.

, On the buns, dress up the burgers exactly as you would beef burgers. You can use lettuce, sliced tomato, chopped onion, pickles, relish, caramelized onions, diced jalapenos, mushrooms, or your favorite burger toppings to add extra flavor to your turkey burgers.A couple of slices of cooked bacon can not only add flavor, but some extra crunch to your turkey burger as well.

, Before you sit down to eat your turkey burger, it’s a good idea to add a condiment to the top of the burger or top bun. Go the traditional route with ketchup, or mix things up with a little mustard. You can even go with a combination of both if you prefer. Use your favorite condiment or burger sauce as a finishing touch to your tasty turkey burger.Barbecue sauce, mayonnaise, honey mustard, steak sauce, and bleu cheese dressing are all delicious condiments for your turkey burger.
Give your turkey burger some unique flavor by spreading a little salsa or even marinara sauce on top instead of the usual ketchup.

",How to Make Grilled Cheese with Miracle Whip," For starters, it is important to use the correct bread. Grilled cheese lends itself well to white bread. In this case any old white bread will do. Wheat, rye, and pumpernickel do not work as well due to their heavier flavor.;
, Apply butter to both sides of each piece of bread. This will help to add flavor, plus also toast the bread and keep it from burning.

, Next, add the cheese. Feel free to experiment, but American seems to be the cheese of choice. Cooper is less common, but much more tasty. Be sure to apply approximately five or six slices in-between the bread. The cheese should be approximately half an inch thick or so.

, Once you have cheese on the bread, add a big glob of Miracle Whip on top. This is the special ingredient. It will really add something to set it apart from other grilled cheese sandwiches. Apply about two tablespoons.

, Once the sandwich is assembled the grilling can begin. In a skillet, place three tablespoons of butter and heat on low. Brown the sandwich on both sides. Make sure the cheese is gooey and yummy.

Slice the sandwich into wedges and serve.",How to Make Giant Grilled Cheese1," Even though the grilled cheese is cooked in a pan, you may need to put it in the oven briefly to melt the cheese completely. Make sure that the oven is hot enough in case you need it by preheating it to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (177 degrees Celsius), which should take approximately 10 to 15 minutes.Pay attention to the oven so you know when it’s ready. Most models will either beep or flash an indicator light to let you know that the right temperature has been reached.;
, Take 1 loaf of round, crusty bread, and use a sharp knife to slice it in half horizontally. Trim the top and bottom crusts from the bread to create two large, round slices that are approximately 1 ½ inches (3.8 cm) thick.These types of round, crusty bread are sometimes called bread boules, and are often used to serve soups and dips in.
It can be difficult to cut a round loaf of bread, so be careful to tuck your fingers under when you're slicing.

, Once the bread is cut, use a butter knife to spread the mustard of your choice over one slice. Cover the mustard with ¼ pound (114 g) of thinly sliced Swiss cheese and ¼ pound (114 g) thinly sliced Monterey Jack cheese. Spread mustard on the other piece of bread, and close the sandwich.The mustard is optional, but adds delicious flavor to the grilled cheese. You can use your favorite type, such as honey, dijon, or coarse-ground.
You can use substitute any melting cheese that you like for the Swiss and Monterey Jack. Cheddar, American, pepper jack, or mozzarella are other options to consider.
You can add other fillings to the grilled cheese if you like. Bacon and tomatoes are classic additions, but you can be as creative as you’d like. Try adding ham, pepperoni, roasted red peppers, sliced apples, or even crumbled potato chips to your sandwich.

, Add 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of vegetable or olive oil to a large, heavy-bottomed 10- or 12-inch (25 to 30-cm) skillet that’s oven-safe. Allow it to heat on medium-low for 3 to 5 minutes, or until the oil starts to shimmer.You can substitute butter for the oil, but butter burns off much more quickly so you may find yourself needing to replace it as you fry the sandwich.

, When the oil is heated, use a butter knife to spread 2 tablespoons (28.5 g) of unsalted, softened butter over the top of the sandwich. Place the sandwich in the pan buttered side down, and apply another 2 tablespoons (28.5 g) of butter to the other side of the sandwich that’s now facing up., Allow the sandwich to cook for approximately 3 to 4 minutes or until the bottom has become golden brown. Use a spatula to carefully flip the sandwich over so the cooked side is now face up. Cook the other side for another 2 to 3 minutes so it becomes golden brown too.Check the sandwich’s color regularly while it’s cooking on both sides to ensure that it doesn’t burn.

, When both sides of the sandwich are golden brown, remove it from the skillet and place it on a cookie sheet. Because it is such a large sandwich, all of the cheese may not be melted so put the grilled cheese in the preheated oven and let it cook until the cheese is fully melted, which may take 3 to 8 minutes.If the cheese is mostly melted when you take the sandwich out of the skillet, you don’t necessarily have to put it in the oven. The cheese will continue to melt a little if you leave it the pan off the heat.

, When the cheese is completely melted, use a sharp knife to cut it into four wedges. Place the wedges on plates, and serve."

Cut the sandwich into slices to serve.",How to Make Giant Grilled Cheese2," Instead of cooking the grilled cheese in a skillet, this sandwich is baked in the oven. To ensure that it’s hot enough to melt the cheese, preheat the oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit (190 degrees Celsius) and allow it to fully heat., Take 1 large, rectangular loaf of focaccia bread, and use a sharp knife to slice it half horizontally. Place the bottom piece on a large cookie sheet with the cut side up, and leave the other aside for a moment.Ideally, you should use a foccacia that fits tightly on an 18-inch by 13-inch (46-cm by 33-cm) baking sheet.

, On top of the piece of bread on the cookie sheet, spread 1 ½ pounds (680 g) of grated cheddar cheese in an even layer. If you want to add any other fillings to the sandwich, such as crumbled bacon, sundried tomatoes, caramelized onions, or pesto, sprinkle them over the bread as well.You can substitute any cheese that you like for the cheddar. Just make sure that it melts well. Fontina, Gouda, provolone, mozzarella, and Colby are all cheese that melt well.
If you’re planning to add other fillings to the grilled cheese, spread half of the cheese over the bread, lay down the fillings, and then cover them with the remaining cheese.

, Once you’ve added all the cheese and other fillings to the sandwich, place the other piece of foccacia on top with the cut side down. Set a large, heavy skillet that’s oven-safe on top of the sandwich to help weigh it down.If you only have smaller oven-safe skillets, use multiple pans to weigh down as much of the focaccia as possible.

, With the heavy pan on top of the focaccia, set the baking sheet in the preheated oven. Allow it to bake until the cheese melts, which should take 8 to 10 minutes.Keep an eye on the sandwich to ensure that the focaccia doesn’t burn.

, Once the cheese is completely melted, remove the grilled cheese from the oven. Use a sharp knife to slice the sandwich into 9 pieces, and serve.You can cut the grilled cheese into smaller pieces if you want to serve a larger crowd.
Consider cutting the sandwich into bite-size pieces and using them as an appetizer at your next party.

Allow the pan to heat for at least 5 minutes, so you can be sure that there are no hot spots that may burn the sandwich.You can also make the grilled cheese on a gas or charcoal outdoor grill or a tabletop grill.

, In a small bowl, combine 6 tablespoons (90 ml) of extra-virgin olive oil, 2 tablespoons (6 g) of chopped fresh oregano, ½ teaspoon (1 g) of red pepper flakes, and kosher salt to taste. Mix well to ensure that all of the ingredients are fully combined.You can substitute fresh chopped basil or parsley for the oregano if you prefer.

, When you’ve flavored the oil, use a pastry brush to spread it over the cut sides of 1 baguette that’s been sliced in half horizontally. Place the baguette pieces cut side down in the grill pan, and grill them for approximately 4 minutes, or until they’re toasted.If you don’t have a pastry brush, use heavy duty napkins, paper towel, or coffee filters to spread the oil over the bread. Just make sure to use paper items that aren’t flimsy so they won’t leave bits of paper behind.

, When the baguette pieces are toasted, remove them from the grill pan. Flavor the bread further by rubbing down the cut sides with garlic. Use 1 large clove for each piece of bread.If you aren’t a fan of garlic, you can skip this step.

, After you’ve flavored the baguette with the garlic, take 2 medium tomatoes that have been cut into ¼-inch (6.35-mm) slices and spread them evenly among the two baguette pieces. Next, layer ½ pound (228 g) of sliced provolone cheese over the tomatoes so they’re mostly covered.You may want to season the tomato slices with kosher salt to taste before adding the cheese.

, Place the baguette pieces in the grill pan again with the cover on. Allow the sandwich to cook until the cheese melts, which should take approximately 3 to 5 minutes., When the cheese on the sandwich is melted, remove it from the grill pan. Sprinkle a bit more kosher salt over it, and drizzle what’s left of the oil mixture over the top of the sandwich as well.You can omit the salt and/or the oil if you prefer.

, Allow the sandwich to cool for 2 to 3 minutes, and then use a sharp knife to cut it into slices. Place the slices on a platter, and serve.Depending on how large you cut the slices, you should get 12 to 16 servings from the grilled cheese.

Remove from the skillet and serve.",How to Make a Breakfast Grilled Cheese," Set the skillet over a medium-high heat and give it a couple of minutes to start warming up. Ideally, the skillet should be large enough to hold two regular-sized slices of bread at a time. Add a tablespoon of butter or canola oil if you wish, or you can simply cook the breakfast meats in their own fat.If the skillet you’re using is not non-stick, lubricating it with a little oil before you start can save you a lot of trouble during the cleanup stage.
The liquefied fat from the bacon or sausage can be used to scramble the eggs right afterward.;
, Add four strips of bacon or four small sausage links to the pan. Let the meat cook until it browns and the fat renders out of it. Turn each strip of bacon over once the liquid fat begins to bubble over the top; if you’re making sausage, make sure to break it into small crumble it as it cooks.Hearty center-cut bacon fries up crisp and meaty, making it perfect for sandwiches.
Remove the outer casing from the sausage links before you put them in the pan., Remove the bacon or sausage from the skillet. Beat 2-4 whole eggs (depending on how many sandwiches you want to make) in a small mixing bowl with a splash of milk. Add salt and pepper to taste. While the skillet is still hot, pour in the eggs and scramble them gently using a flat spatula until they begin to solidify and fluff up. Take the eggs out of the skillet and put them on a separate plate.To cut down on mess and difficulty, keep the eggs in a few large chunks.

, Cheddar and American are the most common choices for a grilled cheese, but you could also use jack, muenster, Havarti, Gruyere or whatever else you prefer. It’s best if the cheese is in broad, flat slices, but shredded cheese will work as well. Use 1-2 slices for each sandwich.If you’re really feeling daring, try mixing-and-matching a couple different types of cheese with complementary flavors, such as manchego and swiss.
Some cheeses melt better than others. You likely won’t have much success with so-called “squeaky” varieties like goat cheese and queso fresco., Slather one side of each slice of bread with a generous helping of butter softened at room temperature (2-3 tablespoons will do the trick nicely). The butter will cook right into the bread, getting it perfectly crispy and golden brown.Use plain packaged white or wheat bread on the fly, or go with thick, fresh-baked sourdough or pumpernickel for a bistro-ready delicacy.
You can also brush on a light coating of olive or canola oil as a substitute for butter. Oil will make for a more even finish., The grilled cheese sandwich is a highly customizable food. Put a unique touch on your sandwich with any other ingredients that you think will pair well with delicious salty bacon or sausage and silky smooth melted cheese. Just make sure you can get it closed to grill it!Let your imagination run wild. Put together different combinations each time you make the breakfast grilled cheese.
Try an omelette-style sandwich with mushrooms, onions or bell peppers, or make a BLT grilled cheese by adding crisp lettuce and freshly sliced red ripe tomatoes.

, After being used to cook the bacon or sausage and scramble the eggs, your skillet will have gotten very hot. Lower the temperature by a notch or two, or remove the skillet from the heat source and let it rest for a moment. That way, you won’t risk accidentally burning the sandwich by cooking it too fast.Take a moment to wipe any small pieces of bacon, sausage or egg remaining in the skillet so they don’t burn and get stuck on the sandwich.
The bread should cook slowly so that you’ll have time to heat both sides of the sandwich once all the ingredients are in place.

, Plop the bread in butter-side down and listen for the delightful sizzle. Allow the bread slices to grill for 20-30 seconds so that it just begins to brown. Lift one corner each slice with your spatula and take a peek at the underside to see how it’s coming along. Once the bread starts to turn a golden color, it will be time to add the rest of the components.If you’re cooking with a smaller skillet or you’ve overstuffed your grilled cheese with delicious toppings, put the sandwich together first, then cook it on both sides until the bread is golden-brown and the cheese is melted., Start by placing a slice of cheese on one of the pieces of bread, or use one for each. Then, distribute the scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage and any extra toppings evenly between both halves of the sandwich. Pat both halves of the sandwich flat so you’ll be able to put them together neatly.Making a sandwich with two slices of cheese will ensure that it comes out extra rich and hold together better.
Add this point, you can add a pinch of seasoned salt, garlic powder or any other spices you want to increase the flavor.

, Fold one half of the sandwich over onto the other, being careful not to lose any toppings. Continue to heat the grilled cheese for another 30 seconds to a minute, then flip the sandwich over and cook for the same amount of time on the other side. This will start melting the cheese, which will smother and envelope the other ingredients. Yum!Pressing down on the sandwich with your spatula will put more surface area in contact with the skillet, cooking it faster and more evenly.
Keep an eye on the bread and don’t let it get too dark. Nobody likes a burnt grilled cheese.

, Scoop the sandwich out of the skillet once it’s perfectly done. Cut it from corner to corner or straight down the middle with the edge of the spatula and give it a couple moments to cool off before you dig in. Serve the grilled cheese with a side of pancakes, hashbrowns, grits, fresh fruit or yogurt, and never skip breakfast again!


It should only take about 10-15 minutes total to prepare all of your ingredients and fix a delicious grilled cheese.
To save even more time, cook the bacon or sausage in advance, then just take it out of the refrigerator and add it to the sandwich when you’re ready to grill one up."

, When the oil begins to shimmer, add 2 tablespoons (33 g) of tomato paste. Cook the tomato sauce and oil together over medium heat for 2 minutes.Stir the tomato paste and olive oil regularly as you heat the mixture to ensure that it cooks evenly.

, Once you’ve cooked the tomato paste for a couple of minutes, add ½ cup (80 g) of canned chickpeas that have been drained and rinsed to the pan. Allow the mixture to cook for another 2 minutes.Remember to stir the mixture regularly as you heat it.

, After you’ve cooked the chickpea mixture for another couple of minutes, remove it from the heat. Use a potato masher to mash the chickpea mixture until it reaches the consistency of lumpy mashed potatoes.If you don’t have a potato masher, you can use the back of a large fork or spoon to mash the chickpeas.

, For two grilled sandwiches, you’ll need 4 slices of bread. Set two of them out on your work surface and divide the chickpea mixture between the slices, spreading it evenly across each piece with a knife or spatula.You can use any type of bread that you like for the grilled cheese, but a hearty bread, such as sourdough, multigrain, or ciabatta, is the best option.

, After you’ve spread the chickpea mixture over the two slices of bread, divide ½ cup (115 g) of loosely packed fresh baby spinach between them. Set the spinach over the chickpea spread in an even layer so it’s not falling off the bread.You can substitute arugula or kale for the baby spinach if you prefer.
You can add other vegetables to the sandwich if you like. Sliced tomato, onion, and avocado are tasty options.

, Once you’ve arranged the spinach on bread slices, place two pieces of sliced cheddar cheese on top of the sandwiches. Position the cheese so it covers as much of the other fillings as possible.If you don’t have sliced cheddar, you can use shredded. Just be careful not to pile too much on the sandwich or it will drip out the sides as it melts.
If you are making the sandwiches for multiple people and everyone doesn’t like cheddar, you can substitute any cheese that melts well, such as Swiss, Muenster, provolone, or American.

, Once the oil is hot, place the sandwiches in the skillet. Let them cook on the first side for 3 to 4 minutes, or until they are golden brown on the bottom.If you cover the skillet with the sandwiches inside, they will usually cook more quickly.

, When the sandwiches have cooked for a few minutes on the first side, use a wide spatula to carefully flip them over. Allow the sandwiches to cook for another 3 to 4 minutes, or until the other side is also golden brown.Make sure that the cheese is fully melted when you take the sandwiches out of the skillet. If it hasn’t melted, lower the heat and let them cook another couple of minutes.

, Once the sandwiches are finished cooking, use the spatula to lift them out of the skillet. Transfer them to plates, and use a sharp knife in half before serving.The grilled cheeses are especially good served with soup.z

",How to Make a Philly Cheese Steak1," A thin cut of steak will cook very quickly and will let the different flavors — cheese, onions, peppers — intermingle, with your bread as the bed.


You can cut the partially-frozen steak with a large, sharp chef's knife, or you can use a commercial meat slicer for easy preparation and uniform thickness. Most people won't have a meat slicer; a sharp knife will do just fine, even if it takes a bit longer.;
, In a large skillet coated with a neutral oil, fry the onions and (if desired) peppers until both are translucent and barely browned on the edges. Stir occasional and salt as necessary. Remove and set aside when finished.

, Allow the meat to brown without stirring or agitating. At a high enough heat — and depending on the thickness of the meat — this process should only take one or two minutes. Do not overcook.

, Once the steak is chopped into smaller bits, turn it over to ensure that it's cooked on both sides. Cook for no longer than 30 seconds.

, You are going to be placing your roll directly on top of the steak, so make sure that your mound of meat is roughly the size of the roll.

,, What kind of hoagie roll should you choose? In the Tri-state area where cheesesteaks are king, Aversa, Amoroso, and Vilotti-Pisanelli are commonly used as hoagie rolls.


If you can't find any of these brands, however, you can try making your own Italian roll or using French bread. French bread is a little crispier than what is usually used, and it's not ideal, but it won't fall apart easily and is a pretty substantial bread.

, The contents of your cheesesteak should fit nicely inside your roll.

Option 1: Toast your hoagie roll and then smother the hot bread with cheez wiz. This will give the bread a nice crispiness, but the cheez wiz won't stay hot as long.
Option 2: Warm your cheez wiz in the microwave. Pick up melted cheese with a spatula and deposit on the roll.

Choose a bread for your sandwich.,
Use dry, day-old bread if you have it.,
Use sliced sandwich bread if possible.,
Pick a cheese that melts easily.,
Choose your spread.,
Consider adding extra ingredients to your sandwich.",How to Make a Grilled Cheese Sandwich Using a Microwave1," The classic choice for a grilled cheese is a fluffy, white bread,but if you're a little more health-conscious, go for a whole grain or flax bread. Otherwise, just follow your taste buds—from pumpernickel to sourdough, there is no wrong answer.


Avoid bread with large air bubbles or holes, as your cheese may melt right through and drip out.;
, Since the moisture in fresh bread makes it soggy (unlike a hot oven, a microwave won't evaporate the moisture, which would allow it to get crispy), a dry piece of bread will fare much better in a microwave.Always check old bread for mold, just to be safe.

, Each slice of pre-sliced bread will have the same thickness, which means they will toast evenly. If you are buying an unsliced loaf from a bakery, ask if they can slice it for you. Most bakeries, and bakery departments at grocery stores, have a bread slicer.


If you slice the bread by hand, use a serrated bread knife and try to cut the slices about 3/4 of an inch thick. Bread at this thickness will fit in a standard toaster and be thin enough for the microwave heat to penetrate., American and Cheddar are the go-to cheeses for a grilled cheese, but you can branch out with cheeses like Monterey Jack, Gruyere, Munster, Gouda, or Brie, as they all melt smoothly.Avoid fresh, crumbly or very hard, aged cheeses, including fresh goat cheese, Feta, and aged Parmesan.These cheeses just don't melt well when they are the main cheese in a sandwich.
A very hard cheese like Parmesan will melt smoothly if you grate it and pair it with a melter, like Cheddar. The moisture in the Cheddar will help the Parmesan melt better.If you can't resist those hard-to-melt cheeses, you can still add them to your sandwich for the taste (like you would add pickles or a tomato). Just make sure you also have plenty of cheese that melts easily, like Havarti or American., Butter is the classic choice, but margarine or mayonnaise will also infuse your bread with a richer flavor and help crisp the outside., Pickles, tomatoes, jalapenos, avocado, even potato chips—get creative with additional fillings if you want to branch out from the classic cheese-and-bread-only sandwich.Up your protein intake with a few slices of ham, turkey, or other deli meat. Just wipe off extra moisture before putting it on your sandwich.Remember that ingredients with additional moisture—like tomatoes—might make your sandwich a little soggy.
Enjoy your sandwich with a side of mustard, ketchup, sriracha, or tomato soup.

"
"
Toast both slices of bread in a toaster until golden brown.,
Butter one side of each slice of toast.,
Place the cheese and any additional ingredients between the two slices of toast.,
Wrap the sandwich in a paper towel and place on a microwave-safe plate or rack.,
Microwave between 15-20 seconds, or until the cheese is melted.The time it takes to melt will vary depending on the microwave.,
Use a towel or oven mitts to remove the sandwich and let it sit for 2-3 minutes before serving.",How to Make a Grilled Cheese Sandwich Using a Microwave2," If you are unsure of the settings on your toaster, try turning the dial to the medium, or middle setting. That way if your bread is a little under-toasted, you can pop it back in at the lowest setting to crisp it up.The drier the toast, the better. You will be adding moisture back into the bread when you microwave it with the the cheese and butter. Too much moisture can make your sandwich soggy., You can butter both sides, but you run the risk of adding too much moisture and ending up with a steamed, soft sandwich., The dry, unbuttered side of the bread should be touching the cheese, with the buttered side on the outside. Two slices of cheese at about 3/4oz (or about 1.5oz total) is usually plenty of cheese.Make sure the cheese is evenly distributed across the bread so it melts evenly. You can tear slices into smaller pieces to make them fit.
Don't pile your sandwich too high with extras. Microwave heat can't penetrate very deep--only about 1-1 1/2 inches--so a fat sandwich may not heat all the way through and your cheese might not melt., The paper towel will absorb the excess moisture, keeping your bread from getting too soggy.Don't wrap the sandwich in plastic wrap, as this traps moisture instead of absorbing it., If you see the cheese begin to drip out of the sides, the sandwich should be done.


You can also see if the cheese is melted by trying to lift the top slice of bread. If the cheese is fully melted, the bread will stick together and be difficult to separate.

, This gives the bread time to cool to a crust, plus it makes it safer for you to eat."
"
Butter one side of each slice of bread.,
Place your cheese on the dry, unbuttered side of one slice of bread.,
Top cheese with any additional ingredients and cover with the second slice of bread, butter-side up.,
Place your crisper pan (or browning dish) in the microwave and follow the manufacturer's instructions to pre-heat.,
Place the sandwich on the crisper pan and microwave for 20-30 seconds.If the crisper pan comes with a lid, don't cover the sandwich.,
Use a spatula to flip your sandwich over and microwave for another 20-30 seconds.,
Use heat-proof oven mitts to remove the crisper pan and sandwich.",How to Make a Grilled Cheese Sandwich Using a Microwave3," Make sure the butter is softened so it spreads easily on the bread, otherwise it might tear. Place the bread on a clean surface, butter-side down.You can soften or melt the butter by placing about 1 tablespoon in a microwave-safe bowl for 5-10 seconds., Most recipes call for 2 slices of cheese, or about 1.5 oz. Go ahead and add more if you want a super-cheesy sandwich.Distribute your cheese evenly over the bread so all melts at the same rate.

, Don't build a sandwich any taller than 1-1 1/2 inches or the microwaves may not cook it all the way through., A crisper pan is made from microwave-safe metal that becomes extremely hot and works the same as a griddle or pan you would heat up on the stove. It will brown and crisp your bread, just like if you made your sandwich in a frying pan.To get the griddle-effect, a crisper pan must become extremely hot during the preheating process. Only use it with adult supervision and never, ever touch it with your bare hands. Use heat-proof oven mitts to handle the crisper.Follow the manufacturers directions about where to place the pan. It may have to sit on the floor of the microwave or may have built-in legs that lift it closer to the grill on the ceiling of the machine.Do not put anything on the crisper pan until it has pre-heated.

,


If your bread doesn't appear to be browning, try adding more time in 5-second increments. Remember, the bread that is touching the pan is the side that will be getting crisp, so you may not be able to tell until you flip it over., This will ensure that both sides of your bread are browned and toasted and that the inside of your grilled cheese is cooked through evenly.Press the sandwich with the spatula on either side to add crispiness.Be very careful no part of your skin comes in contact with the pan. If it is easier, first remove the pan with oven mitts, then flip the sandwich and return the pan to the microwave.

, Allow the sandwich to cool for 2-3 minutes before cutting in half and serving warm. The bread may continue to crust over a little as it cools."

For a twist, pour some olive oil into the skillet instead of coating the sandwich with butter.;
, You do not need to oil the skillet because the bread already has butter on it.

, Place a slice of bread, butter-side-down, onto the skillet. Add 1 to 2 slices of Cheddar cheese on top of the bread.


You can also try another type of cheese, such as Monterey Jack, for a gourmet sandwich.

, You can leave your sandwich plain, or you can pile on some extra ingredients on top of the cheese. When setting down the last slice of bread, make sure that the buttered side is facing upwards this time.


Add cooked, sliced or crumbled bacon on top of the cheese.Place a slice of ham on top of the cheese.Sprinkle dried herbs, such as basil, oregano, or rosemary, on top of the cheese.This will work especially well if you put herbs on your sandwich.
Add slices of tomato and cooked bacon., This will take about 2 to 3 minutes. You can also wait for the cheese to start melting instead., Once the sandwich has started to turn golden-brown and the cheese has melted, slide a spatula under it and flip it over. Grill the sandwich for another 1 to 2 minutes., Use a spatula to transfer it from the skillet and to a plate. Leave the sandwich whole, or cut it in half. You can cut it vertically or diagonally.

If you don't like Swiss cheese, you can try another type of cheese, such as Monterey Jack.

, Scoop the mayo into a small cup or bowl. Add the honey, dried mustard, and poppy seeds. Stir everything together with a fork or mini whisk until evenly combined.

, Flip the top half of the bread roll over so that the under/cut side is facing you. Use a butter knife to spread the honey-mustard across the roll.

, Place the top half of the roll down onto the cheese, with the honey-mustard side facing down. For a fancier sandwich, stir a pinch of poppy seeds into ¼ tablespoon of melted butter, then spread it across the top of your sandwich with a pastry brush.

, To turn this into a tasty, gourmet sandwich, preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Once the oven reaches the correct temperature, place the sandwich onto a baking sheet and tuck it inside. Bake the sandwich for 15 to 20 minutes.

You can also use mayo or a thick, creamy salad dressing, such as Ranch, Italian, or Green Goddess.

, Place the bottom slice down, buttered-side-up. Place 1 to 2 leaves of lettuce on top. If the lettuce leaves are much larger than the sandwich, cut them into halves or thirds first.


Some types of lettuce have a very thick stem in the middle. Reduce bulk by cutting this stem out with a sharp knife.

, Cut a thin slice off of a red onion. Separate the slice into rings. Place as many rings as you want onto the lettuce.


You can leave the onion rings off if you want to.

, Cut off two thick slices of tomato. Stack them on top of the lettuce and onion. A thick, meaty tomato would work the best for this.

, Add a sprinkle of salt and a dash of pepper on top of the tomato slices. How much you use is entirely up to you!

, Carefully lay 1 to 2 slices of sharp, white Cheddar on top of the sandwich. Make sure that they are covering the tomatoes entirely. They will keep your sandwich from getting soggy.


If you don't like Cheddar, try Swiss, Monterey Jack, or Provolone instead.

, For an extra-fancy touch, slice the sandwich in half diagonally from corner-to-corner. Stick a fancy toothpick or cocktail stick through each sandwich half to hold it together.

",How to Make a Cucumber Cream Cheese Sandwich," Classic cucumber cream cheese sandwiches are dainty treats, typically served as a snack or part of a tea service and are usually made with white bread.


Traditional English cucumber sandwiches rely upon soft white bread that won't compete with the flavor or texture of the fillings.Of course, if you want a heartier meal, break traditional and experiment with a strong rye or a sweet brown bread.
You can even try sweeter white-flour breads like brioche, which is made with egg and butter.;
, Most recipes for cucumber sandwiches suggest that you use seedless English cucumbers, which are readily available in most grocery stores. You don't have to stick to this variety, though. Making cucumber cream cheese sandwiches can be a great way to use up cucumbers from your garden harvest.


You should choose a “burpless” variety, which has lower levels of cucurbitacin, a natural organic compound that is responsible for some cucumbers' bitter flavor and tendency to cause stomach upset in people.Some great choices are as follows: striped Armenian cucumbers, the Suyon Long, the Straight Eight, the Lemon Cucumber (which has, as the name suggests, a lemony flavor), and the Sumter (a particularly disease-resistant variety).All of these are known among gardeners as good “eating” pickles. Save the cucumbers with high levels of cucurbitacin for pickling.

, A classic cucumber cream cheese sandwich is an elegant example of simplicity, relying only upon the creamy tanginess of cream cheese, paired with the crisp crunch of a cucumber housed between two pillowy pieces of white bread. There's nothing wrong with breaking from tradition now and again, though! Experiment with these different filling options:


Option #1: Mix 4 ounces cream cheese with 1-2 ounces of goat cheese. Mix in fresh lemon juice to taste (about 1-2 tablespoons), and salt and pepper to taste.Option #2: Mix 4 ounces of cream cheese with 2 tablespoons of finely chopped dill. Mix in fresh lemon juice to taste (about 1-2 tablespoons, but more if you'd like), and season with salt and pepper.Option #3: For a zestier filling, mix 4 ounces of cream cheese with 1/4 cup of mayonnaise. Add in either 1-2 tablespoons of Ranch dressing OR about ½ packet of dry Ranch dressing seasoning mix (start with a small amount of dressing—whether it's wet or dry—and increase as needed). Season with salt and pepper to taste, but know that you may need less salt with this filling mixture.

, Once you've selected your choice of filling, simply mix all of the ingredients together in a medium sized bowl.


Make sure that the cream cheese has softened to room temperature, or you may have a difficult time getting a smooth texture.
You may also mix the ingredients together in a stand mixer.

, Most recipes call for you to peel the cucumber. This is optional, though. If you like the flavor of the peel or like the added crunch it brings to your sandwich, leave them on.


If your cucumber has seeds, consider removing them. This will result in a crunchier final sandwich, but many chefs lament the loss of the flavor that the seeds/middle of the cucumber lends. Slice the cucumbers very thinly. It's easiest to cut your cucumber into thin rounds, but some chefs prefer to cut the cucumber length-wise.
You can also cut the cucumbers on a bias: Angle your knife forty-five degrees to your left (imagine a clock in front of you: place the tip of the knife at 10 o'clock and the handle of the knife down towards 4 o'clock). Proceed to cut into thin slices.

, Spread your filling very thinly on both sides of the bread, and then layer your sliced cucumbers on one piece of bread.


Though you've already seasoned your filling, you may want to sprinkle just a bit of salt and/or pepper on top of the cucumbers.
Place a second piece of bread (which has also been spread with the filling) on top of the cucumbers, and firmly press down.

, It's traditional to remove the crusts from the sandwiches, but this is an optional step. Your final sandwich will look more elegant and refined if you remove the crusts, so we definitely recommend cutting off the crusts if you'll be serving them to guests.


Experiment with cutting them into dainty shapes such as triangles or slim fingers.However you cut them, cut neatly and consistently. Snack on any mis-cuts or leftovers yourself in the kitchen!
Once you've finished cutting your sandwiches—or once you've finished putting the sandwiches together if you are a crust-lover—all that remains to be done is to serve and enjoy them!

Find a new favorite cheese.,
Blend several cheeses together.,
Consider your bread options.",How to Make a Gourmet Grilled Cheese1," Begin by visiting a specialty cheese shop or a grocery store with a particularly large cheese section. Talk to an employee about what flavors you’re looking for and what sort of flavor combinations you’re in the mood for. Don’t forget to mention whether you’re looking for a particular consistency as well.Be brave. You could always go for a solid cheese you’ve had before, but trying something new will broaden the scope of flavors you’re able to incorporate in future recipes.
If you’re looking for the meltiest of all cheeses, go for Muenster and Havarti.;
, Leaning towards building a basic grilled cheese, just a bit fancier? Don’t hesitate to use multiple cheeses on one sandwich. For example, get some Comte, Taleggio, and Brie, all for use on one sandwich. This particular combination will go best with a fine, relatively neutral bread like Brioche.The important thing it to be creative. Plus, winding up with a few different blocks of cheese in your fridge gives you the opportunity to try other new, equally adventurous recipes.

, A high quality bread is an absolute necessity if you want your sandwich to look, feel, and taste gourmet. Most importantly, make sure the bread you choose is firm enough to provide a crisp outer layer when buttered and cooked.Go with Pullman bread for a soft and airy option similar to white bread, but with a better crust and higher quality ingredients.
Rich, dense multigrain options can hold up to the most flavorful of cheeses. Pair it with Manchego. Pumpernickel can pair well more powerful flavors too.
Day-old sourdough is the crème-de-la-crème of grilled cheese bread options. The air pockets in sourdough add texture to your bite, and a day gives it the necessary time to firm up and maximize crunchiness.

Build the ultimate grilled cheese with blueberries and balsamic.",How to Make a Gourmet Grilled Cheese2," Though a cheddar and tomato grilled cheese may be the standard, a gouda, mushroom, and onion grilled cheese is the standard gourmet option. Roast some mushrooms and onions and add to liberal amount of Gouda, all pressed between a pair of whole wheat bread slices.Add greens too! Kale will go especially great in this one.

, Once you’ve got a better handle on all the different cheeses to choose from, spend a few extra minutes in the produce department. Particularly healthy – and tasty – options include Brussel sprouts, asparagus, and spinach. All of these go very well with goat cheese.In truth, you can pair just about any cheese with just about any vegetable. After finding a few cheeses you like, grab a whole slew of different veggies to slice up and try out in different combinations.

, One borderline-dessert grilled cheese option incorporates strawberries, a delightful cheese called Brie, and chocolate. Cover a slice of multigrain bread with a layer of sliced Brie. Next, cover the chees with strawberries that have been quartered, salted, peppered, and briefly pan-roasted. Include a liquid drizzle of dark chocolate and add another slice of multigrain. Heat as desired.Alternatively, pair Brie with apple slices and fig jam on multigrain. If you’re looking for a particularly complex sandwich, throw in some arugula and caramelized onions as well.
Want to keep it simple, add some class, and incorporate bacon? It can happen: pair brie with still-hot bacon and apricot preserves.

, Grab yourself a jar of jalapeño jelly and swing by the produce section for a crisp, tart apple too. Pair these with a cheese combination, such as cheddar and mozzarella. This recipe calls for sourdough, and will be best grilled.Alternatively, you can always cut up some fresh jalapeños. While your sandwich will still be both fancy and delicious, it will lose some of the balance brought by the jelly’s sweetness.

, Go for seafood gold and grab yourself some lobster. Include it in a sandwich with Mascarpone cheese, diced scallions, and few slices of freshly cut tomatoes.The flavor of lobster is, admittedly, best allowed to access your taste buds when paired with white bread, such as that of a dinner roll.

Consider adding some provolone as well, and some arugula to add some vegetal spiciness.

, Another fruit and cheese sandwich? Well, this one’s especially worthy of note. Simply layer blueberries, greens of your choosing, and goat cheese on a baguette and douse in balsamic vinegar."

Butter a skillet.,
Cook the sandwich for 3 to 5 minutes on one side.,
Cook the other side.,
Plate your sandwich.",How to Make a Gourmet Grilled Cheese3," Melt 1 tablespoon of salted butter in a nonstick skillet over medium-low heat. If you’ve got one, use a cast-iron skillet. While salted butter isn’t your only option – it’s widely accepted to be the best. For instance, mayo will work, but is best for American cheese on white bread – not quite worthy of “gourmet” status.In fact, your butter can be the source of your sandwich’s sophistication. Try truffle butter, herbed butter, or garlic butter.

, Before placing the sandwich in the pan, press it down gently. Avoid crushing any of your gourmet ingredients, or press hard enough to keep it all together. After three minutes, use a spatula to peak at the side of the sandwich that’s been cooking. If it’s golden brown, you’ve nailed it. Hurry up and flip your sandwich over., Lift the sandwich with a spatula and inspect the skillet’s surface. If the sandwich lifted without resistance, and there is still an buttery sheen to the skillet’s surface, carefully flip your sandwich and begin cooking the other side. Give it three minutes and check to see if the bread has browned to perfection.Add a bit more butter between sides if the sandwich sticks to the surface or the skillet looks dry when you check it.

, Carefully transfer your sandwich from the pan to a plate of your choosing. Garnish per the recipe you’re working with, or with something that will simply boost the visual appeal of your sandwich. A single stalk of parsley or another well-placed bit of herb, albeit simple, will not only look good, but will call attention to the fact that you put care and attention into the sandwich. Finally: enjoy!"

If your grill does not come with inserts, you can still use it.;
, Add the cheese between the two slices of bread and place straight on the preheated grill. Cover and allow to cook. Other ideas for grilled sandwich variations include:


Add ham with the cheese to give more taste to your sandwich.
Vary the breads and cheeses to make it more interesting. For example, try goat cheese on whole grain bread.
Place a thin slice of tomato on the cheese, and grill it together. Be careful not to burn your mouth, though, since cooked tomatoes become very hot due to their high percentage of water.
Add fruits or veggies. Examples are grilled goat cheese with apples or the classic grilled cheese with tomato.

, Check on it in about a minute; it might take a couple of minutes but keep checking to avoid burning. Alternatively, you can save a little time by loading the sandwich while the grill is still cold and giving the whole process about 5 minutes, though you may need to add or subtract a minute based on your grill. If you've added extra ingredients, such as meat, this method works better than starting with a pre-heated grill because it gives the fillings time to heat up before the bread burns.

, When the sandwich is finished cooking, lift the lid and pull the plug out of the wall.

, Who says corn dog batter has to be used only for hot dogs? Most meats and vegetables taste great fried in the crispy cornmeal batter. If you can put it on a skewer, you can make it into a crunchy corn treat. If you're using shrimp, make sure it's peeled and de-veined first, then skewer it in two places (so it won't fall off), bread it, and fry it according to the instructions.

Avoid oversized hot dogs.,
Opt for nitrate-free hot dogs.,
Choose organic hot dogs.,
Pay attention to the sodium levels.,
Consider hot dogs made with turkey or chicken.,
Look into vegetarian hot dogs.",How to Make Healthier Hot Dogs1," Bigger hotdogs mean more fat, calories, and sodium, so skip any dogs labeled jumbo, bun-length, or stadium style. They can have up to double the amount of all the unhealthy junk you’re trying to avoid., Nitrate or sodium-nitrate is used to hot dogs last longer on grocery store shelves. But eating nitrates may increase your risk of cancer, so choose a nitrate-free option for the healthiest hot dogs.Nitrate-free hot dogs are usually clearly labeled. If you're not sure whether your dogs have nitrates, scan the ingredient list for “sodium nitrite” or “sodium nitrate.”

, When it comes to finding nitrate-free hot dogs, an organic option is usually the best bet. The meat in organic dogs isn’t treated with any sketchy antibiotics or hormones either, so you can definitely feel better about eating them., High sodium levels make many store-bought hot dogs a scary option. Check the nutrition labels on any package you’re considering, and avoid brands with more than 370 milligrams of sodium per serving.Be careful with “lite” hot dogs. They've often got a ton of sodium to help boost their flavor.

, All-beef hot dogs are definitely traditional, but red meat is chock full of saturated fat. Hot dogs made with turkey or chicken are a leaner choice, which means less fat and calories., A meatless dog is almost always the winner when it comes to healthy hot dogs. That's because vegetarian hot dogs are made from soy protein, so they've got a lot less saturated fat and calories than traditional meat versions.Don’t overlook the sodium levels in veggie hot dogs. They're sometimes loaded with sodium for extra flavor to make up for the lack of meat.

, After you’ve emptied the food processor, toss in a pound (454 g) of lean ground pork and a pound (454 g) of lean ground turkey. Pulse the meats until they’ve got an extremely fine texture.If your food processor isn’t that big, try grinding the meats separately. Then throw them into the processor together just to mix them.

, When you’re done grinding the meats, add the oats and 2 large, lightly beaten egg whites, 1 tablespoon (10 g) of garlic powder, 1 tablespoon (7 g) of onion powder, 4 teaspoons (8 g) of ground dry mustard, 1 ½ teaspoons (2 g) of dried thyme, 1 teaspoon (2 g) of ground nutmeg, 1 teaspoon (2 g) of ground mace, 1 teaspoon (2 g) of ground sweet paprika, 1 teaspoon (6 g) of salt, and 1 ½ teaspoons (3 g) of freshly ground black pepper. Run the mixture in the processor until you've got a thick paste.You don't want to run the food processor for too long because it can get hot and heat the meat. Pulse it briefly, and cool processor down for a couple of seconds before pulsing it again.

, When you're finished processing the meat mixture, spoon it into a large bowl. Give it a good mix with a wooden spoon so the seasonings are fully blended with the meat. Throw some plastic wrap over the bowl, and chill it the fridge for 1 to 2 hours., After the meat mixture has chilled, take 2 ounces (55 g) of it at a time and work it into a ball with your hands. Next, roll the ball into a log that's about 5-inches (13-cm) long to give it a standard hot dog shape.If you want totally traditional hot dogs, you can run the meat mixture through a sausage maker with hot dog-sized casings. But be aware that you'll have healthier hot dogs without casings.

, Once you’ve shaped hot dogs, toss them into a large skillet. Pour just enough water into the pan so it covers the them halfway., Heat the skillet with the hot dogs and water on the stove on high.

The larger and thicker the hot dogs are, the more time you'll have to simmer them.

, Once the hot dogs are finished simmering, lift them out of the skillet with tongs. Put them on a paper towel-lined plate so they can drain. Finish cooking the rest of the hot dogs the same exact way., When the hot dogs are fully drained, throw them on a grill over medium heat for 7 to 9 minutes to brown them. You can also brown them in a skillet on the stove over medium heat for 5 minutes.If you don’t plan to eat the hot dogs right away, wrap them individually in plastic after simmering them.

",How to Reheat a Cheeseburger," Take the cheeseburger apart, dividing it into its separate pieces: buns, patty, condiments, and vegetables.You might be tempted to stick the whole cheeseburger in the microwave without separating it into parts, but doing so will result in soggy buns and vegetables. Each component of the cheeseburger contains a different level of moisture, which is partially why reheating them at the same time produces uneven—and undesirable—results.
Scrape the condiments off the patty and buns. A little can remain, but most of it should be removed.
Consider scraping the cheese off, as well. It won't affect the way the burger patty reheats, but it may melt off during the reheating process even if you leave it on.
Sort through the vegetables and other toppings. Lettuce and tomatoes have a tendency to get soggy during storage, so you may need to toss them. Pickles, onions, bacon, and other toppings with a lower water content tend to be okay and can be saved.;
, Warm up the burger patty by itself using the microwave, oven, or stovetop.


See the “Different Ways to Reheat the Burger Patty” section for additional information.
The microwave is the quickest method, but it's also easier to overcook the patty when using that appliance. If you're more interested in quality than speed, the oven and stovetop might be better options.

, Most of the original cheese may completely melt off as you reheat the patty. As a result, you may need to top the patty with a fresh slice of cheese.


To lightly melt the cheese onto the patty, place it on top during the final part of the reheating process. You can place the cheese on after you finish reheating the patty, but it may not melt at all if you wait until then.

, The best way to reheat the cheeseburger bun is to place it in the oven for a few minutes, but if you're short on time, the microwave can be used instead.


See the ""Different Ways to Reheat the Burger Bun"" section for additional information.
If you're already using the oven or the stovetop to reheat the patty, it is recommended that you use the oven to reheat the bun. Even though the process takes a little longer than the microwave, the oven tends to produce higher quality results.

, Place the patty on the bottom bun, followed by any condiments and vegetables. Top it all off with the top bun.


Replace any condiments, including ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise, and special sauces.
Salvageable vegetables from the original sandwich can be reused, but you should consider replacing any vegetables that were soggy or wilted.

, Sprinkle the surface with a few drops of water.


Keep the patty in the center of the plate so that it reheats evenly.
Burger patties can lose some of their moisture content during refrigeration, so if you don't sprinkle them with a few flicks of water before sticking them in the microwave, they can dry out and become rubbery., Microwave the patty on high for 30 to 90 seconds, working in 15-second to 30-second intervals.


The exact amount of time can vary depending on the thickness of the burger patty and the wattage of your microwave.
If you want to add a fresh piece of cheese, place it on top of the patty and microwave the two together for another 10 seconds.

, Prepare a small baking sheet by lining it with nonstick aluminum foil.

, Place the patty in the middle of the prepared baking sheet. Sprinkle the surface with a little water.


Burger patties lose moisture when they sit in the refrigerator, so sprinkling the patty with a few drops of water before reheating it can prevent it from drying out too severely in the heat of the oven.

, Stick the patty in the preheated oven and cook until heated through. This will usually take approximately 10 minutes, but may take more or less time depending on the thickness of the patty.


If you want to melt additional cheese onto the patty, place a fresh slice on top of the burger during the last 1 or 2 minutes.

, Place the burger patty in a small stainless steel or cast iron pan.


Make sure that the pan you use has a lid.

, Fill the pan with just enough water to cover the bottom.Alternatively, you can add a little beef broth or cooking oil instead of water to give the patty an extra dimension of flavor.
The addition of liquid will prevent the patty from drying out any further as it cooks. Moreover, some of the moisture it lost while sitting in the refrigerator will even be regained as the steam seeps into the meat.

, Place the pan on your stove, cover it, and heat over medium to medium-high for 5 to 7 minutes.By covering the pan, you allow steam to build up inside. This steam is the primary heat source responsible for reheating the patty.
If you want to add a fresh slice of cheese, remove the lid and place the cheese on top for 30 to 60 seconds. Keep the lid off while the cheese melts.

, Remove the patty from the pan and transfer it to a paper towel lined plate for 30 seconds. This rest time should allow most excess water to drip off.


The liquid in the pan can be discarded at this point.

, If you already have the oven set to 400 degrees Fahrenheit (200 degrees Celsius) to reheat the patty, you can keep it at that temperature.

, Wrap each bun in a separate sheet of aluminum foil. All sides of each bun should be covered.


The foil should prevent the buns from burning in the oven. The extra insulation should also help distribute the heat throughout the bun more evenly.
You can place the foil-wrapped buns on a baking sheet, but doing so is not necessary.

, Place the wrapped buns in the oven and reheat until warmed throughout. This should only take approximately 5 minutes or less.


If the oven has been set for 400 degrees Fahrenheit (200 degrees Celsius), you should only keep the buns in the oven for 2 to 3 minutes.

, Loosely wrap the two buns together using a long, clean sheet of paper towel.


The paper towels can help control and balance the moisture content of the bread as it reheats.

, Place the buns in the microwave and cook on high for 30 seconds, or until both buns feel evenly warm.


Lay the buns side by side instead of putting one on top of the other.
If you need to reheat the buns for longer than 30 seconds, rotate them before microwaving for additional time.

Look for a multi-pronged garden tool.,
Consider making your own cooking tool.,
Find cleaning materials before using garden tools for cooking.",How to Make a Redneck Hotdog Cooker1," The idea is to stick the hotdog on the end of something like a rake so look for either a garden rake, garden claw or any other tool that will allow you to make the transformation.

Consider something with a long pole. You don’t want your tender fingers near the flame, so make sure you choose something that gives you enough distance between the hotdogs, fire and your hands.



 


Make sure the item can be near a flame. Anything made of plastic or rubber will melt and product noxious fumes once heated. Only use old fashioned steel or metal for cooking.





;
, If you want to approach the job using traditional cooking utensils, consider creating your own cooking device using a variety of tools or items from the kitchen and garage.

Join a skillet to a shovel. Use wire to bond the skillet to the shovel and you’ve created a long handled skillet that allows you to sit by the fire with beer in one hand, skillet in the other.






Transform a stand-alone sprinkler into a shish kabab hot dog cooker. Stick metal rods or even wooden sticks in old sprinkler heads, position next to the fire and allow the dogs to cook on their own. Remember to turn and rotate for even cooking.

, While it may take a few minutes, cleaning the garden rake or any other tool you find in the garage will help you maintain sanitary cooking conditions. And help you to avoid anyone becoming sick.


Use dish soap and hot water to clean tools. Give the tools a good scrubbing with a lot of soap and water, then rinse and allow to dry before using tool as a cooking device.

Allow the hotdogs to cool slightly before removing them from the cooking device.",How to Make a Redneck Hotdog Cooker2," Whether you get them on sale or you go for the expensive dogs; make sure you find the kind of hotdogs you like best.

, Add bacon, cheese or any other topping right on the dog before you cook it. Use toothpicks to hold a piece of wrapped bacon in place or throw on a piece of cheese right before the hotdog is fully cooked.

, If you are using a garden rake, add one hotdog to each prong. Make sure the hotdog is fully pierced and you can see the other end of the rake (so that the hotdog doesn’t fall off the rake and into your fire).

, Make sure you have a decent flame or heat coming from your heat source. You should be able to cook the hotdogs fairly quickly if you have a strong flame/heat.

, Avoid placing the meat directly into the flame if you are cooking them over a campfire because it could cause the hot dogs to burn.

, Turn the rake or your cooking device over to ensure the meat browns evenly.

, Or use a hot pad, a towel or your t-shirt to remove the dogs and plate them.

Top hot dogs with your preferred condiments.,
Consider an ""all-in-one"" microwave recipe for your hot dog.",How to Make a Hot Dog in the Microwave," Paper towels make cleanup a cinch by absorbing grease and moisture that leaks out of the hot dog as it cooks. If you're cooking multiple hot dogs, line them up in a row on the towel, leaving a little space between each. This allows them to cook evenly.


Be sure to use a microwave-safe plate. Plates made from glass or ceramic are safe bets. Plastic and metal plates should be avoided. Click here for a detailed guide to which containers are microwave-safe.;
, Traditional microwave wisdom dictates that hot dogs should be pricked or sliced a few times with a sharp utensil before cooking. This allows steam from inside the hot dog to escape rather than building up and causing it to explode.However, some sources (like Oscar Mayer) claim that there is no danger of explosion and that piercing the hot dogs will let the juices run out while they cook, leaving you with a dry frank.The choice here is yours — if you're only microwaving one or two hot dogs, they'll be in the microwave for such little time that you're unlikely to run into problems either way.

, Covering the hot dogs with a second layer of paper towel holds moisture next to them as they cook, ensuring a plump, juicy hot dog.


If you roll up your hot dog, tuck the ends under so that the towel doesn't unroll during cooking.

, Different microwaves have different wattages, so cooking times can vary slightly. The cooking times below assume a middle-of-the-road microwave rated for about 800-1,000 watts.If your microwave has a higher wattage, use shorter cooking times (and vice versa for lower wattage units). If you're unsure of your microwave's wattage, click here.



1 hot dog: About 40 seconds

2 hot dogs: About 1 minute to 1 minute 15 seconds

3-4 hot dogs: About 1 minute 30 seconds to 2 minutes 30 seconds

5-6 hot dogs: About 3 minutes to 3 minutes 30 seconds

7-8 hot dogs: About 4 to 5 minutes

9-10 hot dogs: About 6 minutes

, Since microwaves can vary in their cooking power, it's wise to see how your hotdogs are doing when they're half-finished. If they're still cold or just barely lukewarm, let them finish cooking. If they're warm or hot to the touch, consider shortening the cooking time or simply taking them out of the microwave immediately.


Remove the paper towel carefully — steam trapped underneath may be released. Use oven mitts if concerned about burns.

, When your hot dogs are as hot as you'd like them to be, they're ready to eat. They're pre-cooked, so there's no ""right"" temperature to cook them to. Carefully remove the hot plate from the microwave, discard the paper towel, and serve the franks between buns or on their own. Enjoy!

, Traditionally, hot dogs are served in a white bun. Though you can use buns straight out of the bag and have no problems, many prefer the sensation of a warm bun when they eat a hot dog. Warming a bun in the microwave is quick and easy — see below:


Open the bun and place it face-down on a paper towel. A plate is OK but is not necessary.
Wrap the bun in the paper towel or place a second on top.
Microwave on high for 10-15 seconds. Check for a warm, soft texture. If it's not quite warm yet, go an additional 10 seconds.
Don't microwave the bun with the hot dog in it. The steam from the hot dog will make the bun soggy., Toasted buns have the warmth of microwaved buns with the added benefit of a crisp, toasty texture. If you have a toaster, toasting hot dog buns is easy — just put them in at the setting you'd normally use for white bread. There are other ways to toast buns as well:


Heat the open bun under a broiler until well-browned. Most modern ovens will have a ""broil"" setting that also works.
Rub the inside of the bun with a little oil and lay it face-down in a hot pan or griddle. Turn occasionally to prevent burning.

, Hot dogs are great plain, but adding toppings allows you to express your culinary creativity and add flavor to this classic dish. Typically, you'll want to add these condiments after microwaving the hot dog, as cooking can often affect these toppings' taste and consistency. Just a few topping ideas include:


Ketchup
Mustard
Mayonnaise
Hot pepper sauce (Sriracha, etc.)
Cream cheese
Chopped onions
Pickle relish
Bacon

, While most hot dog condiments are meant to be added cold after the hot dog is finished, a few recipes allow you to cook the hot dog along with its toppings in the microwave. A few are described below:



Cheese dogs: Slit each hotdog lengthwise and place a strip of your preferred cheese inside. Microwave as normal and serve.

Chili dogs: Place hot dogs in a microwave-safe tray and cover with chili. Microwave as normal, allowing a little extra cooking time for the chili. Serve separate from the buns — guests can pick a bun, then add a hot dog and chili from the other dish.

Sauerkraut dogs: Put an uncooked hot dog in a bun and top with sauerkraut. Wrap the entire hot dog in a paper towel and fold the leftover towel underneath. Microwave as normal, allowing an extra 5-10 seconds per frank. The bun will be somewhat soggy, but this texture pairs well with the sauerkraut.

Pour on the charcoal.,
Step on the gas.",How to Grill Hot Dogs1," If you have a charcoal grill, fill your chimney starter, soak the briquettes with charcoal lighter fluid, and light 'em up. Carefully, of course. Your eyebrows look good on you.


Allow about 20 to 30 minutes to burn off the lighter fluid and get the coals evenly burning. When the briquettes are covered with a layer of ash and glowing, they're ready. Pour them into the bottom of the grill, cover, and let it heat up.

Consider using hardwood charcoal instead of the standard charcoal briquette. It adds a great smoky flavor that marries well with hot dogs.;
, If you have a gas grill, turn on all burners to get the grill good and hot. You want the grill itself to sear the dogs as soon as they hit.


When you're ready to grill, you can turn down the heat to medium so you don't burn the dogs through and through. Not even Grey Poupon can help that!


"
"
Grab your tongs.,
Roll those dogs.,
Be patient.",How to Grill Hot Dogs2," Now that your grill of choice is heated up and ready for searing, it's time for the big event. Grab a set of tongs and load up the grill.


Lay the dogs on the grill perpendicular to the grate. This will give them nice char lines that enhance the flavor.






Make sure they're well-spaced. You need room to roll those puppies around on the grill.







, Every minute or two, roll the dogs about a quarter turn so that you cook all sides evenly. Thicker dogs will take a little longer to heat up on the inside.

, Don't remove your dogs too soon. They will still taste good, but you want to let the skin turn a deep reddish brown color. This is evidence of something called the Maillard Reaction, which is what gives grilled and roasted foods such great flavors.

"
"
Toast your buns.,
Load your dog.,
Chow time!",How to Grill Hot Dogs3," Sure, you can plop that freshly grilled wiener between a couple pasty-white hot dog buns, but why would you want to? Remember that Maillard reaction we talked about? That's what makes toast so good, too. So take advantage of that hot grill.

Turn off your gas grill. It should be plenty hot enough to toast up a couple buns. If you're serving a whole crew, keep it turned on low.






If you're using a charcoal grill, scoot the coals to one side. Put the buns on the cool side.






Open up your buns, slather a little butter on them, and then place them face down on the grill. Close the lid so it warms the whole bun. Keep an eye on them—if your grill is really hot, they can burn quickly.






When they start to brown, rotate them 90°, then give them another 30 seconds or so. Don't let them burn!







, When the bun's done, drop your dog in, and add condiments to your heart's desire. Here are some ideas for toppings:


Mustard—golden, yellow, gray, searing, smooth, or seedy. Hot dogs love it.
Ketchup—the old standby.
Pickle relish—dill, sweet, however you like it.
Raw onions—green, white, yellow, or sweet, it's all good!
Grilled onions—the only thing better than raw onions.
Grilled peppers—is there anything grilled peppers don't taste good on?
Cheese—add a little, add a lot. Pepper jack is a nice change from cheddar or processed cheese, though processed cheese has a really nice melt to it.
Chili—this makes it a little harder to eat with your hands, but it is delicious.
Barbecue sauce—adds to that smokey barbecue thing you have going on here.
Steak sauce—tired of ketchup? kick it up a notch.
Hot sauce—kick it up a couple more notches.
Sauerkraut—yes, it was nasty when you were a kid. Try it now!
Pretty much anything that'll fit on a bun that you like. Okay, maybe not rocky road ice cream, but you know what we mean!


, Enjoy your dog with relish (or any of the other aforementioned condiments).


Before the coals die, roast some marshmallows!

Serve.",How to Make a Hot Dog," Using a serrated knife, cut the meat into evenly sized 1-inch (2.5-cm) cubes.When making classic hot dogs, you'll need to cube both the pork shoulder and beef chuck.
For all-beef hot dogs, you'll need to cube the boneless beef short ribs.;
, Pass the meat through the smallest plate of the meat grinder. Once all the meat has ground once, pass it through the same plate again.


Grinding the meat twice isn't strictly necessary, but it should create a finer ground meat than you would typically find in stores. A finer grind will make it easier for the cure to spread throughout the meat.
When using two different meats, alternate the meats as you grind them to create a more evenly combined mixture.

, Add the kosher salt and meat cure to the ground meat. Use your hands to mix the entire mixture until everything appears evenly combined.


For the classic hot dog recipe, use any standard #1 cure or Prague powder.
When preparing the all-beef hot dogs, opt for pink curing salt instead.

, Cover the ground meat mixture with plastic wrap and place it in the refrigerator. Let it cure for 24 hours.


You should be able to safely cure the meat up to 48 hours.
If you're in a hurry, you can skip the prolonged curing and refrigerate the mixture for only 30 minutes. This may weaken the resulting flavor, but only slightly.

, Remove the meat from the refrigerator and add all of the seasonings to the mixture. Use your hands to thoroughly combine everything.


For the classic hot dog recipe, add the paprika, garlic powder, dry mustard, black pepper, coriander, mace, cardamom, non-fat milk powder, and liquid smoke.
For the all-beef hot dog recipe, add the dry mustard, paprika, ground coriander, ground black pepper, and garlic powder.

, Pour the corn syrup into the meat mixture. Use your hands to evenly mix the corn syrup into the rest of the mixture.


Once you add the corn syrup, the meat mixture should become notably easier the mold without separating.

, Spread the meat mixture onto a clean baking sheet and freeze it for approximately 30 minutes.


The mixture should be somewhat flat after you spread it over the baking sheet, but you don't need to worry too much about how thick it is.
Freezing the mixture for 30 minutes should get it adequately cold, especially if you intend to stuff the links using the traditional casing method. If you plan to prepare the links without casings, however, you may wish to freeze the mixture for roughly 3 hours, or until it feels semi-frozen.

, Transfer the mixture to the bowl of a food processor. Add 1/2 cup (125 ml) ice water to the meat and process the mixture until it becomes smooth.Continue adding water as needed until the mixture develops the consistency of mousse. You can add up to 2 cups (500 ml) for the classic recipe or 1 cup (250 ml) for the all-beef recipe.
Emulsify the meat in small batches. Adding too much to the food processor may make it difficult to process effectively.

, Submerge the casings in lukewarm water for approximately 30 minutes. Change the water at the halfway point to keep things sanitary.


Ideally, you should do this while the meat mixture chills in the freezer.
Sheep intestines measuring 1-1/8 to 1-1/4 inch (2.8 to 3.8 cm) are recommended, but you can use similarly sized hog intestines, as well. Collagen casings will also work., Slip one end of the casing over the nozzle of the sausage stuffer. Carefully work the entire length of casing over the nozzle, continuing until you reach the opposite end.


Make sure that the casing stays wet while you work it over the nozzle. It will be slippery and might be hard to maneuver, but ultimately, the water will help prevent the casing from sticking to the nozzle.

, Load the meat mixture into the tray of the sausage stuffer. Wait for the meat to come out of the nozzle, then guide it into the casing.


This portion of the process may take some practice to perfect. As the meat flows out, gradually slide small sections of casing over it. Clamp down on the end of the casing and allow that section to fill until it becomes completely stuffed before moving onto the next section.

, After stuffing the casings and using up the entire meat mixture, detach the end from the nozzle and twist the links into 6-inch (15-cm) lengths.


Twist both open ends closed, as well.
Cut or break the links at the center of the twisted portions to separate them.

, Place the hot dogs in your refrigerator and allow them to sit for at least 30 minutes.


You can let the hot dogs chill in the refrigerator overnight, if desired, but doing so is not necessary.

, Unroll a large sheet of plastic wrap and spread it out over the kitchen counter.


Work carefully to avoid letting the corners of the plastic wrap overlap and stick together.
If you have difficulty working with a large sheet of plastic wrap, you could opt to work with several small sheets, instead.

, Evenly spread roughly 1-1/2 inches (3.75 cm) of the meat mixture over the long side seam of the plastic wrap.


Try to keep the meat mixture 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) away from the edge of the plastic wrap, and spread it out in an evenly sized, straight line.

, Bring the end of the plastic wrap over and around the meat mixture. Continue rolling the meat mixture into the plastic wrap, working in the same direction.Use as much of the plastic wrap as possible to ensure a secure hold. Using too little may allow the meat mixture to slip out of its plastic wrapping.

, Tie off 6-inch (15-cm) lengths of meat using kitchen string. Tie off both open ends, as well.


Do not separate the links yet. Keep the hot dog links in one long chain.

, Place the hot dogs in your refrigerator and chill them for at least 8 to 12 hours.

, Fill a large stockpot with water and set it on the stove over medium-high heat. Bring it to boil.


You need enough water to cover the entire batch of hot dogs by at least 1 inch (2.5 cm).

, Place the hot dogs into the boiling water and reduce the heat to medium-low, or until the water drops to a bubbling simmer. Cook the hot dogs for 10 to 15 minutes.


You'll need to test the internal temperature of the hot dogs before you remove them from the hot water. Insert a meat thermometer into the thickest link and wait for the internal temperature to reach a minimum 160 degrees Fahrenheit (71 degrees Celsius).

, Remove the hot dogs from the hot water and immediately transfer the links to a large bowl of ice water.


Let the links sit in the ice water for approximately 10 minutes. This should stop the cooking process, thereby preventing the meat from over-cooking.

, If you made the hot dogs using the non-casing method, remove the plastic wrap from each link at this time. The links should retain their form without these wrapping.


Note that you should not attempt to remove the casings from the hot dogs if you used the standard link-making method.

, You can place the hot dogs in an airtight container and refrigerate them for up to 1 or 2 weeks if you aren't ready to cook them immediately.


The hot dogs are technically fully cooked after you finish poaching them, but just like commercially packaged hot dogs, you'll need to take a few extra steps to make them more appetizing prior to serving.

, Pour 1 to 2 tsp (5 to 10 ml) of vegetable oil into a large skillet. Set the skillet onto the stove burner over medium-low heat.

, Place the hot dogs in the warm oil and let them cook for about 10 minutes, turning the links periodically using tongs.Wait for the hot dogs to become crispy on all sides before removing them from the stove.

, Once the hot dogs are crispy and warm throughout, place them on a bun and add any desired condiments. Enjoy them while they're still hot!

",How to Boil a Hot Dog in a Microwave," The fork must be long enough that the handle is longer than the hot dog.;
,, It is important that the water be cold (since the hot dog out of the fridge will also be cold) so that it doesn't boil early and not cook the hot dog.

, IMPORTANT: The fork must not be able to come in contact with any part of the microwave or it could spark. If the microwave has a turn table make sure the fork won't contact any part of the microwave while it is turning.


The point of the fork in the hot dog is to hold the hot dogs under the water so that the end of the hot dogs don't get over cooked by being out of the water and getting direct exposure to microwaves (which most hot dogs will do since they will float in the water).
No, putting a metal fork in the microwave will not hurt your microwave. If the fork touches the side of a running microwave it may spark and damage the fork or the metal shell of the microwave, but as long as you prevent this it is perfectly safe.

, Adjust for the strength of your microwave. When the water boils for 20-30 seconds the hot dog is done.

While the grill is heating up, prepare the hot dog buns and condiments. Hot dogs are best enjoyed hot from the grill.
Make sure that one side of the grill is hot and one side of the grill is a little cooler. You can do this by stacking up the charcoal a little higher on one side. If you have a gas grill, you should be able to control the heat using the knobs on your appliance to make hot dogs good.;

Heat some oil in a frying pan.,
Place the hot dog pieces in the frying pan.,
Turn the hot dog pieces.,
Drain the hot dog pieces.,
Serve the hot dogs.",How to Cook Hot Dogs5," You can fry whole hot dogs, but they taste most excellent when they're cut into bite-sized pieces. That way, more surface area gets a crispy brown sear. Take two or three hot dogs - depending on how many you want - and cut them into smaller pieces you can fry.

, Place the pan on the stove and turn the heat to medium high. Add enough oil to rise up the sides of the frying pan by about 1/4 - 1/2 inch (.6 - 1.3 cm). Let the oil heat up completely. To test whether it's ready for the hot dogs, drop a crumb of bread into the hot oil. If it immediately starts sizzling and sputtering, the oil is ready.

, Do this carefully, since they may sizzle and pop right away. Put them all in the pan in a single layer and let them start to fry. Try not to overcrowd the frying pan, since this will cause the hot dogs to cook unevenly.

, Use tongs to carefully turn them over after a minute or two, when the first side has become brown and crispy. Keep frying the hot dog pieces for another minute or two, until they're cooked just the way you like them.


Remember that hot dogs are pre-cooked, so you can cook them to any texture you like without worrying about whether they're still raw in the middle.

, Use the tongs to transfer them to a paper-towel-lined plate so the oil can drain off and the hot dogs can cool a bit.

, They're delicious with fried peppers and onions, mixed into macaroni and cheese, or on their own with some ketchup and mustard.

Depending on the age and developmental level of your child, they can help cut up the vegetables. Properly teaching children about knife usage, rather than removing them from this step, can actually increase their safety in kitchen environments. Always supervise children with sharp objects!
Children who are too young to help cutting vegetables can help wash the vegetables and throw away the scraps.

Serve.",How to Make a Spiral Cut Hot Dog," Usually boiling or steaming provides the best method to achieve a nice, sleek spiraled effect.;
, Make sure hot dogs have cooled slightly before placing on the spears, to save your fingers. (You can reheat the sausage in the oven or microwave after you’ve created the spiral.)


Simply hold the bottom of the shish kebab spear and poke the sharp end into the bottom of the hot dog, lengthwise.
Pierce the entire dog until it rests in the middle of the spear.

, The key to cutting the dog is to not cut all the way through. Cut only to the spear:


Cut the hot dog beginning from the top and work your way down. For a fancier spiral, cut the hot dog on an angle.
Make a cut every one to two inches, depending on the size of the hot dog. Make sure you don’t make cuts too close together as they may run together and ruin the effect.
As you are cutting, roll the hot dog away from your for the cleanest cut. This may take some practice, so you may want to test drive this method on a few hot dogs first.

, Since you’ve already cooked the hot dog, don’t leave the sausages in boiling water for more than a minute or two.


Reheat one or two spears at a time in the boiling water, depending on the size of your pot.
Use tongs to remove the spears from the hot water.
Rest the removed spiral hot dogs on a paper plate. The paper will help absorb any residual water.

, Be careful performing this step. If you pull too aggressively or too quickly, you could sever the hot dog. When removed successfully, the result should look like a long, spiral hot dog.

, Add mustard and ketchup and whatever else you like to eat with hot dogs.

Bring a large pot of water to a rolling boil.,
Place the hot dogs in the pot.,
Boil the hot dogs for six minutes.,
Remove the hot dogs from heat and drain them.",How to Boil a Hot Dog1," The pot should be large enough to fit all the hot dogs you want to boil. Leave a few inches of room at the top of the pot so it won't boil over when you add the dogs.;
, Carefully slip them into the pot one by one. Don't toss them in all at once, or the boiling water could splash you.

, Hot dogs come pre-cooked, but they taste best when they're heated thorough. Boiling them for six minutes is enough time to get the hot dogs piping hot, but it's short enough to keep them from splitting down the middle. You want to avoid letting the hot dogs split, since they'll lose a lot of flavor if they do.


If you're boiling a large pack of hot dogs, they may need an extra minute or two. Test a dog to see if it's ready before removing the rest of them from heat.
If you're boiling just a dog or two, they may be ready before six minutes are up. Test a dog at five minutes to see if it's hot enough to suit you. If not, put it back in the water.

, You can remove them one by one with tongs, shaking off the water as you go. As an alternative, pour the entire pot of dogs through a strainer, so that the water runs through and the dogs are caught.If you made enough hot dogs for people to come back for seconds, leave the extra dogs in the pot of warm water. Just move it to a cool burner and put a lid on the pot; the extra dogs are still likely to be hot when you're ready to eat them.
If you're serving a big crowd and you want to keep a lot of hot dogs warm, keep the burner on the lowest heat setting until all the hot dogs are gone.

, This will prevent the dogs from bursting in the microwave. Make a lengthwise slit through the skin of each hot dog you're cooking.

, Check the dogs after 1 minute to determine if they need more time by cutting off the tip of a hot dot to see if it's thoroughly heated. If it needs more time, continue cooking in 30 second increments until they're fully heated.


You can also check to see if it needs more time by looking at the texture of the hot dog; if the skin looks wrinkled and darker in color, it's probably done.

1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon Italian spice mix
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper

, Beer imparts a delicious sausage flavor to the hot dogs. It's the perfect way to add flavor if you're cooking up a batch of dogs to eat while watching sports or serving a roomful of adults who like the flavor of beer. Just add an entire beer to the water to replace a cup and a half of water. Bring it to a boil and cook the dogs as normal.


If you're up for an experiment, try different types of beer. For example, a pale ale will impart a very different taste than a darker beer.
This method works for hot dogs of any kind, but tastes especially good with all-beef dogs.

, Tossing in a garlic clove or two while the water comes to a boil is a great way to add earthy flavor to your hot dogs. You don't even have to peel the garlic; just throw in a clove or two unpeeled.

, If you want crispy dogs, quickly sauteing them after you've boiled them is the way to go. Heat a skillet over medium high and add a dash of olive oil. Use a knife to split your dogs in half lengthwise. When the oil is hot, sauté the dogs split-side down until they're brown and crispy.

, No matter how you cook your dogs, the best flavor comes afterward in the form of great condiments. Place your dogs in their buns and add your favorite toppings. Here are a few ideas:

You should also wash any kitchen utensils that came into contact with the raw meat.;
, Mix the onion powder, garlic powder, pepper, and salt together in a small bowl. Remove the plastic wrap from the ground chuck. Sprinkle these seasonings over the meat. Make sure to sprinkle the seasonings evenly over the meat. You want it to all be equally flavorful., Use your parchment paper to fold the meat in half from side-to-side. Then, take a knife or pizza wheel. Cut your meat into eight even squares. These are your sliders, which you will now grill., You will need to heat both your sliders and your buns. You can use any buns you like from a local supermarket. Preheat your oven to 250 degrees Fahrenheit. Preheat your griddle pan to 350 degrees Fahrenheit., First, wrap the buns in tinfoil. Then, place them in the oven. Cook them for 5 to 10 minutes, until they're crisp and brown., Grill the burgers on the griddle pan. Sliders are small, so they will cook fast. You only need to cook them for 2 to 3 minutes per side. Make sure there is no pink in the middle before serving., You can use small or large slices of pepperoni here. Large slices may be easier to work with, but you can create multiple emojis for one slider with smaller slices.Use a small, sharp knife to cut emoji faces into the pepperoni or pepperonis.
For example, you can cut a sideways D-shape into one pepperoni, and then cut two circles above it to make the emoji "":D.""
You can then put the pepperonis on the patty or use something sticky, like mayo, to plaster them on the bun.

, Take a plastic Ziplock bag, fill it with chocolate syrup or some kind of condiment, such as ketchup, and cut a small hole in one corner. You can use the corner of the bag like the tip of a pen. You can draw emoji faces on the buns to make cute emoji sliders.Chocolate syrup is usually used to make emojis for sweeter buns, so it may be better to use something like ketchup or mustard on a burger bun.

, You can make emojis by putting eyes on the bun just above the burger. This makes it look like the bun look like your emoji's head, and the burger looks like the mouth. You will need an edible marker, which you should be able to find in the baking aisle of the craft store, for this method.Cut out tiny circles of the stringed cheese. Use the edible markers to add pupils to the eyes.
Dab the eyes with mayonnaise. Then, stick them onto the top half of the bun.

",How to Make Chickpea Burgers," You aren't after a smooth paste, but a paste that still has some texture in it.
The goal is to observe when it start to form a mass in the processor bowl as that's the sign that the chickpeas are processed enough to be able to form burgers. If your paste is too coarse or too dry, they may fall apart when cooking.;
, Additional seasonings to taste can include - some lemon or lime zest, freshly chopped chilli.

, Chill in the fridge until needed, or at least 10 minutes. This makes them more stable for frying.
At the same time, make your salad, prepare your breads and everything you wish to serve with these.

Turn only once if you can help it - larger, thinner burgers are more likely to break than smaller patties.

, Leftover cooked rissoles are excellent cold for lunch on a hot day, or as an appetizer with a dipping sauce.

Head to your local supermarket to grab mayonnaise, ketchup, horseradish sauce, sugar, lemon juice, and cayenne pepper. You may even have these things in your cabinet and refrigerator already!If you want to make a lighter or lower calorie version, you can use low fat mayonnaise and reduced sugar ketchup.;
, This recipe makes about 4 to 8 servings of Zesty Sauce, so depending on the occasion, you may use it all up in one sitting. If that’s the case, feel free to just use a small bowl. If you plan on storing your Zesty Sauce, it’s helpful to make it in a container that has a lid. If you have an empty condiment bottle, it’s a great idea to clean it out and use that for your sauce.

, Squeeze the mayonnaise, ketchup and horseradish sauce into your measuring cup or spoons and then dump them in the bowl (or condiment bottle, if that's what you're using). Add the sugar, lemon juice and pepper., You can use almost any sort of utensil to stir your sauce, but a rubber spatula will help ensure you get all of the ingredients blended thoroughly. Continuously scrape the ingredients from the sides of the bowl and fold them back into the sauce.If you poured your ingredients directly into a condiment bottle, shake it vigorously. This is much easier than trying to stir it. After about 30 seconds, it should be blended.

, Lick the back of your spatula, or dip your finger into the sauce. If you think your mixture needs any changes, add whatever ingredient you think it needs. Then mix again and taste again, until your sauce is to your satisfaction.

, Place the bowl or container in the refrigerator for about an hour before serving. The flavors will meld and improve during this time. If you are crunched for time or simply want to use the sauce immediately, it’s perfectly OK to eat it at room temperature."

Keep in mind that the recipe may not turn out as well, however.
If you plan on making chicken burgers again in the near future, make a larger batch of fresh breadcrumbs, and freeze the leftovers in a bag.

, Add as much or as little cracked black pepper as you'd like. Save the remaining 1½ cup (75 grams) of breadcrumbs for later. If you'd like, you can experiment with other herbs and spices as well. Here are two more ideas for you:


Savory Chicken Patties:1 tablespoon fresh dill, finely chopped
3 chives, chopped
2 garlic cloves, minced
½ teaspoon paprika
⅛ teaspoon salt


Herbed Chicken Patties:2 tablespoons fresh dill, finely chopped
1 tablespoon fresh basil or mint, chopped
Squeeze of fresh lemon juice
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 pinch cayenne pepper
Salt, to taste



, The mixture will be very wet, which is fine. Be careful not to over-mix your burger meat, or it will be too dry once grilled., Divide the mixture into little piles first, then use your hands to form them into large balls. Use the palm of your hands to flatten the balls slightly. If things get too sticky, you can work on top of a sheet of wax paper.Make a slight indentation in the center of each patty. This will help them hold their shape better., Place the breadcrumbs into a shallow dish. Then, working one at a time, press the patties (both sides) into the breadcrumbs. Set them aside as you finish them before moving onto the next one.

, If you do not have any olive oil handy, you can use another type of cooking oil, such as canola or vegetable. Olive oil will give the chicken burgers more flavor, however.

, They are ready when they turn golden and are completely cooked through.You can grill the chicken burgers in a grill pan. Be sure to lightly coat it with cooking spray first, however., Burger buns will taste much better grilled than straight from the bag. You will need to grill them about 1 minute per side.You can also bake burger buns in the oven for about 5 minutes at 350°F (177°C).

, Place a chicken burger onto the bottom half of a hamburger bun. Add your desired toppings, then finish off with some mayo, ketchup, or both. Cover with the top half of the bun. Here are some ideas for popular burger toppings:

Lettuce
Sliced tomato
Sliced onion, separated into rings
Slicked pickle
Sliced cheese

",How to Make a Burger in a Pan,"


Divide the meat into equal portions after adding the desired spices and seasonings. Flatten each portion into a round burger. This will ensure equal cooking when you make burgers in a pan.;
,


Your burgers should be no more than a 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) thick. This thickness will retain moisture in the meat, but still allow the burger to cook to a safe internal temperature without drying out on the outside.

,


Let the burgers sit out for 10 minutes before frying them if they've been refrigerated.
Cooking burgers that are room temperature will prevent the meat from shrinking and becoming tough when placed in a hot pan.

,


Place a few tablespoons of vegetable or olive oil in a non-stick pan and allow the pan to warm up over medium heat for about 5 minutes.
Heating the pan before adding the burgers will help your burgers brown and develop a brown sear on the outside that will enhance the flavor.

,


Add all of the burgers to the pan at the same time so they will cook to roughly the same internal temperature. If you're making a lot of burgers, cook them in batches.
Space the burgers out in the pan so there is a little room between them. This will help the burgers brown around the edges.

,


Let the burgers cook for 5 minutes on one side before turning them. Avoid moving or turning the burgers during this time.
Flip the burgers only after they've cooked on the first side for a few minutes. Letting burgers cook undisturbed will allow the meat to brown.
Cook the burgers for an additional 5 minutes on the second side, then remove the burgers from the pan.

,


Top burgers with cheese, if desired, during the last minute of cooking them in the pan. Adding the cheese earlier in the cooking process will make it melt off the burger and it will stick to the pan.

Combine ground beef and spices.,
Divide into serving amounts.,
Line a burger mold with plastic wrap.,
Press the burger into the mold.,
Flatten, if desired, for thinner patties.,
Slightly indent the center.Using your thumb, gently press a small indentation into the center of each patty.,
Store the patties until ready to use.",How to Make a Burger Patty1," Use your hands to mix about 1/2 tsp (2.5 ml) salt and 1/4 tsp (1.25 ml) ground black pepper into the ground beef.


You can vary the amount of salt and pepper you use according to your own sense of taste. If desired, you could also add other spices and seasonings to change the flavor of the burger completely. For a quick change of pace, use 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of a pre-mixed hamburger spice blend.;
, For standard, 1/4 lb (115 g) patties, separate the ground beef into four equal balls or portions.


The exact amount can depend on the size burger you want. For instance, if you prefer super-thin, diet-friendly patties, you could divide the meat into as many as eight portions, creating 1/8 lb (60 g) patties. On the other hand, if you want giant patties, you could split the full amount into two portions, creating 1/2 lb (225 g) patties.

, Use an actual burger mold, a round cookie cutter, a plastic lid, or another round container that is the right shape and size.Lay a sheet of plastic wrap over that mold.


The plastic wrap will prevent the patty from sticking to the sides of the hamburger press.
If using an actual press, choose one that will work for the size burger you chose based on weight. If using another item, like a can lid, instead of an actual press, choose a lid that look just a little bit bigger than the size of the hamburger bun you anticipate using.

, Place one separated portion of ground beef into the lined mold and flatten it into the mold using your hands. Carefully remove it from the mold by lifting it out with the plastic wrap.


Make sure that the beef is compactly pressed into the mold to help the burger patty hold together more firmly.
If necessary, add more meat or remove excess based on how much excess space is left in your mold.
If the mold does not work for you at all, you can form each separate portion into a ball and use your hand to flatten it into the shape of a patty. It may not be perfectly round, but this will usually do the trick well enough as long as you aren't trying to impress anyone with perfectly formed patties.

, If you want the burger patties to be even flatter, you can press them down using the bottom side of a clean baking sheet.


More specifically, lay the burger patties out on a clean counter, cutting board, or inverted baking sheet and cover them with plastic wrap or parchment paper. Press down on the beef patties using the bottom of a second baking sheet until they flatten to your desired thickness.

, The indentation should be no deeper than 1/2 inch (1.25 cm).


This small indentation or “well” is important, especially for normal beef patties and thick beef patties, since it can prevent the patties from becoming too plump in their centers during the cooking process.

, Ideally, you should wrap the patties in an airtight plastic bag or in plastic wrap and allow them to chill in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour before you cook them.

Mix the beef and spices.,
Form into a rectangle.Place the hamburger meat onto the center of a large sheet of parchment paper.,
Cut the rectangle into squares.,
Store the patties until ready to use.",How to Make a Burger Patty2," Use your hands to combine the ground beef with 1/2 tsp (2.5 ml) salt and 1/4 tsp (1.25 ml) ground pepper until well mixed.


You can add more or less salt and pepper according to your own tastes. If you want to try something different, you could also use a pre-mixed spice blend or another set of spices and herbs that suit your liking. Vary the amount based on how strong you want the flavor to be.

, Pat it down, using your hands, into a 6-inch (15.25-cm) by 8-inch (20.3-cm) rectangle.


If you want to make the sliders more even in thickness, you could press down on the rectangle gently with the bottom of a baking pan or using a rolling pin. Cover the meat with parchment paper before using either option, however, so that the beef does not stick to the bottom of your utensil.

, Use a sharp knife with a smooth blade to cut the rectangular portion of beef into 12 squares, each measuring about 2 inches (5 cm) in width and length.


As a side note, this technique can also be used of you want to the patties to contain a normal amount of ground beef but want them to have a square shape. Simply make sure that the size rectangle you form can be divided into evenly sized perfect squares. For instance, you could form an 8-in by 8-in (20.3-cm by 20.3-cm) square of meat and cut it evenly into four patties that are 4 inches (10 cm) long on each side.

, Refrigerate these patties for roughly 20 minutes before you plan on cooking them. Keep them covered until you pull them out of the refrigerator. Preferably, you should use an airtight plastic bag or plastic wrap.

Flatten into patties.,
Store the patties until ready to use.",How to Make a Burger Patty3," Using your hands, thoroughly mix the ground beef with approximately 3/4 tsp (3.75 ml) salt and 1/2 tsp (2.4 ml) ground black pepper.


Add more or less salt according to taste. The same goes for the black pepper, as well.
If desired, you can use a separate hamburger spice blend or other seasonings that you enjoy tasting in your burgers, like garlic powder or chili powder. Make sure that the seasonings you choose will complement both the beef and the cheese, though.

, Break the chunk of ground beef into four even, separate pieces. Roll these portions into balls.


These “balls” of hamburger need to be pressed together firmly so that the meat is dense and able to adhere to itself. When using this technique, you cannot afford to have crumbly burger meat.

, Use your thumb to indent the middle of each ball. The indentation should be deep enough to reach the center of the ball.


Alternatively, you could also use the handle end of a wooden or plastic mixing spoon to form the indentation.

, Fill each indentation with roughly 2 Tbsp (30 ml) shredded cheddar cheese. Use your fingers to smooth the top of the beef over the exposed indentation, hiding the cheese in the center as you do so.


Cheddar cheese is recommended by default, but you can get creative by trying other types of cheese, as well. You can even stick small wedges or cubes of cheese in the center of the burger as long as they fit and are roughly equivalent to 2 Tbsp (30 ml) of shredded cheese.

, Use your hands or a burger mold to flatten the filled burger balls into patties.


For these burgers, it might be easiest to form the patties using your hands. You could still work with some sort of patty press or mold, though. Line the mold with plastic wrap, press the stuffed patty ball into it, and flatten out the meat until it fills the mold.

, Wrap these patties in plastic wrap or an airtight plastic bag and store them in the refrigerator for a minimum of 30 minutes before taking them out and cooking them.

Mix the ingredients together.Use your hands to combine the ground turkey with both the dry and liquid seasonings.,
Divide into four balls.,
Flatten into patties.,
Store the patties until ready to use.",How to Make a Burger Patty4," Continue mixing until the spices and herbs seem evenly distributed and the entire mass of turkey burger meat seems sticky and compact.


Ground turkey tends to be drier than ground beef, but the mayonnaise can add enough tackiness to the mixture to help hold it together better.
You can vary the spices as desired. Keep in mind, though, that most turkey burger patties have more spices than most beef patties do. Turkey has a slightly blander, milder taste than beef, so the additional spices help punch up the flavor of your turkey patties.

, For standard size turkey burgers, separate the entire bulk of seasoned meat into four even 1/4 lb (115 g) portions.


Note that you could technically form larger or smaller burger patties. Even though it's a less common practice with turkey patties than it is with beef patties, there is no reason why it should not work.

, Use your hands or a burger mold to form the portions of turkey meat into flat burger patties.


Since these burger patties tend to be a little stickier to the touch than beef patties are, forming the patties with your hands can be easier than using a burger press. If you are comfortable enough with your patty mold, though, you can still give it a shot and likely have success. Make sure to line the mold with plastic wrap before pressing the turkey patty meat into it.

, You could cook these turkey burger patties immediately, but if you wrap them in plastic wrap or a plastic bag and refrigerate them for 20 minutes or so, you might find that the patties cook more evenly and stick less during the cooking process.

Finished.

",How to Make a Burger Patty5,"


The texture of the mashed beans should be thick and chunky. You should still see some skins in the mixture. Do not puree the black beans in a blender or food processor at this point, though, since they could become too watery to form patties if you do that.

, Place the green bell pepper, onion, and garlic into a food processor. Run the machine on medium speed until the vegetables are finely chopped into tiny, indistinguishable pieces. Do not allow the mixture to reach a pureed or paste-like consistency, though.


Immediately after processing these vegetables, stir them into your mashed black beans until thoroughly combined.

, In a separate small bowl, mix together the egg, chili powder, cumin, and chili sauce, beating them gently with a fork or whisk until combined.


The yolk and white of the egg should be fairly well combined. The seasonings should also appear evenly spread out within the egg mix.

, Pour the egg mixture into the bowl with the bean mixture. Mix everything together until evenly combined. Add the bread crumbs to the same bowl and mix again, making sure that the crumbs are thoroughly combined, as well.


When ready, the entire mixture should be evenly sticky and it should hold together when pressed into portions without any difficulty.
Note that the eggs help bind the ingredients together. The bread crumbs add volume to the patties, and they also prevent the mixture from becoming too moist.

, Separate the vegetable mixture into four portions, and flatten each portion into a burger patty using your hands or a burger mold.


The veggie burger mix might be easier to form into patties if you use your hands, but if you do decide to use a patty press or mold, line it with plastic wrap before use.

, These veggie burger patties are usually cooked immediately, but if you decide to store them, wrap them in plastic wrap or a resealable plastic bag and refrigerate them until you are ready to cook the burgers.

Choose lean ground beef.,
Look for grass-fed beef.,
Make smaller patties.,
Consider cooking the hamburger on the grill.,
Maximize the flavor of leaner beef.,
Season the burgers to add flavor.,
Blot the excess fat.",How to Make a Healthier Hamburger1," Lean ground beef has less than 10 grams of fat, 4.5 grams or less of saturated fat, and under 95 milligrams of cholesterol for a cooked three-ounce patty. Extra lean ground beef has less than five grams of fat and less than two of saturated fat.Lean beef is labeled as 90/10 or 10%, and extra lean is labeled as 95/5 or 5%
Beef contains all the essential amino acids needed for growth and maintenance of our bodies. Eating high-quality protein is useful for maintaining muscle mass and recovery after trauma or surgery. Beef contains an abundant amount of vitamins and minerals, including Vitamin B12, Zinc, Selenium, Iron, Niacin, Vitamin B6, and Phosphorus.;
, Choosing grass-fed beef will increase the antioxidant content, Vitamin E levels, a healthier fatty acid profile including more omega-3 fatty acids compared to grain-fed beef.Grass-fed beef means the cattle were, as the name suggests, fed mostly grass and other foods that they would naturally eat in their environment. Grain-fed cattle mostly eat an unnatural, grain-based diet., Serving size is important when you make your hamburger. Some hamburgers can be 6, 8, or even 16 ounces. No one needs a hamburger that large. You can enjoy a hamburger, but on a smaller, healthier scale. This saves you calories, fat, and cholesterol. When you make a hamburger, make your patties 3 to 4 ounces when raw., Grilled hamburgers have a great flavor, and grilling hamburgers can also help make the hamburger healthier. When you grill a burger, some of the fat drips out during the process. The hamburger can end up having less fat than you originally thought.You can also cook burgers on griddle pans and the broiler.

, Since leaner ground beef has less fat content, it can be harder to cook, but you can still cook a delicious burger if you know how to cook these meats. For 90/10 beef, cook over medium heat. Cook on one side until the side is brown, then flip and cook the other side until brown. It usually takes 11 to 15 minutes to cook the burger. Just make sure to cook until the patty is done.Coat the pan with cooking spray. This helps to keep the patties from sticking when you cook them. Heat the pan before you place the patty in the pan.
The USDA has a rating scale of Prime, Choice, and Select for beef. The leanest of these will be Select, which will have less marbling (meaning there is less fat interspersed with lean meat).To help keep them juicy, avoid piercing the patties or pressing down on them in the pan.

, If you find the lean meat lacking in flavor or juiciness, try adding seasonings and extras to the patties to add flavor without adding calories and fat. Season with salt, pepper, seasoning salt, paprika, dried herbs, barbeque sauce, steak sauce, and garlic salt.Try mixing an egg white in with the patty. You can also add a ¼ cup of wheat bread crumbs. Or instead of bread crumbs, try a gluten-free option with almonds, walnuts, or other nuts.Add things you’d traditionally place on top of the burger inside the patty. Mix in onions, tomatoes, spinach, mushrooms, salsas, or any other vegetables to make a tasty burger. Even try adding a small amount of low-fat cheese.

, After you cook the patties, remove them from the pan and place them on a paper towel. Use another paper towel to gently soak up the fat on the patty. This helps reduce the calories and fat."

Make a turkey burger.,
Try a bison burger.,
Choose fish.,
Make meatless burgers.",How to Make a Healthier Hamburger2," A popular alternative to beef hamburgers are turkey burgers. Though many people believe turkey burgers contain less fat and calories than beef burgers, this is not always true. Ground turkey can have a higher fat content than a traditional hamburger. When buying ground turkey, make sure that you buy a lean cut. Look for packages that are 90/10 or higher, such as 93/7 or 99.To make turkey burgers delicious and juicy, try adding olive oil to the patty. Add two tablespoons of olive oil for each pound of ground turkey. This also helps give them a brown crust on the outside.Remember, however, that adding olive oil will add (healthy) fat and calories to your burger.
Try chicken burgers for another poultry burger. Just place cooked chicken breast in a food processor with any seasonings or additional ingredients. Then shape into patties., Bison can be a healthy alternative to traditional ground beef in burgers. Bison is a leaner meat than ground beef. In a three and a half ounce serving, bison ranges from two to nine grams of fat and 143 to 190 calories. In three and half ounces of ground bison, there might be 15 grams of fat and 240 calories.Bison has good amounts of protein, iron, zinc, and B12. It also a good source of omega-3 fats.
Bison can be temperamental to cook. It doesn’t take long to cook, and is tough if overcooked. Ground bison should be cooked until the pink just starts to disappear.

, Fish makes a great substitute for beef in burgers. Tuna, salmon, and tilapia all make tasty burgers. Fish burgers generally need additional herbs and spices to give them a tasty flavor. Try soy sauce, ginger, cilantro, scallions, garlic, or olive oil. Fish typically has less calories than beef, and is a great source of omega-3 fats.To make the fish filets into burger patties, cut the filets into small cubes. Combine the cubes with the other ingredients in a bowl, mixing gently with your hands until everything is combined. Press the mixture into patties that are about four inches thick. You can cover the outside with sesame seeds, bread crumbs, or nuts.

Reduce your calories by changing your bun.,
Skip the bun.,
Switch out your condiments.,
Reconsider cheese.,
Pile on the vegetables and fruit.,
Make smart choices when adding sides.",How to Make a Healthier Hamburger3," White buns can add a lot of calories and unhealthy carbs to your burger. Instead of eating on a white bun, change to a whole wheat bread source. But don’t grab the first wheat bun off the shelf. Take time to read the label.


Don’t buy breads with enriched bleached flour or wheat flour. Instead, choose a 100% whole wheat bread. Make sure it says 100% whole wheat. Look for the label to say whole-wheat flour as the first ingredient.Choose to only eat one half of the bun, making it an open-faced sandwich. This cuts your calories by half.
Substitute your regular bun for an English muffin.
If you are eating at a get together, remove some of the bun insides to reduce calories., Another way to eat healthier hamburgers is to go carb-less and eat no bun. Choose to eat your burger on a lettuce wrap, a collard leaf, or a romaine wrap. You can also place the patty on a bed of kale, spring greens, or spinach.Get creative with what you place your burger on. Try putting it between slices of grilled eggplant or zucchini.

, Ketchup is full of sodium and sugar, and mayonnaise if full of fat. Instead of covering your burger with these things, try adding other kinds of toppings to your burger. Condiments are typically processed foods. Adding whole foods like avocado or an egg are ways to incorporate whole foods that do not include added preservatives or sodium. Once you switch from traditional condiments, you’ll be surprised the array of flavors you’ve been missing on your burgers.


Mash 1/3 of an avocado and spread it on your burger. Avocado is a superfood that is healthy and delicious (though it is high in calories, so don't use too much).Add spices, fruit, vegetables, and herbs to the avocado for even more flavor.
Make your own spreads. Combine Greek yogurt with garlic, and lemon juice for a tasty condiment. Or try making a pesto sauce.
Try salsa on your burgers. This provides a lot of flavor without tons of fat, sugar, or calories.Add hummus onto your burger. Hummus comes in many different varieties, from plain to lemon to red pepper. You can also try tabouli.
Make a healthy slaw. Combine cabbage, greek yogurt, and other spices or herbs and pile it on your patty.

, Cheese can add a lot of fat and calories to your burger. If you have to have cheese on your burger, consider slicing block cheese into thin slices. You can also purchase ultra thin varieties of cheese.Choose low-fat cheeses and try to avoid highly processed cheeses like Velveeta.


As alternatives to traditional cheese, try adding feta or goat cheese to your burger. Feta cheese has a lower fat, saturated fat, and calorie content than regular cheese.Goat cheese has a few less calories and grams of fat than traditional cheese. For example, one ounce of goat cheese has 76 calories, 6 grams of fat, 4 grams of saturated fat, and 13 milligrams of cholesterol.One ounce of cheddar cheese has 113 calories, 9 grams of fat, 6 grams of saturated fat, and 29 milligrams of cholesterol., Another way you can make your burger extremely healthy is to pile it with more nutritiously dense food. Vegetables not only add nutrients, they also add flavor. Try roasted tomatoes, roasted peppers, sauteed mushrooms, or caramelized onions.Top with any leafy greens, like arugula, spinach, or kale. Put bell pepper, cucumbers, carrots, sprouts, and alfalfa.
Put fruit on your burger. Try grilled pineapple, mango, or persimmons.
Avoid topping that will add unhealthy fats, like bacon.

, Sometimes, it’s not the burger that’s unhealthy; it’s the sides. A small order of fries from McDonald's has 230 calories, 11 grams of fat, and 1 1/2 grams of saturated fat. A large order of fries has 510 calories, 24 grams of fat, and 3 1/2 grams of saturated fat.Even French fries that you cook at home have a lot of calories. Instead of eating an unhealthy side, add a salad or a serving of fruit.Take care to pay attention to what you drink, too. Instead of a sugary soda, choose water, seltzer water, or a diet soda.

Choose the best hamburger.,
Eat smaller portions.,
Be an informed consumer.",How to Make a Healthier Hamburger4," You can eat hamburgers when you go out to eat if you plan ahead and choose conscientiously. Think of ways to reduce unnecessary calories, fat, and cholesterol. For example, remove the bun or ask for the burger on a bed of lettuce. Ask for no mayo or for the condiments on the side, plus no cheese or bacon. This cuts out a lot of unhealthy additions to your burger.

, One reason eating a hamburger out is such hit to your nutrition is the size of the serving you receive. Many burgers contain anywhere from 1/4 pound of meat to an entire pound. Some burgers have multiple patties of meat. Choose only hamburgers with one patty.For restaurants that serve extremely large patties, share the burger with a friend, or cut the burger in half and save part for a later meal.

, When you eat burgers at restaurants, do your research beforehand. Don't order without knowing the nutritional information of your meal. Many restaurants provide calories on menus now, so you can know exactly how many calories you are consuming. But you should also look online at nutritional information for additional information, like fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol.


Know the calorie content of the burgers you are eating. For example, a Dave’s Single from Wendy’s has 550 calories, 34 grams of fat, and 13 grams of saturated fat.At Five Guys, a hamburger has 700 calories, 43 grams of fat, and 19.5 grams of fat.At Applebee’s, a hamburger has 780 calories, 50 grams of fat, and 18 grams of saturated fat while a mushroom swiss burger 1060 calories, 72 grams of fat, and 28 grams of saturated fat.
Since you want to try to keep your meals under 500 calories, try these hamburgers instead. A jr. hamburger at Wendy’s has 230 calories, 8 grams of fat, and 3 grams of saturated fat. In-and-Out as a “protein style” burger with no bun that has 240 calories, 17 grams of fat, and 4 grams saturated fat. A little hamburger at Five Guys has 480 calories, 26 grams of fat, and 11.5 grams of saturated fat.These calorie and fat counts don’t include fries, so stay away from those.

Start with fresh ground chuck.,
Make sure the chuck has a fat content of at least 15 to 22 percent to ensure juiciness.,
Chill the beef well before forming patties.,
Season the meat with salt and pepper.,
Make each patty by forming about half a pound of ground chuck into a tight ball about the size of a baseball.,
Use a spatula or other straight-edged tool to ""pull in"" the sides of the patty so that they remain together and tight.

,
Form patties about 1/2- to 3/4-inch thick.,
Build a hot fire in the grill.,
Place the burgers on the grill over direct heat.,
Check doneness by peeking inside a patty with a spatula, or use an instant-read food thermometer inserted into the center of the patty.,
Serve on fresh buns with any toppings you prefer: cheese, tomatoes, lettuce, onion, pickles and condiments such as ketchup, mayonnaise or mustard.

,
Finished.

",How to Grill That Perfect Burger," Chuck is the most flavorful type of ground beef, and comes from a single cut of beef. Plain ""ground beef"" can include meat from all over the animal.;
, If you prefer your burgers well done, ask your butcher for a higher fat content. This will allow you to cook them more without drying them out.

, Wash your hands well, then form the patties.

, Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper give the best flavor.

, Firmly press ball into a flat cake, first between your hands, then onto a clean cutting board.

,, Make the diameter about 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) larger than the bun to allow for shrinkage.

, Lightly oil the bars with vegetable oil - pour oil onto a paper towel, then hold the towel with tongs to wipe the oil onto the grill bars.

, Cook about 3 to 4 minutes per side, turning once. Do not press down on the burgers with the spatula during cooking - this only squeezes out the juices, encourages flame-ups and dries out the burger.

",How to Cook Hamburgers on the Stove," It's recommended to use ground chuck that is about 85% lean. If you use this kind of hamburger meat, it will turn out perfect - moist and juicy, yet not too greasy.






;
, It's preferable to create and have hamburger patties that are about 1 inch (2.5 cm) thick composed of 5 to 6 oz of hamburger meat. This seems to make for the perfect size. The diameter of the hamburger patties, if 1 inch (2.5 cm) thick, should be a little larger than you prefer as it will shrink when you cook it. If you make it the size you like to eat it cooked, when composing the patty it will be way too small when it is done cooking.








, Not good. We don't want our hamburgers to look like those guys from The Hills Have Eyes, so we're going to make a nice little 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) indentation in the center of the burger. When it expands, it will be level again








, Turn your stove on medium heat. As soon as the oil is glistening, drop your patties in with the indentation side facing up. Something to watch out for here is over crowding the pan. We want to keep our hamburgers spread out evenly so they can cook evenly and not get stuck together.








, Just let them sit until they have reached the quality you desire. Rare, medium rare or well done. Whatever it is, just keep an eye so they don't get over cooked.








, The amount of time it will take to cook your hamburgers on a stove depends on how large you made the patties.









1 inch (2.5 cm) thick patties take about eight to twelve minutes to cook on average. One way to check on how far along your burgers are is to take the pointy end of a knife and cut a small slit, prodding the meat back to see the color of the inside.

Find a seat.,
Look at the menu.,
Call the waiter over.,
Wait for your food.,
Enjoy!

",How to Order Food1," It's probably a better idea to find a seat before you get your food. This is because if all the seats are full after you've collected your food, you're going to have to either eat standing up or walk around looking for a seat for quite some time. Also, some restaurants send waiters to your table, so it's required that you find a seat. At some restaurants, there will be a hostess who will direct you to your seat.;
, The menu should already be on your table but if it's not, or there are not enough menus for everyone, ask a member of staff for one. The menu includes everything that the restaurant sells and also states their prices. Have a look and see if anything interests you then decide what you're going to buy.

, This can be done by simply getting a passing waiter's attention or waiting until they come to you. Once they arrive, tell them what you'd like to eat. Make sure that they've written down the correct foods so you don't end up with something that you didn't want.


Never click your fingers to get their attention, the waiter will find it very rude and offensive. Remember that they are normal people with jobs, not your slaves.

, At some restaurants, they cook the food from scratch as soon as they get your order. This means that it might take some time for your food to get to you. Just be patient, your food should arrive in under half an hour. If it hasn't arrived, tell someone. They may have forgotten about your order, or it might just be a busy day.

Season your burger as you'd like, e.g.,
Place your burger seasonings-down on the Foreman, and season the other side (or cover in sauce).

Decide where you'd like to eat.,
Find their phone number.,
Give them a ring.,
Place your order.,
Wait for your delivery.,
Pay the delivery person.",How to Order Food2," This all depends on what you fancy. Are you hungry for a burger? Or would you rather order from your local kebab shop? As long as the shop does deliveries, you can pretty much order whatever you like.

, You can usually do this by going to their website or searching for their phone number online. If the shop is local, they will usually post flyers through the door. If they don't have a website, you can also look at one of these flyers to find their number.

, They might not answer straight away if they're busy but just do your best to stay patient.

, To do this, tell them what you'd like to eat. They will usually ask for your address so they know where to deliver the food and sometimes your name. Make sure that they confirm your order so you don't end up with the wrong foods at your door.

, Depending on where you live and where you ordered from, the time you'll have to wait can vary. Usually though, you shouldn't be kept waiting for over half an hour. If you're still waiting, phone them up again and confirm that your order has been delivered. They may have forgotten about it or not finished cooking it yet.

, Some people give small tips to the delivery person. This is optional but they'll appreciate it a lot. If you'd like to give a small tip, tell them to just keep the change.

Infrared gas grills will provide 1400 degrees of grilling heat approximately three minutes after you push the ignition on your infrared grill.,
Cook burgers on an Infrared Grill.,
Start the infrared gas grill with ignition or long lighter.

,
With either ignition, be safe by lighting the flame or starting the ignition sparking before you turn the gas valve to the On position.,
In approximately three minutes the grill should be at searing temperatures.

,
Test the heat with a wave of your hand 8"" above the burner.,
I place my hamburgers down frozen but my steaks and seafood I grill defrosted and rubbed.

,
Once food is at the cooking surface on the grilling grates remember this is not a low temperature barbecue so do not close the grill hood.

,
As soon as you place the burger down the surface of the food will begin to cook.,
After approximately :45 seconds quarter-turn the burgers.,
After another :30 - :45 seconds you can flip the burger and repeat the process.

,
Once the burgers are flipped you should see the criss-cross pattern made from searing the burger at its initial placement and the quarter turn sear.

,
There should not be any uncooked section on the cooked side.,
Grill and quarter turn the burgers on the uncooked side and burgers are ready to serve medium.

,
If more grilling is desired for medium-well or well done temperatures, lower the heat by turning the valve to the medium position.

,The lower heat setting will allow you to close the hood and allow the convectional heat to surround the burgers to barbecue the inside heat of the burger

,
With half-inch thick burgers I keep the hood closed for approximately two minutes for a medium-well done temperature.

,
That's it.",How to Grill a Burger With an Infrared Gas Grill," For many backyard chefs there is a slight learning curve as they acclimate to this intense heat and the fact that the heat is directional. Because the heat is directional, infrared grill burners cook at searing temperatures without closing the hood. A typical BBQ cooks by conducting heat through the air trapped in the hood. Infrared radiant heat is direct from the flame like the sun is direct on your skin on a sunny day. The sweltering heat of a humid overcast day is more like a hot barbecue conducting heat through air.;
, Note the rough outer texture of a hamburger makes it difficult to get a completely seared seal at the outer layer of the burger. Food like steaks and fish are much easier to grill with an infrared grill and the flavor is much better than what a typical barbecue will produce.

,, You do not want to turn on the burner and have gas releasing while you look for the extendable lighter. A small cloud of gas will escape waiting to ignite so make the ignition (spark or lighter) before turning the infrared burner to the On position.

,, Move quickly; if the grill is at its proper heat you will not be able to hold your hand above the burner for more than 2 or 3 seconds.

,,, However, because the heat rises from the burner, there will be a large difference between how the heat affects the food covered by the cooking grate and the sections of the food left exposed in-between the grids.

, This should ensure the heat evenly affects the food and does not leave less seared sections where the burger is protected by the cooking grates.

,,, If there is still any pink at the surface after this 1:30 minutes of grilling check to make sure the LP tank valve is not in check and the infrared grill is turned to the high position.

(More fat and it will just drip off the meat and cause fire flare-ups; less and the burgers will be dry.) If possible, buy the meat the day you’re going to cook it.


Ask the butcher to grind the meat twice, once in the coarse plate of the grinder and then through the fine plate.;
,, Put them in a bowl and mix them together until combined.


Add any of the ingredients you're wanting to be a part of the burger – the Worcestershire sauce, ketchup, mustard, and the chopped herbs.

, Season with salt and pepper and mix everything together.

, It is easier to start mixing with a spoon; then use your clean hands to thoroughly combine the ingredients.

, Handle the meat as little as possible, so you don’t squeeze out the juices.


Shape the mixture into 6 equal-sized balls using your hands.
Press the balls down to make flat burger shapes about ½ inch (1.27cm) thick. Make a small indentation in the center of the burger with your thumb. This prevents the center from swelling, leading to uneven cooking.

, Cover them with plastic wrap or wax paper. Chill for 30 minutes to a few hours to make the burgers firmer and easier to cook. Burger meat is best cooked cold.

, The homemade burgers can be cooked with a broiler or grill, fried in the skillet or frying pan, or barbecued. They can also be baked. The method used depends on what you have available and what you prefer by way of taste and texture. Whichever method you choose, after taking the patties out of the fridge, spritz them with a little cooking oil or brush them with some melted butter before cooking.


Broiler/grill: Preheat the broiler (upper level grill) to medium heat. Line a broiler pan with foil, for easier cleanup after cooking. Place the burgers in the broiler pan. Broil them for 6-7 minutes on each side or until thoroughly cooked.
Frying pan or skillet: Add oil or butter to the pan and fry the burgers well. Be sure to use low heat and a long cook to properly cook the burgers the whole way through.
Place on the barbecue grill. Cook as usual for hamburgers on the barbecue.
Bake: Place in the oven on 350ºF/180ºC for 15 to 30 minutes, depending on thickness. You may like to flip them over halfway, testing doneness regularly.

Heat the oil.,
Clean the potatoes.,
Slice the potato using a ridged waffle blade.,
Rotate and continue slicing.,
Fry the potatoes in batches.,
Drain the excess oil.,
Add salt and enjoy.",How to Make Waffle Fries1," Pour 4 inches (10 cm) of cooking oil into the deep fryer. Switch on the heat and allow the oil to reach 350 degrees Fahrenheit (180 degrees Celsius).If you don't have a deep fryer, you could pour the oil into a large Dutch oven or heavy-bottomed saucepan. Place the pot on the stove over medium-high heat.
Use a frying thermometer to monitor the temperature of the oil. It should remain at 350 degrees Fahrenheit (180 degrees Celsius) for the duration of the cooking process. Adjust your temperature settings as needed to achieve this.;
, Rinse the potatoes under cool, running water while scrubbing off the dirt with a vegetable brush.


Thorough cleaning is important if you intend to keep the skins on for your fries.
On the other hand, if you prefer fries without skin, peel the potatoes first and rinse them under running water when finished. Since the dirty skins are gone, you won't need to scrub the potatoes with a brush.

, Insert the waffle blade attachment into the mandolin. Pass the end of the potato over the blade, making one ridged slice.


The waffle blade should have ridges on it. If your mandolin allows you to choose the thickness of the slices, choose a thickness of at least 1/4 inch (6 mm).
If you don't have a mandolin, you could also use a ridged cheese knife. Make a straight cut down over the end of the potato and create slices roughly 1/4 inch (6 mm) thick, if not a little thicker.

, Rotate the potato 90 degrees, so that the vertical grooves now run horizontally. Make a second slice from this angle.The resulting crisscross should produce the waffle fry shape. If you do not rotate the potato, your slices will look like ridges instead of waffles.
Continue slicing in this manner, rotating the potato 90 degrees in between each slice. Repeat until you slice through both potatoes.

, Place several cut slices into the hot oil. Fry for several minutes, turning as needed, until the fries turn golden brown.


Watch the fries closely to prevent them from burning.
You need to fry the potatoes in batches instead of frying them all at once. Adding too many to the hot oil can crowd out the pan and cause the temperature to drop. As a result, the fries won't cook correctly.

, Use a slotted spoon to remove the finished fries from the hot oil. Transfer them to a plate lined with clean paper towels.


While waiting for the oil to drain, you can start on your next batch of fries.

, Sprinkle salt over the fries while they're still hot and eat them immediately to enjoy the best taste.

Rotate and continue slicing.,
Bake the potato slices.,
Toss with salt and enjoy.",How to Make Waffle Fries2,"


Alternatively, you could lightly coat the baking sheet with nonstick cooking spray instead of using oil.

, Rinse the potatoes under running water while scrubbing the skins with a stiff vegetable brush.


If you wish to keep the skins, you need to scrub off the dirt in this manner.
If you don't wish to keep the skins, peel the potatoes first and rinse them under running water when finished. You should not need to scrub them since the dirty skins are already gone.

, Secure the waffle blade attachment in the mandolin. Using firm, even pressure, pass the end of the potato over the blade, creating the first slice.


The waffle blade should have ridges on it. To prevent the fries from becoming too thin, use a thickness of 1/4 to 1/2 inch (0.6 to 1.25 cm).
If you don't have a mandolin, consider using a ridged cheese knife. Chop straight down over the end of the potato using this knife, making slices that are 1/4 to 1/2 inch (0.6 to 1.25 cm) thick.

, Turn the potato 90 degrees. The vertical grooves should now run horizontally. Make a second slice from this angle.


Rotating the potato in this manner should create the crisscross waffle pattern. If you don't rotate the potato, you'll get ridged fries instead of waffle fries.
Continue slicing both potatoes in this manner, rotating 90 degrees in between each slice.

, Spread the potato slices onto your prepared baking sheet, arranging them in a single layer. Bake the fries in your preheated oven for 20 to 25 minutes, or until they turn golden brown.


The exact amount of time may vary depending on how thick you cut the fries. You may need to check the progress every 5 minutes after the first 15 minutes to prevent the fries from burning.
If you'd prefer evenly browned fries, consider turning the fries with a spatula after the first 15 minutes. Allow the other sides to brown for the duration of the cooking time.

, Remove the hot fries from the oven and sprinkle them with salt according to your own tastes. While these fries shouldn't get soggy, they'll still taste best when eaten hot and fresh from the oven.

Peel and rinse the potatoes.,
Shred the potatoes.,
Melt the butter.,
Combine the potatoes, butter, salt, and pepper.,
Spread the potatoes over the hot iron.,
Close and cook.,
Serve while still hot.",How to Make Waffle Fries3," Close the waffle iron and preheat it to the highest setting, following the manufacturer's instructions.


You should be able to use nearly any standard-sized waffle iron for this procedure. Usage instructions will vary based on the manufacturer and model, however, so you need to be familiar with the machine you're using before embarking on this recipe.
After the waffle iron preheats, consider spraying the grate with a light coating of nonstick cooking spray. This may not be necessary if the waffle iron has a nonstick cooking surface, however.

, Peel the skin off the potatoes. Rinse off any stray dirt and pat the potatoes dry with clean paper towels.


If you'd prefer to keep the skins, wash the potatoes under running water and thoroughly scrub off any dirt using a stiff vegetable brush.

, Using a box grater or mandolin, grate both potatoes into thick shreds.At this point, the raw potatoes should look similar to hash browns.
Do not rinse the shredded potatoes since doing so will rinse away too much of the potatoes' natural starch. That starch is necessary since it will help bind the shreds together.

, Place 1 to 2 Tbsp (15 to 30 ml) of butter in a small microwave-safe dish. Microwave the butter for 10 to 20 seconds, or until it's completely melted.


If desired, you could use margarine or olive oil instead of the butter.

, Place the shredded potatoes into a large bowl. Drizzle the melted butter on top and sprinkle the potatoes with salt and pepper.


Use your hands or a mixing spoon to toss the ingredients together, coating the potatoes evenly with the butter and seasonings.

, Spoon the seasoned potatoes over the bottom of the preheated waffle iron. Arrange the shreds into a thin, even layer.


Depending on the size of the waffle iron and the size of the potatoes, you may need to separate the shredded potatoes into two batches. Cook one batch, remove the finished fries, and cook the second batch in the same manner.

, Close the waffle iron and allow the fries to cook until they reach a deep golden brown.


The amount of time may vary depending on your waffle maker. It's generally a good idea to check on the fries after 5 or 6 minutes, though.
If the bottom of the fries are cooking faster than the tops, consider flipping them over before you finish cooking them.

, Use a fork to carefully lift the finished waffle fries out of the waffle iron. Enjoy the fries while they're still hot for the best flavor and texture.

Start with the correct potato.,

Put the fries through your cutter.,
Soak your fries in a bowl of cold water.",How to Make Curly Fries1," A potato with high starch and lower water content will always be best for french fries. Try using russet potatoes that are slightly older, if possible.To help maintain uniform shape, pick larger, evenly shaped potatoes.;
, Using a vegetable peeler or a paring knife, cut the skin off the potato moving the knife away from you. Remove any bruised and unsightly potato bits with a knife.


Peeling is optional with fries. Keeping the skin on will keep them looking rustic, but peeling the skin away will leave your fries looking more even., After the potatoes are prepared, run the fries through your curly fry cutter.This often involves wedging the potato between the slicer and the handle. Rotate the handle to force the potato through the slicer. Different models may vary but should be used roughly in the same way.






Use a mandolin or fry cutter that contains a slicer for curly fries. This allows you to simply wash the potatoes and put them through the cutter. This equipment is available at most department stores and online.





, Soaking your fries in water removes excess starch and prevents the fries from getting stuck together.Soak your fries for five minutes and strain. Place them on a plate in a single layer then pat them with paper towels. Let them lay out for a few minutes to air dry.

Wash and rinse your cut fries in advance.,
Blanch the fries in oil.,
Allow the fries to rest.,
Quick-fry the blanched fries.",How to Make Curly Fries2," Allowing them to completely air dry will keep the oil from sputtering if you choose to deep fry them.Water can be very dangerous when introduced into oil so the less water you add to the frying oil, the better.

, Blanching is a technique that uses lower-temperature oil for a long duration during frying. This ensures that the potato will be cooked all the way through.To blanch, heat the oil on a medium-low setting. Add your fries and cook for approximately eight minutes. When the fries make a “screaming” noise, they are ready to come out. The screeching is the sound of air whistling out of the inside as they cook.The fries shouldn’t be browned, but will be edible. Upon removing, allow the fries to drain on a paper towel to remove excess oil.


When deep frying, use a deep pot or wok with a thick bottom.Fill it halfway with vegetable oil and allow to heat completely before using.
Frying can be made much easier with the use of a frying thermometer. This will allow you to control the temperature more accurately. When blanching, ideal oil temperature should be 250 degrees Fahrenheit (121 Celsius)., Give the fries time to cool before frying a second time.For a quick turnaround, put them on a pan in a single layer inside the freezer. Otherwise, allow them to rest in the fridge overnight in a paper-towel lined sheet.


No matter the method, allow the fries to come back to room temperature before the second frying. This allows even cooking., Heat the oil to 325-350 degrees Fahrenheit (160 - 175 Celsius).Add the blanched fries to the oil in small batches to prevent over crowding. Cook for three to five minutes or until the fries are golden brown in color. Remove and pat excess oil off using paper towel.Serve immediately.

",How to Make Curly Fries3," Toss the fries in a generous amount of olive oil. Keep tossing until all fries have an even coating of oil.If you’d like to spice your fries, now is an ideal time. Try using salt, pepper, garlic salt and chili powder. Arrange the fries in a single layer on a cookie sheet.


Use more baking sheets and less fries per sheet. Keep the fries from touching one another to help them become crispy and cook evenly., Wait for your oven to preheat. It may be tempting to put the fries in and be done with it, but wait. Allowing the oven to complete preheat means your fries will cook evenly and prevents them from getting soggy., After the fries bake for 15 minutes, give them a good flip. Either toss them in the pan or use a flipper to move them around. The flip will keep both sides of the fries browning and even crispiness., Generally, after flipping initially, your fries will need another 10-15 minutes baking time. When your fries are the desired golden brown, you know they are finished. Remove your fries from the oven and allow them to cool slightly before serving.


Turn the oven to broil for the last few minutes if you desire extra crispiness. This will quickly give the fries a very deep brown color.

Don't go to your meal hungry.",How to Make Battered Foods Healthier," When it comes to fried foods, there are many options chefs and home cooks have for their oil or fat choices. Picking a heart-healthy fat can help improve the nutrition of your fried foods.


Be careful with your oil choice. Whatever you choose should have a high smoke point. Some oils (like olive oil) can actually burn and have an off taste which isn't good.
Choose heart-healthy oils with a high smoke point like: peanut oil, soybean oil and canola oil.Avoid oils like lard, duck fat or palm oil as these are sources of saturated fats.;
, Making sure your frying oil is the right temperature is one of the best ways at reducing how much of that fat is actually absorbed into your foods.If you do not heat the frying oil to the correct temperature, your food needs to stay in the fryer longer, allowing the batter to absorb more oil. This means your final product will be higher in fat.Use a frying thermometer clipped to the side of your pot or pan. This will allow you to measure the temperature and keep an eye on it. Also be sure to maintain the correct temperature throughout the entire cooking process. Note that each food or recipe will require a different frying temperature.
Also, do not crowd the pan with a lot of food as this drastically lowers the frying oil temperature.
Keep your oil clean as well — especially if you fry foods often. Sometimes leftover particles remain in the oil and burn. This can taint the flavor of new foods that you fry.

, Battering foods for frying makes for a very tasty, crispy, crunchy crust. But it can also pack a lot of calories.Be smart about the types of batter you use.


Most traditional batter recipes do give a great crust to fried foods; however, they notoriously absorb a lot of oil.Try gluten-free ingredients in your batter (since gluten is an oil-absorbing compound). Try bread in cornmeal or rice flour to reduce oil absorption.Add some carbonation to your batter. Using carbonated liquids (like seltzer water) or leaveners (like baking soda) produces gas bubbles in the batter and discourages oil absorption as well., It's important not only to fry foods correctly, but make sure you do not allow excess oil absorption after the foods are fully cooked.


Use a slotted spoon or mesh strainer to scoop foods out of the hot oil. The holes in these items allow the hot oil to drain off and away from the foods.Allow foods to cool on a wire rack, paper towels or newspaper. This helps the excess oil get absorbed and be pulled away from the foods.If you allow foods to sit in the oil, they'll continue to absorb oil as they cool.

, Although a homemade french fry or potato chip is definitely delicious, add extra nutrition to your fried foods by frying more nutrient dense items.


Try frying more vegetables instead of of the typical white potato. They'll offer a little more nutrition. For example, instead of making french fries, make fried zucchini sticks or beet chips instead.
If you're really in the mood for potatoes — french fries or chips — try using sweet potatoes instead. They're significantly higher in Vitamin C and A compared to regular white potatoes.Also choose to fry leaner cuts of meat. Go for chicken breast over chicken wings or drumsticks. Or fry shrimp or other seafood for another option for lean protein.

, Onion rings are one of the most popular battered foods. And although it is a vegetable, onion rings can rack up a lot of calories per serving.Instead of your typical breading or batter for onion rings, choose to bread your onion rings in finely ground high fiber cereal. Bran flakes are a great option.
Also skip the initial dredging in flour and go straight into an egg wash. After your onion rings are coated, dip them into the ground cereal to coat.
Skip the frying of your rings and opt for a lower calorie option by baking them. Bake until they are golden brown and crispy.

, You can also make a healthier fried chicken as well. Like onion rings, take advantage of the oven and other types of breading to lower the calorie level of this high calorie item.Regular corn flakes when crushed offer a really great alternative to the traditional battered fried chicken. Slightly crush (do not completely grind) the corn flakes.
Again, skip the flour dredge and dip your chicken right into an egg wash followed by the crushed corn flakes. Make sure each piece of chicken is fully coated.
Bake in the oven instead of frying to help lower the calories. Bake until the chicken is fully cooked through.

, If you're in the mood for fried fish, try baking your fish instead. Like the onion rings and chicken, baking the fish offers you a lower calorie option.


Another great option for breading is crispy rice cereal or puffed rice cereal. Crush the cereal slightly — do not crush too fine.
Coat your pieces of fish in an egg wash and then roll into the crushed rice cereal. Make sure the fish is completely coated in the cereal.
Instead of baking your fish directly on a baking sheet or pan, place your fish onto a wire rack (sit over a backing sheet). This allows the hot air to fully circulate around the fish keeping the bottom crunchy as well.
Bake at a high heat until thoroughly cooked through and golden brown.

, Although many tempura recipes offer a variety of vegetables, the batter can attract a lot of oil and therefore calories.Use a unique Japanese ingredient to mimic tempura at home.


Start your tempura with a variety of vegetables. Slice into strips, wedges or florets for easy handling.
Toss vegetables in whole wheat flour. Toss around to shake off any excess. Then dip the flour-coated vegetables in an egg wash to help the batter stick.
Instead of traditional breadcrumbs or crushed cereal, try using panko breadcrumbs. These breadcrumbs are bigger, airier and add a ton of crunch to foods. Toss the egg coated veggies into the panko and coat thoroughly.
Bake the vegetables until they are golden brown and crispy. You may want to stir them halfway through to help promote even browning.

, It's great to plan ahead to include a higher calorie item like fried foods. But don't plan to skip meals so you can overindulge later in the day.


Skipping meals is never a good idea. It doesn't help weight loss, it doesn't help save calories and it usually comes with some side effects. Many people have increased fatigue, increased hunger and a slower metabolism.If you skip a meal or snack prior to going out to eat, you may end up being overly hungry at the meal where your fried foods are. It'll be much harder to stick to an appropriate portion size if you're too hungry.

, If you're craving a fried item, go ahead and have it. But be smart about the other choices you make during your meal.


Fried foods are high in calories and high in fat. Keep your calories more minimal by having a healthy side dish with your fried item. Don't go for a fried appetizer, a fried main dish and a fried side dish.
If you have the option choose a lower calorie side. Instead of a fish and chips, go for the fried fish and a side of coleslaw or fruit salad.
You can also do a healthier entree and go for a more indulgent fried side. Go for the entree salad with grilled salmon and split a side a fries with a friend or family member.

, Occasionally splurging on an indulgent treat like a fried item is OK. It's just important to keep your indulgence to the appropriate portion size so you don't blow your whole calorie budget.


If you're ordering fried fish, fried shrimp or fried chicken, stick to an appropriate portion size for protein foods. Have a piece about the size of a deck of cards (or 1 drumstick or thigh for chicken) or a 3 – 4 oz piece.If you're going to a Japanese restaurant for vegetable tempura, again stick to an appropriate serving. Just because they're vegetables, doesn't mean you can over do it. Stick to 1 cup of fried vegetables per serving.Some restaurants now even offer fried pastas or breads — like fried macaroni and cheese balls. Stick to a 1 oz serving or about 1/2 cup of these.Fried fruit isn't a common item; however, if you encounter — especially in dessert form — stick to 1/2 cup serving., One bite of a favorite fried item and you're most likely already thinking about having a second bite. Manage your hunger so you have more control over how much you eat.When you're overly hungry it's hard to control your portions or food choices. If you know you'll be ordering a fried item at your meal (or making them at home) try to tame your hunger so you can stick to appropriate portion sizes.Have a small snack an hour or two prior to your meal. This helps satisfy hunger and allow you to make rational decisions at meal times.
You can also try drinking a large glass of water or unsweetened tea to help fill your stomach up with a no calorie fluid. Thirst and hunger mechanisms are poorly differentiated by the brain, so staying well hydrated helps with satiety and overeating.

Next, dip the wedges into the egg and then directly into the panko to coat.Make sure that all of the wedges are well coated with the breadcrumbs on all sides.
Have a plate or platter nearby that you can lay the avocado fries on once you’ve coated them.

, When the oil has reached 375 degrees Fahrenheit (190 degrees Celsius) in the pan, add just enough of the avocado wedges that will fit in a single layer. Fry the fries until they are golden brown, which should take 30 to 60 seconds. Repeat with the remaining wedges.Use a slotted, metal spoon to lift the avocado fries out of the oil so the excess oil can drip off.

, When you’re finished frying the avocado fries, place them on a plate lined with paper towel. Allow them to sit for a minute or two so the excess oil is absorbed before serving them.These simple avocado fries pair best with a spicy dipping sauce, such as jalapeno ketchup.

Cut your sliders.",How to Make French Dip Sliders," Set your oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (or 177 degrees Celsius) and let it preheat while you get to work on the sliders. Grab a 9x13 baking dish and spread the softened, unsalted butter over the bottom and sides. Make sure everything is thoroughly covered, because the butter will keep your sliders from sticking. Plus, it’ll make the bread extra buttery., Don’t break them apart! Instead, take them out of the bag and set them on your cutting board. You want to cut your Hawaiian rolls in half, so that there is one large top and one large bottom. Think of the entire loaf as one very large roll! Slide a knife into the side and carefully wiggle it through the entire piece.Set the top aside, and put the bottom of the rolls into the pan.

, After the bottom half of the rolls are in the buttered pan, it’s time to add the most important ingredients. Spread half of your provolone cheese slices across the bread so that it is covered. Top it with your roast beef and the French fried onions. Grab the rest of the cheese and put it on top of that. Finally, top your masterpiece with the top of the rolls!, Put your butter in a microwave safe bowl. Pop it in the microwave for about 30 seconds, or until it’s completely melted. Room temperature butter will melt pretty quickly, but frozen or refrigerated butter will take a bit longer. Keep an eye on it, and only remove it once it’s completely liquefied., Once your butter is melted, add in 1 tablespoon of the au jus seasoning mix. Then pour in the Worcestershire sauce, the sesame seeds, the garlic, and the onion powder. If you like your French dip sandwiches salty, sprinkle in the salt as well. Whisk all of these ingredients together., Once all of the ingredients are thoroughly mixed, you can add them to the sandwiches. There are several ways you can do this. You can drizzle it over the sliders straight from the bowl, or you can brush it onto the sliders with a pastry brush. Whichever way you do it, make sure the sliders are completely coated with the mixture. This adds a lot!, Once your oven is preheated, pop your baking dish in the oven for about 15 to 20 minutes. Keep an eye on the sliders, because you’ll be able to visually tell when they are finished. They are done when the cheese is melted and the rolls are a light golden brown color.


Once you make these a few times, you’ll know how long they need to bake.

, While the sliders are in the oven, you should make the dipping sauce. The dipping sauce is a critical component of the French dip sandwich. Pour the rest of the au jus mixture and put it in a saucepan with two cups of cold water. Turn the stove to medium heat, and whisk the mixture as it heats. As soon as it begins to boil, reduce the heat and let it simmer.


As the sauce simmers, it will thicken up.

, Once your sandwiches are golden and gooey, take them out of the oven. Grab a sharp knife and slice along the ridges in the roll. It’s important to cut them, otherwise it’ll be a mess trying to grab them! Place the sliders on a platter and serve with the au jus. Enjoy!"

Slice and serve immediately.",How to Make an Egg Sandwich1," Place the two pieces of bread in a toaster or toaster oven. Turn on the toaster to a medium toast setting. While the bread is toasting, prepare and fry the eggs.Keep checking on the bread while you are preparing the eggs to make sure it doesn’t burn! If the toast is done before the eggs, remove it from the toaster.
If you are toasting the bread in a toaster oven or inside your regular oven, top one piece of bread with the slice of cheese when it is partially toasted. The heat of the oven will melt the cheese.;
, Place a medium sized skillet on the stove over medium heat. Once the skillet has heated, pour the tablespoon of canola oil into the skillet and swirl to coat the bottom., Once the oil has heated, crack the first egg onto one side of the skillet. Immediately crack the second egg onto the other side of the skillet. Cracking the eggs on opposite sides of the skillet lets each egg fry separately and prevents them from running into each other., While the eggs are frying, sprinkle on a pinch of salt and pepper. You can add additional spices such as thyme or paprika if you wish, but be sure to also use salt and pepper since they help to bring out the flavor of the egg., After the whites of the egg become opaque, flip each egg with a spatula. Flip quickly so that the egg yolks don’t run, and make sure that the eggs aren’t overlapping as they cook., Some people prefer their egg yolks soft and slightly runny, while others prefer firmer yolks. Let the eggs fry until the yolks have reached a consistency that you're satisfied with.Remember that runny yolks are delicious, but they can be messier to eat than firm yolks!

, Lay out your toasted bread on a plate, and place the slice of cheese on one piece if you haven’t already melted it on the bread. Transfer both of the fried eggs onto the piece of bread without the cheese. Then put the piece of bread with the cheese on top to finish the sandwich.Some people like to add ketchup or hot sauce to their egg sandwich. Add your condiment of choice to give your sandwich extra flavor.

, Cut your egg sandwich in half, then serve immediately. Fried egg sandwiches are best when eaten hot, since they can become soggy if left out."

Go for kid-sized foods.,
Go for the salad option.,
Choose a lower-calorie main dish.,
Always go for grilled over fried.,
Build a better breakfast.,
Pick low-calorie drink options.,
Keep it simple.,
Order a lower calorie side.,
Choose a better dessert.,
Manage your hunger.,
Plan to eat fast food.,
Make other food choices healthy.,
Be sure to get in a workout.,
Try making your favorite dishes at home.",How to Eat Healthy at a Fast Food Restaurant," A very easy trick to start implementing when you're ordering fast food is going for a kid-sized meal. These mini meals are an easy way to stick to smaller portions and fewer calories.


Choosing a kids-sized meal can save you 200-300 calories.And you're not missing out on the ""good stuff."" Most kids meals still come with similar products to the standard menu options. In addition many fast food restaurants offer a side or small piece of fruit.
Choose small sandwiches as well. Ordering a ""double hamburger"" or even a ""triple burger"" will have 2 or 3 times as many calories as a single patty burger.
Also skip the option to super-size your meal or make it a ""large"". Even though it seems like a great deal, you're just adding more calories and fat to your overall meal.;
, Many fast food restaurants are now offering many more foods outside the typical burger and fries. Salads are a newer choice that may offer you a little extra nutrition and save you some calories.


Salads are a great choice because you're including a serving or two of vegetables which are naturally low in calories.
Do watch out for high calorie toppings and dressings. Items like bacon bits, cheese, croutons or fried protein (like fried chicken) can really put the calories over the top. Read nutrition labels (if available) to help you identify if a salad will be a healthier option or not.
Choose salads with grilled protein, low-fat dressing on the side, and a lot of fresh vegetables., Sandwiches and nuggets are a popular option at fast food restaurants. Choose the best option to keep your calories moderate.


Try out a snack wrap. Many restaurants now offer small wraps with a piece of grilled chicken inside. They're low in calorie (about 300 calories) and small which is perfect for portion control.Most fast food restaurants offer chicken nuggets. A 4 or 6 piece order are actually somewhat low in calories - about 200 calories. In addition, some restaurants offer grilled nuggets for an even lower calorie count.Stick to a plain hamburger or cheeseburger. When you don't have multiple patties or toppings, these sandwiches are actually moderately low in calories - right around 300 calories.If you have the option, do half of a sandwich instead of a whole sandwich and pair it with a side salad or a piece of fruit. Also ask for whole wheat bread if it's available.
If you're ordering a sub, try going for a whole grain bread and ask to make it ""lower carb"" by scooping out some of the doughy part of the bread.
Divide your meal into two or three smaller portions, and bring some of it home to eat the next day.

, Another easy way to automatically make a fast food meal a bit healthier is choosing grilled or baked items over fried items.


Studies have shown that fried foods are not only higher in calories and fat but can also raise your risk of heart disease and type two diabetes if eaten regularly.Choosing a grilled option can save you 100-200 calories per sandwich.Instead of the fried chicken sandwich, opt for the grilled chicken version instead.

, Fast food restaurants are known for a good breakfast. Plus, many serve breakfast all day long. Choose a better meal to start your day off on a good foot.


Breakfast sandwiches and wraps should be simple. Stick with an egg, cheese and a lean protein like ham or Canadian bacon. Or choose a sandwich with egg whites only. Try to avoid sandwiches on croissants, bagels or made with sausage or bacon.
Another great breakfast option now available is oatmeal. Watch out for the added brown sugar, but a few nuts or dried fruit is OK.
If you're interested in something cold, try fruit and yogurt parfaits. These offer a little protein and fiber and are a great breakfast option.

, Fast food restaurants now offer a whole host of beverages to go with your meal - anything from sodas, to coffees and even smoothies. However, some of these drinks are quite high in calories and can put you over your limit.


Drinking sugary drinks is associated with many chronic disease, such as type two diabetes and heart disease.Stay away from regular sodas, sweetened juice drinks, sweetened teas, sweetened coffee drinks, smoothies, milkshakes or chocolate milk.
Instead of these types of higher calorie beverages, go with low or no calorie beverages. Water is always a great choice, but you can also try diet sodas, unsweetened tea, unsweetened iced coffee or diet lemonades. Some of these may have some artificial sweeteners but they are low or no calorie.
Drinking artificially sweetened drinks will satisfy your sweet craving, but it will not help to reduce it. In order to reduce your craving for sweet beverages, choose unsweetened options, such as coffee and tea, sweeten them yourself, and gradually reduce the amount of sweetener., Many times fast food meals, especially the main entree, can get high in calories with all the tasty toppings that are added. More simple or plain items are usually lower in calories.


For example, a plain fast food single patty cheeseburger has about 300 calories. A bacon club cheeseburger has about 700 calories.Customize your meal as needed. If you see an item you want to order and notice it has a lot of extra toppings or condiments, ask for these to be served on the side or not at all.
Skip the higher fat condiments like mayonnaise, honey mustard, BBQ sauce and ""special"" sauces. Instead go for yellow mustard, hot sauce, salsa, horseradish and vinegar for a much lower calorie topping.

, It's so familiar to hear a fast food restaurant ask customers ""what side would you like with that?"" Even if you choose a healthier entree, the sides at fast food restaurants can be quite unhealthy.


The first thing to do is order a small. This is especially true if you're ordering a fried item or other sides that are higher in calories. Choosing a small order of fries or onion rings can save you a few hundred calories.Many restaurants are now offering fruit as a side. If you have the option opt for the apple slices, banana or small fruit cup.You may also want to consider getting a side salad. This can help you fill up on low calorie vegetables. Just stick to low-fat dressing on the side.
If you're willing to order a different side, go for something that's low in calories and not fried. For example, choose a baked potato over fries. Be moderate with the butter and sour cream. However, this baked version is lower in calories and fat compared to the fries., If you're craving something sweet after your meal, be careful to choose a dessert that's not overly high in calories or fat.


Go for mini or individual desserts. Items like cake pops, mini parfaits or mini cookies are a great way to enjoy a pre-portioned sweet treat.Also choose smalls. Whether it's a small soft serve or milk shake, a small will always have the least amount of calories.
If ordering ice cream, go for a cup instead of a cone and leave off the hot fudge or caramel. A few rainbow sprinkles is a better lower calorie choice.Bring your own dessert from home. You could bring a sweet piece of fruit, a low calorie cookie pack, or some fruit snacks. Planning desserts could reduce the calories of your meal and also save you money.

, If you know you're planning on getting fast food during the day, it's important to make sure you manage your hunger appropriately so you don't overdo it at the drive through.


If you skip meals or snacks or go into a meal too hungry, you're more likely to overeat and make poorer food choices.This is dangerous if you know you're going to a fast food restaurant.
If you need it, have a snack about 2 hours prior to hitting the drive through. Keep it simple and small - just enough to prevent you from becoming overly hungry. A piece of fruit, a small yogurt, a hard boiled egg or a protein bar are great options.
Avoid trying to skip meals, snacks or under-eating to help save up calories for a higher calorie fast food meal.
Pack meals and snacks at home. These will help to curb your hunger and reduce your urge to pick something up to eat from a fast food restaurant.

, To make sure you keep your fast food consumption in check, make sure you intentionally choose when and how often you're eating fast food meals.


If you're not planning for fast food, you're probably more likely to stop by on a whim or when you're overly hungry.
Instead, plan to have fast food occasionally. When you plan for it, you're preparing yourself in advance which may help you make healthier choices at the restaurant.
Also, take a look at the menu you before you go. Review what you might be interested in and what options are the healthiest. Most fast food restaurants now offer their menus and nutritional information online.
You may also want to compare a few places to see what restaurant will you offer you the healthiest and most enjoyable meal.

, Sometimes you might find yourself stopping for fast food meal on an overly busy day or evening. Even if it's not something you planned on doing, you can still make the rest of your day healthy.


Don't feel that one ""slip-up"" or one not so healthy meal ruins your entire day. You still have multiple food choices during the day to pick something nutritious for your body.
If you were late for work and stopped by the drive through for breakfast, don't worry. Make a healthy choice at lunch, your afternoon snack and dinner.

, Another way to keep yourself on track with a healthy lifestyle is by sticking with your workout plan.


Aim for about 2 1/2 hours of moderate-intensity cardio activities each week.Activities like walking, jogging, swimming or dancing are great to add to your lifestyle to help maintain weight (even after the occasional fast food meal).
If you ended up going to a fast food restaurant or weren't able to eat as healthy as you wanted to, do something positive by going for a walk or staying a the gym a little longer than normal.
Although you generally cannot ""work off"" an entire fast food meal at the gym, doing something healthy and positive for yourself is a good habit to continue to practice.

, If you find yourself craving fast food frequently or really enjoy specific fast food meals, try making your favorites at home.


Studies have shown that if you cook most of your meals at home, you actually consume less calories overall.This is because you can control what ingredients you use and how much you eat of certain foods.
Think about your favorite fast food meals and see if you can recreate them at home with less calories and fat. Consider researching recipes online or looking for cookbooks that have more nutritious versions of these foods.
For example, instead of chicken nuggets from a restaurant, consider making baked chicken nuggets at home. Or if you love burgers, consider making turkey burgers at home on a whole wheat bun.

You can also crack the egg into a bowl and whisk it, then pour it into the biscuit cutter if you want the yolk to be blended with the egg whites., Cut a piece of aluminum foil that is slightly larger than the biscuit cutter, then place the foil on top of the biscuit cutter. Shape the foil around the aluminum cutter so it stays in place, then cook the egg for 3-4 minutes.

, While the egg is cooking, slice the English muffin in half and place it in the toaster. Remove the muffin once it has finished toasting, even if it finishes before the eggs are done!If you are cooking the English muffin in the toaster oven or in your regular oven, you can place the slice of cheese on one piece of the muffin so that it melts.
To toast the English muffin in a regular oven, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (176 degrees C), then place the muffin on a baking sheet inside the preheated oven and bake for ten minutes., Remove the foil after 3-4 minutes and check on the egg. By this time, the whites should be set and the yolk should still be a little soft. If you prefer a firmer yolk, keep cooking for another minute., Use tongs to remove the biscuit cutter from the skillet as it will be hot and could burn your fingers! Then use a spatula to transfer the cooked egg to a plate. Sprinkle the egg with salt and pepper., Place the slice of Canadian bacon on the already heated skillet. Let the bacon cook for about one minute, then flip it over and cook it on the other side for another minute. If the bacon is not crispy after two minutes, keep cooking until it is crispy., If you have not already melted the cheese onto the English muffin, place the slice of cheese on the bottom half of the muffin. Then place the bacon and egg on top of the cheese, and finally put the top of the English muffin onto the sandwich. Serve immediately."

If you're doing more than one color, simply divide the juice by the amount of colors you're making and add only a few drops of coloring each time until you're happy with the resulting color.

, Do not overlap any of the sticks or the overlapping parts won't change color––keep it all one layer. Check that all the potato sticks are completely covered by the lemon juice.


Again, if you're making different colors, divide the potato sticks evenly across each color being used.

,, Use a slotted spoon or similar to lift out the sticks. Lay them out on kitchen towel to drain and dry.

, When the sticks are dry and the oven is ready, spray or brush them with olive oil. Arrange the oil-coated sticks in a single layer across the baking sheet. Again, don't overlap or they won't bake evenly.


Cover the baking sheet with parchment paper to ensure that it's non-stick.

Peel the potatoes (optional -- if not, rinse and scrub skins).
Cut each potato lengthwise into two halves.
Lay each half cut-side down, then cut parallel to the cutting board to cut in half once more.
Cut these potato planks into your fries.

, This vinegar boil is called ""parboiling,"" and the vinegar helps to keep the potatoes nice and firm. Put everything into the pot cold, then crank the heat up to high until it boils for 10 minutes.









When pierced with a fork, each fry should be tender but not falling apart., The buttermilk will form the crust needed to get a nice, crispy fry. Normally this comes from the deep-frier, but you won't be deep-frying this time. The buttermilk is a perfect substitute.








, The potatoes will need to cook in the oil, but you want the oil to be hot to avoid soggy, greasy fries. Heating up the oil in the oven ahead of time is the perfect solution. While you could check the temperature, it should be good to go after 2-3 minutes, and will quickly rise to the right heat if the oven is pre-heated.

, Whisk together these dry ingredients -- they are the second half of your DIY oven french fry crispy-crust. This is also a great time to whisk in any desired flavors or seasonings, like a teaspoon (5ml) of any or all of:

Peel the potatoes.,
Leave the potatoes in cold water until ready to cook.,
Fill a large pot with potatoes, 2 tablespoons (30ml) vinegar, 2 tablespoons salt, and 2 quarts (≥ 2 liters) water.,
Parboil the potatoes for 10 minutes over high heat.,
Drain the potatoes and pat dry with paper towels.,
Fill a deep pan or wok with 3"" (7.5cm) of oil, and heat to 400F (205C) A large dutch oven, wok, or a deep-fryer will have the best results.,

, Soaking them reduces the starch content. Some cooks even soak the potatoes overnight., Want to know how McDonald's gets perfect fries every time? They cook them three times, starting with a ""parboil,"" or vinegar bath. Throw everything in a large pot, cover with the 2 quarts water, and set the stove to high. This is completely optional to get good crunchy fries.








, They should be tender and easily pierced with a fork, but not falling apart. Start checking after about 8 minutes.








, Let the potatoes cool on a paper towel-lined baking sheet for about five minutes as they cool down. As they do, get start heating up the oil in the next step.







, While fries can be cooked without a thermometer, it will be impossible to get McDonald's-besting fries without one.








If you don't have a thermometer, but want to go for it anyway, you'll want medium-high heat. Not quite the highest setting, but pretty close. You drop one small potato in to test -- it should bubble up quickly, These are not completely cooked yet, and that's a good thing! They should be pale and floppy. Note that, as the potatoes hit to oil, the temperature should drop to roughly 360F (180C).








Return the oil to 400F with each new batch, ensuring all the fries cook.

, Remove the chips from the hot oil and drain them on a plate full of paper towels. Don't move forward until they have at least cooled to room-temperature. This is key for your second fry! It should take about 30 minutes.


Wondering why you double-fry fries? Potato water molecules are caught up in the starch, and there is less water in the outer edges (as they ""air dried"" when cut) than the centers. During the first fry, this outer edge water escapes, but the water in the center just makes it to the edge. Luckily, as this water cools it forms a starchy, oily crust, which the second fry turns into the perfectly crisp exterior of a good fry., McDonald's doesn't just freeze their fries to store them -- the process of freezing actually makes crispier final fries! This is because water expands as it forms ice, creating jagged little ice crystals in the potato. These internal ""cuts"" provide more room for the rapidly melted water to escape once you fry it, removing more moisture for a crisper fry., This recipe requires little more than smart fryer skills. If you want to use the same oil as before, this is perfect -- simply strain out or remove any bits of potato that may have stayed in the oil.

, You'll likely need to do this in two batches to fit everything -- don't try to crowd the pan. The oil will again drop to about 360F (180C), and adjust the heat if needed to keep it there








, The paper towels remove excess oil, and the salt provides the best, most even flavor when allowed to dissolve on the still-hot fries. Serve immediately!









If you're working in two batches, the fries can be kept warm and crisp on a wire rack in the oven set to 200F."

Curry and fried food such as samosas or onion bhaji
Hot dogs, etc.;
, You have a lot of power to reinvent and improve the healthiness of fast food in your home environment. Select the options you enjoy the most and then follow some of the examples in the following steps to improve the fast food menu served at home.


Always use the best and freshest ingredients for optimal nutrition.
Prefer healthier oils over saturated, trans-fat or solid fats. A recent study in the British Medical Journal stated that olive and sunflower oils are good oils that do not appear to be implicated in heart disease.All the same, try to avoid deep frying very often.

, Burger and fries doesn't have to be a fat, sugar and empty calorie experience. It can be a truly satisfying and tasty one that has plenty of nutrition:


Choose quality burger meat to make burger mince from. Make your own patties and use olive or sunflower oil to fry them, or bake them.






Choose vegetable based burgers instead of meat ones.






Select wholemeal or wholegrain buns over white buns.






Add lots of salad ingredients, including sprouts, tomatoes, different styles of lettuce, etc.






Bake the ""fries"" (or chips/wedges) instead of frying them. Cut fresh potatoes into big wedges and bake on a parchment covered tray. If you need oil, brush a little olive oil over them prior to baking.






Make a low-sugar or sugar-free ketchup for the burger.
Add plenty of salad fillings to the burger.
Try these recipes: Salmon burger, Grilled Foreman burger or a turkey burger. For more homemade burger ideas, see Homemade burgers.

, Pizza can be fattening if you're not careful how much you're eating take out versions. Here is how to improve it:


Choose a thin, wholemeal pizza base. Try to make a wholemeal base using wholewheat, spelt, or other wholegrain flour in place of white flour.
Use non-stick trays or parchment paper on the pizza tray instead of adding more fat to prevent sticking.
Choose lean meats. Instead of pepperoni, salami, sausage and bacon, choose lean lamb strips, shredded chicken breast, ham or prawns.
Reduce the amount of cheese used by at least half or use low-fat cheese. Alternatively, don't even add cheese.
Use vegetable toppings instead of meat toppings.
Don't have with garlic bread but do have with plenty of fresh salad.
Don't forget other Italian fast options such as pasta or lasagna with lots of vegetables in the sauce and homemade garlic bread using real butter (not adulterated) or olive oil and fresh garlic.

, Make homemade fish fingers and make baked chunky chips. Don't add too much salt and be sure to have with a salad on the side and some homemade ketchup (tomato sauce).

, Instead of deep frying, fry in shallow oil, using a healthy oil like olive or sunflower oil.


See How to make Mexican baked ""fried"" chicken and check out the escalopes option in How to make fried chicken for the shallow frying method.
Eat with plenty of salad or steamed vegetables.

, By returning to the roots of Tex Mex, you can unearth the much healthier Mexican versions that would be eaten daily and are filled with nutrients. Some examples include:


Mexican rice
Homemade tortillas
Mexican pie
See How to cook real Mexican food for some more ideas.

, Many Asian take-outs are healthy if you avoid fried fatty or high calorie meals. Making these meals at home is easy and can include:


Curries made with reduced ghee or other fat amounts, brown rice, salads accompanying the curry, less meat and more vegetable content, etc.







Sushi (try both fish/seafood and vegetarian versions; if you're a novice sushi maker, it isn't ""fast"" but it will speed up with practice)






Bento boxes (although this takes a bit of work and isn't quite ""fast"")







Stir-fries (use healthy oil, lower the meat amount, use brown rice and don't overdo sauces with too much sugar in them)
Soups, such as miso soup.







, This can also be made at home for cinema nights:



Nachos can be relatively easy to make by blending tomatoes, chillies and garlic, then adding vegetables of your choice (onion, pepper and more chilli is often tasty).
Warm the salsa through, then pour some chips in an ovenproof dish, pour the salsa on top and sprinkle with just a little Monterey Jack cheese or highly flavored favorite cheese. Fresh nachos can be very tasty.

Make popcorn at home. Instead of adding fat, add spices such as cinnamon or squeeze small amounts of lime juice and sprinkle pepper on the popcorn.







, Do you get onion rings? Consider baking onion rings rather than frying them.


Do you like doughnuts? Change to watermelon doughnuts to reduce the fat content.
If you love cheesecake, make a light version at home and stick to only having one piece each for dessert.

, You could also have ice-cream for dessert if you wish, choosing a fruit based sorbet option without dairy or small portions of a quality dairy ice cream.

, Try different ways of putting together the fast food meals at home. Keep notes of which work best and what sorts of substitutes you and your family like most.


Taste test! Does it taste similar? Better? Fresher? Is it more economical? Is it more satisfying than fast food? What do the other people think of your attempt? What could you do better next time you make it?
Keep a folder of your favorite fast food home recipes, either hard copy or digital. Include an ingredients list to help with quick shopping.
Build on your experiences. Attempt them once a week until you get them perfect, and don't forget to adjust your recipe if you see fit, along the way!

, Once or twice a month is probably a good average for at-home fast food treats that contain a lot of fat or raised levels of sugar, although if you've really super improved the healthiness, more often is possible, especially with Asian style and traditional South American cuisine.


Always favor fast food imitations that are filled with nutrients and that are simple.
Get children involved in making homemade fast foods; teach them that cooking is easier than getting takeouts.

Squeeze the moisture out of the sauerkraut.Lay the sauerkraut on several layers of clean paper towels.,
Butter half of the bread slices.,
Layer on the corned beef, cheese, sauerkraut, and dressing.,
Butter the remaining bread slices.,
Melt another 2 Tbsp (30 ml) of butter in a griddle.,
Cook the sandwiches until both sides are toasted.,
Serve hot.",How to Make a Reuben Sandwich1," Wrap the sauerkraut inside the paper towels and squeeze gently over a sink or bowl to get the excess liquid out.


Squeeze out as much moisture as possible. If too much excess remains, it can seep into the bread, causing it to turn soft and mushy.;
, Butter one side of four slices. Gently line the slices up butter-side down on a piece of wax paper.


The buttered side will need to be on the outside as the sandwich cooks, so when you assemble the sandwiches, the non-buttered side needs to face up.
If you do not use wax paper, you may end losing too much of the butter after you lift the sandwich up.

, Evenly divide the corned beef and place it on the bottom of each sandwich. On top of the corned beef, lay one piece of Swiss cheese, sauerkraut (1/4 amount for each sandwich), and roughly 2 Tbsp (30 ml) of prepared Thousand Island dressing., Butter one side of the remaining four bread slices and place one slice onto the top of each sandwich with the buttered side facing out.


As with the first half of the bread, the buttered side must face out to come into contact with the hot skillet.

, Add the butter and heat over medium until it melts completely.


Note that you can also use a shallow frying pan or skillet if you do not have a griddle.
By buttering both the sandwiches and the griddle, you create more evenly toasted bread with a softer texture and a more buttery flavor.

, Add the sandwiches to the buttered, hot griddle. Once the cheese begins to melt and the sides along the bottom look golden brown, carefully flip the sandwiches over and cook the other side.


The other side should also be golden brown before you remove it from the pan.

, Remove the sandwiches from the pan and slice in half before serving.

If you use a corned beef brisket, you should receive a packet of spices, as well. Sprinkle the spices over the brisket in the slow cooker.
There is no need to drain the sauerkraut before adding it. In fact, the extra liquid helps the corned beef cook properly without drying out.

,


Do not remove the lid as the corned beef cooks. Doing so will release the heat trapped inside, altering the overall cooking time.
If you want to prepare this dish a little faster, cook on high for about 5 hours.

, Prepare a baking sheet by covering it with a sheet of aluminum foil.


If you prefer a cleaner taste, you could skip the foil and coat the baking sheet in a fine layer of nonstick cooking spray, instead.

, Bake it for about 15 minutes.


Do not leave the bread in the oven long enough to brown or burn. It should only be left long enough to get a little crusty.

, After the bread is cool enough to touch, use a serrated knife to cut the loaf into 12 separate slices.


Let the bread cool for about 5 minutes before trying to handle it.
Cut the bread at a 45-degree angle.

, Add the mayonnaise, chili sauce, sour cream, parsley, onion, relish, lemon juice, horseradish, and Worcestershire sauce to a small bowl and whisk until well combined.


Note that this will yield slightly more than you need for your sandwiches. Any extra can be saved in an airtight container and refrigerated for several days.
The dressing you are making for this sandwich is known as a Russian dressing.

, After the corned beef finishes cooking, remove it from the slow cooker and transfer it to a cutting board. Use a carving knife to cut the beef into small slices.


Slice against the grain instead of with it. Slow cooked corned beef is already tender, but if you slice it against the grain, it will be even tenderer. Slicing with the grain, however, can cause the beef to become a little tougher and stringier.

, Add roughly 2 Tbsp (30 ml) of butter to a large skillet and heat on the stove over medium heat until the butter melts.


Note that a griddle or wide griddle pan may work even better since it has low sides, making it easier to flip the sandwiches during the cooking process.

, Layer equal amounts of sliced corned beef, cheese, sauerkraut, and Russian dressing onto six slices of your toasted bread. Top each sandwich with another slice of rye bread.


Each sandwich should have two slices of cheese on it and as much as 4 Tbsp (60 ml) of Russian dressing.
Remove the sauerkraut from the slow cooker using a slotted spoon, draining as much liquid as possible from the sauerkraut before adding it to the sandwich.

, Add the sandwiches to the prepared skillet and cook for about 7 minutes on the first side, or until the sides are crisp and golden brown. Flip with a spatula and finish cooking for a few more minutes, just long enough for the cheese to melt and the other side to turn golden brown.


Note that you may need to prepare the sandwiches one or two at a time instead of cooking all six at once. You may also need to add more butter as you continue to finish the sandwiches.

, Transfer each finished sandwich to a cutting board and cut in half with a serrated knife before serving.

",How to Make a Chicken Sandwich2," To make this sandwich, you'll need:


1 egg
3 cups milk
3 cups fine breadcrumbs
1 cup flour
1 tsp. salt
1 tsp. paprika
4 tsp. black pepper
2-4 tablespoons cups cooking oil
2-4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts
1-2 tsp. of red chili powder for a spicy flavor, if desired
1 tsp. of crushed onions

, Put the egg and milk into a single bowl. Beat the egg until it's integrated. Then add the breadcrumbs, flour, and additional dry ingredients, stirring thoroughly with a whisk to integrate the batter mixture.

, Evenly dip each chicken slice into the flour, and then the batter, and the flour again. Put the pieces on a plate to let them rest while you prepare the frying oil.

, Put the stove at medium setting, and flick a small amount of cold water at the oil to check the heat. If it hisses, then the pan is hot enough to cook the chicken.

, Put a few pieces in at once, but be careful not to crowd the pan. If you do, you'll bring the temperature of the oil down significantly, making your chicken soggy and greasy. Turn the chicken once, when it becomes golden brown on the bottom.


Remove chicken from the pan when it's golden brown and has cooked to an internal temperature of 165°F. Place the chicken slices on a cutting board to let them rest before slicing.
If you don't have a thermometer, slice a piece of chicken in half. Make sure the juice runs clear and there's no pinkness on the inside.

, Fried chicken goes great on any number of different kinds of sandwich bread, and with a variety of different condiments and additions. Try out the following:


Use Italian bread, tiger bread, baguette, or olive-cheese bread.
Top with slice dill pickle, raw red onion, lettuce, and tomato.

",How to Make a Chicken Sandwich3," To make this chicken sandwich, you'll need:


1 large boneless, skinless chicken breast
1 teaspoon olive oil
Salt and pepper to taste
½ teaspoon salt
¼ teaspoon pepper
¼ teaspoon garlic powder
¼ teaspoon onion powder
¼ teaspoon dried oregano
¼ teaspoon paprika
Aluminum Foil
Hamburger Buns (whole wheat) or multigrain bread

, Brush both sides of each chicken breast with olive oil, and sprinkle with the seasonings. Line the chicken on an unlined baking sheet and preheat the oven.

, After ten minutes, flip the chicken to the other side, and bake for 8-10 more minutes, or until juices run clear when pierced with a fork. It's fine to make a small slit in the thickest part and see if it's done.


You'll need to adjust the baking time to the size of your chicken breasts. This recipe is perfect for 8 oz, but if yours are much larger, you might need to bake them for 12-15 minutes on each side, and if they're smaller, 8 minutes per side will probably be just right.
The best way to make sure they are done is to use an instant-read thermometer. It should read 165 degrees F when inserted into the thickest part. If you don't have a thermometer, make a small slit in the center and peek to make sure it's white and opaque, not pink.

, Loosely cover with foil and allow to rest 5 minutes before putting them in your choice of bun or multigrain bread, with the toppings of your choice.


Before you turn the oven off, try toasting the buns in the oven with sliced cheese to give your sandwiches a crispy texture. Keep a close eye on them so they don't burn.

Three slices are traditionally used, with one slice being used in the center of the sandwich to create two layers, but the sandwich can also be made without this additional slice.


If you want to cut the calories of this sandwich down, eliminating the middle slice of bread is a good way to do it. It'll still taste good.;
, Add bacon to a cold flat bottomed skillet and heat slowly on low-medium heat, turning the bacon frequently. Fry the bacon until crisp, or until you see lots of little white foamy bubbles on the bacon as you turn it. Blot the bacon with paper towel to remove the grease, and set aside until you're ready to assemble the sandwich.


If you'd prefer, you can also use pre-cooked or microwavable bacon for a quick alternative. Turkey or soy bacon are lower fat alternatives.

, To start assembling the sandwich, start with the base. Use a table knife to spread a thin layer of mayonnaise onto the bottom piece of toast, to taste. The mayo helps to keep the sandwich moist, but if you don't like it, or don't want the extra calories, it's perfectly fine to leave it off.

, On top of the bottom layer, start adding a few slices of thinly-sliced poultry. Chicken is the traditional choice, but turkey is also commonly used. Top with a leaf or two of crisp iceberg lettuce, and one or two slices of fresh tomato.


The meat on a club sandwich is almost always cold. If you want to roast your own chicken or turkey for a club, all the better, but let it cool to at least room temperature before making the sandwich.
If you don't have iceberg, romaine, bibb, or other crisp lettuce varieties work perfectly fine. Spinach and other greens are also great substitutions, but iceberg lettuce is most traditional on a club.

, Halfway there. To start the second layer, you can add another slice of toasted bread, with mayo on both sides, if you're feeling indulgent. If you're not, feel free to hold the mayo, or leave the middle slice off entirely.

, Start the second layer of the sandwich by laying the 2-3 pieces of cooked bacon on the top of the center piece of bread. You can break up the pieces if they're a little too big for the sandwich.

, On top of your bacon, complete the second layer of the sandwich, adding essentially the fixings for an entirely other sandwich. Start with chicken or turkey, then lettuce and tomato on top. Go a bit easier on the second layer, so the sandwich doesn't become top-heavy.

, When you've got your tower built-up, top it all off with another slice of bread, pressing down slightly to get the sandwich under control. Mayo? Your call.

, Now comes the fun part. The most famous feature of the club sandwich is the way that it's cut. To start, cut it from corner to corner, across one diagonal, and then again across the opposite diagonal, cutting it into four triangle-shaped slices.Use a sharp chef's knife for the best results. You've got a lot of sandwich layers to cut through.
Some people like to cut the crusts off before slicing the sandwich along both diagonals, so the sandwich slices are perfect little triangles.

, Club sandwiches can get a little hard to handle, so it's common to secure all the layers with a toothpick through each section. Some people even add the toothpicks before cutting the sandwich, and use them as a guide for the knife. Your call.

, Arrange the sandwich sections on the plate, spread out slightly with a gap in the middle, which you can fill with your side. French fries and chips are probably most common, but you could also pair a club with potato salad, cole slaw, or a green side salad, and a pickle.

, Most club sandwiches are made with plain white bread, but there's nothing stopping you from getting more creative. Try a club made with hearty multi-grain, or made of marbled rye for a little more flavor.


For a real creative treat, try using three different slices of bread. Wheat on the bottom, rye on the top, and pumpernickel in the middle. Now you're talking.

, Most clubs don't have cheese, but what sandwich isn't a little better with a slice of provolone? Or American? Or pepper jack? Sandwich rules were made to be broken. Pimento cheese is a southern delicacy, made with spreadable cheese and a pepper kick. It'd go great on a club.

, A club is usually made with poultry, chicken in most parts of the world, and often turkey in the US. But a roast beef club? A corned beef club? A roast pork club? Why not?


If you don't eat meat, try adding grilled zucchini slices, eggplant, tempeh, or portobello mushroom instead of the meat.

, Plain old mayonnaise or Miracle Whip can make even a bad sandwich serviceable. But with a little extra work, that mayo can be great. Consider mixing in any of the following concoctions:


Pesto mayo (Tablespoon of pesto per half cup of mayo)
Curry mayo (1/2 tablespoon of curry powder per half cup)
Fry sauce (ketchup and mayo)
Thousand island (French dressing, pickle relish, mayo)
Sriracha hot sauce mayo (Sriracha to taste, plus mayo)
Brown mustard mayo (2 tablespoons per half cup)
Mayo and cajun seasoning (Teaspoon per half cup)

, If you like ketchup on your sandwich, go for it. Barbecue sauce? Balsamic vinegar? Banana sauce? Louisiana chili sauce? Sounds great. The club sandwich is a pretty basic recipe that you can alter to any tastes. Try a bite plain, then add what condiments you like.


Try a different condiment on each slice of bread, to make the layers distinct and unusual. It'll be the most epic club ever.

",How to Make a Day After Thanksgiving Turkey Sandwich," The first task is to remove leftover meat from the turkey carcass. Cutting with a knife works to a point, but you also end up losing quite a bit of meat with this method. You’ll be able to work with much better precision by hand.


Removing the meat from a turkey is a messy job, so roll up your sleeves. You’ll also want to wear an apron or to change out of nice clothes.
The job doesn’t take long but is well worth the effort. Depending on the size of your bird, you’ll end up with enough leftover meat to last at least for several days. Oftentimes, you can fill up one or two large containers.;
, Removing leftovers from a turkey carcass is largely a matter of sorting. You will want to find the edible pieces of meat while getting rid of any inedible pieces, like bones, cartilage, and fat. When you’re done, the bird should be little more than a bare ribcage.


While some pieces are easy, like stripping drumsticks for meat, there are less obvious spots on the bird with good meat. Look closely and work systematically.
Make sure to strip the turkey breast of all its white meat. The wings may look small, but they also contain some edible meat.
Once you’ve picked the front of the turkey clean, turn it over and begin to work over the backside. The areas near the thighs and backside have a lot of delicious dark meat, once you strip away the layer of skin and fat.
Break open the ribcage. There is sometimes salvageable meat inside.
In some families, the neck bone is a prized piece of the turkey and gets eaten fast. If your family is not so fond of it, however, know that the neck bone has a bit of meat on it. Using your fingers, you can scrape the meat off.

, Take all of the meat that you’ve removed and place it inside a plastic tupperware container. Then, be sure to store it inside of a refrigerator or other cool place. Try to finish the job within two hours after the meal in order to minimize the growth of bacteria.


Leftover turkey should keep for between 3 to 4 days in the refrigerator.If you don’t plan to eat the leftovers immediately, consider freezing them instead. They will keep longer this way.

, Now, dispose of what remains in your “discard pile.” You can throw it away or, if you’d rather get as much mileage out of the bird as possible, consider making stock. Boiling the carcass into stock yields a rich broth for soups or other food, and releases leftover fats, flavors, small bits of meat.To make stock, take the carcass and bones and cover them with about 10-12 cups of water in a soup pot.
Chop up 3 celery stalks and one onion, adding them to the pot. If you’d like, you can also add carrots, several sprigs of parsley, and about ½ teaspoon of ground black pepper.Boil the pot and then reduce heat to a simmer. Continue to simmer the carcass until the liquid is reduced by about 1/3, which should take about 3 ½ hours.
When finished, strain the broth and discard the solids. Let the liquid cool for a time and then either refrigerate or freeze the broth.

, With the turkey meat salvaged, you should be able to assemble a fine sandwich. The first task is to pick your bread. While two slices is standard, the more ambitious or hungry might go for three slices to create a double-decker sandwich.


While white or whole wheat bread work fine, you needn’t limit yourself. The slight tang of rye and sourdough can add a nice touch to overall flavor of the sandwich, too.

, Now, take the two (or three) slices of bread and set them on a plate or on a chopping block. With a bread knife, spread your chosen condiment on one side of each slice of bread.


Mayonnaise is a perennial favorite for sandwiches. There are many alternatives, however. Hummus, pesto, mustard, and mashed avocado are all solid condiments.One highly underrated sandwich spread is horseradish sauce, or the closely related, mayo-based horseradish cream. Horseradish has a pleasant, somewhat tangy taste. Be careful not to use too much, however, as it can irritate your sinuses.

, Once you’ve spread your condiment, take salt and pepper and lightly season the bread and spread. Freshly ground pepper tastes best, but pre-ground works just as well in a pinch.

, Select turkey meat from your leftovers and place on top of one slice of bread. If you’re constructing a double-decker sandwich, using three slices, add the meat to two slices of bread.


Try to use a mix of white and dark meat. White meat is lower in fat and leaner, but it can be dry.

, Fixings are what separate the regular turkey sandwich from the after-Thanksgiving turkey sandwich and what elevate it to a special place in the food canon. To start, take some leftover cranberries. On the extra slice of bread, place a slice of either jellied cranberries or a spoonful of sauce. Then, spread.


If you are feeling hungry, put more turkey meat on top of the cranberry sauce.

, Take stuffing from your other leftovers and apply it over the cranberry sauce in a generous layer. You can also add it to both sides, if you desire.


Some people also like to add leftover vegetables like peas, onions, or corn kernels. This is up to you.
Try to use whatever leftovers you have handy and whatever suits you. Some people will also use mashed potatoes, baked beans, corn casserole, or others dishes on their sandwiches.

, Once you have piled on the meat and fixings, assemble the pieces of bread one on top of the other to complete the sandwich. You are now ready to eat.


Your sandwich might now be too large to cut in half or to pick up. If that is the case, eat it with a fork and knife.
If you’d like, warm the sandwich in the microwave for about 15-30 seconds. It’ll taste even better.
Consider using leftover gravy for a further enhancement, as well, turning it into a hot turkey sandwich.

Make sure that all the parts are equally sized., Take a portion of the patty mixture and gently shape it into an ovular patty shape that is about ¾ inch (19.05 mm) thick.

Make a salad of spinach, arugula, or your favorite type of greens mixed with olive oil and balsamic. Then place the salmon patty on top of the greens and drizzle the patty with tartar sauce. Serve with a lemon wedge.


You can chill the patty before putting it on the salad or serve it while it is still warm., If you enjoy the taste of the patty by itself, serve in as a side in the context of a larger meal. Pair it with rice, cooked vegetables, or whatever other foods you have prepared."

Add meat.,
Add other sources of protein.,
Add herbs and spices.,
Dress up the food with fancy presentation.,
Garnish with colorful small tender vegetables and herbs suitable for eating raw.",How to Make Soup With Noodles Like Ramen,"

Cooking the noodles in the broth adds flavor and thickness from starch and a little oil to the broth, and adds flavor from the broth to the inside of the noodles. If you like that, just cook the noodles in the usual manner substituting improved broth for water. But, if some part of the soup such as big or tough vegetables or meat requires extended cooking time, add the noodles to the broth three to five minutes before it will be done so they don't overcook.



 


Cooking the noodles out of the broth avoids masking delicate flavors with starch and oil. Make Ramen Noodles the usual way, preferably right before the broth will be done, discard the water, and add the noodles to the broth when it's done. The amount of broth to make separately from noodles is up to you, but you may want to use less liquid than normally recommended because cooked noodles will not absorb much more liquid.





;
, Try meat bouillon (broth) from a can or reconstituted from a dehydrated cube or packet. There are also vegetable broths some of which taste like chicken broth.

, For that, you could Microwave or steam the toppings, or boil them in minimal water, to avoid leaching out their vitamins (but make sure meat is cooked thoroughly). Or, Sauté them (adds some fat and a more-cooked outside texture and flavor). You could also add some cheap, strong flavorings to the boiling water for the noodles to absorb into them, such as the seasoning packet, chili, or soy sauce.

, Cut them into bite-size pieces, small and across the grain if fibrous. They will cook by boiling, but you can Sauté some or all of them and add them to the soup for different texture and flavor.

, Canned, frozen or otherwise pre-cooked vegetables should be cooked as little as possible; add them once everything else is hot. Firm vegetables should be cut thin to speed cooking, and fibrous vegetables should be cut for easy eating. Some popular choices are:


Bell peppers
Tomatoes
Bamboo shoots
Chopped Lemongrass, especially with seafood
Onion

, The pieces should be bite-size and thin so they are tender and certain to cook thoroughly by boiling a few minutes. Some popular choices are:


Baby clams
Dried baby shrimp
Asian beef meatballs
Squid
Shrimp
Crab
Salmon (available canned)
Bacon
Tuna (widely available canned)

, Especially if you're a Vegetarian.


Eggs (fried, dropped in, or stirred in)
Tofu
Grated cheese, especially cheddar, Colby, or Colby-Jack. Try it as a topping.
Vegetarian imitation bacon bits.

, Be careful if you're also using the spices that come with ramen noodles, because those can be very hot already. Give anything dehydrated a chance to rehydrate rather than just sprinkling it on top, which would leave it hard and difficult to taste at first. Some popular choices are:


Chili
Basil
Hot sauce
Lemon juice (try it with hot sauce for a flavor like hot and sour soup)
Soy sauce
Old Bay (don't add much; it's largely salt)
Peanut butter (preferably unsweetened)
For American-style noodles, ranch dressing (available in a light style) or butter adds creaminess. These would be best without a broth.

, Try small bowls, chopsticks, and big Asian soup spoons.

, Some popular choices are:


Cilantro
Bean sprouts
Parsley
Decorative spices and herbs such as slices of hot peppers and basil leaves.

Use egg noodles.,
Try a whole-grain pasta.,
Serve your chicken stroganoff with rice.",How to Make Chicken Stroganoff4," Egg noodles are the traditional choice when making chicken stroganoff. If you are interested in a tried-and-true classic, stick to the simple egg noodle., Whole-grain pastas are healthier than refined pastas because they contain more fiber, vitamins, and minerals. Plus, whole grains make you feel fuller, which will keep you from adding unnecessary calories to your diet.You can use any shape of whole-grain pasta. Choose the shape that is most delicious to you.

, Instead of some sort of pasta, try serving your chicken stroganoff over rice. Use brown rice instead of white.

Try adding rice to your soup.",How to Make Soup in Your Blender1," If you don't have a blender with very high settings, you will need to chop up the vegetables before putting them in your blender. A very strong blender, however, should not have problems liquefying whole vegetables. You can save time by just throwing them into the blender., For a zucchini soup, you can mix zucchini and other vegetables together in a blender. Add one cup to a cup and a half of hot water to the mix so the soup will heat up while being blended. In addition to the main ingredients, add spices such as dill, cilantro, sea salt, and pepper to taste.Place one whole zucchini, 1 to 2 plum tomatoes, 1 to 2 stalks of celery, 1 sliver of red onion, and 1/2 to 1 garlic clove in the blender.
You should blend the ingredients on high for about 90 seconds. However, the exact time varies depending on your blender. You may have to blend the ingredients longer to get a smooth, uniform texture.

, A nice tomato soup can be made in a blender as well. You can spice this soup with things like basil, oregano, dill, or Italian seasoning. You should also add salt and pepper to taste. You should also mix in 1/2 to 1 cup of hot water.Add 1 whole carrot, 1 to 2 whole tomatoes, 1 to 2 stalks of celery, 1 sliver of red onion, and 1/2 to 1 cloves of garlic.
Blend the soup for about 90 seconds on high, or until it's smooth.

, If you use very hot water for your soup, the friction from the blender should result in your soup being adequately hot when it finishes blending. However, if you have a slower blender, the soup may not heat to your liking during the blending process.You can heat soup in a microwave until it's as hot as you want.
You can also heat soup over the stove.

, If you want to make your soup into a full meal, you can then pour the soup over brown rice after making it. You can also try something like lentils or quinoa. This can be a good lunch or dinner."

Use the right ingredients.,
Blend cooled soups only.,
Freeze leftover soup.,
Serve soup with an accompaniment.",How to Make Soup1," If the soup is dainty and for a dinner party, use fresh ingredients of good quality. If the soup is meant to take care of wilting veggies and leftovers, that's fine but keep such a soup for a hearty family meal and avoid using it to impress the guests.


Many soups that require a meat or fish stock can have a vegetable stock substitution to serve vegetarians or to make the soup lighter in taste.

, Many a person has had a rude shock and even some nasty burns from trying to blend a soup while still hot. Rushing the blending is not safe and therefore, a soup that requires blending should be made plenty ahead to avoid taking shortcuts that can injure.

, In most cases, soup is fine to freeze. It's also easy to thaw, as all you need to do is throw it back in a saucepan and reheat, and the thawing will occur as it melts back into soup form.

, Usually soup is not eaten alone, unless it's extremely filling and hearty. The most usual accompaniments to soup include:


Crusty white bread (and butter)
Garlic or herb bread
Dumplings (added to the soup)
Croutons (sprinkled on the soup)
Scones or muffins
Whatever else you have at the back of the freezer that can be zapped back to life quickly.

Combine the shrimp and salt.,
Let stand.,
Add the rice and bamboo shoots.,
Pack the mixture in a clean jar.,
Let the mixture ferment.,
Store in cold temperatures.,
Cook before serving.",How to Make Buro1," Place the shrimp and salt in a large bowl and mash them together using a wooden spoon or your hands.


If possible, use fresh shrimp instead of frozen shrimp.
Make sure that the shrimp has been washed in running water and drained well in a colander before using it.
The salt must coat the shrimp evenly after you mix the two ingredients together. The shrimp must be allowed to absorb as much salt as possible.;
, Set the shrimp mixture off to the side and allow it to stand for two hours.


The shrimp mixture should sit out at room temperature during this time. You can cover it partially with a loose sheet of plastic wrap to prevent dust and debris from falling in, but do not create a tight seal.

, Place the rice and bamboo shoots in the salted shrimp mixture. Use your hands or a wooden spoon to mix them in thoroughly.


The rice should be freshly cooked, slightly cooled, and slightly watery when added to the shrimp mixture.
Strictly speaking, the bamboo shoots are optional. Shrimp, salt, and rice are the only ingredients that must be included, but bamboo shoots are highly recommended.

, Transfer the mixture to a clean, dry glass jar. Leave at least 1/2 inch (1 cm) of empty headspace at the top of the jar, then seal it.


You can use separate jars or opt for one jar. If using one jar, it will need to hold 1 to 2 gallons (4 to 8 L).
Cover the top of the jar tightly with a sheet of clean plastic wrap. After covering it with the plastic, tightly screw on the cap.

, Allow the mixture to sit in a cool location for 3 to 10 days.


It is best to keep the jar in a slightly cool location. A refrigerator can be too cold, but a humid kitchen is too warm. A basement or cellar is ideal.

, After buro ferments, you should store it by keeping the jar in your refrigerator or freezer.


When stored in the refrigerator, the buro should last for about one month. When stored in the freezer, it should remain good for two to three months.
If storing the buro in the freezer, you may wish to separate the buro into serving size portions before freezing it. That way, you will not have to defrost the entire jar just to use a portion of it.

, When you are ready to serve the buro, sauté the amount you want in hot oil, onion, and garlic for roughly 10 minutes on medium heat.


For one-quarter of the buro produced in this recipe, use 1/2 cup (125 ml) vegetable oil, 2 Tbsp (30 ml) minced garlic, and 2 cups (500 ml) chopped onions.
Cook the garlic and onions in the oil, stirring occasionally, until they become fragrant and lightly browned. Use a medium skillet or saucepan.
Add one-quarter of the buro to the pan with the onions and garlic. Cook for 10 minutes, stirring continuously, until browned.

Enjoy your bolillos as dinner rolls or sandwiches.",How to Make Bolillos," Place 1/2 cup (125 ml) of warm water into a large bowl and add the yeast and sugar, stirring gently to mix the ingredients evenly. Allow the mixture to sit for 5 to 10 minutes, or until foam starts developing on the surface.If the yeast mixture does not become foamy, that means the yeast is dead or will otherwise not activate. As a result, the bread will not rise if you continue forward from here. If this happens, you should buy a new packet of yeast and start over.;
, Pour the remaining water into the yeast mixture, along with the oil, salt, and 2 cups (500 ml) of the all-purpose flour. Stir the contents of the bowl together using a wooden mixing spoon until evenly combined.If you have an electric stand mixer with a dough hook attachment, you could mix the dough ingredients together using that instead. The electric mixer can also help you knead the dough in future steps.
Do not add all the flour at once, since doing so would make the dough harder to form. Add it in gradually, bit by bit.

, Add the masa harina (corn flour) and white cornmeal into the bowl and stir well to incorporate it.


If you are unable to find masa harina, you will need to substitute it for another type of corn flour. Extra cornmeal can be used in a pinch, but do so only as a last resort, since cornmeal is coarser and will affect the texture of the bread. Regular wheat flour would be a better substitute. Do not use corn starch as a substitute under any circumstances, however., Gradually add the remaining 3 cups (750 ml) of all-purpose flour into the bowl. Add roughly 1 cup (250 ml) at a time and stir well after each addition. Continue until all the flour has been mixed in.


Note that, as the dough gets thicker and tougher, you might find it more difficult to stir it using your wooden mixing spoon. Should this happen, lightly dust your hands with flour and begin mixing the dough using your hands. You can also put flour on the sides of the bowl to prevent it from sticking.
If you have been mixing the dough with a stand mixer and dough hook, you will not need to blend the remaining flour in by hand.

, Lightly flour a clean kitchen counter. Turn the dough out of the bowl and onto this surface, and knead it for 5 minutes or so.You can also add a little bit of warm water right at the beginning of the kneading process.When ready, the dough should lose most of its stickiness and should be much firmer and smoother.
If you have not done so already, lightly dust your hands with flour as you work with the dough. Dust your kneading surface with flour, too.

, Place the dough into a large, lightly oiled bowl and cover it with plastic wrap. Set it aside in a warm location and let it rise for about 1 hour.The bowl you use should be roughly twice the original size of your batch of dough.
Make sure that the bowl has a thin coat of vegetable oil or nonstick cooking spray along the bottom and sides before you put the dough inside. This oil should be enough to prevent the dough from sticking as it rises.
You can cover the bowl with a clean, damp dish towel if you do not have plastic wrap.

, Use your fists to gently deflate the risen dough. Lightly flour your kitchen counter again, and turn the dough out onto it. Knead the dough for another 2 minutes.


Note that you may also need to sprinkle your hands with flour again, especially if the dough threatens to stick to your fingers when you touch it.

, Start by splitting the dough into three even portions. Further divide each of these three portions into four equal pieces, forming a total of 12 evenly sized rolls.


Alternatively, if you want to make more servings, you could split the full amount of dough into four equal sections. Split each of these portions into even fours, creating a total of 16 rolls.

, Roll one portion of dough in between your hands to form a roll. Place it on the counter, and gently flatten it into an oval using your fingers.


The oval should be about 1/2 inch to 1 inch (1.25 to 2.5 cm) thick.
Position the oval so that the long side runs from top to bottom and the shorter side runs from side to side.

, Bring the bottom third of the oval up and over the center. Fold the top third of the oval over these two layers. Pinch the ends together into a blunt point. This process is similar to folding a piece of paper to fit in an envelope.Essentially, you need to fold each oval of dough in the same way you would fold a letter when placing it into a standard envelope.

, Place each uncooked roll on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Keep the seam side down, and space the rolls at least 2 inches (5 cm) apart.


Instead of parchment paper, you could use a silicone baking mat.
Consider sprinkling the parchment paper or silicone sheet with a little extra cornmeal for added texture.

, Place a loose sheet of plastic wrap over the baking sheet and move the dough to a warm location. Let the rolls rise for 30 minutes, or until roughly doubled in volume again., Place the cool water, corn starch, and salt in a small saucepan. Quickly stir them together, then place the saucepan on the stove.For best results, create the wash while the dough rises instead of waiting until after the rolls are ready.

, Turn the eye of the stove to medium-high heat. Stir the mixture constantly for several minutes until it boils, thickens, and becomes translucent.Use a whisk or mixing spoon to stir the contents of the saucepan.
Remove from the heat once ready.
The corn starch acts as a thickener. The final wash will look a little cloudy due to the corn starch, but you should not be able to see any white grains of corn starch in the liquid.

, Carefully brush a bit of the wash over the tops and sides of each roll.


Wait until the rolls have finished rising before brushing them with the wash.

, Use a sharp, pointed knife to make a 1/4 inch (0.6 cm) slash from one end of each roll to the other.Stop 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) from each end of each roll.


After making the slash, gently pinch the ends of each roll again to accentuate the point.

, For best results, do this while the rolls continue to rise, during the last 15 minutes or so.


Try to avoid waiting until after the dough has already risen. The longer the dough sits out, the more delicate it becomes and the more likely it is to deflate.

, Place the baking sheet on the center rack of your preheated oven. Bake them until they turn a pale golden brown.Baking time might vary based on the strength of your oven and the size of your rolls.
Be careful as you move the uncooked rolls into the oven. If you are too reckless or quick, you might cause them to deflate slightly.
Note that the finished rolls will also have a ""hollow"" sound if you gently tap them on the bottom with your fingertip.

, Remove the baked rolls from the oven. Slip them off the baking sheet and place them on a wire cooling rack to cool., The bolillos are ready to eat once they are cool enough to handle with your hands. Eat them alongside a meal as a dinner roll. You could also slice them in half lengthwise and use the crusty bread halves for sandwiches.


If you want to save the rolls, do so by placing them in an airtight container. Store them at room temperature for up to three days.

It is also easy to store and serve, as you don't have to worry about reheating it. Before you make your chilled soup, prepare your ingredients.You will need 2 large cucumbers. You should peel and dice them before adding them to your soup.
Chop up two scallions, including the green and white portions.
Scoop out the insides of a large avocado and discard the skin.

, Add the cucumbers, avocado, and scallions to a blender. You should also add two tablespoons of lime juice, 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon of sea salt, and 1/4 teaspoon of black pepper., How long this will take depends on the speed of your blender. Keep blending the ingredients until they have a smooth, soup-like quality.If your blender runs on a very high setting, you may want to use a lower or middle setting instead of a high setting. While the high setting will blend ingredients faster, it may make your soup hotter than you want due to the friction.

, You do not have to wait before serving chilled soup. It can be served as soon as it comes out of the blender. It can make a great snack, a side dish, or can be a meal in itself.If you have soup leftover, store it in the refrigerator for later. One advantage of chilled soup is that it does not need to be reheated after storage.

Add thicker ingredients for a chunkier soup.,
Use a blender to heat the soup.,
Add hot water to warm the soup.",How to Make Soup in Your Blender3," Some people dislike the texture of very smooth soup. If you want something slightly chunkier, add more of the chunkier ingredients. Additional celery and tomatoes, for example, can make soup chunkier. You can use the ""pulse"" button to mix in the added ingredients so the soup does not become too much like liquid., If you have a very powerful blender, you do not need to heat the soup after blending it. With powerful blenders, 90 seconds of blending at a high speed will heat your soup. If you want your soup hotter, you can continue heating it in the blender instead of heating up over the stove or in the microwave., If your soup does not come out as hot as you want, and you don't want to blend it further, you can add a little more hot water. Tossing in another half cup of hot water can heat the soup up without damaging its texture too much."

Rub the fish with salt.,
Combine the rice and the rest of the salt.,
Add the fish.,
Pack tightly.,
Allow the mixture to ferment.,
Store in a refrigerator or freezer.,
Cook before serving.",How to Make Buro2," Use just enough salt to coat all sides of the fish evenly. Set the fish aside for 15 to 20 minutes.


Make sure that the fish has been thoroughly cleaned before you use it. If working with fillets, you simply need to rinse and dry the fish. When cleaning fresh fish, you must remove the scales, gut it, and rinse the flesh.
Slice each fish into 7 or 8 pieces before rubbing it with the salt.
Let the fish sit out at room temperature. You can cover it loosely with plastic wrap, but do not create a tight seal.

, Combine the two ingredients in a large bowl until the salt evenly coats the cooked rice.


The rice must be soft and cool when you mix it with the salt.

, Transfer the salted fish to the rice mixture and mix thoroughly, mashing the fish and rice together until evenly combined.


Use gloved hands or a wooden mixing spoon to combine the ingredients together.

, Transfer the mixture to clean, dry glass jars. Cover the top of each jar tightly.


Leave at least 1/2 inch (1 cm) of empty headspace at the top of each jar.
You can either use separate jars or a single jar. If using a single jar, make sure that it can hold approximately 1 gallon (4 L).
Cover the top of the jar tightly with plastic wrap. Place the cap on securely over the plastic wrap.

, Place the jars of buro in the vegetable drawer of your refrigerator. Let the sit there for two weeks before you use them.


The buro can also be fermented in a cold cellar or basement, but in this instance, a refrigerator is recommended.

, For long term storage, keep the buro in your refrigerator or transfer it to a freezer.


When stored in a refrigerator, the buro should last for one or two months. When stored in a freezer, it should last for three or four months.

, To prepare the buro for eating, sauté the amount you want in a skillet or saucepan coated with hot oil. Cook it with minced garlic and chopped onion for best results.


sauté the garlic and onion in the hot oil until they turn light brown and become fragrant. Cook the ingredients over medium heat.
Add your desired amount of buro to the pan and continue cooking for 10 minutes, or until browned.
You may also want to add 1 to 2 Tbsp (15 to 30 ml) of sugar to the buro as you cook it to help balance the sour, salty flavor of the pickled fish.

Boil the brine.,
Peel and slice the mangoes.,
Place the slices in a large jar.,
Pour the brine over the mango slices.,
Let the mixture ferment.,
Store in the refrigerator.,
Enjoy.",How to Make Buro3," Combine the water and salt in a small saucepan and bring the solution to a boil over medium-high heat. Allow the mixture to boil for a full five minutes, then remove it from the heat and let cool.


The water and salt are necessary components of the brine, but you can alter the flavor if desired by adding 1/4 cup (60 ml) sugar or 1/4 cup (60 ml) sili (small chili peppers).

, The flesh of each green mango needs to be cut into fat, long slivers.


After rinsing and drying each mango, peel off the skin using a sharp knife or vegetable peeler.
Cut each mango into three flat pieces. Two of the pieces should hold nothing but the flesh, while the third middle piece will contain the pit or seed.
Use a knife the shave away the flesh of this middle piece away from the seed. You should be able to get two long slivers from this section alone.
Cut the flesh from the remaining sections into fat slivers.

, Arrange the mango pieces in a large glass jar. The pieces should be packed closely enough to keep them upright, but there should also be gaps between them.


If you have a large enough jar, you can keep the slices in one jar. Otherwise, you may need to use several smaller jars.
Make sure that each jar is clean and dry before using it.

, Pour the cooled salt brine over the mango slices. Make sure that the slices are completely covered, but leave at least 1/2 inch (1 cm) of empty headspace at the top of the jar.


It is essential that the brine cools to room temperature before you pour it over the mango slices. If the brine is still hot or warm, it could partially cook the mango, causing a distortion in the taste and texture of the finished buro.

, Loosely cover the jar with its cap, then keep the jar in a cool to room temperature location for three days.


A basement or cellar would work well. Refrigerators are too cold, but a humid kitchen might be too warm.
You do not need to keep the jar covered tightly during the initial fermentation. In fact, for this type of buro, it is best if you leave the lid a little loose.

, After three days pass, you should tighten the lid of the jar and store the buro in your refrigerator.


When stored in the refrigerator, the buro should last for about one month.
You could also try storing the buro in your freezer. When frozen, it can stay good for two or three months.

, Burong mangga does not need to be cooked before you eat it. When you want to serve the buro, simply remove it from the jar and enjoy.

",How to Make Soup in a Slow Cooker," If any of your ingredients are frozen, thaw them before you start to assemble the soup.


Place the frozen ingredients in your refrigerator and allow them to thaw slowly overnight.
If you need to quickly thaw ingredients, do so by using the ""defrost"" setting on your microwave. Avoid thawing certain ingredients, like meat, at room temperature since doing so provides more opportunity for bacteria to grow.;
, Most of the meat and vegetables should be cut down to similar sizes. Ingredients cut to an even size will cook at the same rate, so they should all reach the right consistency at the same time.It is especially important to cut each particular ingredient into evenly sized pieces. In other words, if you cut some of the meat into 2-inch (5-cm) pieces, you should cut all of the meat into 2-inch (5-cm) pieces. If you cut some of the potatoes into 1-inch (2.5-cm) cubes, you should cut all of the potatoes into 1-inch (2.5-cm) cubes.
Note that aromatic vegetables (like onion and garlic) and soft vegetables (like corn and peppers) can be cut into smaller pieces than the meats and hearty root vegetables. Aromatic ingredients can enhance the flavor more thoroughly if they cook faster than the rest of the soup, and soft vegetables are usually added later in the cooking process, so they won't be cooking for quite as much time as their heartier counterparts.

, Consider trimming away the visible, separate layers of fat on any meat you plan to use for your soup.Since melted fat has nowhere to drain in a slow cooker, it tends to pool in layers at the top of the soup. A little interior fat can enhance the flavor of the soup, but too much fat can make the broth seem greasy.
For the same reason, you'll also want to avoid adding any oil, butter, margarine, or lard to the soup ingredients in the slow cooker.

, While not strictly essential, browning your meat in a skillet before adding it the to slow cooker can enhance both the color and flavor of the dish.


Use roughly 1 to 2 Tbsp (15 to 30 ml) of oil, butter, or margarine for every 1 lb (450 g) of meat. Heat the fat in a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat, then toss in the cut portions of meat and cook, stirring frequently, until the meat looks evenly browned.
If desired, you can also brown aromatic vegetables beforehand to enrich the flavor profile of the soup. Common aromatic vegetables include onions and garlic.
When you're running short on time, however, you do not need to brown the meat beforehand. The soup should cook perfectly fine even if you skip this step, but the flavor and color of the finished soup will vary slightly.

, Before adding any ingredients, consider covering the bottom and sides of the slow cooker with nonstick cooking spray or a specially designed slow cooker liner.


This step is not strictly necessary, but lining the slow cooker should prevent ingredients from sticking as they cook, making the cleanup process much easier as a result.
Slow cooker liners are your best option since they don't introduce any extra fat into the soup. If you choose to use nonstick cooking spray, only apply a light coat and wipe away any pools of fat before adding your soup ingredients.

, Layer all root vegetables on the bottom of the slow cooker before adding any other ingredients.Since the heating element of the slow cooker is located at the bottom of the machine, the ingredients that require the longest cooking time should always be placed on the bottom of the slow cooker, where they can get more direct access to the heat. Layering the ingredients like this will help promote even cooking.
Of all possible soup ingredients, root vegetables usually require the greatest amount of time, so they need to be added first. These ingredients include potatoes, yams, carrots, radishes, parsnips, beets, rutabagas, and large wedges of onion. Winter squashes should also be layered near the bottom of the slow cooker, even though they aren't root vegetables.

, Most raw meat should be layered on top of the hearty vegetables. Many spices and herbs can be added at this time, as well.


Fish and other types of seafood should not be added this early, but all other raw meats can be. This includes cuts of beef, chicken, pork, lamb, venison, and goat.
If you're using previously cooked meat, do not add it to the raw ingredients yet.
By adding the seasonings early on, you allow their flavors to distribute more evenly throughout the soup broth. Note that rosemary can become bitter when cooked for long periods of time, however, so you should save any rosemary you plan on adding for later. All other herbs and spices can be added now.

, Hard vegetables that aren't quite as hearty as your root vegetables should be layered on top of the meat.


This can include chopped onion, chopped garlic, tomatoes, chopped celery, cauliflower, and broccoli. All of these vegetables will hold their form when cooked for long periods of time, but since they don't require quite as much heat as meat or root vegetables, they should be placed further away from the lower heating element.

, Any broth, stock, or water called for in the recipe should be added now. Pour the liquid into the slow cooker, covering the solid ingredients by roughly 1/2 inch (1.25 cm).


Traditional soup recipes prepared on the stove will usually require much more liquid, but for slow cooker soups, you should only add just enough liquid to barely cover the ingredients. Liquid won't evaporate in a slow cooker like it does in a stockpot, so if you add too much now, the finished soup might be too watery.
Note that dairy-based liquids should not be added to the slow cooker yet.

, Place the lid on your slow cooker and turn on the heat. Most soups should cook on high for three to four hours or on low for six to eight hours.For vegetable soups that do not include any meat, reduce the cooking time. Vegetable soups should cook on low for two to four hours or on high for one to two hours.
When possible, cook soups on low heat. A lower, slower cooking experience will make your ingredients more tender and allow the flavors to blend more evenly, thereby enhancing the overall taste of the soup.

, Allow the soup to cook in the slow cooker without disruption. Do not remove the lid to stir the contents or otherwise check on the ingredients.


Each time you remove the lid, you'll end up releasing some of the heat. If you remove the lid too often, you'll need to increase the cooking time.
Only remove the lid if you are adding more ingredients or if the soup is done and ready to serve.

, Some ingredients cook much faster than others, so you should wait until the final 30 to 45 minutes before adding them. After adding these ingredients, return the lid to the slow cooker and continue cooking until done.


If you add soft ingredients too soon, they will likely become mushy and may fall apart. Such ingredients include soft vegetables (peas, corn, bell peppers, and greens), seafood (fish and shrimp), and grains (rice and pasta).
Precooked meats should also be added near the end. Adding them sooner shouldn't cause the meat to dry out, but it may cause the meat to fall apart.
Dairy products must be added during the final portion of cooking, too. This includes cream, milk, shredded cheese, sour cream, cream cheese, and non-dairy milk (like coconut milk or soy milk). Adding dairy too early can cause it to curdle.

, If you need to thicken the soup broth, you can do so by adding a cornstarch paste during the final 10 to 15 minutes.


The liquid will not thicken on its own in a slow cooker. This isn't an issue for most soups, but it can be a problem if you prefer soups with a thicker liquid.
Mix 1 to 2 tsp (5 to 10 ml) of cornstarch with equal parts cold water in a small dish. Add the paste to the contents of the slow cooker, stirring thoroughly to blend it in. Return the lid and continue cooking for another 10 to 15 minutes.

, If you accidentally add too much liquid to the soup, you can partially reduce the amount by removing the lid and allowing the soup to sit for another 30 minutes.


Once you remove the lid, some of the liquid will be able to evaporate. Keep the heat on to maximize possible evaporation and to keep the soup hot.
The ingredients will not cook as well with the lid removed, though, so you should wait until all of the ingredients are fully cooked before doing this.

, Once the soup has finished cooking, turn off the heat, remove the lid, and stir the ingredients to distribute them evenly throughout the soup. Serve the soup directly from the slow cooker while it is still hot.


Note that some slow cookers have a “warm” setting. If you plan on returning for seconds later on, you can switch the slow cooker to “warm” instead of turning it off completely.
Typically, extra soup can be ladled into airtight containers and stored in the refrigerator for a few days to a week.

Go crabbing. Get your fishing license and set out some crab traps!
Buy a fresh crab. Your local farmers' market might have a fresh crab stand. Seafood shops, yuppie grocers, and Asian grocery stores may also carry fresh crab.;
, Steam or boil your crab at 7-8 minutes/pound, lid on but tilted to allow venting. Steam the crab because steam decreases the amount of water retained in the body cavity. Boiling will get the job done quite well, though, and more people are likely to have a big pot than a big steamer.


Start your timer when the water starts to boil. Base your number of minutes on the average crab weight, not the sum total of the crab you will be cooking.
Round times down whenever necessary; undercooked crabs can always be cooked further, while overcooked rubbery crab is inedible.
Add some seasonings to your water when using the boiling method. Add salt, a bay leaf, some celery chunks, a carrot, some pepper corns, and any other whole spices you've got on hand. Pre-mixed crab boil seasonings are available, but not necessary.

, Remove your crab from the pot, and rinse under cool water in the sink. This will cool down the shell enough for you to handle. Flip the crab over a couple of times to get both sides with the water.

Whisk in gelatin and chill the mixture.,
Beat the egg whites with cream of tartar.,
Whisk in the rest of the sugar.,
Whip the heavy cream.,
Fold the blueberry puree into the whipped cream.,
Fold in the egg whites and chill the mousse.",How to Make Blueberry Mousse2," Juice one lemon and pour the juice into a saucepan along with 1/2 cup (100 g) of the granulated sugar. Cut one vanilla bean in half and scrape the inside of the pod. Put the seed paste into the saucepan and add 4 cups (400 g) of fresh blueberries.If you don't have vanilla bean, you can stir 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract into the mousse base once it's cooked.

, Turn the saucepan on to low heat and stir the blueberry mixture occasionally. Let the mixture bubble gently and simmer it for about 5 minutes. Turn off the heat and pour half of the mixture into a bowl to cool.The berries should soften and burst once they've finished cooking.

, Set a fine mesh strainer over a bowl. Put the remaining half of the blueberry mixture into the strainer and press it against the strainer using a spatula. The seedless puree will drip into the pan and the solids will stay in the strainer.You can just throw away the solids.

, Pour 1 tablespoon (10 g) of gelatin powder into the seedless blackberry puree and whisk it until the gelatin dissolves. Put the bowl in the refrigerator to chill.The mixture should become cold, but it won't set up.

, Get out a completely clean mixing bowl and place 2 egg whites in it. Add a pinch of cream of tartar and beat the egg whites with a stand or electric mixer on high speed. The egg whites should whip up into firm peaks.Ensure that the bowl is totally clean and that there's no bit of yolk in the egg whites. These prevent egg whites from whipping.

, Keep the mixer running on high speed and add the last 1/4 cup (50 g) of granulated sugar. Beat the egg whites for another minute. The egg whites should turn glossy as the sugar dissolves., Pour 1/2 cup (120 ml) of chilled heavy cream into a large mixing bowl. Use a stand or electric mixer with whisk attachments to beat the cream on high speed for several minutes. Beat the cream until soft peaks form in the cream when you lift away the attachments.If you can, chill the bowl and attachments in the freezer for a few minutes before you beat the cream. It will beat faster and you'll get more volume.

, Remove the bowl of blueberry gelatin from the refrigerator and spoon it into the mixing bowl with the whipped cream. Use a large metal spoon to gently fold the blueberry mixture into the whipped cream until it's incorporated.To fold, hold the spoon and use a twisting motion with your wrist to gently combine the blueberry mixture into the whipped cream. The goal is to incorporate the blueberry mixture while keeping the volume in the whipped cream.

, Fold the egg white mixture into the blueberry whipped cream mixture until it's just incorporated. You can spoon or pipe the mousse into serving dishes. Chill the mousse for at least 6 hours before you serve it. When you're ready to serve the mousse, top it with the reserved blueberry mixture you sweetened.The gelatin and egg whites need time to set up before you serve the mousse. This is why it's important to chill it.

Slide the knife in between the clam meat and the top and bottom shell to remove the meat.







, Mix the milk, water, and salt in a large bowl until well blended. Place the clams in this mixture and refrigerate for 2 to 4 hours.


As the clams soak, they should take in some of the moisture and flavor from the milk, water, and salt.
If you are short on time, you can reduce the amount of soaking time to 20 or 30 minutes. This is not preferable, but you should still be able to coat and cook the clams.

, Stir together the all-purpose flour, corn flour, and onion powder in a shallow dish until thoroughly blended.

They should close up immediately, but if they do not close, throw them out. Discard any other mussels with open shells. Unwrap them from the bag or packaging as soon as they get home to allow them to breathe. If they die before they are consumed, the mussels will be poisonous.






;
, Submerge the mussels in a bowl of clean, cool water. Leave them to soak for 20 minutes. While underwater, they will breathe and filter the water, which will begin to push out any sand or ocean minerals from inside their shells.








, Little brown threads may be sticking out from between the 2 shells. This is the beard. Grasp the beard and pull it out and towards the hinge end of the mussel. Remove it completely and discard.








, Use a slotted spoon to take the mussels out of the bowl. Place them in another clean bowl of water. Do not reuse the first bowl by draining and refilling it. Using the slotted spoon will help ensure that the sand from the water does not re-enter the mussel.








, Pull them individually out of the second bowl of water and gently scrub at the shell. Pick off any slime that may be clinging to the shell. Rinse them off under running water.








, Dump the bowls of water, and cook the mussels any way that is desired.

, They are a tough patch on the side of the scallop, with the tissues running horizontally instead of vertically. If your scallops have this, simply pull them off with your thumb and forefinger.


The side-muscles are safe to eat, but they are very chewy.

, Place the scallops into a strainer or colander, and rinse them. Shake the water off, then gently pat them dry. If you don't dry the scallops, they will be too moist, and not fry properly.

",How to Cook Bay Scallops3," Pinch off the side-muscles, if necessary. They will feel like a tough spot on the side of the scallop. Once you have done this, rinse the scallops with cool water and pat them dry with a paper towel.

, Stir everything together with a fork until evenly combined. You will be tossing the scallops in this first.

, Keep mixing until the yolk breaks and you get an even color. This act as a sort of glue, and help the breadcrumbs stick to the scallops later on.

, You will be dipping the scallops in this last. It will give them a crunchy texture when you fry them. You can use plain breadcrumbs, or ""flavored"" ones (such as garlic) for something fancier.

, You want them to be lightly coated with the flour mixture. Because of how many scallops you have, consider working with only a few at a time.

, The easiest way to do this would be to use a slotted spoon. This way, you won't have to worry about wasting any of the egg mixture up while dipping the scallops.

, Roll them around with a spoon, then transfer them to a large baking sheet. Make sure that they are evenly coated with the breadcrumbs.

, If you don't have a deep fryer, you can also use a 2-quart (1.9 liters) saucepan or another deep pan.Whatever you choose to use, it must be able to safely hold 2 to 3 inches (5.08 to 7.62 centimeters) of oil..


Test the oil to ensure it is hot enough. Place a small cube of bread into the oil. If it starts to turn brown within 1 to 2 minutes, it is hot enough to cook scallops.

,, Once the scallops finish draining, you can either serve them, or put them into a warm oven heated to 300°F (148.9°C).This will keep the scallops warm while you fry the rest.


Drain the scallops by placing them on a few sheets of paper towels. This will help soak up the excess grease and keep them from becoming soggy.

Cook the oysters.",How to Clean Oysters," Oysters caught in waters far from the Equator are usually the freshest. The best Northern Hemisphere locations include the Pacific Northwest or either coast of Canada. For Southern Hemisphere locations, look for southern Chile or New Zealand as the country of origin., Oysters should remain alive until they're shucked. Otherwise, they're not fit for consumption. To test for life, try opening the shell. If it snaps back, the oyster is still alive. If not, you shouldn't buy it. Cracked or open shells are other markers of dead oysters., Place them cup side down (flat side up) on a large plate. Cover them with a wet kitchen towel. Make sure the fridge has enough air circulating to avoid killing the oysters. Avoid placing them on a bed of ice. Oysters live only in saltwater. Anything containing fresh water can kill them., Place the oysters in a colander. Then, rinse them under a stream of cold running water. Scrub each shell with a scrub brush to remove any dirt or debris. Pay special attention to any creases, where debris can build up and slip inside the shell.

Oysters whose shells have opened have died in storage. Discard them., Hold the oyster in your non-dominant hand while you open the shell with your dominant hand. Wear a protective glove on the hand holding the oyster to protect it should your knife slip.Alternatively, you can place a clean hand towel on the counter or other flat surface. Put a cleaned oyster on the towel. Use another hand towel to hold the oyster steady as you prepare to open it., The hinge is the meeting point of the top and bottom side of the shell. This is where you'll insert the oyster knife. Look for a slight indentation between the top and bottom halves., Insert the tip of your oyster knife blade into the hinge. Jiggle the blade by rotating your wrist back and forth. Apply enough pressure to open the shell., Slide the blade between the body and the flat side of the shell. This will slice through the muscle that attaches the oyster to the shell. Then, remove the flat side. Repeat the process with the cup side of the shell.As you loosen the body, avoid spilling any liquid from the shell. This “oyster liquor” retains the original flavor of the meat., Place the oysters on a bed of crushed ice to keep them chilled. Make sure they're consumed within two hours to avoid spoilage and food poisoning. Serve with mignonette sauce, cocktail sauce, or grated horseradish., If you prefer to not eat raw oysters, there are a number of ways to cook them. You can steam, roast, or fry them. Serve them with Béchamel sauce or Tabasco sauce."

, With a small, sharp knife, cut across the fish, through the skin, behind the gills. The knife should reach the bones of the fish, but not cut through them.

, Find the flounder backbone, which runs down the middle of the fish from the gills to the tail. Cut along this line, from the center of the gills to the tail. Follow the backbone while cutting.

, Insert the tip of the knife under the skin, along the backbone. Slice from the gill to the tail, lifting the side of the fish that is coming loose. Keep lifting the fillet as it pulls away from the bone. Continuing cutting until the fillet is separated from the backbone. The flesh should remain attached at the tail.

, Once the top part of the fish has been filleted, make the same incisions under the flesh and next to the backbone, to pull the bottom part of the fish from the bones. Keep the fillets attached to the fish near the tail.

, Slide the knife between the skin and the meat of the fish and gently cut the flesh away from the skin. Hold onto the skin instead of the flesh during this process, as the skin is stronger.

, Perform the same steps of cutting and filleting on the other side of the fish.

, Once separated from the bone and the skin, the flounder has been cleaned and is ready for cooking and preparing. Four fillets should be taken from one average flounder.

Run the back of a butter knife along the body of the fish, working from the tail toward the head. As you scrape the knife along the body, you'll remove the scales. When you finish the first side, turn the salmon over and repeat on the other side until you’ve scraped off all the scales.


Rinse the salmon under running water to wash away any leftover scales.;
, With a filet knife, slice into the belly of the salmon from the tail to the lip. Gently open the belly, and use your hand to pull out the organs. If there are any organs that you can't easily remove, delicately slice them out with the knife.


Hold the clean belly open and rinse the fish under running water to remove blood., Use the filet knife to remove the head and pectoral fins from the salmon. Cut on a 45-degree angle from the head, around the back of the pectoral fin, and toward the belly of the fish to sever the head and fin from the body.To remove the remaining fins, use a sawing motion to slice the fins from the body. Cut from the tail toward the head.
Cut off the tail where it meets with the body of the fish.

, Use a large knife to cut the body of the salmon into inch-thick (2.5 cm) filets. You don’t have to worry about the bones in a salmon, as they will soften up during the smoking process.


Keep the thickness of the steaks as uniform as possible to ensure even curing and smoking.

, Before you smoke the salmon, it’s important to soak it in a brine solution that will help preserve the fish. Combine the brown sugar, white sugar, salt, and water in a large glass bowl and stir to combine. Place the salmon filets in the brine solution.


Transfer the bowl to the refrigerator and let the salmon cure in the brine for about an hour., Most canned salmon is smoked before it’s processed in the cans. This prevents food-borne illnesses and contamination, and ensures the fish will be properly preserved. To smoke the salmon, you'll need:


Clean towels
Kitchen scale
Smoker or a barbecue
Wood for smoking

, Remove the salmon from the brine solution and rinse it under running water to remove excess salt and sugar. Lay the fish on a clean towel and pat it dry. Place the fish somewhere cool and let it dry for about 30 minutes.

, The best way to determine proper smoking time for canned fish is to measure the amount of moisture lost during smoking. To do this, you must know the start and end weight of the fish. Place all the fish in a clean bowl and weigh it using a kitchen scale.Record the weight of the fish before you start the smoking process, and keep this number handy.
You don’t have to worry about measuring the weight of the bowl, as long as you use the same bowl later to measure the post-smoking weight.

, Light the charcoal in your smoker. Let the fire burn and embers form. When there's a good bed of embers and the temperature of the smoker is between 140 and 160 F (60 and 71 C), add the wood.


You'll know you have a good bed of embers when the coals are red hot and there are few to no flames.
A popular wood for smoking salmon is alder.You can also use a charcoal barbecue to smoke your fish if you don’t have a smoker.

, Lay each piece of salmon scale-side down on the racks of the smoker. Leave about an inch (2.5 cm) of space between each filet to allow air to circulate and the smoke to rise.When the smoker is ready, insert the racks with the salmon. Smoke the fish for about two hours.

, When two hours have elapsed, remove the salmon from the smoker. Transfer the fish to the bowl you used to weigh it originally. Weigh the smoked fish and record the weight. Ideally, you want a weight loss of about 12.5 percent. If the fish needs more time, return it to the smoker for another hour if necessary, then weigh it again.


To determine the weight that’s been lost, subtract the post-smoking weight from the starting weight. Divide that number by the original weight. Finally, multiply that number by 100 to get the percentage., To can salmon, you should only use half-pint or one-pint (200 or 250 ml) canning jars. Wash the jars, lids, and rings in hot, soapy water. Set everything aside to dry.For three pounds of salmon, you'll need roughly three pint jars or six half-pint jars.
You can buy canning jars at home stores, grocery stores, supermarkets, and departments stores.

, Use your finger to peel off as much skin from the salmon as possible. Pack the filets into a clean canning jar with the skin-side out. Fill each jar as much as possible, leaving an inch (2.5 cm) of head room at the top of each jar.Clean the rim of each jar with a clean towel.
Place a sealing lid on each jar, and then screw on a ring. Don’t tighten the rings too much, as these will tighten during canning.

, Arrange the jars on the canning rack and place the racks into the pressure canner. Cover the jars with water according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Place the lid on the canner, close the latch, and open the heat escape vent.Heat the canner over high heat and bring it to 11 pounds pressure.

, When the pressure canner reaches pressure, turn the heat down to medium or medium-high. Process the fish for 100 minutes.Keep an eye on the pressure to make sure it doesn’t drop below 11 pounds.


If the pressure does drop below 11 pounds, turn up the heat immediately until it returns to the right pressure.

, After 100 minutes, remove the canner from the heat and allow it to cool and the pressure to return to zero. Wait another two minutes, and then carefully remove the jars using a jar lifter or tongs. Set the jars on a heat-proof mat and allow them to cool for 24 hours.After 24 hours, test the seals by pushing each lid gently with your finger. If any seals move, it means the lid didn’t make a proper seal.
For jars that didn’t seal properly, you can process them again in the pressure canner for another 100 minutes at 11 pounds of pressure. Or, transfer that can to the refrigerator and eat the fish within a couple days.

You don’t need to use any soap or cleaning product to wash off the sand. All you need is water and friction., If you have too many clams to put them all into the colander or steamer basket, then you can split them into batches for cleaning.Grab a few towels or oven mitts to help you safely handle your clams.
If you don’t have a pot that’s large enough, then you can use a heat proof bowl.

, Bring your water to a rolling boil. You can leave it in the pot for the next step, or you can pour it into your heat proof bowl if you’re using one.While the amount of water doesn’t have to be exact, it’s best to use about 1 quart (1 liter) for every 15 clams.

, Completely submerge your clams to get them to open their shells. While they’re in the water, gently shift the colander back and forth to encourage the clams to open., The clams will have opened their shells with the meat exposed, but you need to cool them down quickly so that the meat doesn’t cook. Accidentally cooking the clam in the boiling water will ruin its texture and flavor.Have a bowl of cold water prepared and waiting for use before you insert the clams into the boiling water.

, You can use either cool or ice water to chill your clams. The cold water will prevent the clams from cooking improperly.Wait until your clams are completely cool before handling them to avoid burns.

, Use your hands to remove the clam meat. Place the clam meat into a clean container.If the clam is not completely detached, cut its four abductor muscles with a sharp knife., This is the tough part of the clam, so most people choose to slice it off. You will want to remove it as close to the tip as possible to preserve the meat., One side of the clam should have a sharp tooth-like texture that resembles a razor-blade or zipper. Follow along the razor-blade with your knife to open the meat., Spread the clam to reveal its inner parts. You can lay it on a cutting board or plate so that you can easily make your cuts as you remove the inedible parts of the clam.

If you are experienced in the kitchen, you may choose to hold the clam in your hand; however, doing so risks you cutting your hand. It’s best to use a hard surface instead.

, You will see the fleshy brown gills near the center of your clam. Use your knife to carefully detach them from the rest of the clam meat. Cut down below the gills and rinse thoroughly to remove any hidden sand.The gills are not dangerous to eat, but most people prefer to remove them before cooking them.
The mouth of the clam, called the palp, is in the same place as the gills. You will be removing these parts together if you scrape away all of the fleshy brown area., Look for the dark sack-like part of your clam, which is the stomach. Press the meat below the stomach to make it easier to cut it away.Use your knife to remove the stomach, which may take several passes with your blade. Rinse the area to remove the gunk that seeps out.Continue to cut and rinse until all of the dark stomach sludge is gone.

, Razor clams contain a crystalline style that allows them to break up their food, and you must remove it before eating the meat. While you’re cutting away the stomach, you should see the rod slide from inside the clam. If it doesn’t come away on it’s own, press the clam to push it out, then remove it with your fingers.Don’t mistake the crystalline style for a worm. It’s a natural part of the clam.
It will look like a piece of plastic., The digger looks like a long rectangular piece that extends from around the center of your clam. You can choose to first cut it away from the rest of the meat or to leave it attached for cooking, depending on your personal preferences or the directions in your recipe., Inside the foot you will see what looks like dark sludge. These are the intestines, which need to be cleared away. You can pluck them out or run your knife beneath them. Rinse the area until all you see is clean, white clam meat., Once you’ve cut away all of the innards, you’ll want to give your clams a final rinse. For best results, rinse them individually under your tap. Allow each clam a few seconds under the water., As you finish washing each clam, transfer it into your preparation dish. Continue until all of the clams are clean., After you’re done washing the clams, drain off any water that has accumulated in your dish., Proceed with your recipe or freeze your clams for later. You can always prepare part of the batch and save the rest.

If you want to freeze your clams, place them in a storage bag or container. Add a little water before putting it in the freezer.

The natural slime of the fish sticks to the newspaper, which helps it stay in place as you clean.Be absolutely sure that the sunfish is dead before you begin cleaning.;
, You can buy a fish scaler to remove the scales. If you don’t have a fish scaler, find a sharp knife with a serrated edge. You can use a knife to remove the scales and carry out the rest of the cleaning process.You can find a fish scaler at places like Bass Pro Shop, or at many supermarkets, like Walmart.

, Use your tool to begin removing the scales. Hold the fish with the hand you won’t be cutting with. Work from the tail to the head as you remove the scales. Slide the knife back and forth repeatedly, from the tail to head. You do not have to cut deeply. Continue to remove the scales until the skin is smooth., Locate the back of the gills on the fish. Insert the knife into this location. Continue to cut until the head comes off completely.The gill slits are located next to the pectoral fin on the side of the fish.

, Insert the knife into the belly of the sunfish. Slide the knife all the way back to the vent. Make sure to avoid the organs as you do this. Once you’ve made the cut, remove all of the organs.The vent will be next to the anal fin, near the back of the belly.
Save any fish roe (eggs) that you may find.
Dispose of the organs when you remove them.

, Use the knife to remove the fins and tail on the sunfish. You don’t have to make any special incisions to do this. Simply make a cut where the fins and tail begin. Dispose of the fins and tail when they have been removed.The fins you should remove are the dorsal fin, pectoral fin, anal fin, and caudal fin. The dorsal fin is located on top of the fish. The pectoral fin is located on the side of the sunfish. The pelvic and anal fins are beneath the fish. The caudal fin is essentially where the tail is., Make an incision behind the gill. Cut from the gill all the way down to the flank, which is along the side of the fish. Do not remove any meat just yet., Use your free hand to hold the fish firmly. Slice forward from the tail fin to the vent. This should be about a 1-2 inch (2.5 – 5 cm) cut. Cut cleanly to the bone., Start the the top of the fish. Slice along the spine of the fish. Cut all the way from the head to the tail. Once you’ve done that, begin to cut the meat away from the ribs., Once you’ve finished filleting the fish, rinse it off in water. Place the fish on ice. Keep it on ice until you are ready to cook it."

Choose fish that are high in omega-3 fatty acids.,
Eat clams and sardines to boost your B-12 levels.,
Avoid fish with high mercury levels.,
Eat 2-3 servings of wild-caught or sustainably farmed fish weekly.,
Consider sustainability.,
Check for advisories if you catch your own fish.",How to Choose and Prepare the Healthiest Fish1," Fish that contain high levels of omega-3 fatty acids are some of the healthiest seafood choices. Salmon, halibut, and sardines are all rich in omegas and delicious additions to your regular diet.Try grilling salmon or halibut and serving it with a side of vegetables.;
, Certain types of fish are high in vitamin B-12, which is a critical nutrient for all humans. To get the most out of your fish choices, opt for varieties that are high in vitamin B-12 like clams, sardines, anchovies, and salmon.Try broiling fresh clams topped with a little bit of butter for a wonderful dinner option.Eat some sardines as an easy, healthy snack at home or on the go.

, Mercury is harmful to your central nervous system. Certain types of fish contain high mercury levels and should be avoided. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency recommends completely avoiding king mackerel, marlin, orange roughy, shark, swordfish, tilefish, and bigeye tuna.It is especially important for women of childbearing age, pregnant and breastfeeding women, and young children to avoid fish that are high in mercury content., These choices should also be low in mercury. Some of the healthiest choices include Atlantic mackerel, wild-caught salmon, catfish, and sardines. Good shellfish choices include shrimp, oysters, American and spiny lobsters, and clams.A serving of fish or shellfish is 4 ounces for adults.
For children between 4 and 7 years old, a serving is 2 ounces.

, When you are deciding what types of fish and seafood to consume, you should think about sustainability and how your food choices affect the environment. Increasing demand for fish as well as unregulated fishing practices can harm fisheries and species that are at risk. Check out the Monterey Bay Aquarium Seafood Watch at www.seafoodwatch.org to choose seafood that has a minimal impact on the environment.Some sustainable seafood choices include farmed catfish, farmed mussels, wild-caught cod, and wild-caught clams.
Unsustainable seafood choices include Chilean seabass, orange roughy, shark, and Bluefin tuna.

, If you eat fish caught by family and friends, or if you catch the fish yourself, you should check local advisories. Contact your county or state fish and wildlife service and ask about fish advisories. If there is not an advisory, you should eat only one serving of the fish. You should eat no other fish in the same week that you eat the serving of local fish."

, If you are hosting the party outside, take weather into account. The party date will probably be too far in advance to check the forecast, but consider the time of day. If you live in an area where it rains every afternoon in the summer, host the party in the evening.

If you are afraid a rainshower might spoil your outdoor luau, it’s a good idea to plan some indoor-friendly party activities just in case.

, Pick bright, tropical colors to play into the luau theme! Lime green, turquoise, bright orange, and hot pink are all great options. You can go for a rainbow scheme, or opt for more specific tropical colors. Your color scheme will help you select decorations that match.For example, you might want to focus on pinks and oranges, or greens and blues.
When selecting a color scheme, consult your child or think about their favorite colors.

, Leis are colorful Hawaiian necklaces made of flowers, and sometimes shells, seeds, and feathers. They are a symbol of affection and are often worn at celebrations.Spread the luau spirit by purchasing plastic or fabric leis in bulk from you local party supply store.Leis can double as a decoration and a party favor! Hang leis on tables and chairs for an instant luau feel, and give leis to kids as they arrive so everyone looks festive!

, Bright flowers and green plants create a tropical Hawaiian atmosphere. Depending on your budget and preferences, you can purchase live plants or synthetic ones. Put the plants on counters, chairs, and tables to turn your home or pool deck into a Hawaiian getaway., A bowl of assorted tropical fruits makes a beautiful centerpiece, and can double as a party snack! Try coconut, kiwi, lime, mangoes, and citrus fruits., Grass table skirts can completely transform your tables. Simply attach the skirt to the rim of your table according to the directions on the package. Many skirts have an adhesive backing. You can purchase grass table skirts at your local party supply store., To have a party, you’ll need to invite your child’s friends! Parents should make the guest list for kids under 4. Think about family friends and friends from school who you’d like to invite. Children over 4 should probably be given a say in making the guest list., You can buy luau-themed invitations from your local party store, or you can try your hand at making them! Depending on the size of your guest list, making invitations may not be feasible.Invitations should include the time, date, and location of the party. Don’t forget to mention any special details! For your luau-themed party, you might want to direct children to bring their swimsuits.

, Go for colorful, tropical invitations decorated with flip flops, flowers, or ocean waves. If you are buying your invitations, consider using Hawaiian postcards.

If you decide on homemade invitations, flip-flop-shaped invitations made from construction paper are a cute, easy option. Print the invitation text on colored cardstock, then trace and cut out a flip-flop shape. You can find stencils online and print them. Glue on a silk flower for extra flair.The possibilities are limitless. You could make flower-shaped invitations, or even attach invitations to a lei! Visit party planning websites or blogs for more ideas., You should give the guests enough time to plan ahead, but not so much time that they forget about the event. Send out invitations at least two weeks, but no more than four weeks, before your party., You can cook the food for your party, or hire a catering service. If you have a large number of people attending your party, cooking may not be feasible. On the other hand, if you are not planning to serve a lot of food or the party is small, cooking can be a fun and cost effective option., Do you want to serve a full meal at your luau party, or would you rather serve only snacks? It’s entirely up to you. For shorter parties, cake and ice cream may be the only refreshment needed., The food at your Hawaiian luau-themed party doesn't need to be completely authentic. Hawaiian food is full of fruity and tropical flavors, so focus on incorporating those into traditional party foods.Try a tropical fruit salad, mango ice cream, or pineapple salsa and chips!

, A roast pig, or Kalua pua'a, is the central dish of the traditional Hawaiian Luau. It is usually seasoned with sea salt and green onions, and baked in an underground oven.Roasting an entire pig is probably a little ambitious for a children’s party, especially since kids are picky eaters, but you can opt for easier, party-friendly pork dishes inspired by the traditional Hawaiian dish.


Serve a ham baked with pineapple rings, or pulled pork sandwiches on Hawaiian sweet buns. You could even order a Hawaiian pizza for extra picky eaters!

, Whether you are making the food are having the party catered, finger foods are great options for a luau party, where kids will likely be grabbing food quickly as they play. Plus, you’ll save on plastic cutlery.

Kabobs are easy and tropical. Try making fruit kabobs or ham and pineapple kabobs.Pizza and sandwiches are simple and versatile.
Ocean-themed candy and snacks go well with a Hawaiian luau party, and are easy to buy in bulk! Try Swedish Fish candy or Goldfish crackers., Cold drinks are luau must-have, especially if you are hosting the party outside on a hot day. Stock up on water, but consider serving other beverages as well, especially ones fruity ones! Fruit smoothies and juices are great.

Garnish your beverages with slices of oranges, paper umbrellas, and colorful straws.Look online for tons of fun non-alcoholic drink recipes. You might even want to serve some tropical cocktails for your fellow parents.You may want to set up a “bar,” where kids and adults alike can go to get fruity drinks!

, For many kids, the cake is the focal point of the party.Buy or bake a cake that fits with the luau theme. It should be colorful and beachy. Cakes shaped like flip-flops, fish, or sand castles are sure to delight partygoers.

When buying a cake, consider allergies and the number of guests. You may need to buy 2 cakes for especially large luaus!

, The activities you plan for your party should depend on the average age of the children attending. For younger kids, you should plan simpler activities, and if you’re hiring performers, keep the performances short.If you are hosting your party at a pool, the water may provide all the entertainment you need, particularly for younger children.

, Planning the party activities for your luau party can be simple: just tweak classic party games to fit the theme.

Play hot potato using a tropical fruit, like a mango or a coconut, as the ""hot potato."" Or, play ring toss using leis as rings. Have players try to loop the leis around mini tiki torches.Buy a beachy pinata that fits with the luau theme, and fill it with tropical candy, like fruit gummies, Swedish fish, and citrus-flavored starbursts. Blindfold each child, and let him or her take a swing at breaking it open!

, Hula is a traditional Hawaiian dance, and is considered one of Hawaii’s oldest traditions.Turn on some Hawaiian music and have a dance contest, or hire a hula instructor to teach the kids.

Consider providing hula skirts so kids can wear them as they dance. These can double as party favors!

, Limbo is a classic island game in which participants bend backwards and dip under a bar without touching it. Those who touch the bar are “out.”The bar moves lower and lower, and the last player standing wins. This fun party game requires minimal supplies. Just turn on some Hawaiian tunes, find a limbo stick, and play!No need to buy a limbo stick--a broomstick works just fine.

, A hula hoop competition is a simple and fun luau party activity for older kids. Have the kids compete to see who can hula hoop the longest, and don’t forget to play Hawaiian music., Lei-making is a simple craft that even preschool-aged children can do with a little help from their parents. Provide string and assorted fabric flowers with holes punched in the middle. Kids can select their favorite flowers and string them together to make custom leis.If you want, you can purchase beads and shells for kids to add to their leis.
You can let older children use construction paper to cut out their own flower designs. Provide a few different flower stencils and let them get creative.Kids can take these DIY leis home as party favors!

Buy fresh fish displayed on ice that is not melting.,
Choose fresh whole fish with clear eyes, firm flesh, and bright red gills.,
Select fresh fish fillets that are not discolored and do not smell fishy.,
Buy fresh shrimp that is translucent.,
Do a tap test on live shellfish.,
Avoid cracked shellfish.,
Make sure live crabs and lobsters move their legs.,
Pay attention to package indicators on refrigerated fish and seafood.,
Exercise caution with frozen fish and seafood.,
Read the ingredient labels.",How to Choose and Prepare the Healthiest Fish2," When you purchase fresh seafood, it is important that it has been kept at a proper temperature. This reduces the risk of foodborne illness, which is often referred to as food poisoning. Fresh seafood should be refrigerated in a case and displayed on thick ice that is not melting., Fresh whole fish should have clear eyes that slightly bulge. The flesh should be firm and shiny, and should spring back when you press it lightly with your finger. Look for fish with bright red gills. The gills should not have milky slime in them., If you are purchasing fresh fish fillets, the flesh should be firm and it should not be discolored. You should avoid fish fillets that appear dried out or dark around the edges. Like whole fish, the flesh of fish fillets should spring back when pressed. The fish also should not smelly overly fishy., Fresh shrimp should have flesh that is translucent, or slightly clear. The flesh of fresh shrimp should also be shiny. You should avoid shrimp that have a strong odor. Instead, opt for fresh shrimp that have little or no odor., If you are buying live clams, oysters, or mussels, you should tap their shells first. They should close up when you tap them. If they do not close up after the tap test, you should avoid buying them., When purchasing fresh or live shellfish, you should not select ones that have a cracked or broken shell. If you purchase a package of fresh shellfish that contains individuals with cracked or broken shells, you should throw those clams, oysters, or mussels away immediately., If a crab or lobster is alive, it should show at least some leg movement. Crabs and lobsters spoil very quickly after they die. This means you should only purchase and prepare live crabs and lobsters., Sometimes refrigerated seafood is packaged. These packages might have time and temperature indicators on them to display whether the seafood has been stored properly. If the package has indicators on it, make sure you check them and only buy the seafood if it has been stored properly., Frozen fish and seafood can spoil easily if it thaws or is left at warm temperatures for too long while being transported. Avoid packages that are open or crushed on the edges, or torn. You should also avoid packages in the top of a freezer case or that have signs of frost or ice crystals., There are many fish products that have unhealthy additives. For example, fish sticks can contain transfats and preservatives. Make sure you read all ingredient labels carefully, and opt for fish that have minimal additional ingredients.

Thaw frozen fish and seafood safely.,
Remove skin and visible fat.,
Grill or broil your fish instead of frying.,
Cook fish for 8-10 minutes for each inch of thickness.,
Cook to an internal temperature of 145 degrees Fahrenheit or 63 degrees Celsius.",How to Choose and Prepare the Healthiest Fish3," The safest way to thaw frozen fish and seafood is in the refrigerator. Place it your refrigerator and allow it to thaw overnight. If you are in a hurry, you can place frozen fish and seafood in cold water as long as it is sealed in a plastic bag., You can help reduce your potential exposure to contaminants commonly found in fish by removing the skin and any visible fat before you cook the fish. You should also avoid using fat from fish for gravy or sauces as it may contain contaminants like mercury, dioxin, or PCBs., If you cook your fish on a grill or broiler grate, fat inside the fish filet will drip away. Fat is where chemicals like mercury, dioxin, and PCBs are stored in a fish. Grilling or broiling fish can help remove these harmful chemicals from the fish. It will also reduce the amount of fat and calories in your serving of fish.Try marinating salmon in teriyaki sauce and grilling it for 8 minutes on each side.Try broiling catfish and serving it with fresh tomato and corn salsa., You should bake, poach, broil, or grill fish for 10 minutes per each inch of thickness. This means if the fish fillet is 2 inches thick, you should bake or broil it for about 20 minutes total., Whether you bake, broil, fry, or grill your fish and seafood, you should always make sure the internal temperature reaches 145 degrees Fahrenheit or 63 degrees Celsius."

Keep the Birthday Bash Small.,
Pick a Theme.,
Pick an Inexpensive Venue.,
Consider the Food Issue.,
Make the Cake, (or decorate a pre-made grocery store one) .,
Get Crafty!,
Balloons are inexpensive and fun.,
Make goodie bags.,
...Or not.,
Make the games.","How to Throw a Great, Cheap Party for Your Child"," Usually between 5-10 kids is plenty. Some people go by the rule: as many children as the birthday child's age.;
, Having a theme to work with can help guide your party planning. While not strictly necessary, it's fun and can lead to creative party decorations, games, and food. Some ideas:


Pink party: Recommended for girls. All decorations, food, drinks, and so forth are pink. Guests are invited to wear pink.
Pizza party: Highlight is make-your-own pizza. Games can include pin-the-mushroom-on the pizza (a spin on pin-the-tail-on-the-donkey). Turn your home into a pizza parlor and play Italian music!
Pool Party: Great for active kids, and appeals to a lot of kids. Guests each get a beach ball as a favor.
Spa Day: Great for older pre-teen or teen girls, guests are invited to bring bathrobes. Play soft New Age music, make facial scrubs, do pedicures and paint each others nails. Food can be light cuisine such as fruit, salad, and sushi. Use Asian-inspired decorations such as bamboo.
Foreign Land. Exotic locales can be inspirational: Texas, Japan, Paris, Ancient Egypt, Hawaii, Hollywood, New York, New Orleans...all of these lend to special menus, activities, and games.

, Save a lot of money by looking for low or no cost party locations. Such as:


Your house, or possibly a friend or relative.
Library (Many have community rooms that are free or low cost)
Place of Worship. Many churches, temples, and the like have meeting space that can work for a party.
Local park. Sometimes you have to pay to use a shelter, gazebo, picnic area, beach, or entrance fee. However, it is often less expensive than other choices and may offer amenities such as tennis, swimming, recreational fields, natural areas, and more. Be sure to schedule in advance!

, The largest expense of a party tends to be food and drink. It is also easy to under-estimate, as you also have to consider if you need additional napkins, cups, plastic utensils, and so on. Some things to consider:


Dessert party: Keep it to cake or cupcakes, ice cream, milk, juice or soda. For a birthday party, kids focus on cake anyway.
Potluck: all guests bring a favorite dish. This cuts down significantly on cost and can sidestep dietary issues.
Frugal Meals: Some foods such as spaghetti is inexpensive while still a crowd favorite. Sandwiches, pizza, chili, hamburgers, hot dogs, and stews are also cost effective if made at home.
Make from (near) scratch. Buying pizza can add up, but you can save a lot of money by making your own, if you're a good cook.

, If your little one is fond of a cartoon or TV character, go to the dollar or bargain store and look for a small toy you can add on the cake. Otherwise, be creative and create a free hand design on top. You can use food coloring to change the color of the icing. Some examples:


A monster truck themed cake.Dye the frosting green, and use crushed chocolate cookies to make a track on top. Buy a small pack of cheap cars and crush them with a hammer, set them on the cake and put a nice monster truck to put on top to make it look as though the cars have been crushed by the monster truck.
Princess cake: Frost a pink cake, and decorate with small princess figurines and roses.
Rainbow Cake: Make colored layer cake, frost with white frosting, cover with colorful candies.

, Instead of buying all the decorations for the party, try making a few. If you have children, likely you already have craft supplies.


Small, inexpensive packets of construction paper or craft foam can be turned into paper chains, banners, signs of any color combo you want. Plus, your child can help make them and give them control of aspects of the celebration.
Fold hats out of newspaper and have the kids decorate them at the party.
Make a banner from a large sheet of paper, and use poster paint to write letters. Use it as a guest book for when people arrive. Or use a plain sheet with a magic marker. Your child will have it to sleep with and all of his or her friends can draw on it at the party.
Autograph a pillowcase. Using fabric markers or permanent markers, put a piece of cardboard in the pillowcase, and have guests autograph the pillowcase.

, Dollar stores often offer them very inexpensively with helium. Regular balloons may not float, but are terrific for colorful and easy decoration.


Put confetti in your balloons for a special touch.
Hang one from the ceiling with candy in it and draw names for it when the party is about to end as a prize. Or everyone gets one as a ""goodie bag'.
You can take permanent markers and write messages on balloons for a personal touch.
Balloons are also fun for games such as relay races, volleyball games (good for small kids), and water balloon toss or fights.

, Buy things at the dollar or bargain store. Go for the party packets and toys where you get more than one item. Look for such items as stickers, cars, candy, etc.

, All too often, goodie bags end up as a collection of cheap plastic toys and candy. Even at the dollar store, these items can add up quickly--surprisingly so! Get a bit creative. Perhaps guests can go home with a bandanna from the cowgirl party. Or a garden party can end with the guests taking home flowers for their own homes.

, If necessary, make up games as well. Even half a croquet set can be used to make a mini golf course that is a mix between golf and a demo derby (give points for knocking someone's ball, and deduct points if you miss the ball you aim for). Other great ideas include pass the parcel, musical chairs, drawing shapes around bodies on large pieces of blank paper etc. Visit the library to borrow books on party


Don't forget to clean up the mess"
"
Insert the tip of your knife into the exit hole.,
Cut the trout up through the belly.,
Use your knife to pierce the underside of the jaw.,
Slice through the jaw towards the mouth.",How to Clean Trout for Cooking1," Hold the trout by its dorsal edge and turn it over to expose the belly. You’ll find the exit hole near the tail end of the fish just under the lower fins. Point the blade toward the head, then slide it in smoothly.To dress a fish quickly and efficiently, it’s important to use a sharp filleting knife that offers a little flexibility. This will allow you to make more precise cuts.You’ll be exposed to blood, excrement and other bodily tissues while cleaning trout. It's a good idea to wear rubber gloves to protect you from germs.;
, Run the knife along the length of the fish, stopping just before you reach the head. This cut doesn’t need to be very deep—just apply enough pressure to get through the soft skin on the underbelly without damaging the internal organs.Be extremely careful when handling the knife, as you’ll be cutting in the direction of your opposite hand.
Keeping the organs intact while you open the belly will make them easier to remove later on.

, Hold the trout upright and stick the blade of the knife straight through the jaw beneath the lower “lip.” Keep pushing it until it comes out the other side. The blade should be situated above the tongue but below the jawbone itself.Be sure to start on the side closest to you so you’re moving the blade away from yourself.
Use a slight back and forth motion to help work the blade through the tough skin around the jaw.

, Push the blade forward until it cuts clean through the tissue of the jaw. There should now be a small flap hanging down beneath the mouth of the trout. You’ll use this opening as a fingerhold to strip away the entrails.If you’re working with a knife that doesn’t offer quite as much dexterity, you can also cut partway through the backbone and remove both the head and intestines at the same time."

Hook your finger through the jaw.,
Strip the intestines in one smooth motion.,
Scrape out the blood line.,
Remove the head, tail and scales.,
Rinse out the trout thoroughly.",How to Clean Trout for Cooking2," Turn the trout so that its head is pointed upwards, belly facing you. Insert one finger into the mouth and down through the jaw flap you just opened. Pinch the jawbone between your thumb and forefinger.Watch out for any sharp, pointy teeth you might encounter inside the mouth of the trout.

, Grip the jawbone firmly with your finger, then pull down as you hold the fish securely with your other hand. The entire lower jaw and abdomen should come free in one piece, taking the intestines with it.Remove the intestines carefully to avoid tearing them or damaging the rest of the fish.
Using the jawbone method can save you the trouble of having to dig out the entrails by hand., Spread the belly of the trout open. Inside, you should see a dark red line sitting in the groove behind the backbone. Drag the tip of your finger along this groove to clear out the black gunk inside. You may need to pull the connective tissue free in places where it's more firmly attached.You can also use an old toothbrush or similar utensil to break up the membrane holding the blood line in place.Don’t neglect to remove the blood line. Most fishing experts agree that leaving it in negatively affects the flavor of the cooked fish.

, Proceed to cut off the head just behind the gill vent and the tail around where you made the initial incision at the exit hole. Rake the outside of the fish from head to tail with the edge of a knife or spoon to scrape off the scales, then peel away the skin starting at one corner.Alternatively, you can cook the trout whole, then deal with the inedible parts once it’s soft and pliable.You should always remove the scales, even if you’re planning on cooking and eating the fish with the skin on., Run a stream of cool water into the body cavity to flush away any remaining blood, tissue and other material. Set the trout aside on a layer of folded paper towels to absorb excess water until you’re ready to cook it or put it away.To really sanitize the fish, scrub it inside and out with distilled white vinegar, using a small soft-bristled brush."

Cut the fillets free from the backbone.,
Trim the fillets at the top and bottom.,
Remove the pinbones.",How to Clean Trout for Cooking3," Lay the trout flat against the cutting board with the backbone facing towards you. Run the blade of your knife all the way along the spine. Set the first fillet aside, then flip the fish over and repeat on the opposite side.Cut using long, smooth strokes with the knife rather than short, jagged ones. This will make the resulting fillets come away cleaner with less wasted meat.
Press down on the fish with your non-cutting hand to help hold it place while you work the first fillet free.

, There will likely be traces of fat and cartilage clinging to either edge of the fillets where they were attached to the belly and backbone. To get rid of these bits, point the tip of the knife downwards against the cutting board and trace along the outline of the extra tissue. Carefully cut away any tissue you find that isn't usable meat.The white fat and cartilage will usually stand out against the darker meat of the trout.
These tissues tend to be tough and chewy, even after cooking, and can ruin the velvety texture of the trout if not properly trimmed.

, Using a pair of tweezers, go through and pluck out each of the tiny pinbones, or the ribs of the trout. Push down gently on the meat around the bones to expose the tip, then get a good grip and tug until the entire bone slides out. If you wait until after you've filleted the trout to extract the bones, they'll no longer be anchored in place and shouldn't give you any trouble.Pull out the pinbones in the direction they run through the fillet (not straight up) to prevent them from breaking accidentally.If you don't have a pair of tweezers on hand, you can also use another thin, pointed tool, such as needle-nosed pliers or the tines of a fork.

Keep the fish on ice.,
Watch out for parasites.,
Store trout in the refrigerator or freezer.",How to Clean Trout for Cooking4," After reeling in your fresh catch, place it in an ice-filled cooler immediately. The trout needs to stay cold in order to slow down decomposition. Make sure the cooler you bring along with you is large enough to accommodate a large haul.Drain the cooler periodically and repack it with fresh ice—soaking in water for too long will dull the flavor of the fish.
On all-day outings, you can also keep the trout alive by pulling it alongside the boat on a stringer or transferring it a large container full of fresh water., Certain species of freshwater fish have been known to harbor parasites, which can be harmful if ingested. Inspect the body cavity and meat of the trout closely before you cook and eat it. Most visible parasites look like tiny worms or insects, and may be found on the inside or outside of the fish.Disposing of the skin and intestines will eliminate the majority of parasites, while making sure the fish is properly cooked will take care of the rest.
Not all parasites can be seen with the naked eye. To minimize health risks, cook the trout for at least five minutes at 140°F (60°C) or higher., Wrap the dressed trout in plastic or wax paper and stash it one of the lower drawers in the refrigerator. Refrigerated trout should stay at a temperature of 32°F (0°C) or below, while frozen fish needs to be kept at right around 0°F (-17°C). No matter how you decide to store your catch, the sooner you eat it, the better it will taste.Try to consume fresh trout within two to three days of refrigeration. Frozen trout will typically stay good for three to six months, or in some cases up to a full year.A vacuum sealer can be a wise investment if you tend to freeze your fresh catch regularly."

Pick a theme with your child.,
Nail down the specifics.,
Get invitations (that match the theme!).,
Buy decorations.",How to Organize a Birthday Party for Kids1," Though it may seem unnecessary, having a theme will help you know what decorations to buy, what food to prepare, and what games to plan. Character parties are popular (think Sponge Bob or Scooby-Doo), but general themes work, too (pirates, fairies, princesses, cowboys, etc.). Unless they want something that just isn't appropriate, allow them creative freedom. Sit down with your child at the table with a pen and paper and write down all the ideas you both like.






Some themes will obviously be more difficult than others. Go with your child to a couple of party stores and see what's available or go online. It'll be easiest to pick a theme based on what you have at your disposal. Most parents aren't Martha Stewart; you certainly don't have to be.;
, There are a few questions you'll have to address: When is the party going to be? How long will it last? Where is it going to be? Is there anything going on communally or culturally that would prevent other children from coming? What time of day works into your schedule?






Take your child's age into account. Generally, the younger the child, the earlier the party. You do not have to entertain all day--a few hours is more than sufficient. If you're not having it at home, consult the desired venue to see what times are available.

, Once you have them picked out, it's time to finalize the details. Check your schedule to make sure there are no girl scouts or work meetings during the time you're thinking. On the invitation, put the start and end times, address, what each child should bring (swimsuit, etc.) and if there will be a meal so parents can plan accordingly.






As for guests, a good rule of thumb is the child's age plus 1.And if parents can come along, great! It's best to have a couple others to help with monitoring and clean up.
Have your invitations in the theme of your party. The other children will probably get excited, too. Your child can hand them out at school (if possible to do it discreetly) or you can give them to the parents if your child is too young (or forgetful!).

Your child shouldn't hand them out in front of those not invited -- it might make the others feel bad. Give them to the teacher to put in the take home folder or have your child put them in desks or lockers.



, For everything from table cloths to pinatas, a party store is your best bet -- or else you'll end up bouncing around town for days looking to piece it all together. And if they don't have a specific something, ask! They may be able to order it for you.






It's always an option to make your own if you're DIY handy. And your child can always help if you want someone to blame the poor penmanship on! As an alternative idea, a few children can come over a bit earlier to make decorations themselves, if they'd like.

"

Plan some games.,
Make party favors interactive.,
Plan the party food.,
Plan the party drinks.,
Plan the goodbye.",How to Organize a Birthday Party for Kids2," These are the building blocks of a good child's party, so start thinking up craft projects, look into renting an entertainer, or utilize the facilities at an outside venue. Look in your phone book or online for party rentals or places near you. For younger kids, have a loose schedule to keep things running.






Don't be afraid to go super theme-oriented. If you're having a Wild West party, have them pan for gold in the sandbox. Conduct a scavenger hunt with theme-related clues and a final prize.
Don't be afraid to go super simple. Nowadays, kids aren't playing the old school games they could be. Instead of having them all plop down in front of the Wii, have them Capture the Flag, play Red Rover, Blind Man's Bluff, or have relay races.
For older children, have more free time. The older the child, the less structured the party should be. Kids will likely want to do their own thing at one point or another. If they express this, don't stress. More free time for you and the other parents!

, Instead of giving them a bag of small toys that will get played with for three minutes and then shoved in a drawer, have them make the party favors themselves! The kids will feel more involved and like they were a part of the party.






They could make potato print t-shirts, simple masks, jewelry, fishing rods, badges -- the list goes on and on and on. This requires a bit more forethought, but will pay off in the long run.

You could have this be the first activity -- so children that come earlier have something to busy themselves with while the others slowly file in. Any late arriving child can take the necessary materials home with them if they'd like.


Let the kids take home the decorations. This is an easy and quick idea if you have something with a general theme, like princesses or baseball. And it allows for minimal clean up!

, When it comes to parties, one thing is timeless: cake. Will you bake one or buy one? Or two?! Cupcakes are easy and super trendy as well. Whatever you choose, either get the order in early or go grocery shopping for the ingredients ahead of time. Make the food theme oriented, too!






Despite what logic dictates, cake isn't enough. You'll need food food too -- make it easy on yourself and get some pizzas delivered or get a fast food restaurant or catering company to take care of everything. Finger sandwiches and lunch bags with sandwiches and fruit or cookies are great choices, too.
If it's a nice day outside and you have a grill, kids love hot dogs and hamburgers. Don't forget the buns, mustard, and ketchup!
If there will be other parents or adults attending and watching over the kids, have food for them, too. They may not be so keen on chicken nuggets and Sprite.

, Soda pop, lemonade, and juice are all pretty standard. And if you'll be outside a lot, a cooler filled with bottles of water or cans of soda will surely be appreciated, especially if it's hot outside. And, of course, milk goes great with cake. If it's autumn or winter, have the kids play outside and come in for cider to warm them up.






Have glasses (and cutlery in general) that are safe for the kids to use. Things may get broken -- so don't break out your fine china. Be prepared for a mess.

, Give the other parents your cell phone number on the off chance they're running late, early, or sending someone else to pick up their child. Establish protocol for the safety of every child.






As the child leaves, take note. Have them say goodbye to everyone, gather their things, their party favor, and mentally check them off their list. Never let the child leave on their own or with an adult you don't recognize.

Choose inexpensive party favors.",How to Plan a Cheap Children's Birthday Party," Before you decide the specifics of a party, like what to serve or who to invite, you'll need to choose a location for the party. If you're sticking to a budget, you'll want to find a venue that is either free or very low-cost.If you're throwing a relatively small party, you can host it at your home or in your backyard. If the party will be too big for your home or yard, try booking a picnic area in your local park.;
, Regardless of where you decide to have the party, you'll want to decorate the venue. This will help customize the space, ideally to make it unique to your child's interests and hobbies.Rather than paying a professional decorator, you can find and display your own decorations at a relatively low cost.


Instead of tablecloths, you can buy a cheap roll of plain white paper and drape big sheets over the tabletops. Then leave crayons out for the kids to draw and doodle on the paper. It won't cost much, and it will add a fun element of creativity to the party.Balloons are fairly cheap, even if you buy them with helium from the store.Decorate the tables with small, low-cost party favors. You can leave a small bowl of individually-wrapped candy at the center of the table, or put out a small bushel of freshly-picked apples for guests to take home.If your child wants a theme birthday party, you can make things simple by buying plates and napkins with that theme's design on them. You can also cut costs by buying balloons and napkins that are the color of your theme - for example, red and blue for a Spiderman party, or teal blue for a Frozen party., Another easy way to cut costs for the party is by making your own invitations. You can use recycled paper on hand, or for even greater savings per project, try sending out an e-vite to the party.You can find free templates and sample invitations online. Search for ""party invitations"" to find examples of easy party invitation templates.

, If you're trying to plan a party on a budget, the reality of the situation is that you may need to invite fewer people. Each extra kid who's invited will require additional food and drinks, plus any party favors or supplies for activities you have planned. If you're worried about hurt feelings from your child's peers, consider inviting only friends and classmates, rather than leaving the invitation open to siblings or other outside friends.For infants, it's best to stick to family members and/or close friends. No two year old is going to remember how many people were at a party, and the smaller, more-intimate setting will make it feel more like a family get-together.If the child is in preschool, a general rule for the number of other kids to invite is the child's age plus one. So, for example, if your child is three or four years old, invite four or five other kids from preschool.For older kids, it's more a question of how many classmates your child is actually friends with, and how many people you can reasonably accommodate (in terms of space and cost). However, if you do invite several classmates, you'll want to avoid sending invitations to all but one or two kids, as this will alienate the uninvited kids and may cause tension., If your child's birthday falls around the same time as one of your other kids' birthdays (or a friend/classmate's birthday), consider combining the two parties into one bigger party. You'll then be able to split the cost of the party with the other parent (if it's a friend's birthday), or at least consolidate the costs instead of having two parties (for siblings).Ask around among your friends' parents to find out when their children's birthdays fall. You can bring up the idea of combining parties casually. Say something like, ""Our child's birthday is only a short while before/after. Would you be interested in combining the two parties together and having one big party?"" Just make sure the other parent isn't planning anything too extravagant that would break your budget.

, Instead of paying for the party to be catered, try making your own food (if you feel up to the challenge). Baking your own cake will save quite a bit of money right off the bat, and you can offer simple party snacks like chips and dip, pretzels, and small sandwiches or deli plates.If you don't feel up to doing all the food on your own, consider asking your close friends or family members if they'd be willing to help make a dish or two for the party.It may be best to avoid asking the parents of your guests, however, as you don't want them to feel they must bring something in order to attend.
You can also opt for something relatively low-cost, like a sheet pizza and wings.
For soda and juice, go with off-brand or generic beverages. Kids won't taste the difference between brand-name soda and off-brand soda, and it will save you quite a bit on supply costs.

, Rather than hiring a party entertainer by the hour, you can teach yourself some magic tricks or balloon shapes and provide your own entertainment.If you want to encourage an outdoor outing (weather permitting), you may want to look into having the birthday party at a nearby park, or organizing a nature walk after everyone's had cake. Look for parks and guided nature walks online to find a wilderness area near you., You can organize a board game tournament, or have the kids play traditional party games that are easy to organize on a budget. Some classic examples include pin-the-tail-on-the-donkey and musical chairs.You can also organize a bean bag toss or a game of Simon Says.Another cheap and easy game is building an obstacle course in the backyard. You can use materials you already have, or opt for low-cost obstacles like hula-hoops and jump ropes. Just be sure that everything you use in the obstacle course is safe and will not cause any potential injuries.You can also organize easy-to-play games like kickball or capture the flag. These games are fun and will cost virtually nothing to buy supplies for., If your budget doesn't have much room for entertainment, consider choosing a variety of DIY projects or crafts for the kids to participate in at the party. That will keep them busy and engaged, and it will allow them to work together on a common project.One fun example of a DIY project involves using crayons or non-permanent markers to draw on cardboard to make a play castle or doll house. All you'll need is some cardboard (from moving boxes or a large refrigerator box, for example) and drawing materials.You can also use more traditional projects, like finger painting. Or look online for cheap and easy children's craft projects.Look into children's craft classes at a local or chain craft store, like Michaels. They often have free or low-cost (approximately $5 per child) craft classes, which could be a fun birthday outing, if your party list is small enough., Instead of buying expensive party favors, fill a paper or plastic bag with candy and stickers to give out as party favors. If your budget allows it, you may want to get one or two more expensive toys and hold a raffle to see which kid gets the big gift.If you want to get toys for the party favors, look around online to find toys you can buy in bulk. Some large-quantity toy orders, like plastic figurines, can be bought by the pound at certain outlets."

Get some colorful paper.,
Cut your paper into a circle.,
Cut a small triangular strip out of one side of the circle.,
Create a cone shape by folding one side of the cutout over the other.,

Cut a row of small triangles from the top of your paper to make crown points.,
Overlap one end of the paper over the other to make a circular crown.,
Tape, staple, or glue the ends of paper together, creating a seam.,
Decorate your party crown.",How to Make a Party Hat," This will be the main color of your party hat, so choose whatever you like.


You can use construction paper you have at home, or buy some tagboard paper. Tagboard is a little thinner than poster board, and closer to the thickness of a traditional party hat.If you want to get really creative, buy some patterned or textured paper.;
, For an adult’s hat, the circle should be about 10 inches in diameter, and for a child’s hat, the circle should be about 9 inches in diameter.


You can use a pencil and paper plate to trace a perfect circle onto your paper before cutting.Make your hat taller or shorter by cutting a larger or smaller circle into the paper. For example, to make a really large, tall hat by cutting a circle 12 inches or larger in diameter. To make a smaller hat (for a pet or doll), cut a circle about 6 inches in diameter.
When cutting the circle, try to stay as close as possible to the line you've drawn so you won’t have any jagged edges.

, The cutout should be wider at the bottom and taper into the center of the circle.


To find the center of the circle, fold your circle evenly in half top to bottom, lightly crease it, and unfold it. Then fold your circle evenly in half left to right, lightly crease it, and unfold again. There should now be a small point in the middle, which marks the center of your circle.

, One side of the paper should overlap the other side, making a seam.


You can make the cone as wide or as narrow as you want, but remember that it should be big enough to fit on your head.
The tighter you pull the cone together, the taller and thinner your hat will appear.

, This will create the base of your party hat.


Use a glue stick or liquid glue if you want a clean seam. Hold the two pieces together for a minute or two so the glue sticks.
Tape or staples will be more visible, but will take less time.
You can also tape the seam using colorful washi tape for a little extra decoration.

, You will be tying string to these holes, so punch them into the bottom of the hat on either side.


To figure out where to punch the holes, place the hat on your head like you'll wear it when you’re finished. Use a pencil to make dots a little bit in front of where your ears are, and then punch a hole in each dot.
Reinforce the holes using paper reinforcement rings. These can be found at any office supply store, and come in a wide range of colors.
You can also reinforce the holes by placing a layer or two of clear tape on top of them, and then re-punching the holes through the clear tape.

, Cut one foot of string or elastic, and tie each end to the hole punches in a small knot. The strap will go under your chin to help keep the hat on your head.


If you want to be more precise with the strap length, hold a longer piece of the elastic or string to each side of your head so you’ll know the exact length to cut.
Use ribbon instead of string or elastic if you want a fancier chin strap.

, Use lace, ribbon, colorful paper, or any other material to add a decorative border to the bottom of your hat. Adhere the border to your hat using tape, glue, or staples.


The border will cover up the two chin strap holes, keeping the string in place and hiding the small knots.
Make the border look however you want it to look! You can tape on waves of lace, glue on a straight piece of ribbon, or staple some fringed paper to the bottom of the hat.

, This will allow you to decorate your hat with glitter.


Brush the glue all over your hat, or just paint little strips of glue here and there.
You can also use a glue stick if you want a little less mess.

, Pour the glitter on while the glue is still tacky, then let the glitter dry for 2-3 minutes.


You can use any color of glitter you want.
Tap off the extra glitter so you don’t shower glitter all over the place when you’re wearing your hat.

, Finish off your party hat with any embellishments or details you like.


Add a ball of yarn to the top if you want, or glue on some tassels.
The fun of making your own party hat is decorating it however you like, so get creative!

, The party crown is a fun alternative for the partygoer who prefers a more royal head topper.


At a birthday party, you can even make a party crown for the birthday boy or girl, and stick with traditional cone-shaped party hats for the other partygoers.

, The paper should be at least 14 inches long and 8 inches wide (legal size), or long enough to fit around the top of your head.


Folding the paper will help you cut the crown points into the paper more quickly and evenly.

, Start at the folded side of the paper, and cut the triangles along the top of the paper.


The triangles should be about 2 inches wide and 2 inches long.
When you unfold it, the top section of your paper should have a zigzag pattern, making the points of a crown.

, Depending on the size of crown you want, you’ll need to adjust the paper to make a larger or smaller circle.


Place the crown your head and overlap the ends together until the crown feels comfortable on your head. Use a pencil to mark where the ends meet so you’ll know where to adhere them together.

, Use the pencil marking you made as a guide for making the seam.


If you are using glue to make your crown, let it dry before continuing.

, Use glitter, paint, stick-on jewels, or any other decorations you see fit. Have fun and be creative with your decoration.


Wait until any glue you’ve used is dry before wearing your crown.
Add embellishments by cutting shapes out of paper and gluing or stapling them to the crown.

",How to Organize a Stress Free Kid's Party," Most party places book at least 2 months in advance. Park reservations will need to be made ahead of time, if you have chosen a popular park during the warmer months. If you have opted for a home party, you’ll need a little extra time to work out the details that party facilities will handle for you.;
, Invite your family and friends. For kids under 5 keep the list to 10 kids under 5. Send out a save the date 2 months out and then an invite 1 month ahead. If you email and don’t get a response, be sure to call personally. Not everyone is computer savvy.

, Plan what will be fun for both the children and adults.

, Make them excited to come to be invited to your party. If you choose the park, bring comfy chairs for your guests. For a home party, make sure you have ample seating and room to move around. For a party place, visit the facility and take a tour. If your party is mostly kids, go for the kid play park. If the number of adults outweigh the kids, make sure you account for this in your choice of location. Don't be afraid to ask guests for ideas ahead of time.

, Keep it simple. Provide your child’s favorite dish , order pizza for convenience and easy clean up. Throw in healthy foods like fruit and veggie plates. If you have favorite family recipes by all means, cook it up. It will be a nice gesture, but don’t make this your focal point. Your focal point is your little one’s big day and he or she will want your full attention.

, If your child wants a Dora The Explorer party, purchase Dora plates, pink and orange balloons, and a Dora designed cake. The rest of the time the child will be busy playing.

, Approach with caution. Pick one thing that fits your theme and make it special. For a train-themed party, purchase kids train hats with their names on them.

, The best way is to integrate having the kids make the favors. Have them paint a shirt, plant a flower,or decorate a bouncy ball. They will cherish their work and have fun making it too.

, You only need one. If you're having the party at a park, the play is mostly taken care of. To mark the special occasion, set up one structured activity that makes the day special. Piñatas are always a hit, just proceed with caution around children and the bat. If you are having a home party, you may want to opt for a few more activities to keep the kids busy. Otherwise your house becomes “The “Park” and could suffer some serious damage. Keep the kids playing party games and your home will survive. If you really want to have a clown, face painting, a singer, or have “Dora” show up check with the facility hosting your party. They should be able to get you a much better deal on added entertainment.

, Take into account what you can afford. You may find that an all inclusive party place will cost the same of a fully catered home party. The park party may cost the least but require the most logistical preparation. Do you have more money or more time? Can you let someone else handle the details, or do you prefer being included in all aspects?

Send out creative invitations.,
Lead guests to the party with dinosaur footprints.,
Decorate the tables.,
Hang photos.",How to Plan a Dinosaur‐Themed Birthday Party1," Get the theme going right away with the right invitations. When sending out invites, pick cards that use a dinosaur theme. You can try dinosaur-shaped cards, or cards that are embellished with drawings of dinosaurs.If you want to make the cards yourself, or if your child does, buy some blank cards. Handwrite information on the front like the date, time, and so on.
You can cut out cardboard shapes of dinosaurs using stencils and paste them on the inside of the invitations. You can also use stickers to decorate invitations.;
, Using stencils and cardboard, cut out a variety of prehistoric footprints. Have footprints of multiple different dinosaurs. Have them running up your walkway into your home.If you live in an apartment, talk to your neighbors. Ask them if they would mind if you added some footprints in the hallway just for the day.

, You can opt for decorative tablecloths, which you can buy at most department stores, decorated with images of dinosaurs. However, you can also use plain green or gray tablecloths and decorate from there.For example, lay down a gray tablecloth and scatter fake leaves over it. You can make the leaves yourself using stencils and cardboard or purchase fake leaves.
Then, you can place plastic dinosaur toys running down the center of the table. This creates a fun, prehistoric theme.

, You can stop by a local party store or print out photos of your own. Having photos hung up of dinosaurs all over the wall will really set the dinosaur theme.You can do cartoonish dinosaurs, using supplies from a local party store. You can also print out pictures of realistic dinosaurs.

Serve green and red drinks.,
Decorate the cakes with dinosaurs.,
Use decorative plates.",How to Plan a Dinosaur‐Themed Birthday Party2," Dinosaur-shaped food is a popular kid's dish.

You can also opt for dinosaur-shaped mac and cheese.
If you're serving baked goods as a refreshment, opt for dinosaur-shaped cookies. If you have dinosaur-shaped cookie cutters, make your own cookies using them.

, You can easily make dinosaur-shaped sandwiches for refreshments. Simply cut out two slices of bread using a dinosaur-shaped cookie cutter. From there, add the ingredients to one slice of bread and then top it off with the other.Sandwiches are great if you have multiple children attending with different dietary restrictions. You can have gluten-free sandwiches, nut-free sandwiches, and so on.

, Green and red drinks will remind guests of lava and swamps, two things associated with the dinosaur-age. Serve drinks of this color, and call them things like ""Lava Juice"" and ""Swamp Punch.""A fun thing to do with swamp drinks is to place gummy fish and worms in them. For example, use a green drink, like Mountain Dew, and have a few Swedish fish placed at the bottom of the cup.
Go for fizzy red drinks, such as red sodas, to give them a lava-like appearance. You can also add a scoop of sherbet on top of the glass to create an extra fizzy appearance.

, A dinosaur cake is a must for a birthday party. When it comes to creating a dinosaur cake, you have many options.You can draw a dinosaur on with icing, along with the words ""Happy Birthday."" If you're not skilled at decorating yourself, you can have a cake custom made at a local bakery.
You can also use small, decorative toys to decorate your cake. For example, add a dab of green food coloring to vanilla frosting to create a grass-like appearance. Then, put small plastic dinosaurs on top of the cake, as well as tiny plastic trees, rocks, and so on.

With very young children, supervise the entire time. You want to make sure children do not draw on your walls.

, Hide a variety of small plastic dinosaurs around the house. Give kids lists of which dinosaurs to find and have them team up to look. You can do something similar to an Easter egg hunt, placing dinosaurs in eggs.You can hide dinosaurs anywhere in your home. Hide them in a bookshelf, a desk, behind a curtain on a window, or in a closet.
For an outdoor hunt, it can be fun to bury dinosaurs in a sandbox. This way, kids will feel like they're digging up fossils.

, Stock up on a variety of plain white t-shirts at a department store. Have kids use stencils and fabric paints to create their own dinosaur t-shirts.Children may have strong preferences regarding their favorite type of dinosaur, so provide multiple different dinosaur stencils. It's a good idea to have more than one of each type so kids don't get impatient taking turns.

, You can create something resembling a dinosaur tail by drawing one on poster board and cutting it out. You can also use a leftover tail from a kid's dinosaur costume. Put on some fun music and use the tail as a limbo stick., Kids loves piñatas, so a large dinosaur shaped piñata can be a great addition to the party.

You can take this opportunity to catch each other up on what’s been going on in your lives while the kids are busy playing. That way, everybody gets to benefit from a little friend time.Post up somewhere within eyesight of the kids so that you can supervise while you socialize.
Take a break from talking about princesses and potty training and steer the conversation toward topics like your career, interests and recent personal developments.;
, Don’t forget that the parents will start to get hungry after a while, too. It can be a good idea to have a few mature alternatives to pizza pockets on hand for your guests to nibble on, such as a fruit and cheese tray or some light finger sandwiches. Or you could get more elaborate and experiment with some of those fancy hors d'oeuvres you’ve been meaning to try. Keeping pace with a dozen screaming kids will be much easier on a full stomach.Fix a big batch of chili to simplify the food situation, or encourage your guests to bring one of their own favorite dishes.You might even turn a party for younger children into an impromptu luncheon for friends that you don’t see very often.

, There should be something for the older partygoers to drink other than juice boxes and strawberry milk. Iced tea, cucumber water and berry-infused lemonades are always crowd pleasers. After the food has been served, break out the cold beers, uncork a bottle of wine and put on a pot of fresh coffee (you may need it to get through the rest of the afternoon).Set up a cocktail bar, complete with soda water, fresh fruit, and other mix-ins, where your adult guests can serve themselves.
A few alcoholic beverages are okay, but try not to let things get out of hand. Offer to arrange a ride home for guests that accidentally overdo it.

, A well-staged live performance is great fun no matter what age you are. If you’re going all out for a big bash, secure the services of a clown, magician or comedy troupe to captivate the little ones. You can practically guarantee that no one at the party will be able to look away. Chances are, you’ll end up feeling like a kid again yourself.Schedule an appearance by your child’s favorite Disney princess or superhero.
Get in on the act by putting on a homemade puppet show or theater production., A couple rounds of Scrabble or Cards Against Humanity can make a welcome diversion for the big folks while the little ones are off amusing themselves. These games require creativity and critical thinking, which are both assets you don’t typically get to employ at a party for adolescents. And, if nothing else, they’ll help the time pass a bit faster.Board games are an excellent way to break the ice when you’re around parents you don’t know very well, especially if you divide up into teams.
Look for games with simpler rules and less mature themes so that the kids can get in on the action too., After a while, a soundtrack comprised of nothing but jingles written for grade schoolers can be enough to drive anyone to the brink of insanity. Luckily, there’s a good chance that the music you listened to growing up will be accessible to the younger generation as well. Skip The Wiggles Greatest Hits and instead queue up some music that will get everyone at the party grooving, like The Beatles, The Beach Boys, Queen or Jimmy Buffett. You’ll be glad you did about an hour in.Musical soundtracks tend to be a big hit with listeners both young and old.
Screen your track selection for bad words and other inappropriate content beforehand.

, When you need to mesmerize a group of eight year olds in a hurry, some big big-screen entertainment may be the answer. Pop in a Disney DVD or find an age-appropriate selection in your Netflix watchlist that the kids can gather round and watch together. They’ll be enraptured for an hour or two, during which time you can take a breather from having your hands full.Pick a movie that everybody can get into, including the adults and older kids.
Sitting still for a movie may even lead to unscheduled naptime—for the older partygoers, that means peace and quiet.

, Rather than having every parent drop off their child individually, find a few who are willing to play chauffeur for small groups of kids who have all been invited to the party. This will free up the other parents to pay bills, run errands, see to other responsibilities or simply relax and take the day off. They’ll appreciate the favor, and the kids will have a blast riding around with their friends.Work out specific routes and limit the pickup radius to a small area so that the trip there and back isn’t so hard on those who volunteer to drive.
Make sure it’s okay with the other parents before offering to give their kids a ride.

, A lot of times, the parents that are forced to hang around at kids’ parties have no choice but to sit and wait uncomfortably until their little ones tire out. You can circumvent awkward silences and possible boredom by giving everyone something to do. Delegate basic tasks, like taking over Bounce House safety duty or picking up discarded drink cups.Set up stations where the kids can get their faces painted, put together basic crafts or have their picture made with props and costumes.If the party is proceeding without a hitch, have a lounge area available where everyone can sit and watch the kids together.

, Tackle culinary tasks with a partner that likes to cook. With a little assistance, you can greatly expedite the process of mixing, measuring, grilling and putting the finishing touches on the birthday cake or dessert. Collaborating on the food and festivities will help everything fall into place with minimal time and stress, and definitely beats standing around timidly cradling a cup of warm punch.Get together before the party to come up with some ideas for a menu that will satisfy everyone’s tastes.

, As stressful, tedious or downright boring as these types of parties can sometimes be, remember what’s truly important at the end of the day: that the kids are happy. Your little boy or girl will be all grown up before you know it, so don’t take their exciting, adventurous, wide-eyed early years for granted. Get out there and have fun right alongside them. The memories you make together will be worth it.Play games that give parents the chance to be on the same team as their kids.
Take plenty of photos to mark the occasion and capture those precious moments of joy.

Try a moss liner.,
Add a touch of lace.,
Create a woodland wonderland.,
Sprinkle some fairy dust around.,
Use bamboo utensils.,
Turn chairs into toadstools.",How to Plan a Fairy‐Themed Birthday Party1," You can find moss liners at most craft stores. Throw it over your table for an instant fairy transformation. It's the perfect base for little fairy hideouts and other decorations. If that's out of your budget, try lining the table with a green tablecloth or green paper., Lace is reminiscent of fairy wings and the fairies' whimsical world. Therefore, it makes the perfect solution to place mats for your party. Just use a doily big enough to act as a place mat for each setting, or use a series of doilies or a lace runner in the middle of the table., Once you've created the base, add woodland touches here and there. Butterflies, ladybugs, flowers, toadstools, tiny fairy houses, and even gnomes make great decorations for a fairy party. Of course, don't forget to add some fairies!, Glitter makes an excellent ""fairy"" dust to sprinkle around the room for a party. Add some to the middle of the table, for instance, to create some sparkle. Just keep in mind that glitter can be difficult to clean up, so be prepared to spend some extra time on cleanup., Bamboo can add a whimsical touch to the party. Fairies wouldn't use plastic utensils. They'd make they're own utensils from leaves or bamboo, so incorporate that into your decorations by using bamboo. Of course, green plastic utensils would also work fine., You've transformed your table; now it's time to transform your chairs. Start by covering the stools in red fabric. You can use simple cotton fabric from your local craft store. Next, add white felt dots with a glue gun. Cut the fabric into appropriate sizes, and pull it tight over the seat of the chair, stapling it underneath the seat of the chair. You can also use white fabric paint to add white dots, but you should do that before you put the fabric on your chair, as you could damage the fabric underneath if you don't.

Pick a location and set a date.,
Make a guest list.,
Make or buy the invitations and send them out.,
Plan other activities for before and after you eat.,
Make a shopping list.,
Decorate your house.,
Set the food up about half an hour before guests are expected to eat.",How to Host a Kid's Ice Cream Party," The party's location should be both accessible to most guests and safe for children. Ideally, you will be able to accommodate the party at your own home, but since special circumstances do exist, it is possible to hold the party at a friend or family members home. This will take additional time to arrange - for both you and the homeowner - so communication is a must. If the party won't be at your home, ask the homeowner for permission at least three weeks in advance, to ensure they have no prior plans. As for setting the time, the party should be kept between two and four hours, depending on what other activities you have planned for the children.;
, Decide how many people your location is capable of holding and then ask the ""hosting child"" who they want to invite to their party. Since it is more than likely they will want to invite too many children, it will be your job as an adult to filter through the guest list with the child's help. Target for between five and twelve children, depending on the space you have available and how much money you are willing to spend on food.

, Although there are multiple ways to send your invitations, giving your child the invites to hand out is both easy and free. Send out invitations about two weeks before the party. On them, be sure to ask guests to RSVP within the week to either a phone number or through email. This will give parents enough time to see if they are free, but also enough time for you to pick up ingredients.


Ask if the child is allergic to anything or has special requirements on the invitations. That way, when your guests RSPV, they can let you know if there is anything special they require such as a dairy-free ice cream or a peanut-free party.

, Ask your child what kinds of games or activities they have in mind. Try to allow for a balanced mixture of downtime and activities, since too much free time can turn into a hassle for the party host. Depending on the time of year, your party could include games such a Hide-and-Go-Seek or Ghosts in the Graveyard. Family-friendly movies are also a great idea, but stick to movies rated G and PG, unless you have parental permission to show PG-13.

, There are a few different ""food sections"" you'll need to shop for, so use the following list as a very general guide. Customize it based on your preferences and needs. All food besides fresh berries should be picked up about three to four days in advance of the party.



Ice Cream. Since this is an ice cream party, having ice cream would definitely be a plus. When calculating how much ice cream you need, allow about two servings of ice cream per child. That equals about a cup of ice cream per kid in attendance. Try to get a diverse variety of ice cream flavors, but don't forget the originals. Purchase vanilla, chocolate, and strawberry ice creams as your base flavors, but feel free to experiment with new flavors or brands. If there will be any vegetarian guests at the party, make sure that no ice creams contain gelatin. Vegans coming? Plan to buy a bit of dairy-free ice cream, or make your own.

Fruit toppings. Who could ever forget the famous cherry on top? Although fresh fruit may have a bit more flavor, it can be pricey, especially when it is out-of-season. Your best bet is to buy mostly frozen fruits that can be thawed out on the day before the party. Buy the fruits that are most compatible with your budget and tastes. These could include cherries, strawberries, banana slices, blackberries, raspberries, and blueberries.

Nuts. Although they can be a bit more expensive than traditional ice cream social fare; almonds, peanuts, walnuts, and pecans are all excellent additions to ice cream. Still, it is best to use precautions since people can be highly allergic to them. Even if someone has never experienced a reaction before, it is best to keep the nuts separate from other foods.

Cookies, candies, and cereal. Who doesn't enjoy cookie crumbles or their favorite candy bits on a sundae? Have a few different brands of cookies and candies on hand for the children to sprinkle over their ice cream. For a unique twist on the sundae, allow the children to experiment with cereal toppings such as Fruity Pebbles and Cocoa Puffs.
Sauces and other toppings. Hot fudge, caramel, cherry sauces, and marshmallow fluff all fit into this category. Marshmallow fluff is a fantastic substitution for real marshmallows since most brands don't have gelatin in them, a big ""no"" for vegetarians.
Other snacks. You may decide to throw in a few pizzas or pizza rolls into the oven for the adults, or you might want to leave out a few bags of chips for a salty contrast to the sweet ice cream.
Bowls or ice cream cones, napkins, and spoons. Decide if you will be using bowls and spoons from home or if you will be picking up disposable dishes. Reusable items from home are best for the environment, but if you are expecting many guests disposable bowls may be a good option for you. Try to use paper, not Styrofoam or plastic, both of which are non-biodegradable.

, Balloons and streamers are an easy and inexpensive way to make the party look festive and exciting. Post a sign outside of your home so people can easily find the party. Add a few balloons and the hosting child's name for a personalized touch.

, You can wait a little longer if the ice cream is already soft.


Smash large cookies and candies and put them (and the other ingredients) into bowls with large spoons. This allows the children easy access to their favorite toppings without them having to touch everything with their hands.
Make sure that there will be a place for every kid at the table. Lay out their silverware, napkins, and bowls.
Heat any hot toppings about ten minutes before you eat, and pour them into small dishes. This allows any sauces to sufficiently cool down enough for safe handling, but still be pliable enough to pour over the ice cream.
As stated above, you should make sure you set the nuts away from the other dishes slightly, with their own spoons.

Serve treats in green cupcake liners.,
Add floral notes.,
Try bird's nest cookies.,
Create a whimsical punch.,
Create a fairy-themed cake.",How to Plan a Fairy‐Themed Birthday Party2," Cupcake liners, particularly ones that have leaves on them, make a perfect serving dish for party treats. You can even serve hot appetizers in them, such as little bowls of mac and cheese or spaghetti and meatballs. If your dish is messy, though, try serving them in foil liners and then placing them in paper liners. That will help make them sturdy and decorative., Flowers make a great addition to a fairy party, but you don't have to stick to bouquets. Try making flowers out of fruit, for instance. You can use cookie cutters to cut out flower-shaped pieces of watermelon, then skewer them with green grapes or kiwi to create the leaves.You can also use edible flowers in your food. For instance, freeze edible flowers (like rose petals) in ice cubes to add whimsy to drinks.

, One option for treats is bird's nest cookies, which are no-bake. Just melt a 12-ounce bag of chocolate chips and a 12-ounce bag of butterscotch chips together in the microwave. Make sure to stir the mixture every half minute while it is heating. Once melted, mix in a 12-ounce bag of chow mein noodles. Spray down a muffin pan, then drop the mixture into the pan in spoonfuls, shaping them into nests as you go. Let them set up in the fridge, then add in small, egg-shaped candies, such as jelly beans., Your fairy punch doesn't need to be very sophisticated. Even pink lemonade with flower-shaped ice cubes would add whimsy to the party. For something a little more sophisticated, try an orange smoothie. Mix a can of frozen orange juice (thawed out), 1 cup of water, 1 cup of milk, 1/4 cup of sugar, 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract, and about 10 ice cubes in a blender, which makes 4-5 servings. Add a sprinkling of edible glitter on top and garnish with a striped paper straw and a flower., You can go any number of directions with the cake. You can make a simple cake with edible glitter on top, or you can add decorative frosting flowers. Another option is to create a ""mossy"" cake with green frosting, then add in decorations like trees, flowers, fairies, and toadstools.

"
"
Create fairy-like favors.,
Make simple fairy wings for each person.,
Build your own floral crowns.",How to Plan a Fairy‐Themed Birthday Party3," Start with clear boxes. Fill the bottom with green candy, such as green jelly beans or other jelly candies. Add a toy fairy to the box, and a few flower-shaped or flower-colored candies to the box. You can also throw in a fairy-themed cupcake for the attendee to take home, such as a red cupcake with white dots made from candy (toadstool) or a cupcake topped with rose., Using large pieces of glitter paper, cut a wing out of each sheet. To attach them, make a large loop out of ribbon for each wing, big enough to stick an arm through. Glue one to each wing. Use a piece of fabric, felt, or ribbon to attach the wings to each other. You can add flowers or a bow in the middle for extra decoration., Start with sturdy wire that's wrapped in brown or green, found at most craft stores. Cut a length that's big enough to go around the person's just over two times. Twist the wire around itself, making a circle the size of the person's head. Glue some felt or fabric around the ends of the wire to keep it from scratching the person. Hot glue flowers on the front or use florist's tape to wrap them on.You can also use ivy instead of flowers for a green crown.
For a less-permanent crown, just use a loop of sturdy paper to make the crown."
"
Let the attendees create ""fairy houses."",
Run a fairy dust relay race.,
Make a fairy photo booth.",How to Plan a Fairy‐Themed Birthday Party4," Buy small wooden birdhouses from a craft store. Let the attendees paint the houses how they like, then add decorations like flowers, fairies, and butterflies. You can even place the houses in a small saucer with glass beads to create a fairy scene the attendees can each take home., Place two jars at one end of your yard. Divide into the group into two teams, and let each person have their own (small) cup of ""fairy"" dust (AKA glitter). Make sure you have enough glitter to actually fill the jars. Have each person run to the other end of the yard, dump their glitter in the jar, and run back. The first team to fill up their jar wins the relay race.Have a lint brush on hand to help get glitter spills off of clothing and skin.

, One option is to create clouds out of white paper and hang them in front of a blue sheet. You could also paint an easy woodland scene on an old sheet or a large sheet of butcher by paper by adding trees and clouds. Alternatively, you could make a glitter background. Then just let everyone have fun and take photos as they do.It can help to have some dress-up items, such as tiaras, fairy wands, tulle skirts, and fairy wings.

Choose a good birthday party location near or at your house:


There is usually no better place to hold your child's birthday party than your own home.,
Involve the children in party planning and preparation.,
Let your child(ren) help plan the theme, location, guest list, menu, games, etc.,
Decide on the time length of the party.,
Decorate the location.,
Provide name tags for the guests as they arrive.,
Have a box or bag ready to put all the presents in as the children arrive so they can be kept safe to open later.,
Keep the children busy.

,
Make sure you have good party food (see the 'Things You'll Need' section).

,
Have the party bags ready and named so they can be handed to each child as they leave.,
Understand that the objective of the day is to make your child feel special.",How to Involve Children in Planning a Birthday Party," Children are usually better behaved in the home environment and much easier to control. It's always wise to make sure any valuable items are stored away in case of accidents. Also, outdoor parties can be a lot of fun, whether it's held in one of the local parks or simply in your own backyard.
If you feel your house is too small to accommodate the number of children you are planning to invite, then booking a local hall is a sensible option. Choose carefully and try to find one that has a carpeted floor.
When holding your party in a hall, be sure to make a thorough checklist of everything you will need to take with you for the party (Don't forget your music, prizes, matches or a lighter to light the birthday cake candles with!). Shows at a local restaurant can also be a great option for certain families.;
, Surprises are fun, but the kids like to get involved in planning, and this is a time when the kids are motivated to be especially helpful.

, They can do lots of things, like: write invitations or create them on the computer with fun computer paper, fill loot bags, blow up balloons, decorate, even help 'child-proof', or straighten the house.

, One to two hours is more than enough time for a toddler or pre-school party. For older children two to three hours is recommended.

, Finding the party venue can be a real headache for your guests - especially at night! A bunch of balloons (not just one - it will pop!) tied to your mailbox will help your guests and the entertainer find your home.

, It is a good idea to provide each child with a sticky label badge bearing his or her name. People tend to respond better when they are addressed by name.

, If the birthday child is opening presents during the party, try to make sure they are removed to a safe place afterwards.

,,, For drop off parties, parents usually start arriving about 15 minutes prior to the scheduled end.

, It's their special day -- whether there's a party or not. Alternative birthday celebrations include special rituals, such as birthday plates, breakfasts, dinners or birthday cake with grandma, measuring to see how much they've grown, reminiscing about ""the day you were born"" or previous parties over photo albums or by watching videos of younger years.

Decorate with a sea theme.,
Make some fish and starfish shaped cookies.,
Have sea-related games.,
Have sea-themed party food.,
Have a suitable cake.,
Make little party bags for taking home.",How to Hold an Under the Sea Party for Kids," Examples include streamers made to look like seaweed, paper fish, sea creatures, toy boats, starfish, shells, sand, sponges etc.;
, Leave them plain for decorating by the party guests. Set out a decorating area with icing, candies, sprinkles etc. and have the children spend some time icing their own fish cookies. Do this early in the party, so that the children can take home their creations to eat later.

, Here are some ideas:


Pin the legs on the octopus - Make the octopus and leave some of the legs off for taping on.
Nemo Treasure Hunt - take photos of a Nemo toy in various places in the garden. The children have to look at the photos and find the Nemo toys hidden in each one. The finder gets to keep the Nemo toy. Use chocolate fish or ordinary fish toys if preferred.
Watery games - anything wet could be good if the weather is right and parents aren't fussed. Water bombing is a fun water game, with supervision. If it's really hot, ask the kids to come in their swim gear and use sprinklers, hoses etc. as part of the entertainment.
Fishing - make fish shapes out of cardboard and place a paper clip ""nose"" on each fish. Make fishing rods from bamboo sticks with string attached and a small magnet or hook at the end (whichever works best for you) and have the kids fish for a catch. Make sure to include other items, such as an old boot, a tin can etc. The winner is the one with the most fish.

Pass the deep sea parcel - have chocolate fish, gummy sharks etc. as the prizes in the parcel.

, Fish shaped fish bakes, chips, cupcakes decorated with a mermaid, or a shark, or just a general sea theme etc. Look for shell shaped food, such as chocolate. In fact, anything shaped like a fish, a sea creature, shells, seaweed, starfish, driftwood, sand castles, etc. is fine.

, Anything that can be found under the sea, real or fantasy, can inspire the cake. For example, Nemo, a treasure chest, a shark, a dolphin, a seal, submarine, etc. are just some ideas for an under the sea cake. The image shows a fairytale castle under the sea.

, Add the decorated fish cookies to the bag, as well as some sea creature toys (the stretchy ones are great), maybe a coloring book of sea animals, and other sea themed toys.

"
Arrive to the party at least an hour early to help with last minute set-ups and to receive instructions from the parents/guardians.,
After all the kids arrive, play an icebreaker game to learn all the kids’ names.,
Suggest outdoor games like freeze tag or any other game that the kids may suggest then go out to the backyard.

,
Have all the kids wash their hands when they come back inside for dinner.

,
Help pass out plates and utensils for the pizza and cake.

,
After everyone is done eating, get the cake ready by placing 10 candles in it then light them.

,
After singing happy birthday, cut the cake into equal pieces and hand it out to each kid.

,
Clean-up all the trash so the table can be clean for the gifts to be opened.

,
Gather all the gifts so they can be opened and record them on paper in case thank you cards may be sent out later.

,
By now, the kids will be ready to rest, so put in a good movie for them to fall asleep to.,
Before all the kids leave the next morning, make sure they all receive their birthday favor bags and thank them for coming.

,
Help clean up and thank the parents/guardians before you leave for giving you the opportunity to be their child’s birthday host.

",How to Host a 10th Birthday Party,";
, For example, have everyone get in a circle and introduce themselves with an adjective that begins with the first letter of their first name, like “Jumping Jackie” or “Happy Heather”.

Discuss the idea of developing a family cookbook with your family.,
Set deadlines and meetings.,
Design a cover.,
Pull the cookbook together.,
Enjoy your cookbook!",How to Write a Family Cookbook," Figure out together what you want to do with the cookbook, how it is to be used and whether or not it is to be created once or created in such a way that recipes and tidbits can be continuously added to it as time goes on. Here are a few questions you might want to discuss.


Is the cookbook going to be big or small? Typed or written? Easy to update?
Do we want to invite other members of the family to contribute? (For example, grandma, grandpa, aunts, uncles, cousins). Or do we just want it to be our immediate family?
Do we want to have a lot of recipes or just a few? What sorts of recipes are worth keeping?
Do we want to keep space to keep adding onto our cookbook, or add it all at once?;
, The family needs to meet up every once in a while and continue to discuss what's new. It could be every day at dinner time. Or, even once or twice a year. As long as everybody who's involved in the cookbook is at a certain place, at a certain time, you can have a meeting about developing and finalizing the cookbook.


It is important that you take overall responsibility for its development. Since it's your idea, everyone will be looking to you to be the main organizer and motivator for this project. Without your leadership, the cookbook may not happen.
Ask everyone to keep recipes aside when they discover they really like them. They could print them off the internet, add a tag to favorite cookbooks in the house or write it out. Another approach is to scan and email you any of the favorite recipes, so that you can begin collecting them together.

, You can draw it or create it on Microsoft Word, Pages or another similar word processing program. When creating the cover, keep in mind:


Everyone in the family should like it––check it with them first.
It should contain something about your family, such as your family name in big letters and perhaps a short summary of why the cookbook was created.
Everyone should have a chance to suggest an idea or help in some way.
Make sure you're all having fun!

, This is the most intensive part of the exercise and it'll take time, so be prepared.


Permanent style: If you're going to prepare a permanent book which cannot be updated, arrange all of the recipes into your word processing program, in order of preference (such as soups, salads, appetizers, main courses, desserts, baking, tips, etc.). Add images, if any. Then ready the digital file to be sent to a printer to have it printed off (see cover making above).
Update style: Find a suitable large recipe binder or hard file with plastic sheet inserts. Print off the existing recipes in the desired order, along with images, if any. Arrange these in the folder. Leave space for future recipes. These can be added in one of two ways––they can be collected and arranged in the word processor and only printed off when a new page is ready (making more work for you). Or, the recipes can be cut to size and taped onto printer paper sheets and inserted into the spare envelopes of the binder, as needed.

, Keep it somewhere in the kitchen that is easy to access, so that all family members can make use of it at any time.

Recruit a small number of members.,
Know where to look for members.,
Welcome everyone into your home.,
Decide when to meet, and stick to it.,
Keep a chain of contact in place.,
Decide on a structure for your cookbook club.",How to Start a Cookbook Club1," Usually, four to six members is a good amount to start with, and you can expand as need or resources allow. Keeping the number small prevents your members from having to cook especially large portions, and it also makes it easier for you to develop a system.;
, Friends and family members are the perfect place to start, but you can also expand into co-workers, friends of friends, and acquaintances if needed. You typically want to stick with members who someone can vouch for, however, since you will need to trust each other well enough to eat the dishes one another makes.

, While ordinary book clubs can meet in public, cookbook clubs usually need to meet in someone's home. That way, you can share dishes and discuss your experiences with the cookbook. In fact, while the founder should host the introductory meeting, it is best if every member of the club is willing to host at some point to keep things fair. Main courses and other larger dishes are usually prepared by the hostess, so everyone should have a shot on the rotation.


Once or twice during the warm weather, you can mix things up by meeting at a park for a picnic. Just make sure that you select a cookbook with plenty of picnic-themed recipes in it.

, Every one or two months should give your members enough time to get the cookbook and try a few recipes out of it. To keep things simple, try to make it the same day each month, such as the third Sunday of every month or the 10th day of every month. This will help everyone remember when the meetings are.


Also keep in mind the best time of day. If you plan to meet on the weekend each time, scheduling your meetings between 2 PM and 5 PM will give your members enough time to cook in the morning and allow them to treat their giant cookbook club meal as an early dinner. If you meet during the week, you may need to schedule your meetings during dinner and into the early evening to give everyone enough time to make after-work preparations.

, Phone numbers are fine, but in today's digital age, e-mail is even better. You can also set up a blog or online spreadsheet to keep things structured. Members can stay in the loop and learn about any last minute changes, and keeping in contact will also prevent members from accidentally preparing the same dish for a club meeting.

,


Most cookbook clubs choose one cookbook each month, and each member makes something out of it to share during the meeting.
If you have a small enough group, you can have each member select a dish from the cookbook and all work on cooking it together.
You can also do a study of a specific person or company known for having an extended career in the culinary arts. For instance, you can have a cookbook club dedicated to preparing dishes published by a major cooking magazine or dishes first made by Julia Child.

Ensure that you have a contract.,
Follow up.",How to Hire a Clown," You may find listings in the phone book or from booking firms or agents, or you may have to locate them yourself by scanning advertisements and asking friends.;
, Ask other friends who have hired a clown about how their performance was, and if the clown acted appropriately and was reasonably entertaining.

, Ask them about the typical age-group of the audience, length of the show and what a typical entertainment routine looks like.

, If the clown works through a bonded agency and has good references, this step may not be needed.

, You can do this over the phone or in person. However, talking in person will give you a chance to observe his behavior and manner of speaking. If anything about his demeanor makes you uncomfortable, or if you're not impressed by how he describes his performance, don't hire him. An entertainer should, after all, be entertaining. Also, since you're having this performer in your house, you need to feel safe. If you find anything about the call or interview off-putting, move on and hire a different clown.

, Find out if he puts on a good show! Ask detailed questions about his demeanor and performance.

, Negotiate if necessary and come to an agreement about payment.

, Popular entertainers are booked at least a month in advance - late summer and fall are the busiest.

, Be clear about your expectations and make sure you examine what promises the performer makes. Consider whether there are any extra fees, whether he is bringing all his own supplies, and what his cancellation policy is.

, After the event, provide feedback so other parents don't have to do the same legwork again. If it was a good show, offer to be a reference for the clown. If not, consider putting a detailed review on whatever sites he uses to advertise and gather customer feedback.

Prevent double dishes.,
Do not be afraid to go with an occasional theme.,
Stick with an appropriate cookbook for the season.,
Keep things light.,
Monitor your members' allergies and eating peculiarities.,
Bring a camera.",How to Start a Cookbook Club2," Your favorite cookbook may have been an old, tattered thing passed down to you by your late grandmother, but if that book is out of print, you should probably resist the urge to put it on your club's roster. Instead, stick with recently published cookbooks that are fairly inexpensive. It may even help to check with local libraries in your area to find out if a cookbook you have in mind is available to borrow.

, As the club's founder, it is only natural for you to select the first book or two. After that, though, you need to give your other members a chance to share their opinions. You can either vote on proposed selections or allow you members to take turns choosing.

, One way to keep a meeting organized is to make sure that all the courses are covered. The host or hostess usually prepares the main dish, while the other members are assigned a meal category like appetizer, side dish, and dessert. If you have more members than meal categories, double up on the assignments. For instance, two or more members could prepare side dishes or desserts.

, There are few things more frustrating in a cookbook club than painstakingly preparing a dish only to discover that another member prepared the same thing. Make sure that each member knows what the other members plan on making to prevent this from happening. Keep an e-mail thread so that the selections are down in writing. You can also keep an internet-based spreadsheet that members can share and edit to accomplish the same thing.

, Even if you prepare a standard meal for most meetings, you can occasionally have a meeting that focuses on one type of food. For instance, if you select a cookbook all about cake, then obviously, all of your members will bring in a type of cake.

, During holidays, you may want to consider a holiday-oriented cookbook, but this is not necessary. Avoid cookbooks that are completely out of season, though. For instance, don't choose a cookbook about grilling for the middle of February, especially if you live in a cold climate.

, Ordinary book clubs demand a certain level of structure to keep the topic of conversation fixed on the book of the month. Cookbook clubs, by comparison, have a looser structure, and conversation can stray from the cookbook being used without conflicting with the purpose of the club. You should each share your experiences and opinion of the cookbook for each month, but do not worry if the topic of conversation strays into other realms every now and then. The main point is to showcase dishes from the cookbook and get an overall opinion of whether or not the cookbook is worthwhile.


Set aside the first 30 minutes of the meeting for members to come in and settle down. Do not serve the food yet. Instead, wait for everyone to arrive and get all their initial greetings out of the way.
Dedicate the next 15 to 30 minutes for ""serious"" business. Club members should introduce their dishes and describe their experiences.
Sit down and relax for the rest of the meeting. The hostess can prepare plates, or you can simply place the dishes on the serving table and allow everyone to take what they want. Allow the conversation to naturally drift in and out of casual topics, but make sure that anyone who has something to say that pertains to official cookbook club business has a chance to say it.

, If one of your members is deathly allergic to peanuts, for example, you should probably make sure that the rest of your group knows to stay away from recipes with peanuts. Other peculiarities based on preference, such as vegetarianism, should be handled on a case by case basis. If your group is close enough, the members may decide to appease one another's eating habits. Otherwise, just make sure that each member reveals the ingredients in his or her dish so that members who would prefer not to eat a certain ingredient can avoid it.

, This is only optional, of course, but bringing a camera to your club meetings will allow you to take pictures of all the dishes. These pictures can then be posted to your group's blog, if you have one, or they can be kept in a group scrapbook or cookbook. Mark down the title, ingredients, and directions for each pictured dish, along with the cookbook it came out of.

If you just have a recipe sheet, pop it inside a clear plastic envelope.,
Protect electronic recipes and cookbooks assiduously.",How to Protect Recipe Books when Cooking," The screen will protect the cookbook from spills and splashes and can simply be wiped clean when you're finished.


Mimic a plastic screen or shield by placing a plastic cover over the book sitting in the stand. Use the type of plastic covers used for plastic comb binding of documents in the office. This sheet can be wiped down again and again, and can be left to sit on your usual recipe stand.;
, Place it on the stand as usual. You can wipe down the bag for reuse or simply dispose of the bag if it's old and not able to be reused.

, This is the type used inside binders to hold materials in place. It can be wiped clean after cooking.

, If you're using a laptop, iPad, e-Reader, or iPhone, etc., in the kitchen to follow a recipe, be sure to do the following:


Keep the electronics well away from the food preparation area and the sink. Water and ingredients landing on the keyboard or screen can damage the electronics permanently.
Keep the electronics within quick walking distance from where you're working but away from steam, heat, and the ingredients. If you have a kitchen table or a high counter, these might make a good, safe space.
Avoid putting greasy, floury, or sticky fingers on the electronics. If you need to scroll or turn a page, wash and thoroughly dry your hands first, or call someone else to come and do it for you.

, Continue heating and stirring until all the gelatin dissolves, leaving no lumps behind. Do not let the liquid begin to boil.Try a double boiler, which will heat the gelatin slowly and evenly.
A microwave is the fastest, but a little risky. Heat at 10-second intervals only, to avoid overheating., Remove from heat and let the gelatin cool. Wait until it reaches roughly the temperature of your finger.Do not let it cool too far past this point, or the gelatin may set into a solid.

Use powdered sugar.,
Add dry milk powder before whipping.,
Mix in melted marshmallows.,
Try instant vanilla pudding instead.,
Mix crème fraîche or mascarpone cheese for slight firmness.",How to Stabilize Whipped Cream2," Most store-bought powdered sugar includes cornstarch, which will help stabilize the cream.Replace the granulated sugar with an equal weight of powdered sugar.


If you do not have a kitchen scale, replace 1 part granulated sugar with 1.75 parts powdered sugar.2 tbsp (30 mL) powdered sugar is typically enough for 1 cup (240mL) cream.Whip the cream until soft peaks form before adding most ingredients. Adding sugar too early can reduce the volume and fluffiness of your whipped cream., Stir in 2 tsp (10mL) milk powder for each cup (240mL) cream. This should add protein to support your whipped cream, without affecting the flavor., Melt two or three jumbo marshmallows by microwaving in a large bowl in 5-second intervals, or by carefully heating them in a large greased pan.They're ready when they expand and melt enough to stir together; remove from heat to avoid browning. Let cool for a couple minutes, then stir into the whipped cream once it's formed soft peaks.


Mini marshmallows may contain cornstarch. This can help stabilize the cream as well, but some cooks find it more difficult to melt and mix in., Add 2 tablespoons (30mL) instant dry vanilla pudding mix once soft peaks have formed. This keeps it stiff, but adds a yellow color and artificial taste.Experiment with this one at home first, before you try it on your friend's wedding cake., Add ½ cup (120mL) crème fraîche or mascarpone cheese to the cream after soft peaks form. The result is stiffer than usual, but not as solid as other stabilizers.This will still work as a tangy cake frosting, but don't try to pipe it.


This version will still melt just as fast in the heat. Keep it in the fridge or icebox.
Use the mixer attachment to gently break mascarpone into small pieces to avoid them flying out of bowl.

"
"
Consider a food processor or stick blender.,
Chill all ingredients and tools before whipping.,
Store whipped cream in a sieve over a bowl.",How to Stabilize Whipped Cream3," Whip the cream in a series of short pulses to work in plenty of air. Once the cream's thickened enough not to splash over the sides, pulse until it reaches the desired consistency. This typically takes 30 seconds, does not require chilling the equipment, and creates whipped cream that should last at least a couple hours.Do not blend for too long or on too high a speed, or the cream will become butter. If you catch signs of separation and coarseness early, you can sometimes fix it by whisking in a little more cream by hand.

, The colder the cream, the less likely it is to separate. Store the heavy cream in the coldest part of your fridge, typically at the back of the lowest shelf. When whisking by hand or an electric mixer, chill the bowl and the beaters in the freezer for at least 15 minutes beforehand.Metal bowls stay cold longer than glass bowls, and not all glass bowls are freezer-safe.
If the weather is hot, place the bowl of cream in an ice bath. Whisk in an air-conditioned room.

, Whipped cream leaks water over time, which is a major reason for runny collapses. Store it in a fine-mesh sieve so the water drains down into a container below, instead of breaking apart your whipped cream.Line the sieve with cheesecloth or a paper towel if the holes are too large to stop the whipped cream.

Consider using honey to replace refined sugars.,
Use fruit juice concentrates and reductions to add sweetness to your cooking.,
Try using agave nectar as an all-purpose sweetener.,
Cook with molasses when you need a hearty, full-flavored sweetener.,
Substitute maple syrup for refined sugars in baked goods.,
Use barley malt syrup when a low-glycemic measure is important.",How to Choose Natural Sweetener," Honey is the oldest and most natural sweetener available - it is made by bees even without human intervention. Honey is incredibly versatile, working well in tea, sauces, salad dressings, baked goods, and more. Honey ranges in color and flavor based on the type of flower from which the bees get their nectar.


Clover honey is perhaps the most common, and is readily available in grocery stores. Its mild flavor makes it incredibly versatile.
Orange blossom honey is also easy to find, and has a mild flavor with slight citrus notes. It is just as versatile as clover honey, and works especially well when paired with citrus.
Buckwheat honey is a dark, full-flavored honey. It is excellent in baked goods, where it imparts a rich, caramel-like flavor.;
, Fruit juices have a high level of natural sugars, and their sweetness can be amplified by reducing them. This can done by simmering juice in a saucepan; an alternative is to buy fruit juice concentrate in the grocery store. Fruit juice reductions work well in both sauces and baked goods, while also making an excellent natural dessert topping.

, Agave nectar is made from the agave plant, known for its crucial role in preparing tequila. It is as versatile as honey, working well in everything from cocktails to savory sauces. Agave nectar has a low glycemic index measure, meaning it will not cause spikes in blood sugar levels like more refined sugars.

, Molasses is a by-product of the sugar-refining process. It is thick and dark, with a full, rich flavor. It works well in baked goods and as a glaze on roasted winter squash or hams. It can also be used to sweeten coffee for an earthy, caramel flavor. Molasses, like many other natural sweeteners, comes in different colors which denote its depth of flavor.

, Maple syrup, which is made from the sap of maple trees, is a natural sweetener with a full, spicy, earthy flavor. While it may not be the most versatile sweetener available, it can help you create stand-out baked goods and even be a part of spicy, winter-themed cocktails.

, Malt syrup is less rich than molasses, but not as mild or sweet as honey. It works well in all manner of baked goods. Maltose, which is the primary sugar present in barley malt, is very low on the glycemic index. While malt syrup can be found in health food stores and some grocery stores, a wider variety of it will be available at home-brewing supply stores where it is sold for making beer.

Chill the cream.,
Add sugar and salt.,
Whisk the cream.,
Watch for peaks to form.",How to Make Whipped Cream1," The colder the cream is, the easier it is to whip. Plan to whip the cream the moment you take it out of the refrigerator, rather than leaving it sitting on the counter for some time. The bowl you pour the cream into should also be chilled if possible.





;
, Sweeten the cream with your sugar of choice. Add a pinch of salt to bring out the cream's rich flavor and contrast with the sugar. Use a spoon or whisk to stir the mixture well.








, Using a large whisk, or a hand mixer, start whipping the cream in a circular direction. Whip as quickly as possible to help air change the consistency of the cream from a heavy liquid into a light, fluffy substance.









It takes a little practice to learn how to whip cream effectively by hand. You have to work quickly enough that the cream doesn't have time to warm up too much. Switch to the other hand if the hand you are using becomes too tired.
Use an electric mixer to make the job easier. Set the bowl of cream under a stand mixer and let the machine do all the work, or use a hand mixer to make gentle swirls in the cream while the beaters whip it up.

, The first change you'll notice is that the whisk or beaters will begin to leave drag marks in the cream, indicating that it has become more solid in texture. Continue whipping until you can lift the whisk or beaters from the cream and leave semi-stiff peaks in their wake.








Some people prefer soft whipped cream, which slumps deliciously down the side of cakes and pies. Others prefer stiffer whipped cream that retains a certain shape when it's used to top a dessert. Keep whipping until the cream reaches the texture you desire.
Stop whipping before it turns to butter. If you keep whipping for too long (which is easier to do with an electric mixer than by hand) the cream will turn to solid butter. If this happens to you, save the butter to make cinnamon sugar toast or another delicious treat and start over with a new batch of cream.

Decide how to flavor the whipped cream.,
Flavor the cream before you whip it.,
Whip the cream.",How to Make Whipped Cream2," In recent years it has become popular to make whipped cream in a variety of different flavors that complement the dish the cream will top. Whipped cream is easily flavored by extracts, cocoa, liqueurs, and zests; choose a combination that works with your dessert. Here are a few ideas:









Make chocolate whipped cream by adding a tablespoon of cocoa. This would make a great topping for chocolate silk pie.
Make vanilla bourbon whipped cream as a topping for pecan pie. Add a teaspoon of vanilla and a teaspoon of bourbon to the mix.
Create a bright-tasting cream by adding a tablespoon of lemon zest, and use it to top strawberry shortcake.
Almond or anise extract add a subtle depth to whipped cream. These make an excellent topping for berry pies.

, When you're ready to make whipped cream, remove the chilled cream from the refrigerator and pour it into a clean bowl. Add sugar and a pinch of salt, then add the flavorings you want to use. Stir it all together with a spoon or a whisk.








, Using the same technique described for classic whipped cream, beat the cream until it forms either soft or stiff peaks, depending on your preference. Use the cream to top your pie or cake.

Beat the cream cheese.,
Sweeten the cream.,
Whip the cream.,
Combine the cream cheese and whipped cream.,
Use cream cheese whipped cream as a topping or icing.,

",How to Make Whipped Cream3," Place it in a chilled bowl and beat until it becomes light and fluffy.








, In a separate bowl, pour in the chilled whipping cream, vanilla, sugar, and salt. Use a whisk or spoon to stir the mixture well.







, Use a whisk or a hand mixer to whip the cream until it forms soft peaks. Stop short of whipping up stiff peaks.








, Add the cream cheese to the bowl of whipped cream. Use the whisk or hand mixer to beat the mixture until it forms stiff peaks when you lift the beaters from the bowl.








, Since cream cheese whipped cream is a bit stiffer and thicker than regular whipped cream, it can be used as either a topping or an icing. Cream cheese whipped cream makes a delicious icing for apple cake or zucchini bread.

Pour in the icing sugar.,
Add the vanilla and non-dairy milk.,
Refrigerate your frosting.,
Find a vegan margarine you enjoy.,
Choose your non-dairy milk.,
Experiment with optional mix-ins.",How to Make Vegan Buttercream Frosting," Put the vegan margarine in a mixing bowl. You can whip it in a standing mixer or use a hand mixer – whatever you have in your kitchen. You want to beat the margarine until it’s nice and fluffy, so take your time. This will get you the best texture for your frosting., Once your margarine is nice and fluffy, it’s time to add the icing sugar. Don’t pour it in all at once, however. Slowly add a bit of sugar and then whip it fully into the margarine. Then, add a bit more. Continue adding just a little at a time until the icing sugar and margarine are thoroughly blended together., Once the icing sugar and margarine are fully combined, add in your vanilla. Mix this in. Then, evaluate the consistency of the buttercream frosting. You may need a couple tablespoons of your non-dairy milk or you may not need much at all.You don’t want your finished buttercream frosting to be overly dense, but you don’t want it to be runny either!


If you want chocolate buttercream frosting, add your cocoa powder now. The amount of cocoa powder depends on how chocolatey you want your frosting, so pour in a portion at a time and do regular taste tests., You can use your frosting right away. If you have leftover frosting, or if you simply aren’t ready to use yours, pop it in the refrigerator. Once you decorate your baked goods, you will want to keep those in the refrigerator as well so that the icing keeps how you want it. You can save your frosting for 3-5 days in the refrigerator.

, It can be tough to find vegan alternatives that accurately mimic the taste of the non-vegan counterparts. It’s important to choose a vegan margarine that you enjoy, so taste a bit before you begin this recipe. If you hate the taste of your vegan margarine, you will not like the taste of your finished frosting!

, Vegans know there are plenty of variations of non-dairy milk on the market. The kind of milk you use can certainly affect the finished taste of your buttercream frosting. You can use soy milk, rice milk, almond milk, cashew milk, and so on – just make sure you can imagine it’s flavor in a frosting.For example, soy milk’s aftertaste might not work as well as vanilla cashew milk’s. Choosing your milk is a matter of personal preference.

, The great thing about this vegan buttercream frosting recipe is that it can be used as a base for a variety of different flavors. For example, adding a bit of fruit juice can transform it in both taste and color. If you are using it to decorate, you can add a few drops of food coloring to create any color you like.


Don't be afraid to get creative with your flavors. Add a few drops of peppermint oil for peppermint frosting. A little bit of strawberry jelly will make fruity, pink frosting. If you want, you can even chop up your favorite vegan candy and put it in your frosting for a little bit of crunch. Experiment!"

Pour 2-3 inches (5-7.5cm) cooking oil in a heavy cooking pot.,
Heat the oil to 375ºF (191ºC).",How to Make Fried Oreos1," The pot should be deep enough so the sides are at least 4 inches (10cm) higher than the oil. When deep frying, there should be enough oil to completely cover the food you are frying, but the pot should not be more than half way full of oil.To fry, use a vegetable oil with a high smoking point and little to no flavor, like refined peanut oil, canola oil, grapeseed oil, or safflower oil.If you don't have a heavy cooking pot, or one with a very thick, heavy bottom, you can use a wok or a deep sauté pan instead.;
, Use a frying, candy, or thermocouple thermometer. These thermometers show temperatures up to 500ºF (260°C).To check temperature of the oil, hold it in the center of the pan. If your thermometer clips to the side of the pan it will be easy to keep track of the temperature as you work.If you don't have a thermometer, stick a wooden spoon, skewer, or chopstick into the oil. If the oil bubbles around the wood, it's hot enough for frying.You can also use a kernel of popcorn to check the temperature. It will pop in oil that is 350ºF (178ºC), so you will know when it is close to optimum frying temperature.If the oil begins to smoke, it's too hot. Carefully removed your pan from the stove to cool."

Combine pancake mix, eggs, milk, and vegetable oil in a large bowl and whisk until smooth.,
Dip an Oreo in the pancake batter using tongs or your hands, coating it entirely with batter.The cookie shouldn't sit in batter too long or it will get soggy, so only dip one at a time and then put it straight in the oil.",How to Make Fried Oreos2," Your batter should not be runny--it should be thick and gooey so it will stick to the cookies.If your batter is too thin, add 1/4 cup of pancake mix.You can substitute funnel cake mix or waffle mix for pancake mix. Make sure it's thick enough to coat the Oreos., The batter should be thick and sticky enough so you can't see through it to the chocolate cookie underneath.

If you hand-dip the cookies, just use one of your hands--then you can use your ""dry hand"" to start frying the cookies and you won't need to stop to wash.
If the cookies are coming apart or crumbling, put them in the freezer for 30-60 minutes. This also prevents the cream center from getting too melted when you fry it.

Serve warm.",How to Make Fried Oreos3," Frying works best in small batches, so fry only 4 or 5 at a time, depending on the size of your pot. The cookies should have enough room to float around without touching each other and sticking together.When adding cookies to the oil, the temperature will drop (especially if you froze the Oreos before hand). Keep the oil between 250ºF-325ºF (121ºC-163ºC) while frying.Attempting to fry large batches will not only cause your batter to stick together, it will also lower the temperature of the oil too low and the dough won't get crispy.Be careful when cooking with hot oil. Don't throw battered cookies into the pot--this would cause spattering, splashing, and a dangerous situation.If you're afraid to use your hand to place the cookies in the oil, use tongs instead., The cookies will float on top of the oil and fry quickly--less than 2 minutes. Don't walk away from the pot or they may burn or over cook.Keep the cookies moving as they fry so they don't stick together.
Allow the oil to heat up between batches, back to 375ºF (191ºC). Use tongs or a strainer to remove bits of batter that may be floating in the oil., Oil remains on the outer fried dough and won't reach the inside batter or cookie. Blotting excess grease will make this decadent treat slightly more healthy.The oil provides the flavor and crunch of the cookie, so don't go overboard and soak up every last drop.You can also drain the cookies on a wire rack, but using absorbent paper towel will remove more grease than letting it drip off on a wire rack., You can reuse the oil for deep frying (make sure to strain and remove any bits of batter floating around) or bring the oil to a donation point (often a waste management facility).Never pour oil down the drain. It will block your plumbing.If you can't find anywhere to recycle your cooking oil, make sure the lid is on tight and throw it in the trash or pour it over weeds.If you plan to reuse your oil within the next few weeks, store it in a cold, dark place or the refrigerator so it will last longer.If you don't have a funnel, pour the cooled oil into a paper cup, then pinch the top of the cup so you can easily pour it into the mouth of the sealable bottle or container.

, You can add a dusting of powdered sugar, vanilla ice cream, a drizzle of chocolate or caramel sauce, whipped cream, or any other garnish you'd like.


Allow the cookies a minute or two to cool so your don't burn yourself, but do eat them while they're still warm! Keep finished cookies in an oven on low heat (about 200ºF or 93ºC) if you're doing a large batch so they will stay warm until they are served."

Add a pinch or two of salt for flavor.,
Bring the water to a boil.,
Allow the asparagus to simmer for 3 to 5 minutes.,
Drain the water.,
Serve your asparagus.",How to Boil Asparagus," The most important step is picking out a good bunch of asparagus. Fresh, healthy asparagus should have the following qualities:A bright green stalk.
Non-shriveled tips.
Firm, not mushy.
Try to get batches that have uniformly-sized stalks. That way they'll all cook at the same rate.;
, Either by holding the stalks in your hand or placing them in a colander, run the asparagus under cold water. Concentrate on the tips, since sand or dirt can get trapped here., While tender at the top, asparagus gets progressively harder towards the base. At the very end, it's almost like wood. You'll want to remove this base before cooking.Grasp the asparagus at the base and the middle.
Bend it until it snaps naturally at the transition point between the tender and hard sections.
Lay the broken stalk flat on a table. Line up the rest of the stalks alongside it to measure how much you'll have to cut.
Use a knife to cut off the rest of the ends simultaneously.
For thicker pieces of asparagus, trim the bottoms of the stalks so they're the same width as the top. This will ensure even cooking.

, This step is optional and can be done if you don't want the flaps on the sides of the stalks to get stuck in your teeth. Use a vegetable peeler to scrape off the scales., If you're not going to cook your asparagus right away, store it to keep it fresh. There are two methods of storing asparagus. Either should keep your asparagus fresh for about 4 days.Wrap the stalks in a damp paper towel. Then seal them in a plastic bag and place in the refrigerator.
Fill a cup or container with 1 inch of water. Place the stalks in the container with the base facing the bottom. Cover the top of the container with a plastic bag and place in the refrigerator.

, This should be large enough so that your asparagus can lay in the pan without bending or breaking., You should lay the stalks side by side rather than piling them on top of each other. That way you'll help all the asparagus cook evenly.

, This could be up to an inch for thick stalks, and as low as a centimeter if your batch of asparagus is especially thin., Sprinkle a bit of salt into the pan. This is an optional step and can be skipped if you don't like salt or have any dietary restrictions.

, Turn on the flame and wait for the water to boil. Place the lid on the pan to heat the water faster., After the water boils, lower the flame and let the water simmer. Keep the pan covered while the asparagus cooks.Be sure to keep an eye on the asparagus to avoid overcooking it. Well-cooked asparagus has a bright green color and a crisp texture. Overcooked asparagus is very mushy and turns a dark shade of green. If your asparagus starts getting dark, turn off the heat and remove it., Carefully pour the water out into the sink. To make this easier, you can strain the asparagus with a colander.

, It can be served hot or cold. There are a number of ways you can jazz up your freshly boiled asparagus, including adding salt, pepper, olive oil, or lemon juice.If serving cold, you have to cool off your asparagus quickly so it doesn't get mushy. You can do this by quickly placing the asparagus in a bowl of ice water."

Use caution with spirulina supplements.,

Add algae to your recipes.",How to Add Algae to Your Diet1," While spirulina is being touted by some as a ""miracle"" food, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has not found enough scientific evidence to prove that spirulina is effective in treating any health condition.And though spirulina contains many essential nutrients (calcium, niacin, potassium, magnesium, B vitamins, iron, essential amino acids) it is not known how much of the nutrient your body can actually absorb from spirulina. Spirulina is probably safe for most healthy adults, but if contaminated, it can cause liver damage, nausea, vomiting, thirst, weakness, rapid heartbeat, shock and even death. Carefully research the source of any supplements to ensure they are tested for toxins and are grown in safe conditions.Speak with your doctor, registered dietitian, and/or pharmacist before trying spirulina. Get advice on dosing from your doctor, as there has not been enough testing to establish a safe dose range.
People with multiple sclerosis (MS), lupus (systemic lupus erythematosus, SLE), rheumatoid arthritis, and other autoimmune conditions should not take spirulina.
Do not give spirulina to children. Pregnant or breastfeeding women should avoid spirulina.
Note that the FDA does not regulate supplements for content, labeling, or safety. Look for products that have been tested by an outside source, such as USP or NSF.;
, This fresh-water algae is thought to help with a multitude of conditions, from preventing cancer to treating skin ulcers. It contains protein, fats, carbohydrates, fiber, chlorophyll, vitamins, and minerals. The quality of the product can vary wildly, so it is important that you thoroughly research the source of the supplement before purchasing.Speak with your doctor, registered dietitian, and/or pharmacist before trying chlorella. An appropriate range of doses for chlorella has not yet been established, so consult with your doctor about how much to take.
People with multiple sclerosis (MS), lupus (systemic lupus erythematosus, SLE), rheumatoid arthritis, and other autoimmune conditions should not take chlorella.
Do not give chlorella to children. Pregnant or breastfeeding women should avoid chlorella.
You can find chlorella supplements in tablet or capsule form.
Chlorella supplements can be purchased at most health food stores or online health retailers.
Note that the FDA does not regulate supplements for content, labeling, or safety. Look for products that have been tested by an outside source, such as USP or NSF and ask your pharmacist to recommend a reputable brand.

, You may be able to purchase spirulina powder at your local health food store or online. Likewise, you can find nori seaweed and even kelp at many health food and grocery stores. Try picking up some spirulina powder, kelp and nori and experiment with adding these various algae to your recipes.

Add nori to a salad. Simply shred up the algae and add it to a salad recipe. It will add a hint of saltiness to your recipe, so you may not need to add salt to the dressing.
Add some kelp or spirulina powder in a smoothie. You may want to also add lemon juice or another citrus flavor with the algae powders because of the strong taste of algae. Experiment with a small amount such as half a teaspoon and work your way up to larger amounts as you become comfortable with the flavor of algae.
Sprinkle spirulina on air-popped popcorn for a high-fiber, low-calorie snack.
Remember to consult with your doctor before using spirulina.

Use a lot of water.,
Cook the vegetables without a cover.,
Use a high heat level.,
Test for doneness.,
Serve immediately.",How to Blanch Green Vegetables," Use 2.8 litres/ 3 quarts of water per 450 g / 1 pound of vegetables. There needs to be enough water to allow the vegetables to cook quickly; less water would cause the vegetables to stew and they will become limp, losing colour, texture, and nutrition.;
, It is fine to cover the pot when bringing the water to the boil but the blanching part should be done without the lid. Otherwise, you will trap the volatile acids released by the vegetables during cooking and this will cause the vegetables to become limp and deteriorate in color.

, Boiling water is important for keeping the green vegetables in top condition. The vegetables should be cooked as quickly as possible and boiling water will enable this.

, To know when a vegetable is cooked by blanching, use a slotted spoon to remove a piece from the boiling water and taste it. If the texture is to your liking, it is done. As a general guide:



Leaf vegetables - removed and drain as soon as they stop being stiff

Tough greens, or strong-tasting greens - cook for up to 5 minutes, long enough to soften their texture and improve the flavour

, Drain and serve. Don't leave them to sit or they're freshness will deteriorate. If you must leave them, plunge them into ice water and serve reheated or cold later.

Make a seaweed salad.,
Make sunomono.,
Make a seaweed dressing.,
Try a seaweed soup.",How to Add Seaweed to Your Diet1," Seaweed salad is popular in Japan, and it’s a cinch to make. Just put 30 grams (one ounce) of dry mixed seaweed in a bowl. Fill the bowl with cold water. Let the seaweed rehydrate for five minutes if you like crunchy seaweed. If you like softer seaweed, allow it to rehydrate for 10 minutes.In a small mixing bowl, combine one tablespoon of rice vinegar, one tablespoon toasted sesame oil, one tablespoon soy sauce, one tablespoon sugar, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon ginger juice. Add an additional teaspoon of rice vinegar for good measure.
Drain the seaweed. Wring out any excess water by squeezing it gently by hand. Wipe the bowl down and put the seaweed back in the bowl.
Pour the ginger/soy sauce dressing over it. Mix the dressing and seaweed so that the seaweed is thoroughly coated. Top with one tablespoon toasted sesame seeds and one diced scallion.
Seaweed salad is great on its own or as a topping for burgers.;
, Sunomono is a twist on the regular seaweed salad. To get started, combine 1/4 cup (60 milliliters) rice vinegar, 1/8 teaspoon soy sauce, two tablespoons soy sauce, and 1.5 teaspoons lemon juice in a small bowl. Set aside.Put 2.5 tablespoons dried wakame seaweed in a bowl with 1.5 cups (360 milliliters) of water. Set aside for about 10 minutes and allow the seaweed to rehydrate.
Slice two or three Japanese or Persian cucumbers into thin slices. In a third bowl, mix the cucumber slices with a generous amount of salt. Allow the salt to remove moisture from the cucumber for about 10 minutes.
Rinse the cucumber slices off in a colander. Gently squeeze any water that may have been reabsorbed by placing the slices between a few sheets of paper towel and pressing the water out.
Mix the cucumber and wakame, then pour a tablespoon or two of the dressing over each serving.

, Instead of making seaweed the star of your salad, give it a supporting role. Heat two toasted nori sheets up in the oven on your oven’s lowest setting. Check the sheets frequently. When they turn slightly brown and crispy, remove them. Break them into smaller pieces and grind them with a mortar and pestle.Pour the nori dust in a blender and combine with one tablespoon orange zest, ½ tablespoon salt, two tablespoons sesame oil, and ¾ cup (180 milliliters) of rice wine vinegar.
Pour it in an empty dressing bottle or squirt bottle. Refrigerate and shake well before use.
Seaweed dressing is great over roasted veggies or salads, and also works well as a marinade for fish.

, Seaweed soup is a popular dish in Korea, where it is known as miyeokguk. To make some tasty seaweed soup for yourself, soak one ounce of dried brown seaweed in warm water for about 10 minutes.Drain the water and gently squeeze out excess water by hand. Cut the seaweed into two-inch (five-centimeter) strips.
Coat a saucepan with two teaspoons of sesame oil, then add 1/4 pound (113 grams) minced beef top sirloin, ½ tablespoon soy sauce, a pinch of salt. Cook over medium heat for one minute.
Stir in the rehydrated seaweed and one tablespoon soy sauce. Cook for one minute. Stir frequently.
Pour two cups (475 milliliters) of water into the saucepan. Bring the pan to a boil. Add one teaspoon minced garlic and four cups water.
Return the pan to a boil, then cover. Reduce heat and simmer for 20 minutes. Remove from heat and allow to cool slightly before eating. Add salt to taste.

Cut the fruit as if you were making fruit salad without any seeds or orange peels.,
Cut off a small chunk of dry ice from the block.,
Put the dry ice into the plastic bottles, seal the top, and wait a day or two.,
Open the bottle and bleed the pressure by opening the cap carefully, keeping it turned away from your face and eyes, as you would when opening a soda bottle that had been shaken.",How to Make Carbonated Fruit," Peel the skin off the apples and discard. Place all cut fruit in a plastic bottle with a pop off top bottle. The pop off top acts as a safety valve.;
, Only about 2 grams is needed, or a piece about half the size of a thumb. There is no harm in putting in too little dry ice - you will simply end up with only slightly fizzy fruit. We are looking for only a little bit of pressure (approximately 30 psi) and so there is no need to add a big hunk of dry ice. The dry ice in the picture below (roughly 5 square inches or 30 square centimeters) was enough for the plastic bottle of fruit.

, Watch as it turns into its gaseous phase. Most of the dry ice will sublimate in an hour and fully pressurize the plastic bottle. Wrap the bottle in a towel to prevent injury if it explodes. Then place in the refrigerator for the night before opening.

, Pour the fruit out of the bottle and it's ready to eat! It loses its fizz quickly, so make sure you serve it in the first 15 minutes after opening. Carbonated fruit tastes like regular fruit, but it tingles on your tongue. It's a totally unique experience to eat, and makes you burp if you have done it right.

Get seedless grapes.,
Keep predators away from your homegrown grapes.,
Wash the grapes.,
Stem the grapes.,
Use the dehydrator.,
Test for dryness.,
Store the raisins.,
Test jars for seal.",How to Make Raisins Using a Food Dehydrator," There are many brands, types, and colors of seedless grapes.


A very common homegrown grape variety is the Thompson Seedless. It is prolific in bearing so you can make lots of grapes from one vine. It is self pollinating and can be trained as a climber, on a fence, or on a post with a 'T' arm, for a single specimen in your landscape. The grapes are medium size and greenish yellow at ripe stage. High in sugar, this grape dries faster than large seedless grapes.
All grapes take three years from planting to produce a crop. To get a large crop takes winter pruning, a little natural fertilizer in the spring and water through the dry season. With this little attention you'll have your own organic raisins drying in your dehydrator in September.;
, Birds love grapes, so be ready to pick the grapes when you see some falling on the ground. It doesn't matter if the grapes are so over-ripe that they're falling off the stems. They are just sweeter that way.


Hold a pan under the clusters as you cut them from the vine. This way those very ripe ones will go to you, and not to the birds.

, Remove the fruit from the stems after washing. Fill the sink full of grape clusters, fill the sink with water. Then swish the bunches and put them into the other sink with the drain strainer open, to drip. Of course, you can use a pan and colander to do this and if you have a lot of grapes, your dish drainer works well with its tray under it. This leaves your second sink free for other things. Let the grapes drip for about an hour so they won't be adding moisture to the dehydrator.

, When you remove the grapes from the stems, pay attention to the small top of the grape stems. If you're stripping the grapes with your hand you should do it in a flat baking pan. When you have a full layer in the bottom of the pan you can turn the grapes with the flat of your hand and see all of the small stems that are still stuck to the top of the grapes. They do not belong on your raisins. Remove them, then pour the grapes onto the dehydrator tray.


When you get down past the middle of the rack of grapes, you may find the lower layers of grapes are still pretty wet. After you've finished stemming them, turn the pan full of grapes onto a towel and roll the them with the flat of your hand. This will dry them enough to make them ready for the dehydrator tray.

, When the trays are full, close the dehydrator and turn on the motor. The temperature should be at its highest setting for the first twelve hours at least. If you must turn the trays, you will have to leave the heat on high another twelve hours. The skins on the raisins hold in the moisture and juice and you are making sure all of the grapes are warm enough to prevent souring.


Turn the heat down to medium-high level, only after the drying grapes all look pretty dark and you can see they're drying out. These pretty little green grapes will turn a dark brown and look just like raisins in a couple of days.
It will usually take two to three days to dry the raisins in a good dehydrator.
If your dehydrator doesn't have a fan and heat mechanism, it is better to use your oven. Grapes will mold if the heat does not get hot enough to turn the juice to sugar within the skin.

, Squeeze several dark, drying grapes on the tray. If you feel them slip inside the skins, they're not dry enough. This means that they will mold in storage. If they feel firm, but pliable, they are done.


You can dry the grapes till they are hard. This allows you to store more in a container, and you know they will last indefinitely. When you go to use the raisins, put your recipe amount in a cup, add a spoon full or two of water, cover and steam for one-half to one minute in the microwave. This puffs them up like store bought raisins. If using for a salad or other recipe not in baking, pour the little bit of water left in the cup out and let the steam dry the raisins.

, Sometimes one is given a picking of grapes from a friend and may only get the one picking and need to store them for future use. Or you may have your own and want to do long term storage where the grapes can keep for more than a year.


Storage for one or two years: Raisins dried hard in your dehydrator will keep in storage for a couple of years if you seal the lid with paraffin. This lets you use plastic peanut butter jars and the like to store in. Just melt the paraffin in in a tin can and pour it around the edges of the lid. Dump out the excess paraffin and screw the lid on the jar while the wax is still warm. Old candle butts can be used for this. The principle for this type of storage is to keep bugs from creeping into the threads of the jar and entering the food area.
Storage with no time limit: If you have a pressure canner, you can pack quart (4 cups) jars, seal, and place in the canner. Pressure at 5 pounds (2.26kg) pressure for forty minutes.
Oven method: Since not everyone has a canner, it is easy to can raisins in your oven.

Pack into clean sterilized jars adding one tablespoon of water. Wipe the top of the jar with a clean damp cloth to remove any minute particles that are on the rim from filling the jar.
Put a sterilized lid on the jar, screw the band down firmly and place the jar on the bottom rack of your oven.
When all the jars are in the oven, turn the heat on to 250ºF (120ºC) and process for one hour.
Turn the oven off and let the jars cool in the oven. To speed this up you can crack the oven door but not wide open, as a draft can crack your hot jars. Canned, your raisins will keep indefinitely. Don't worry about an expiration date. There is none on the sealed jars.



, To test the cooled jars for seal, use a teaspoon handle and tap the top of the jar. If it sounds like a plink, instead of plunk, it is sealed.


Saving an unsealed jar of raisins: If you get a jar that does not seal, just stick it in the back of your refrigerator and use it within the year. They won't spoil in the fridge, but could mold on the shelf because of the water you used in the jar to make the steam for canning.

Cook your rice.,
Marinate the tofu.,
Prepare your veggies.,
Assemble the sushi.,
Roll the sushi.",How to Add Seaweed to Your Diet2," Sushi (or its Korean cousin, gimbap) is the most popular and well-known food containing seaweed. To get started making sushi, cook two cups (360 grams) of short-grain white rice., While the rice is cooking, combine two teaspoons honey, one teaspoon minced garlic, and ¼ cup (60 milliliters) soy sauce in a wide pan. Chop three ounces (85 grams) of firm tofu into ½ inch (one centimeter) wide strips. Marinate the strips in the soy sauce/garlic mix., While the rice is cooking and the tofu is marinating, julienne one small carrot, half of a cucumber, and half of an avocado. Once the rice has cooked for about 20 minutes, mix two tablespoons rice vinegar into it., Place a sheet of nori on a cutting board or large flat surface in front of you. Spread a thin layer of rice evenly across the surface of the nori. Leave a gap at the top and bottom edge of the nori sheet. Lay the tofu strips on the rice in a top-to-bottom orientation. But don’t use it all at once. Put only enough to stretch from the top edge of the nori sheet to the bottom in a thin line. Do the same with the carrot strips, avocado, and cucumber., Turn the nori sheet so that the fillings are now oriented in a side-to-side position. From the end closest to you, gently roll the sushi away from you to form as tight a cylinder as possible. If you have a bamboo sushi-rolling mat, you can use it to make a prettier and more symmetrical sushi roll. You’ll need to remove and readjust the position of the mat temporarily to allow you to continue rolling, otherwise you’ll end up rolling the mat right into the roll.Cut the sushi roll into slices ½ inch (one centimeter) wide using a sharp knife.
This recipe should provide enough tofu, rice, and veggies to make four or five sushi rolls.
There are many opportunities for experimenting with sushi. You can add fish or crab meat, cream cheese, radish, beets, cucumber, and many other fillings.

To get started, blend 12 ounces (340 grams) of raw sunflower seeds until they resemble a fine dust. Scoop the blended seeds out and into a bowl., Wipe the food processor out and add eight ounces (230 grams) raw pumpkin seeds, four minced garlic cloves, two red bell peppers, one cup of water, six tablespoons of lemon juice, one teaspoon salt, one tablespoon raw grated beet, two teaspoons onion powder, and a generous pinch of cayenne pepper (add more if you like your veggie jim spicy). Blend on high until smooth.Add the sunflower seed paste back to the mix and blend again. Your mix should become a mushy paste.
You may need to add slightly more water (one spoonful at a time) in order to get the mixture to achieve the proper consistency.
Fill a resealable plastic bag with the mixture. Snip one corner off so that you can squeeze the paste from the bag as you would through a piping bag.

, Lay a strip of nori, shiny side down, on some parchment paper. The strip should be about two inches (four centimeters) wide and six inches (15 centimeters) long. Use a spray bottle to spray the nori with a light mist of water., Push the paste out of the bag and lengthwise down the center of the nori. Guide the tip extruding the paste from the top to the bottom of the sheet, squeezing continuously so as to allow an even strip of paste to exit the bag. The paste strip should be no wider than about ¼ or ½ inch (about 3/4 centimeter)., Roll the sides of the nori strip over the paste into a tight tube. You can roll the right side over to the left or the left side over to the right. Do not squeeze the tubes as your roll them or the contents will be ejected from either end.If the tubes are not sealing properly when rolled, spray the edges lightly with your spray bottle again.
Set the tubes in your dehydrator overnight. Check them in the morning. Take a bite. They are ready when dried out. You can store the veggie jims in an airtight container.

You can also spread it on sandwiches and wraps., Seaweed can be added to almost any smoothie in the form of kelp powder and dulse flakes. You can add half a teaspoon or more, to taste. Don’t add too much, though, as seaweed tends to have a relatively salty flavor.For instance, mix one banana, one mango, four strawberries, one packed cup of kale, one cup (240 milliliters) of milk, three ice cubes, and one teaspoon of dulse flakes in your blender. Blend on high until everything is well mixed. Add more water in one-teaspoon increments if you find it is too thick.

, Seaweed tea is easy to make. Boil 120 milliliters (½ cup) of water. Place ½ teaspoon of powdered kombu in a mug. Pour the boiling water over the kombu and mix it gently for a few seconds. Allow tea to stand about five minutes. Drink and enjoy., Seaweed supplements have all the benefits that direct seaweed consumption has, but allow you to obtain them without actually adding seaweed foods to your diet. There are many brands of seaweed supplements available. Ask your doctor for a recommendation of a reputable seaweed supplement at a concentration that is compatible with your age, sex, and overall health.Claims that iodine in seaweed can protect against radioactive iodine should not be taken seriously."

Take about 1 1/2 lbs (680 g) of asparagus and remove the root ends so that the asparagus are all about 5 inches (13 cm) long.
Carefully wash each stalk of asparagus under cold running water to remove any dirt. Asparagus shoots grow up through the dirt so they can be quite dirty. Optionally, carefully peel the skins of the stalks with a peeler below the tips. The skin can be slightly bitter, so removing them can improve the overall taste of the dish.
Lightly dry the asparagus with a clean kitchen towel, then toss it with 1 tbsp. (15 ml) of good quality olive oil and season it lightly with salt and pepper.;
, Quickly count the number of asparagus spears. You need one strip of bacon to wrap each bundle of 4 to 5 asparagus spears. Divide the number of spears by 4 or 5 and use that number of bacon strips.


Lay the strips of center cut, thick cut bacon on a cookie sheet. Alternatively, trim the fatty ends from 4 strips of thick cut bacon and lay them on a baking sheet.

,

Remove the bacon to a paper towel to allow it to drain and cool.

, Lay one strip of bacon horizontally in front of you on a clean work surface. Lay 4 to 5 asparagus spears, bud ends all together, perpendicularly at one end of the bacon. The spears cut ends should be hang about 1/2 inch (1.5 cm) below the bacon.


Wrap the bacon tightly around the asparagus as you roll the asparagus bundle. Allow the bacon to wind its way up the asparagus but stop before you get to the tips. Lay the wrapped bundles, seam side down, on a cookie sheet or other transportable flat surface. Now you can either roast or grill the asparagus.

, Preheat the oven to 450ºF (230ºC). Place the asparagus on the flat top of a broiler pan with slots to allow the bacon to drain. When the oven is heated, place the asparagus in the oven and let it roast for about 10 minutes, slightly longer if the asparagus spears are thick. The bacon should be crisp and the asparagus tender.

, Preheat the grill to medium high. When the grill has reached the appropriate heat level, transfer the bundles to the grill with tongs. Lay the bundles seam side down. Let them grill for about 5 minutes then turn the bundles and cook for an additional 5 minutes. Turn the heat down if you get flare-ups. The bacon should be crisp and the asparagus tender. Remove and serve immediately.

Serve.",How to Cure Meat1," Ham is a popular choice for curing, but you can use anything from beef to venison and much more in between. With a good piece of meat, you really can't go wrong, although the first-time curers might want to go with a more forgiving piece of meat, like pork belly or pork butt.


For the most part, use meats with whole muscle groups in their anatomical connection. Pork loin and belly, beef hindquarter or brisket, mutton legs and even duck breast are popular cuts for dry-curing.;
, Say you're trying to make Capicola charcuterie. You might buy a boneless pork shoulder, and then cut the picnic end of the pork shoulder from the pork butt, leaving you with two distinct cuts of meat. You can then use the picnic end of the shoulder in a sausage, for example, and the butt in your dry-cure charcuterie.

, You don't have to stab the meat before applying the dry rub, but for certain cuts of meat — larger cuts or cuts like pork belly, which are often covered with a lining of fat — stabbing the meat allows the salt and nitrite mix to penetrate deeper into the meat, improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the cure.

, Dry-curing with salt will sap away the moisture from the meat and intensify the flavor of the meat, but it still won't eliminate the possibility of botulism spores germinating.To combat botulism, sodium nitrite is often used in combination with salt as ""curing salts,"" ""Instacure #1,"" and ""pink salts."" Botulism is a dangerous illness characterized by paralysis and respiratory problems caused by the bacteria Clostridium botulinum.Consult manufacturer's instructions for how much curing salt to use alongside regular salt. Usually, a 10:90 ratio of pink salt to regular salt is called for.
If you are particular about exactly what goes into your cured meat, it might be best to add the sodium nitrite on your own. (See next step.) Most casual curers, however, will find it easiest to use pre-mixed curing salts, where they won't have to fuss with the ratio of salt to sodium nitrite.
Why are pink salts pink? Manufacturers of pink salt purposely dye the salt for cooks so that they don't confuse curing salt with regular salt. That's because, in large quantities, sodium nitrite is toxic.Accidentally using pink salt instead of regular salt in your chicken soup, for example, could be very unfortunate. The pink dye itself does not influence the final color of the cured meat; the sodium nitrite does.

, If you want to make your own curing salts, be sure to nail the ratio of sodium nitrite to salt. For every 2 grams (0.071 oz) of sodium nitrite, for example, use 1,000 grams (35.3 oz) of salt. Another way to do this is to take the total weight of your salt, multiply it by .002, and use that much sodium nitrite in your mix.

, Spices add a rich dimension of flavor to your cured meats. While it's important not to get too carried away and spice the meat to oblivion, a good spice mix will intensify flavors and add distinct profiles to your cures. In a small spice grinder, grind up your spices and add them to the curing salt/salt mixture. Here are some suggestions for spices to use:


Peppercorns. Black, green, or white are essential in most spice mixes. There's a reason they call peppercorns the ""master spice.""
Sugar. A little Demerara sugar adds a touch of caramel sweetness to your cure.
Coriander and mustard seed. Adds smokiness to the meat.
Star anise. Silky and slightly sweet, a little bit goes a long way. Slightly nutty.
Fennel seed. Adds a pleasantly green or grassy dimension to the cure.
Citrus zest. Adds a light, pleasantly acidic element that cuts through fattier pieces of meat.

, Cover a tray with parchment and line the bottom generously with your curing salt and spice mix. Place your meat on the bed of curing salt (fat side up, if appropriate) and cover the top of the meat with your remaining mix for equal coverage. If desired, cover the top of the meat with another piece of parchment, then another tray, and finally a pair of bricks or another heavy object to weight the meat down.


Do not use metal trays for this step without parchment. The metal reacts with the salt and sodium nitrite. If using a metal tray for underlayment, always use a piece of parchment between it and the salt mix.
If you have a round piece of meat and want to keep it (more or less) round, you don't have to weight it down. The salt will do its job naturally. Weighting down is preferable for a pork belly, for example, that you later want to roll into shape.

, Allow for adequate airflow by leaving at least a small portion of the meat uncovered. After 7 to 10 days, a lot of the moisture should have been drawn out by the salt.

, Under cold water, remove as much of the salt/spice mix as possible and allow to briefly air-dry over an elevated rack. Take a paper towel, as insurance, and wipe away any excess moisture before proceeding to the next step.

, Most cured meats will not need to be rolled into shape at this point, but some will. If you're taking pork belly, for example, and trying to make pancetta, you want to start with a rectangular piece of pork belly and roll up the longer end very tightly. The tighter the roll, the less space there is for mold or other bacteria to inhabit.


If you are rolling the cured meat, it helps to start with an even square or, usually, rectangle. Cut off pieces of meat on all four sides until you have a neat rectangle. Save the scraps for soups or render off the fat separately.

, Tightly wrapping the meat in cheesecloth will help wick away any moisture that forms on the outside of the meat, keeping it dry while it ages. Fold the cheesecloth over both sides of the meat, bunch the cheesecloth up at both ends, and tie the ends into knots. If possible, create a second knot at the top of the cheesecloth into which you can pry your hanging hook.

, Especially if dealing with a rolled piece of meat, trussing will help the meat stay tightly rolled and keep its shape. Use butcher's twine and simply tie off every inch until the length of the meat is trussed. Remove any dangling pieces of twine with shears.

, A walk-in refrigerator is ideal, being cool and dark, but anywhere that doesn't get a lot of light and doesn't exceed 70 degrees Fahrenheit (21 degrees Celsius) will work.

, After you've removed the trussing and cheesecloth, cut thin slices of the cured meat and enjoy. Store any cured meat you don't use immediately in a refrigerator.

Smoke the meat.",How to Cure Meat2," Wet-brining is great for ham or other smoking recipes. Try wet-curing your Christmas ham, for example, and then finishing it off in the smoker for a delicious recipe.

, Making a simple brine, and then adding the nitrites in the curing salt (which will cure the meat) is all it takes to wet-cure meat. Try this basic brine recipe, or research brines with added nitrite for a different kind of taste. In one gallon of water, bring the following ingredients to a boil and then allow brine to cool completely:


2 cups brown sugar
1 and 1/2 cups kosher salt
1/2 cup of pickling spice
8 teaspoons of pink salt (not to be confused with sodium nitrite)

, A brining bag is essential for larger cuts of meat, like a Christmas ham. Smaller cuts of meat can simply go in resealable freezer bags, but make sure that there's enough room for the meat and brine to rest comfortably in. For larger cuts of meat, Place the brining bag in a larger tub or container first, and then fill with brine. Add 1⁄2 gallon (1.9 L) to 1 gallon (3.8 L) of ice water to the brine to dilute the concentrated brine. Mix thoroughly before sealing.

, If you have a five pound piece of meat, brine for approximately two and a half days. Turn the meat every 24 hours if possible. The salt in the brine tends to be thicker on the bottom half of the brine and turning the meat allows the brine to work evenly.


Change the brine after 7 days during the curing process to help prevent spoiling.

,,, Wet-cured meat, such as ham, is great after smoking. Smoke your wet-cured meat in a smoker and serve on a special occasion.

Enjoy!",How to Cook Venison Steak," You need to choose the best quality venison available to you. Like any other meat, venison's final taste is highly dependent on its origin. Ask questions when shopping around and, if the only produce available comes from a supermarket, surely go for the organic variety of it.


Try to get something of about half an inch thick regardless of the overall size.;
, The marinade is essential when it comes to game. Think about countries or regions of the world when it comes to spices and flavours.


For example, to give it a traditional flair, use about a tablespoon each of shallots, garlic and a very high quality raspberry vinegar together with not-so-cheap olive oil.
Cut the shallots and the garlic as small as possible (Brunoise). Put them in a vinaigrette of olive oil and raspberry vinegar, with a generous pinch of salt and pepper.

, Then rub the mixture on the meat. The rubbing in process is not-negotiable!

, Let the meat 'soak' in the flavours for about an hour and you are ready to go.

, Most people are somehow afraid of eating reddish meat. Don't be scared off by red juices. There is some real chemistry going on in the mouth when you taste the juices. Take advantage of it.

, Seriously, make it smoke!

, What you want is black lines that sear the meat and concentrate flavour.


Note: If your marinade is oily enough, your steaks will not stick to the pan.

, Then remove it from the heat.

, If you don't, your meat will resemble shoe's soles. The resting period is essential, so please do not ignore it.


If your searing process was done correctly, when cutting your steak you should have a maximum of 1 mm thick browned meat on each side of the steak. The in-between should be furiously red.

, Salad for summer and steamed potatoes for winter are both excellent sides for your steaks.

Use only venison that has been field-dressed correctly.,
Trim away all visible fat.,
Marinate the meat overnight before cooking it.,
Substitute the removed deer fat with another fat source.,
Match the cut to the cooking method.",How to Cook Venison (Deer Meat)1," The longer the meat stays on the deer carcass after the animal was shot, the tougher it becomes. Choose only deer meat that was cut, skinned, wrapped and refrigerated promptly by a professional or an experienced deer butcher.


Venison should also be aged for a period of 10-14 days after being dressed out. This allows the meat to dry out some, reducing the gaminess and making the meat more palatable.;
, Unlike beef fat, which imbues the meat with flavor and helps to keep the meat moist, venison fat does not taste good, and will do nothing for the texture of the meat. Using a sharp knife, trim away the connective tissue and fat from your cuts of venison before attempting to cook it.


You can discard deer fat, though it's also commonly rendered into tallow, and makes for excellent soaps, and suets for feeding birds.""Silverskin"" is a thin membrane that you'll find on many recently-processed cuts of venison, which you'll want to remove if it hasn't been already. It can be somewhat tedious, but peeling it off the meat as much as possible will improve the flavor and also make it easier to cook.

, Venison has a strong, gamey flavor that you can highlight or mask, depending on the cut and what you hope to do with it. Learning a bit about how to match a cut to a marinade will help you tenderize the meat and add flavor. The best way to marinade venison is in a large gallon Ziplock bag in the refrigerator overnight.

Use thinner cuts with marinade and brine larger cuts. At most, an overnight marinade will only penetrate about an 1/8th on an inch into the meat, making marinading a large roast kind of pointless. Use thin strips of flank or backstrap to marinade to get the most out of the process.For a simple marinade, use Italian salad dressing, or make your own with a half-cup each of vinegar and olive oil, a clove of minced garlic, and a teaspoon each of brown mustard and Italian seasoning (or oregano and basil).
For a BBQ marinade, sautee half a finely-chopped yellow onion and 3-4 cloves of minced garlic in about 5 tablespoons of butter until translucent. To this, add two cups of tomato sauce (or a cup of ketchup), a half cup each of apple cider, apple cider vinegar, and brown sugar, and two tablespoons of chili powder.
If you're not a fan of the ""gaminess"" of venison, use a citrus-based marinade. Citrus tends to mask the strong flavor of venison, and can make it more palatable to children and less adventurous eaters. Try marinading a half-cup of lime juice mixed with a half-cup of olive oil, half a cup of chopped cilantro, a minced green chile, a teaspoon of ground cumin, and a shot of tequila.

, Although the deer's own fat will affect the flavor of the venison adversely, venison lacks the ""marbling"" needed to keep it moist and tender, making it very easy to dry it out. Because of this, many experienced venison cooks will ""bard"" or ""lard"" the meat with another fat source, such as butter, margarine, oil, or bacon fat.Barding is done by adding fat to the outside of the meat. This method works best on the grill or in the skillet, because it involves essentially basting the meat with a fat source. After turning the meat over, you can brush some melted butter or olive oil onto the browned side of the meat to imbue flavor and moisture.
Larding is done by inserting fat into the meat, through little cuts. This method works well for larger cuts and roasts that you cook in the oven, and works especially will with other meats like ham or bacon. Use the tip of a chef's knife to make incisions into the thick parts of your venison roast, then push small cuts of bacon, or fatty pork, into the slits. As it cooks, the fat will help to keep the meat moist.

, Different cuts are more appropriate for different cooking methods. Some are great cooked up as steaks, while others make better stew meats or candidates for venison sausage.Whether you have a specific dish in mind and want to get the right venison for the job, or you want to find the best vehicle for your cuts, you can point yourself in the right direction:

Backstraps or tenderloin are the tenderest and usually the most desirable cut, and can be cooked whole, cut into individual steaks, or cut into smaller chunks for stews and stir-frys. Tenderloin can be served rare-medium.
Roasts are best from the lower hams, which should be braised or stewed at a low temperature for a long period of time to ensure tenderness.
Steaks are best from the top half of the hams, which are the most versatile section of venison. While it's initially a bit tough, after being properly-tenderized, this meat can be used for a variety of purposes.
Stew meat should come form the lower ribs, the belly, and the neck. If you've got a meat grinder, this also makes excellent ground venison or venison sausage.

Grill the steak or cook it in a skillet.,
Bring the steak up to room temperature before cooking.,
Season both sides of the steak with salt and pepper.,
Sear both sides.,
Bard the meat with butter.,
Cook the steak to rare-medium.,
Rest the steak for 5-7 minutes.",How to Cook Venison (Deer Meat)2," The best ways to cook venison steaks are on a hot grill, or in a very hot skillet on the stove. Both methods afford the ability to sear the meat and cook it to the proper internal temperature, essential for a venison steak cooked properly.

Both gas grills and charcoal grills are perfectly appropriate, if you want to imbue the meat with that smokey flavor associated with grilling. Heat the coals for 30 minutes before grilling, or turn the gas grill onto medium.
A good cast-iron skillet is the perfect way to cook a venison steak on the stove. Heat the pan on medium-high heat, and add a tablespoon or two of olive oil before cooking. The pan needs to be hot before adding the meat, to get the right sear on the outside. Wait until the oil is just about to smoke to add the steak.

, 20-30 minutes before cooking your venison steak, it's important to take it out of the refrigerator and out of any marinade that you've used to bring the meat up to room temperature, ensuring that the meat is at an even temperature throughout.

If you add a steak to a hot pan or grill grate just out of the fridge, the outside will heat while the inside will remain cold, making it very difficult to cook to the proper internal temperature without burning the outside black. Cooking room-temperature meat is much easier and more efficient, yielding a better finished product.

, Regardless of whether or not you've used a marinade, it's a good idea to sprinkle fresh-cracked pepper and salt on the outside of both sides of the steak, just before it goes on the heat. Salting the meat too early can draw some of the moisture out, making it tough, so it's better to wait until just before the meat goes onto the grill., A steak is best cooked at medium-high heat, so add your steak to a skillet just as the oil smokes, or to the grill over the hottest part of the coals. You should hear a distinctive sizzle when adding the steak, and if you don't, you should remove the meat right away and wait until it gets hotter. The meat should be cooked 3-4 minutes on each side to get a proper crust on the outside, then moved to a cooler part of the grill, or the skillet should be turned down.If you're cooking your steak in a cast-iron skillet, remember that your skillet will hold the temperature for a long time and stay hot, so after giving it a sear, it's probably ok to turn the heat off completely to avoid scorching the outside of the steak.
The length of the sear will depend on the thickness of your steak. Even steaks an more than an inch thick should only be in the pan for about 10-12 minutes at the most, though. Keep a close eye on the meat and check the underside to make sure it's not over-cooking.
Venison is done at an internal temperature of 130 °F (54 °C). At 150, it will start to toughen up some. Steaks more than 2-inches thick will probably need a cooler part of the grill to cook for slightly longer, or will need to have the heat turned down on the skillet to cook to the proper temperature., If you've ever wondered why your steaks at home don't turn out quite so well as steaks ordered at a restaurant, the answer is butter. After turning the meat over once, it's a good idea to brush a little butter onto the top of the meat to help keep it moist. If you're cooking the steak in the skillet, add a pat (no more than a tablespoon or so) into the pan to melt, tilting the skillet so the butter runs toward the steak., You won't have to fiddle with the steak much, turning it once and cooking it roughly 3-4 minutes on each side. Because overcooking venison is very easy and can happen very quickly, you should periodically feel the done-ness of the meat with your finger to recognize when it's ready to come off the heat and rest before eating.

For a good short-hand to steak done-ness, touch your fingertip to your thumb, and with your other hand feel the fatty part of your thumb, where it meets your palm. Meat cooked rare should offer the same resistance. Meat cooked medium-rare should feel like your thumb meeting your middle finger, medium should feel like your ring finger, and well-done like your pinkie.

, Let the steak rest on a plate or a cutting board for at least five minutes before slicing into and serving. This will allow the muscle fibers to cool down some, so the meat will retain its juices, rather than spilling them out onto the plate. The meat will also continue cooking gently, if you cover it at this point. You can serve your steaks whole, or slice them against the grain into generous-sized slices."

Lard the roast with aromatics and bacon.,
Coat the roast with dried herbs and refrigerate for several hours.,
Bake the roast in baking pan on a bed of vegetables.,
Cover and roast at 325 F for about 3 hours.",How to Cook Venison (Deer Meat)3," After cleaning up your roast by trimming it of fat, silverskin, and connective tissue, make several slits into the meat, about an inch wide and two inches deep. Make 10 or 12 cuts all over the surface of the meat. Stuffing the roast with aromatic vegetables and a fat source, like bacon, will help to inject flavor and moisture into the meat.

For aromatics, use whole cloves of garlic, sprigs of rosemary, thyme, or sage.
For adding fat, chopped bacon makes the best addition, but you could also use cold pats of butter.

, Dry rubs are excellent for venison roasts. You can use a commercial dry rub or mix up your own in a variety of flavors. Use what tastes you like and experiment with different dry rubs–it's awfully hard to screw up. Simply take a handful of your dry rub spice mixture and rub it into the outside of the meat.

For a basic dry rub, mix up equal portions of oregano, basil, parsley, paprika, onion powder, salt and pepper.
For a whole-seed dry rub, toast up a quarter-cup each of fennel seeds, coriander seeds, and cumin seeds in a dry skillet. When they become fragrant, remove them from the pan and crack them with the flat side of a kitchen knife. Mix in dried chili powder, paprika, and brown sugar.
Alternatively, you can also brine roasts in a salt brine overnight, which many venison-enthusiasts swear by. Salt-brines can help soften the flavor of the meat and tenderize it. Either way, let the meat refrigerate overnight, or for several hours before baking.

, Lining the bottom of your baking pan with vegetables will help to keep the meat off the bottom, resulting in a more even distribution of heat, as well as adding flavor and fragrance to the dish.

The most-common vegetables for the job are onions, carrots, potatoes, and celery. After rinsing your vegetables, chop them into big pieces–doesn't need to be pretty. You won't need to season the vegetables, since the meat juices will season the vegetables as they cook.
Because venison has such a tendency to dry out, it's also good to add a little water or water and chicken stock to the bottom of the pan. This will help to keep the interior of the oven moist, creating a kind of hot climate that will keep the meat from drying out.

, Set the meat on the bed of vegetables and cover tightly with tin foil. Place into the oven and bake for around three hours, basting periodically with the juices from the bottom of the pan. If you're using a meat thermometer, you can remove the venison when it's reached an internal temperature between 130 F and 150 F, depending on how ""done"" you like your meat. Any higher and it'll start to toughen.

Remove the roast from the pan, but let the meat rest covered for about 10 or 15 minutes before cutting into slices to serve. You can strain the pan drippings to make a nice gravy to serve with the venison.

Brown your stew meat.,
Add vegetables and aromatics.,
Deglaze the pan.,
Cover and cook at a low temperature for several hours.",How to Cook Venison (Deer Meat)4," In a heavy-bottomed pan, heat some olive oil and brown your stew meat on all sides, over medium-high heat. You don't need to cook the venison all the way through, and in fact you should avoid cooking it through as much as possible. Rather, you want to create a good char on the outside of the meat to create a layer of flavor, and to build up good color on the bottom of your pan. If brownish stuff builds up, that's a good thing.

A good stew can be made with about a pound of good stew meat taken from the ham, neck, or rib section of the venison. It should be cut into bite-sized chunks.
To help brown the meat and also thicken the stew you make, it can be good to dust the stew meat with a little bit of white flour, as when starting a roux. You won't need to use much more than a teaspoon or two per pound of meat.

, After browning the meat, remove it from the pan and add in the vegetables you'd like to include in the stew, starting with the heartiest and moving to the lightest. You want to add the vegetables that will need the longest time cooking first, to make sure everything cooks at roughly the same time. So, you'd add root vegetables like potato, carrot, or turnips first, and add mushrooms, peas, and fresh basil last.

For a basic stew, start by adding two potatoes, chopped into bite-sized pieces, two medium-sized chopped carrots, and a whole small white onion. Turn the heat down to medium and stir until he onion starts to become translucent. Add three or four cloves of minced garlic and continue cooking for a minute or two. When the vegetables start to brown up, it's time to legalize the pan.

, The bottom of the pan should now be covered with good color and flavor, but you can only get it up by adding some liquid and stirring vigorously. To deglaze you can use two or three cups of dry red wine, dark beer, or chicken stock, which all pair nicely with venison. If you want, you can use a combination of liquids, or use half water and half of another liquid, to soften the flavor some.

After pouring in the liquid, it should bubble up vigorously and then calm down some. Stir the bottom of the up to get up the flavor from the bottom, then season the stew to taste. Dried thyme, salt and pepper would all combine nicely.
Return the meat to the pot and turn the temperature back up until the liquid just reaches a boil. Stir periodically to keep the broth moving. When the broth gets to a boil, reduce the heat to low, and cover the pot, removing it to stir periodically., Keep the pot covered and cook it for at least an hour, and as many as three or four. Longer cooking time and lower temperature will ensure in very tender and tasty stew meat, making it important that you save enough time to cook it. The meat will technically be ""done"" after an hour, but it'll be even better after a few, when the proteins get a chance to break down more and the meat becomes fork-tender.

If you want to add more vegetables, like mushrooms, or any kind of fresh green vegetables, wait until 10 or 15 minutes before you're ready to eat, or they'll cook down into mush. A sprinkling of fresh-chopped parsley finished a bowl of venison stew nicely. Serve with crusty French bread, or cornbread for a perfect meal.

Salt the roast overnight.,
Let the roast become room temperature.,
Unwrap the roast.,
Preheat your oven to 250 degrees Fahrenheit (120 degrees Celsius).,
Season the roast.,
Sear the roast on the stove.,
Transfer the roast to the oven.,
Let the roast continue cooking with the oven off.,
Allow the roast to rest before serving.",How to Cook Sirloin Tip Roast1," Rub salt evenly over the surface of the roast. Wrap the roast tightly in plastic wrap, then secure it, Place it in a large bowl or on a large plate in the refrigerator overnight.


Salting the roast ahead of time gives the salt more time to soak into the meat. As a result, the sirloin tip roast will be more flavorful, and the flavor will be evenly dispersed.
Make sure the roast is thawed, or at least thawed enough for the salt to stick.;
, After a day elapses, remove the roast from the refrigerator an hour in advance so that it can become room temperature.


A room temperature roast cooks fast and evenly.
It is important, though, that the roast does not sit out longer than an hour or else bacteria can grow.

, Peel off the plastic wrap from the roast. If moisture has developed on the surface of the meat, gently pat it dry with clean paper towels.

, Make sure that the rack inside the oven is placed in the middle.


You should also prepare a rimmed baking sheet by placing an oven-safe wire rack in the center. This is where the roast will sit as it cooks, and the additional rack will allow the fat to drip away from the meat instead of gathering around it.

, Rub the roast with 1/2 Tbsp (7.5 ml) cooking oil and the minced garlic. Afterward, evenly rub the spices onto the meat, as well.


Combine the spices in a small dish before applying them evenly to the roast.

, Heat some oil in a large cast iron pan over medium-high heat. Sear each side of the roast for 3 to 4 minutes or until it is browned on all sides.


Alternatively, use a Dutch oven for the entire process. Sear the roast inside the Dutch oven on the stove. Then, simply transfer the Dutch oven with the roast directly into the oven.

, Place the roast on your prepared baking sheet and place it in the oven. Cook for about 1 hour and 20 minutes.


Use a meat thermometer to check the temperature of the roast. At this stage, it should be 115 degrees Fahrenheit (46 degrees Celsius).

, Turn the oven off but keep the roast inside. Let it cook slowly at this low temperature for another 30 to 40 minutes.


Leave the door closed the entire time to prevent letting the heat out.
For medium-rare, cook the roast to an internal temperature of 130 degrees Fahrenheit (54 degrees Celsius). For medium, cook the roast to an internal temperature of 140 degrees Fahrenheit (60 degrees Celsius).

, Remove the cooked roast from the oven. Let it rest at room temperature for 15 minutes. When ready, slice it and serve as desired.

, Melt the butter in the pot.

, Let them cook on each side for two to three minutes, until they are completely brown.

, Be careful, since the water will bubble when it hits the hot pot.

, Bring the contents of the pot to a boil.

, Cook the stew until the squirrel meat is tender, about 2 hours. Serve with bread. Eat carefully, since the squirrel pieces have tiny bones.

This step helps to tenderize the meat. If you have a young squirrel, you may skip this step.
You may skip this step if you want to grill a squirrel over a fire in the woods and don't have time to soak it first.

, Set up a charcoal grill with low, steady heat.


If you're camping in the woods, build a fire and allow it it to burn down until you have hot, slow-burning embers to cook over.

,, Cook over low heat for an hour, turning the pieces occasionally.


If you're cooking over an outdoor fire, skewer the pieces on metal skewers or cleaned sticks. Cook for an hour, rotating occasionally.
For barbecued squirrel, baste the squirrel pieces with barbecue sauce every fifteen minutes until the meat is cooked.

Cook food at high heat on a stove top pan.,
After cooking (whether of the main dish or scraps) and removing the meat from the pan, add 1 tbsp extra virgin olive oil or butter to both this pan and a second skillet, both over medium high heat.

,
To the second skillet, add 2 tbsp light olive oil or other medium vegetable oil.

,
Once the fats come to temperature, add 1 medium onion, diced, to the cooking pan.,
While the onion sautés (adding its own caramelization to the fond), constantly stir or whisk the other skillet until a ""blonde roux"" results.,
Deglaze the main pan to pull up the fond.,
Add 3 cups flavorful liquid (chicken and vegetable broths work well), a bay leaf and any hearty herbs which complement the entrée.

,
Whisk in the roux until smooth.

,
Reduce until the sauce is nape (a sauce which is nape will coat the back of a spoon, and a line drawn through the sauce will remain clear even as the spoon is turned around.),
Remove from heat and strain.

,
Add 2 pats of cold butter and whisk until smooth and velvety.

,
Optionally add a small amount of chopped delicate herbs which complement the entrée.

,
Finished.

",How to Create an Impressive Pan Sauce for Almost Any Meat," Pan sauces require fond, the caramelized chunks of food left in the pan after high heat cooking. If using a low or indirect cooking method (steaming, poaching, boiling, slow baking etc.), consider stealing some pieces of the meat specifically for this purpose. This also works well with meats not cooked in a pan, such as steaks on a grill. Bits of red meat surrounded by bone or gristle as well as the small wings of poultry work well for this purpose.;
,,, add 3 tbsp flour and 2 tsp garlic powder to the other skillet. Season the contents of each pan.

, A blonde roux is very light brown, slightly lighter than light brown sugar. As the roux comes together and the fat is absorbed, gradually lower the heat under this pan.

, When deglazing, lift pan off heat and pour approximately 1 cup of flavorful liquid (a decent, drinkable wine is preferred, but clear, smooth fruit juices such as apple, cranberry and white grape are also fine choices) into the hot pan. Return to heat and scrape the onion and fond until the liquid is dissolved.

Use ground venison alongside other meats.,
Brown up the ground venison and onions.,
Add beans and crushed tomatoes to the base.,
Season with three or four tablespoons of chili powder.,
Cover and simmer over low heat for at least an hour.",How to Cook Venison (Deer Meat)5," Ground venison works well for burgers, meat loaves, and as a general alternative to any ground beef recipe, but it's perfectly-suited for chili. Whether you want to make straight-up venison chili, or combine venison with a small amount of stew beef or pork sausage, it's a great base for a hearty chili. A pound should make 8-12 servings.

""Chili meat"" refers to a specific coarseness of grind, usually somewhat finer than ""ground"" venison. If you want a finer grind, have your deer processor grind up some chili meat, or purchase your own meat grinder to grind up your own.If you like a more Texas-style chili, stew meat chunks would be more appropriate, and you'll probably want to cook it at a lower temperature for a longer period of time, though the ingredients and the technique will be basically the same.

, Add one or two tablespoons of cooking oil to the bottom of a heavy-bottomed stew pot, and add your ground venison. Using a wooden spoon, stir the meat around as it browns up. Just before it turns dark all over, add one medium chopped yellow onion, a diced red pepper, and three or four cloves of minced garlic to the ground venison., As the onions start to brown, it's time to add the beans and the tomatoes. Use a can of drained red kidney beans, or a mixture of red beans, navy beans, and garbanzo beans, if you like. About 12 ounces should be perfect.

Use an 18 oz. can of crushed tomatoes, plus a tablespoon of tomato paste to provide the bass for the chili. If you want to use fresh tomatoes, start with about four ripe tomatoes, chopping them roughly and saving all the juices. Keep a close eye and add a little water if the chili needs more moisture added.
If beans aren't your thing, follow the chili recipe you like to make. Venison is perfectly amenable to most green chili recipes, or other types of regional chili you might prefer. Use the flavors and seasonings that you like and see if you like it better with venison.

, Season the chili to your taste. If you like it very strong, you can add more, or stronger chili powder, alongside a teaspoon of cumin, cayenne, and any other spices you like in your chili. If you don't like chili strong, add thyme, cumin, some coriander powder, and other aromatics. Add salt and pepper to taste.

To get at that distinctive chili taste, you'll need at least a bit of chili powder. Add a teaspoon at a time. You can always add more later.

, Turn the heat to low, pop the lid on, and let the chili simmer gently for a couple hours. The meat should cook in about 30 minutes or so, but the flavors will really come together with at least an hour or two of slow cooking. Taste it after thirty minutes to adjust the seasoning and add more chili powder, if necessary. Serve with cornbread.If you prefer, you can also transfer the chili to a slow cooker and let it sit all day, or overnight to really let the flavors blend. In general, the longer it cooks, the better it'll be.

Brush with barbecue sauce and continue grilling.,
Let stand.,
Slice, add remaining sauce, and serve.",How to Cook Sirloin Tip Roast2," Only light one side of the grill, whether it's a gas or charcoal grill. Lightly oil the grate with cooking spray.


If using a gas grill, light one side of the grill and close the lid. Let it reach 350 degrees Fahrenheit (180 degrees Celsius).
If using a charcoal grill, pile the coals to one side of the grill in a large heap. Light the coals, then let the flame die down until white ash forms on the surface of the coals. Close the lid to keep heated.

, Combine the chili powder, black pepper, and garlic powder. Rub the seasonings evenly over all sides of the roast.


Blending the spices in a small dish will help you apply the seasoning evenly to the roast.

, Transfer the seasoned roast to the unlit portion of the grill. Cover the grill and cook for 1 hour.


Stick a meat thermometer into the center of the sirloin tip roast to test its internal temperature. At this stage, it should be 140 degrees Fahrenheit (60 degrees Celsius).
Monitor the temperature of the grill as the meat cooks to make sure it stays relatively consistent.

, Use a basting brush to evenly apply 1/4 cup (60 ml) of the barbecue sauce over all sides of the roast. Grill for additional 10 minutes.


At this stage, the meat should be 150 degrees Fahrenheit (65 degrees Celsius) inside.

, Remove the meat from the grill and transfer it to a cutting board. Allow it to stand for 10 minutes.


Create a tent out of aluminum foil and place it over the roast as it stands.
When done, it should have the internal temperature of medium doneness, 160 degrees Fahrenheit (70 degrees Celsius).

, Cut the roast across the grain, forming thin slices. Place these slices in a large and top with the remaining barbecue sauce. Toss with tongs to coat the meat, and serve.

Layer the vegetables inside the slow cooker.,
Add the roast.,
Cook on high for 2 hours.,
Cook on low for 4 to 6 hours.,
Serve.",How to Cook Sirloin Tip Roast3," Place the potatoes on the bottom of the slow cooker, followed by the carrots, and topped by the onion.


Make sure that the potatoes have been cut into bite-size pieces and that the onion has been sliced or chopped. If using baby carrots, they can be left whole. If using larger carrots, cut into bite-size pieces.
The vegetables are layered according to the length of time required to cook them.
To limit the amount of mess during the cleanup stage, you can spray the slow cooker with nonstick cooking spray before adding the vegetables or you can use a special slow cooker liner.

, Lay the roast directly on top of the vegetables. Sprinkle with garlic powder and pepper.


Note that you do not need to add any liquid to this recipe, even though liquid is recommended for most slow cooker recipes. The meat and vegetables should give off enough liquid to prevent the roast from drying out during the cooking process.
If, however, you want the meat to be even more moist, you can add 1/2 to 1 cup (125 to 250 ml) of water or beef broth to the contents of the slow cooker, as well.

, Cover the slow cooker and cook the contents for 2 hours on high heat.

, After the first 2 hours, reduce the heat to low and continue cooking for an additional 4 to 6 hours.


If you will not be home and able to switch the heat, you could simply cook the roast on low for 8 hours, instead.
When done, the roast should be cooked to well doneness and fork tender.

, Remove the roast from the slow cooker and cut into pieces across the grain. Scoop out the vegetables and serve them alongside the meat.

Give the oil a minute or so to become hot.

, Add the cubed tip sirloin roast to the hot oil in the pressure cooker a little at a time. Cook, stirring frequently, until all sides have browned.


Do not crowd the meat. It would be better to remove some of the beef from the pot as you add more batches to ensure that all the meat is equally browned. When done, place all the browned meat back into the pressure cooker pot.

, Sprinkle the chopped onions over the meat and pour in the beef broth. Stir quickly to mix the ingredients.

, Cover the lid and lock it into place. Select the ""high pressure"" setting and cook the meat for 15 minutes.


Note that the cook time only refers to the amount of time at which the device is sitting at its cooking pressure. It will also take 15 minutes for the machine to pressure up and another 20 minutes for it to release that pressure.

, In a small bowl, whisk together the flour and water to form a slurry.


This slurry will be used as a thickener for the drippings in the pressure cooker. Without it, you would be unable to form any gravy.

, Stir the flour slurry into the broth and meat in the pressure cooker pot. Select the ""browning"" setting and let the liquid reach a boil. Continue cooking at a boil for a couple of minutes, or until the liquid thickens to gravy consistency.


When thickened, add a little salt and pepper into the gravy according to your own tastes.

You can mix the marinade in a large resealable plastic bag or inside a dish that is large enough to fit all the rabbit pieces in a single layer.;
, Place the rabbit pieces into the marinade and toss well to coat. Cover and refrigerate for a minimum of 1 hour, if not longer.

When roasting an entire rabbit, only use farmed rabbit. If using wild rabbit, only use the saddle or torso of the rabbit. Farmed rabbit has much more fat, so it fares better in dry heat methods like roasting than wild rabbit does.
Since the saddle of wild rabbit is fatty enough, though, it can still be roasted. Use 2 large saddles or 4 smaller saddles from wild rabbits in place of 2 full farmed rabbits.
Marinating the rabbit for 2 hours is actually ideal since the marinade will have more time to permeate and flavor the meat.

, Prepare an ovenproof frying pan by adding the butter to it and warming it over medium-high heat.

Continue heating the butter until it melts.
Duck fat or lard can also be used instead of unsalted butter.

, Add the rabbit to the butter in the frying pan and cook it for 3 to 5 minutes on each side, or until browned on each side., Transfer the ovenproof frying pan with the rabbit and remaining butter into the preheated oven. Cook for about 6 to 8 minutes before testing the pieces for doneness.

When done, the meat should feel firm and there should no longer be any internal redness or blood.
Drain the pan drippings before returning the pan to the stove.

, Pour the stock into the frying pan and heat it over medium until the stock begins to simmer.

The simmer should be fairly gentle. Do not let the stock reach a rapid, rolling boil.

, Remove the frying pan from the heat and let it rest in a warm area for 10 minutes. Serve while still warm."

Remove bay leaves and serve.",How to Cook Rabbit2," Prepare a casserole dish by spraying it with nonstick cooking spray.

For this method, avoid preparing the dish by lining it with aluminum foil or parchment paper. Cooking spray will have the most limited effect on flavor and will not negatively impact the way that the vegetables cooked alongside the rabbit taste and cook.

, Sprinkle salt and black pepper over the rabbit pieces before tossing them into the flour. Make sure that all sides of the rabbit are coated well.

You could combine the flour with the salt and pepper beforehand or add the salt and pepper to the rabbit separately. Either method will work.
Pour the flour into a large resealable plastic bag or into a shallow dish before dredging the rabbit pieces. If you use a bag, you can toss the pieces into the bag, seal it, and shake thoroughly. If using a shallow dish, turn and coat all sides by hand.

, Place the onion slices, minced garlic, sliced carrots, and sliced mushrooms in your casserole dish. Drizzle with oil and toss well to coat.

Try to keep the various vegetables as evenly distributed as possible to ensure even cooking.

, Arrange the floured rabbit pieces on top of the vegetable layer. Keep the rabbit in a single layer so that the pieces cook evenly., Sprinkle the parsley, thyme, and oregano over the rabbit pieces and vegetables evenly. Stick the bay leaves into the vegetable medley and pour the wine over the contents of the dish evenly.

Make sure that the liquid in the dish reaches the level of the rabbit pieces. In order to actually braise the rabbit, the meat itself needs to sit inside the cooking liquid as it cooks.

, Cover the dish and bake it until the rabbit becomes tender.

Use aluminum foil to cover the dish if you end up using a dish without an oven-proof lid.

, Fish the bay leaves out of the casserole dish. Serve the rabbit while still warm, serving the vegetable blend alongside it."

Drain and serve.",How to Cook Rabbit3," Whisk the buttermilk together with the Italian seasoning, paprika, garlic powder, and cayenne pepper in a small dish until well combined.

If you do not have an Italian seasoning blend, you could substitute 1/2 cup mixed and chopped fresh herbs. Use herbs like oregano, thyme, and parsley.

, Place the rabbit pieces in the spiced buttermilk and turn to coat all sides. Cover and refrigerate 8 hours to overnight.

A longer marinating time means a stronger flavor and more tender meat.

, Bring the oil to temperature over medium-high heat. Ideally, the oil should be heated to a temperature around 325 degrees Fahrenheit (160 degrees Celsius).

Check the temperature of the oil using a candy thermometer. Note that you may need to continually check the temperature of the oil during the cooking process to make sure that it does not get too cool or too hot. Do not let the oil smoke at any point during the cooking process.
If you do not have a candy thermometer, test the oil by quickly sprinkling flour into it. The flour should sizzle upon contact.
A large cast iron frying pan is the ideal type of pan to use.
Keep in mind that once you add the rabbit pieces, the oil should reach roughly the halfway point up along the side of the pieces.

, Place the rabbit pieces in a colander and let the buttermilk drain from it naturally for a couple of minutes.

Do not shake the buttermilk off or try to wipe the excess away. Simply allow the excess to drip off via the assistance of gravity.

, Mix the flour and salt in a large plastic bag, shaking until well combined. Place a few pieces into the bag and shake well to coat all sides., Fry for 12 to 15 minutes at a steady sizzle. Turn using tongs and fry for another 10 to 15 minutes.

The rabbit should fry at a gentle sizzle. It should not be violent, but it should do more than merely sit in the oil.
Remove all the pieces separately as they turn crispy and golden brown. The belly flap pieces and forelegs will finish up first. The loin will be next, and the hind legs will be last.
If you need to fry the rabbit pieces in batches, let them drain in the colander as they wait. Only flour the rabbit pieces immediately before you intend to fry them.

, Transfer the rabbit pieces to layers of clean paper towels or brown paper bags. Let drain for a few minutes before serving, and serve the pieces hot or at room temperature."

, Cover the slow cooker and let the rabbit cook until it becomes tender enough to fall apart when cut into with a fork.

The cover must stay on throughout the entire 6 hours. If you remove the cover, you will allow some of the heat that has built up inside to escape. This heat is an essential element involved in cooking the contents of the slow cooker, though, so letting any at all escape can affect the cooking time.

, Vigorously whisk the two ingredients together in a small dish until well combined into a slurry., Remove the rabbit from the slow cooker and stir the corn starch slurry into the remaining sauce. Cover and cook on high for 10 to 15 minutes, or until the sauce thickens.

Alternatively, you could pour the sauce into a medium saucepan and add the cornstarch slurry to it that way. Heat the contents of the saucepan on medium-high until they reach a boil. Let boil for 1 to 3 minutes, or until the sauce thickens.

Vegetable oil, shortening, or bacon drippings can also be used instead of the olive oil.
The pot must be oven-safe since you will be transferring it directly from the stovetop to the oven. It should also have a lid.

, After the oil begins to smoke, Sauté the minced garlic, stirring frequently until it begins to brown.

, Add the oxtail slices cook for 5 to 10 minutes, stirring, until they are brown on all sides.

, Fill the pot with the beef broth and Balsamic vinegar. Use enough red wine to cover the top of the meat by 1 inch (2.5 cm). Mix in the rosemary, thyme, oregano, and tarragon.

, Cover the pot and put it into the preheated oven for 3 to 4 hours.


Check on the oxtails periodically to make sure that there is still enough liquid. If the volume begins to dip below the surface of the meat, add more wine.
The oxtails are done when the meat begins to fall off the bone.

, Continue cooking for another 30 minutes.


For a milder flavor, substitute the onion for 2 chopped leeks.

, Remove the bones from the oxtails prior to serving, or allow your guests to do so themselves.


If desired, create a gravy by stirring the flour into the cooking liquid and heating the liquid on the stovetop over medium-high heat. Allow the liquid to boil and thicken, adding more flour if necessary, and serve with the oxtails.

Vegetable oil, bacon grease, or shortening may also be used instead of olive oil.

, Sprinkle the oxtails with enough salt to season them and coat the slices in flour. Add them to the skillet and cook for 5 to 10 minutes or until evenly browned on all sides.


This step could be skipped, but browning the meat beforehand adds a significant amount of flavor to the final dish.Coating the oxtails in flour leads to better browning.

, Place the oxtails in the slow cooker. Cover with Balsamic vinegar, garlic, rosemary, oregano, thyme, and onion. Pour in the broth and add enough red wine to cover the meat by about 1 inch (2.5 cm).


To make cleaning up easier, you could spray the inside of the slow cooker with nonstick cooking spray. You could also use a nonstick slow cooker liner.

, You could also cook the oxtails for 3 to 4 hours on high.


Do not stir the contents of the slow cooker or open the lid as it cooks. Doing so could release a significant amount of heat, and you may need to add an additional 30 minutes onto the cooking time simply by opening it for a few minutes.

, Turn off the heat and transfer the oxtails to a serving platter. Let rest for 3 to 5 minutes before serving.

You can also use the sour milk to replace yogurt or sour cream in baked goods.

, If you’re cooking a cut of meat that you want to ensure is tender, soak it in sour milk. Mix up a flavorful marinade for chicken, steak, or fish by combining the milk with herbs such as rosemary, thyme, garlic, and/or black pepper.In savory recipes, you can also mix sour milk into dishes like potato bakes, casseroles, or stews that have a creamy or cheesy consistency. You should just be careful that the tangy flavor of the milk doesn’t overpower the dish.

, With sour milk, you can whip up rich homemade cottage cheese. You’ll need to heat the milk on medium until it’s 185°F (85°C), remove it from the heat, and mix in some vinegar. Next, pour it through a colander lined with cheesecloth, rinse the curds, and mix them with salt and a little milk or cream until you get the consistency you like.Keep your cottage cheese refrigerated, and eat it within a week.

Chill your tools and ingredients.,
Combine all the ingredients.,
Beat the cream.,
Serve immediately with your favorite dishes.",How to Make Whipped Topping1," Place a large glass or metal bowl in the refrigerator about an hour before making your whipped cream. Refrigerate a pair of metal beaters from a hand mixer as well. Keep your cream refrigerated right up until the moment you plan to make your whipped cream.Chilling the equipment before making the whipped cream will make it easier to incorporate air into the cream. This will make the whipped cream lighter and fluffier.
If you have a stand mixer, refrigerate the bowl and the whisk attachment.
You can use a whisk to whip cream, but it will take vigorous whipping and a lot of extra time. Refrigerate the whisk if that’s the tool you'll be working with.;
, When you're ready to make your whipped cream, remove the bowl, beaters or whisk, and cream from the fridge. Pour the cream into the chilled bowl, along with the vanilla, and the cinnamon or nutmeg if you like.


To sweeten the whipped cream, add 2 tablespoons (16 g) of powdered sugar to the bowl as well., Turn your stand or hand mixer to low speed and combine all the ingredients. Once the sugar and vanilla are incorporated into the cream, increase the speed to medium for about nine minutes, until stiff peaks begin to form.The stiff peak stage means that when you remove the whisk or beaters, the cream will hold its shape and won’t melt back into the bowl as a liquid would.
At the stiff peak stage, the whipped cream will have a slightly grainy texture.

, Whipped cream is great on pies, in hot chocolate, with ice cream, mixed with fruit, or even on breakfast dishes like pancakes and waffles.


To serve whipped cream, you can use a spoon to portion out dollops, or transfer the cream to a pastry bag and pipe it onto cakes and other baked goods.
Store leftovers in an airtight container or covered with plastic wrap for up to a day."

Refrigerate the coconut milk.,
Chill the bowl and beaters.,
Separate the coconut water and cream.,
Whip the coconut cream.,
Beat in the sugar and vanilla before serving.",How to Make Whipped Topping2," Like traditional whipped cream, coconut whipped cream works best when the coconut cream is very cold. The chilling process also helps to separate the coconut cream from the water, which is important because you only need the cream for this recipe.


Refrigerate the can of coconut milk for at least eight hours, but 24 hours is ideal.
It’s important to use full-fat coconut milk, because light coconut milk doesn’t have the right fat content to whip up., About an hour before you plan to make your coconut whipped cream, place a glass or metal bowl in the fridge, along with the metal beaters from a hand mixer.


When the bowl and beaters are cold, they won’t transfer heat to the coconut cream, and this will make it easier to whip air into it.

, Once it’s thoroughly chilled, remove the can of coconut milk from the fridge. Do not shake or agitate the can before opening it, otherwise you will reincorporate the water and cream. With a spoon, carefully scoop out the solidified top layer of coconut cream. Place the cream into the chilled bowl.The remaining liquid in the can is coconut water, and you can drink this, use it in baking, or add it to smoothies. Place it in a storage container and reserve it for another recipe., Using the chilled beaters, whip the coconut cream for about eight minutes, until stiff peaks begin to form. The stiff peak stage means you can pull the beaters out and the cream will hold a peak on the end of the beater.

, When the coconut whipped cream is at the stiff peaks stage, add in the sugar and vanilla. Beat the cream for another minute to incorporate everything.Serve coconut whipped cream as you would traditional whipped cream. You can use it on desserts, in hot chocolate, on ice cream, or even just enjoy a spoonful on its own!
If you have any leftovers, transfer the cream to an airtight container and refrigerate for one to two weeks.

Use immediately or store for later.",How to Make Whipped Topping3," Cool Whip is a brand name of imitation whipped cream, and it tends to be sweeter and lighter than traditional whipped cream. The recipe also requires more ingredients, and the process is more involved. Along with your ingredients, you'll also need some tools and equipment, including:


One small and one medium bowl
Fork
Medium saucepan
Whisk
Candy thermometer
Large heat-proof bowl
Hand or stand mixer (with whisk attachment)
Bowl with tight-fitting lid

, In a small bowl, combine the gelatin and cold water. Stir the two together with a fork to combine them. Set the bowl aside and let the gelatin soften in the water while you prepare the other ingredients.Gelatin stabilizes the cream in this recipe, and makes the whipped topping stable at room temperature.

, In a medium bowl, whisk together the milk, powdered milk, and vanilla. Continue whisking until the ingredients are fully combine and smooth, with no lumps in the mixture.


The powdered milk in this recipe adds body and flavor, but it also makes the whipped cream product freezer-stable., Combine the room temperature water, corn syrup, sugar, and salt in a saucepan. Heat the mixture over medium heat, stirring regularly for three minutes.


When the mixture is boiling and bubbling, stop stirring. Increase the heat to medium-high and insert the thermometer.
Cook for another four minutes or so, until the mixture reaches 250 F (121 C).

, Remove the syrup from the heat. Transfer it to a heat-proof bowl and insert the thermometer. Allow the syrup to cool for about three minutes, until it reaches 212 F (100 C).Cooling the syrup will protect the gelatin from overheating.
If you're going to be using a stand mixer to whip the final mixture, transfer the syrup to the stand mixer bowl instead.

, When the syrup reaches the right temperature, pour in the gelatin and water. Beat the mixture on medium-high speed for about five minutes, until it becomes fluffy and thick.


Add in the milk and vanilla mixture in one-quarter increments. Beat the mixture after each addition to fully combine all the ingredients.

, Once you’ve added all the milk mixture and all the ingredients have been incorporated, cover the bowl with a tight-fitting lid or plastic wrap. Set it aside to firm up at room temperature.


Leave the mixture to firm for at least two hours, but no longer than eight., When the mixture has had time to stiffen, remove the cover and whip it on low speed with the hand or stand mixer. As you beat the mixture, slowly drizzle in the cream, and then continue beating for another five minutes.


After five minutes, increase the speed to medium and continue whipping until the mixture is creamy, thick, and at the firm peaks stage.
The firm peaks stage means the cream will hold it shape for a moment, but any tips melt back into themselves after a few seconds., Homemade cool whip can be put on the same things as whipped cream, such as pancakes, pies, and in hot chocolate. Transfer leftovers to an airtight container and refrigerate for up to two weeks.


Because the powdered milk makes this whipped topping freezer stable, you can also freeze the mixture in an airtight container for as long as three months.

Prefer stronger flavoured cheese.,
Shop with bargains in mind.,
Compare the pre-prepared cheese products with block cheese.,
Bulk buy.,
Freeze.,
Make your own.,
Substitute.,
Visit the source.",How to Spend Less on Dairy Products," Cheese that has a stronger flavour goes further. For example, choose Parmesan or Pecorino cheese and grate lesser amounts of these types of cheese into your cooking. You will still get the same flavor without having to use as much cheese.;
, Be open to trying different brands of dairy products so that you can take advantage of the specials. Cut out coupons and look for home brands or budget brands as well; for some products such as milk, there is unlikely to be a flavor difference.

, Pre-prepared cheese products, such as pre-grated or sliced cheese are often more expensive pound for pound, kilo for kilo. Be wary of this when purchasing cheese products. However, sometimes a grated cheese product or bulk pre-sliced cheese boxes go on special and may be an excellent deal - once again, keep an eye out for the bargains.

, If your family consumes a lot of dairy products, look for larger sized packaging. This will be cheaper than smaller packages and you can break down the packaging and place cheese, milk, yogurt etc. into smaller containers at home that are easier to use.

, Some dairy products can be frozen, for example, cheese and milk. If you find these products on special, buy more than usual and freeze some. Don't forget to date the products on the day of freezing. Wrap cheese in parchment paper and place in an airtight container. Milk can be frozen in its container provided it is not in glass.

, If you love yogurt, purchase a yogurt maker and make your own at home. You can add fresh fruits and flavors as desired.

, Substituting less expensive dairy options for more expensive dairy products is a good way to stretch their use.


Use evaporated milk to make creamy sauces and desserts in place of milk or cream;
Use cottage cheese in place of grated cheese with baked pasta dishes. Crush the cottage cheese with a fork and mix with a little milk to make a smooth paste.
Use milk powder in place of fresh milk. You will find it goes a lot further and does not change the taste in cooking (it's less desirable in cereals and hot drinks if you're used to fresh milk). You can also substitute water or juice for milk in numerous baking recipes.
Make grated cheese go further by mixing with breadcrumbs.

, Tour local cheese factories and dairies that are open to the public to purchase items from the farmer's door. This can save money and be an excuse for an afternoon's picnic tour close to your home area. Beware boutique prices though - sometimes this can be more expensive! Alternately, try farmer's markets for fresh, local dairy bargains.

, This requires that you meet three stages in succession, namely stretch, swirl and heat, explained as follows.

,


Place the steam nozzle just below the surface of the cold milk in its jug.
Turn on the steam wand to release full pressure. Then, keep this wand at the top of the milk, rather than under it, so that it continues to ""stretch"".
Once the milk doubles in size, the nozzle can be placed back under the milk's surface.

, Shift the steam wand to the side of the milk jug. This creates a swirling motion and the milk will blend, taking care of any bubbles that might have formed.

, Turn off the steam wand when the milk reaches 70ºC/158ºF. Knock the jug against the bench if you see large bubbles, this should be enough to pop them. If this doesn't work, skim them off the top.

Sift 3 cups of flour into a large bowl.,

Cook the noodles in boiling water or chicken broth until they float.",How to Make Egg Noodles1," If you don't have a sifter, use a fork or small whisk to break up any clumps so that it is an even powder throughout.;
, You can adjust this to taste, adding another pinch for a slightly saltier pasta, but don't add less. Salt, in small quantities, is a flavor enhancer, bringing out the richness of the eggs. Whisk to mix in evenly.

, Clear a small hole with your fingers in the middle of the flour to make a cone-shaped well. This will make it easy to mix the wet ingredients into the dough evenly. Then add your egg.


Want a richer pasta? Add more egg yolk and less whole egg. This will develop a deeper yellow color and the richness some people crave with egg noodles.

, As you whisk, you'll notice the flour slowly adding in as the fork catches the edges of the well. Keep making bigger and bigger swipes to get more and more flour into the egg, then pause about halfway through.

, You want to mix until you have a shaggy, loose dough. Depending on your environment, you may need more water, adding more if it is dry and less if it is humid. Your goal is this loose, shaggy, Play-Doh-like dough., Take the dough and fold it on itself, then press firmly into the top with the heel of your hand to kneed it. Rotate the dough and repeat this 4-5 more times. You'll know the dough is ready when it comes to the texture of wet Play-DohTM. If you don't quite like the texture of the dough, you can adjust now:



Dough is too sticky: add a tablespoon more flour, sprinkled evenly, as you kneed.

Dough is too dry: add a touch of water, slowly, and kneed in. The dough should be a little wet.

, This allows the glutens to relax, leading to a more tender noodle This will make it easier for you to work, as well. Leave it in a cool, dry place.


In a rush, this step is optional. Still, even 20 minutes will make the dough easier to work with., Sprinkle a few tablespoons of flour onto your rolling surface. This will keep the noodle dough from sticking to your work surface., Try and keep the ball of dough at least vaguely rectangular, allowing you to cut out nice long noodles. Keep rolling until the dough is almost paper thin-- when held up with your fingers, you should be able to see the outline of your fingers peeking through the dough.If you want thicker egg noodles, so be it! There is nothing that says you can't have big, beefy noodles.

, Be quick yet firm with the cutter, getting nice long, even noodles. Many cooks then cut all the noodles in half to make them easier to cook and eat.

, This should only be 2-3 minutes as fresh noodles cook incredibly quickly. After the finish, drain immediately and serve."

Simply hang them over the back of a clean chair, on wire hangers, or a dedicated pasta drying rack overnight, then break into smaller pieces and store in an airtight bag the next morning., There are not a whole lot of options here, but you do have some variability when choosing liquids. Try out a low-fat milk for a slightly denser pasta, or use a dry white wine (like a Chardonnay) for a subtle, snappy pasta that goes well with Italian dishes.


You could also try out lemon juice, though it should be cut halfway with water to avoid being too acidic.

, The most important thing to remember is to make sure they are finely ground, which will avoid lumps or broken pasta when cooking. Try out 2 teaspoons of:


Black pepper
Thyme
Lemon zest
Oregano

, There are a lot of different theories about how to make the perfect egg noodles, and most of them vary in the number of eggs. When using 3 cups of flour, you have several options -- experiment to find your favorite:

Using a stand-up mixer fitted with the hook attachment, combine the following ingredients: 2 ½ cups of flour, three eggs, and ½ teaspoon of salt. Mix together until the ingredients are combined. Then, remove from the mixer and knead the dough by hand for 3 to 5 minutes.Alternatively, you may be able to purchase fresh pasta dough from your local grocery store.;
, To make the ricotta cheese filling, you will need to dry five ounces (142 g) of ricotta cheese. This can be done by spreading the cheese over a towel and then placing another towel on top. Let is stand for approximately five minutes or until the moisture has been absorbed., Transfer the dried ricotta cheese to a medium-sized mixing bowl. Add 1 ounce (28 g) of freshly grated parmesan cheese and ½ a teaspoon of lemon juice to the ricotta cheese. Mix together and then add salt and pepper to taste.You can also add fresh basil, sage, nutmeg, red pepper flakes, or garlic depending on the flavour you want to create., Using a spoon, transfer the ricotta filling into a pastry bag. The pastry bag should be fit with a ¼ inch (2.5 cm) round tip for piping. If you do not have a pastry bag, you can place the filling in a ziplock bag and cut a ¼ inch (2.5 cm) hole in the bottom corner of the bag.Place the pastry bag and filling in the refrigerator.

, Divide the dough in half. Then using a pasta roller, roll out one half of dough into a ⅙ inch (0.5 cm) sheet of pasta. Sprinkle the dough with flour if it begins to dry out. You may need to put the dough through the roller a few times before you reach your desired thickness.Repeat this process with both halves of the dough.
In order to get the desired thickness, you will typically want to use the second to last setting on the pastry roller., Lay out one of the sheets of dough on a lightly floured surface. Then, using a cookie cutter, cut the dough into 4 ⅛ inch (10.4 cm) circles. You should be able to get about 10 circles from the two sheets of dough.Place five of the circles to the side and cover with a towel to keep them moist.

, Remove the ricotta filling from the refrigerator. Then, pipe the filling in the shape of a circle onto the dough. The circle of filling should be approximately 1 ½ inches (3.8 cm) in diameter. You do not have to be too exact with this measurement. It just needs to be big enough to hold an egg yolk.Once you have finished the first circle, pipe another circle directly on top. This will give the filling some height and will help keep the egg yolk in place.
Repeat this step with all five pasta circles.

, Crack an egg and then separate the egg whites from the yolk. Place the egg whites in a medium sized bowl. Then, using your hand or the egg shell, gently place the egg yolk in the center of the circle created by the filling.It is very important that you do this carefully so that you do not break the yolk.
Repeat this process with all five of the pasta circles.

, Using a pastry brush, gently brush the exposed edges of the pasta circles with water. This will help the ravioli seal once you add the top piece of pasta., Remove the five remaining dough circles from under the towel. Brush one side of each with water and then gently drape them over top of each piece of ravioli. Use your fingers to gently press down the edges so that they meet with the pasta on the bottom.You should also press down on the filling and egg yolk in order to remove any air pockets. This needs to be done with extreme caution so that you do not break the yolks.

, Place a large pot of salted water on the stove on medium to high heat. Wait until the water is at a gentle boil. Cover the pot with a lid to allow the water to boil faster., Drop the ravioli into the boiling water and cook until they begin to float and the cheese is warm. This will take approximately two and a half to three minutes. Avoid overcooking the pasta. This could lead to an overcooked egg, which will take away from the flavour and texture of the dish.Once cooked, remove the ravioli using a slotted spoon. Dab any excess water from the bottom of the ravioli with a paper towel.

, Serve the ravioli immediately. Place two to three pieces of ravioli on each plate. Then drizzle with a simple oil and garlic or tomato sauce."

",How to Make Brown Rice in a Rice Cooker," It will usually be simplest to portion out your rice in whole cups. For example, two people sharing a cozy meal may only eat two to three cups of rice, whereas a larger meal may require six to eight. Working with even quantities will make it much easier to figure out exactly how much water you need to produce perfectly cooked rice. Using a dry measuring cup to scoop your rice will help you avoid any troublesome guesswork.
For best results, only prepare as much rice as you plan on eating. Leftover rice doesn’t reheat well.;
, Place the brown rice in a mesh strainer or sieve and run it under the faucet, circling the strainer beneath the stream. This will rinse away most of the starch, which will prevent the grains from becoming sticky when cooked. Continue washing the rice until the water runs clear.You may notice that the water draining out of the rice has a slightly milky appearance. This is normal.
Shake out as much excess water as you can before cooking the rice.

, Place the newly washed rice in the bottom of the cooker and spread it out. When preparing a lot of rice at once, make sure it’s properly distributed so that it will cook evenly.Don’t add more rice to the rice cooker than it can hold at one time. If you need to prepare an especially large amount, do it in batches.

, A good rule of thumb when making brown rice is to increase the recommended amount of water by 50%. Therefore, whereas you would normally use one cup of water for every cup of rice, you’ll want to use one-and-a-half cups to account for the difference in texture. Since brown rice is tougher than white rice, it needs to cook longer.Unlike white rice, brown rice grains still have a natural fibrous bran layer. As a result, they don’t absorb water as easily and take longer to cook to the ideal temperature.The amount of water you add to the rice is directly correlated to the overall cook time. When all the water has evaporated, the internal temperature of the rice cooker will rise, signalling it to shut off.Though not a necessity, soaking the brown rice for 20-30 minutes before cooking can also help it get more done. Should you decide to soak your rice, only use one cup of water for every cup of rice., Make sure the cooker is plugged in and ready to go. Then, hit the “cook” button and call it a day. The cooker will automatically take care of the rest!Most rice cookers only have a couple of settings: “cook” and “warm.”
If the model you’re using is more sophisticated, be sure to program it to the appropriate setting before cooking the rice. Consult the owner’s manual to find out what settings are recommended., Once the rice is finished, give it a little time to achieve the right consistency. Holding off on uncovering the rice for a few more minutes will allow it to absorb any remaining steam and begin cooling off to an edible temperature. Leave the lid on the cooker as the rice sits.Undercooked brown rice will often be crunchy and unappetizing.
Don’t skip this step. It can be tempting to dig in right away when you’re hungry, but the full flavor and enhanced texture of the rice definitely make it worth the wait., Stir the rice from the edges inward with a wooden spoon or rubber spatula. Use the edge of your utensil to break up any large clumps you come across. You’ll now have a batch of perfectly cooked, velvety brown rice ready to be paired with a vegetable medley, savory stir fry or piece of seared fish.Never use metal utensils to fluff or scoop your rice. This may leave permanent scratches on the inside of the rice cooker.A shamoji can come in handy for those who make rice on a regular basis. Modern version of this traditional Japanese utensil are molded from soft plastic and are designed specifically for mixing and serving rice., This will both lower the internal temperature of the appliance and give you a head start when it comes time to clean up. As heat continues to escape, it will dry out the sticky residue left behind in the cooker. Afterwards, it can be scraped away with little difficulty.Don’t handle the rice cooker while it’s still hot. Wait until it has completely cooled off before attempting to clean it.By the time you’re finished with your meal, the rice cooker will be

, Run the edge of a spatula (or simply use your fingers) along the walls and bottom of the cooker to dislodge crusty rice remnants. Dump these directly into the trash or down the garbage disposal. Take off as much as you can by hand—all that will be left to do then is give the cooker a good wipe-down.Rice cookers are usually coated in a slick nonstick finish that makes them a snap to clean.
Again, stay away from sharp or abrasive tools and scrubbers. The effectiveness of these types of items isn’t worth risking the damage they may do.

, Wet the cloth with warm water to help dissolve stuck-on starch. Any lingering film or loose particles should come right off. Let the interior of the cooker air dry, then replace the lid and stash it away until the next time you need it.If you need a heavy-duty solution for bigger messes, scrub the cooker with a soft-bristled dish brush or the green side of a kitchen sponge.To be on the safe side, unplug the rice cooker before applying water anywhere in or around it.

Serve the crab ravioli.",How to Make Crab Ravioli1," Melt 1/2 tablespoon of unsalted butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Stir in 1/2 tablespoon of all-purpose flour and keep whisking the roux for 30 seconds. Whisk in 1/4 cup (60 ml) of half-and-half or whole milk. Continue to whisk the roux until it thickens which should take about a minute. Turn off the heat and let it cool.This quick roux will keep your crab filling thick and absorb moisture as the ravioli cooks.;
, Pick over 1/2 pound (226 g) of lump crab meat to remove any shell or cartilage. Add the crab meat to the cooled roux and gently fold in 1/2 teaspoon of Dijon mustard, 1 teaspoon of fresh minced tarragon, and one large minced scallion (only the white part). Add salt and white ground pepper according to your taste.To fold the seasonings, hold a spoon and use a twisting motion to incorporate the seasonings into the thick roux.

, Since you'll be assembling a lot of crab ravioli (about 48), you need to have your wrappers, water, and crap filling all laid out. Get out the 48 wonton wrappers. Set a small prep bowl filled with water on your work surface and get out a pastry brush. Place the crab filling in a bowl on your work surface.You should also line a baking sheet with plastic wrap and set it aside, so you have somewhere to place the filled crab ravioli before they cook.

, Practice filling and forming about three ravioli at a time. Get out three wonton wrappers and use the pastry brush to coat them with water. Spoon 1/2 teaspoon to 1 teaspoon of the crab filling onto the middle of each wonton wrapper.If you have someone helping you assemble the crab ravioli, you might have them divide the crab filling into 48 portions. This way, you can quickly fill the ravioli before you seal them up.

, Get out three more wonton wrappers. Place one wrapper over each of the filled wrappers. Ensure that you push out any air that might be trapped in between the wrappers. Press the sides of the wonton wrappers, so they seal shut.It's important to work quickly, so the water doesn't dry before the wonton wrappers are sealed shut.

, Press a 2.5-inch (6.3-cm) round cutter onto each filled wonton. This will give your ravioli a round or fluted shape while trimming away the extra wonton wrapper. Set the prepared ravioli on the baking sheet.Continue to fill, seal, and trim the crab ravioli in small batches until you've assembled all of them.

, Bring a large sauce pot full salted water to a boil. Carefully add the ravioli and stir them gently. Let the ravioli boil for about three minutes or until they float to the top of the water. Use a slotted spoon to gently scoop them out of the water and into a colander.You can pour the cooked ravioli with the water through a colander, but some of the ravioli may break in the process.

, Toss your drained crab ravioli with your favorite sauce and serve them right away. Crab ravioli works well with tomato sauce, cream-based sauces, butter sauces, or garlic sauces.If you want to make the crab ravioli in advance, you can assemble them, dust them with flour, and refrigerate them for up to 24 hours. When you're ready to serve them, just remove them from the refrigerator and boil them.

, Pour 1 tablespoon of olive oil into the well and crack one medium egg into it. You should also add one egg yolk to the wet ingredients. Use your fingers to stir the flour mixture into the wet ingredients in the center, so a shaggy dough forms.You can discard the extra egg white or save it for another recipe.

1 pinch paprika
1 pinch nutmeg
1 tablespoon melted butter
1 tablespoon finely chopped flat-leaf parsley

, Measure out one level teaspoon of the crab filling. Hold one of the cutouts and place the teaspoon of filling near the middle. Use your finger or a pastry brush to spread a little water along the edge of the cutout and fold it over, so the ravioli looks like a half-moon. Dust the filled ravioli with a little flour.Ensure that you've pressed the edges well, so a seal is created.

Return the meat to the pan and stir in the seasonings. Keep the meat warm over low heat while you mix the rest of the salad. You'll need to add these seasonings to the cooked meat:1/3 cup (80 g) of ketchup
1 teaspoon of yellow mustard
1 tablespoon of dijon or spicy mustard
2 tablespoons of barbecue sauce;
, Carefully cut 4 whole hamburger buns into 1-inch cubes. Get out a stick of butter and cut it in half. Melt 4 of the tablespoons (55 g) in a wide skillet over medium heat. Add the bread cubes and stir them so they completely soak up the butter. Add the remaining 4 tablespoons (55 g) of butter and continue to cook the croutons for about 8 to 10 minutes.

Set these aside and cut 8 whole dill pickle spears into cubes.You could also cut the lettuce if you'd rather not tear it into pieces.

, Although you can use any salad dressing you like, ranch or thousand island dressings work well with this deluxe cheeseburger salad. For a quick thousand island dressing, mix together the following ingredients and let the dressing chill for at least an hour before drizzling it over the salads. You'll need to mix together:1/2 cup (116 g) of mayonnaise
2 tablespoons of ketchup
2 tablespoons of sweet pickle relish
2 teaspoons of minced onion
1/4 teaspoon of minced garlic
1 teaspoon of white vinegar
1/8 teaspoon of kosher salt
2 to 3 dashes of Tabasco sauce (optional)

, To make six deluxe cheeseburger salads, set out six plates. Place a handful of torn lettuce on each of the plates. Top the lettuce with a large scoop of the seasoned meat. Use 1 cup (125 g) of grated sharp cheddar cheese and sprinkle the cheese evenly over each salad. Top the salads with the diced tomato, cubed pickle, and sliced red onion. Sprinkle the croutons over the salads and serve them.Serve the salad immediately. Since the meat mixture is warm, the lettuce may wilt if it sits too long before serving.

, Put 1 pound (0.45 kg) of 93% lean ground beef or ground turkey breast into a large bowl. Add ¼ teaspoon of kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper. Stir the meat and seasonings to combine them. Run your hands under water and use your wet hands to divide the mixture into 4 pieces. Form each piece into a hamburger patty and set them aside.Check your meat counter for the leanest meat they offer. Some counters or butchers offer 95% lean ground beef.

, Heat a gas or charcoal grill so that it's hot. Place your four hamburger patties on the grill and cook them for about 4 or 5 minutes on each side. The hamburgers will be medium-done, although you could cook them longer if you'd like them well-done. Remove the hamburgers from the grill and let them sit for 5 to 10 minutes.If you'd like to grill the onions for the salad instead of just slicing them, slice half an onion and place it on the grill during the last 5 minutes of grilling the hamburgers.

, If you're watching calories, you can always leave the dressing off of the salad. Or you could just swap a high-calorie dressing with this lighter one. Whisk all of the dressing ingredients in a small bowl and set it aside while you make the rest of the salad. For the light dressing, you'll need:1/4 cup (58 g) of light mayonnaise
1 teaspoon of mustard
1 teaspoon of dill pickle juice
4 teaspoons of ketchup
1/4 teaspoon of onion powder
1/4 teaspoon of garlic powder
1/4 teaspoon of paprika

, Wash a head of romaine lettuce, a small red onion, a 4 ounce avocado and 1 cup (200 g) of cherry tomatoes. Take a sharp knife and carefully chop the romaine lettuce in order to get 4 cups (300g). You should also slice half of the onion and cut the avocado into cubes. Cut the cherry tomatoes in half and chop 4 dill pickle spears.You can add other healthy vegetables like sliced mushrooms or sliced bell peppers.

, Divide the chopped romaine lettuce among four plates. Place a few slices of red onion on each plate. Measure out 1/4 cup (25 g) of reduced-fat shredded cheddar cheese and sprinkle it over the four salads. Chop each hamburger patty and place one patty's worth of meat on each salad.

You'll need to choose the freshest three vine ripe tomatoes; it doesn't matter what kind of tomato you use, really, but heirlooms can be perfect for this dish. The tomatoes should have a larger circumference than the cheese, ideally. You'll need a pound of Mozzarella cheese; buffalo Mozzarella is often used for a Caprese but any kind of Mozzarella will do. You'll also need some fresh, aromatic basil.;
, Cut it in 1/4-inch circular slices. You can make them a bit thicker or thinner, if you like.

, Having the tomatoes be thicker than the cheese will help the salad hang together. You don't want each slice of cheese overpowering each slice of tomato.

, You can prepare the single portions in individual dishes or in a large serving dish. You can arrange them on a plate without overlapping them at all, or you can partially overlap the pieces of tomato and cheese. It's all about the presentation you want, and no matter what, it will taste just as delicious.

, It looks great and has the Italian flag's color palette. You can place one piece of basil on each tomato or just sprinkle the leaves throughout the salad.

, You should add salt and pepper to taste, as well as a generous amount of extra virgin olive oil. Using coarse salt and pepper can give the salad an extra kick. There's no magic number for how much olive oil you need -- just drizzle it over the salad until you're satisfied.


If you like, you can also pour some balsamic vinegar over the salad, or you can reduce it first. To do this, just bring 2 cups of balsamic vinegar to a boil over medium high heat and then wait 10-20 minutes for it to thicken to the consistency you like. Then you can drizzle it over your salad in a pattern., Serve this tasty salad on its own or with a side of sliced Italian bread.

Adding the thyme leaves is optional.

, After you’ve mixed the lemon juice, salt, and thyme into the salad, drizzle some pure maple syrup over it to taste.

Choose 100% whole grain breads and rolls.,
Try out a tortilla or a wrap.,
Use portion controlled deli thins.,
Consider using lettuce instead of bread.,
Try making ""naked"" or open-faced sandwich.,
Be mindful about your condiments.,
Choose low-sodium proteins.,
Include a source of calcium-rich dairy.,
Add in some vegetables.,
Make a BALT sandwich.,
Try a Mediterranean veggie wrap.,
Prepare spicy salmon lettuce cups.,
Get classic with a tuna melt.",How to Make Healthier Sandwiches," Your basic sandwich is generally made with bread, on a roll or in a wrap. If you're going to choose one of these items or something similar, boost the nutrition of your sandwich by choosing whole grains.


Whole grains are a more nutrient-dense and healthier option compared to refined grains (like white bread). They're less processed and contain all the parts of the grain.Whole grains are typically much higher in fiber, minerals and even protein compared to refined grains. Breads high in fiber keep you full longer and therefore helps stop snacking. Snacking can result in overeating, which can contribute to obesity.
If you're going to choose an item like bread, a wrap, English muffin, bagel, flatbread or deli thin, go for 100% whole grains.
Look at the food label to make sure your item is 100% whole grain. The ingredient label should list only 100% whole wheat or 100% whole grain flour.;
, If you want to minimize your bread intake or just try something a little different, consider using a tortilla or a wrap. You can wrap up your sandwich fillings for a quick meal.


Both tortillas and wraps are flat and are not as high in carbohydrates or calories compared to many types of bread or rolls. They're also a little bit less filling since they're just less food overall.Again, choose 100% whole grain if you can. Many corn tortillas are automatically whole grain as well.
Be wary of what size wrap you buy. Many come in 6"", 8"" or even 12"". The bigger they are, the more likely it'll count as two servings of grains. Stick to a 6"" wrap to minimize calories and carbohydrates.

, Many bread companies are jumping on the low calorie, low carbohydrate band wagon by developing ""deli or sandwich thins."" These are rolls or bread that are very thin, low in calories and carbohydrates.


These deli thins are a great substitute for regular bread. Many companies make them in 100% whole grain versions, have added fiber and protein.Sandwich thins are also usually low in calorie as well. Some may only have about 100 calories for both pieces. This may be lower than other breads or rolls you've used in the past.
Again, read the ingredient list to make sure that these products are truly 100% whole grain.

, Another way to add more nutrients (and fewer calories) to your sandwich is by using a lettuce wrap. This is a fun twist on a classic sandwich that can also make it healthier.


Lettuce, like other vegetables, is naturally low in calories. Many lettuces, especially dark greens, are also high in nutrients like fiber, vitamins and antioxidants.You use a lettuce wrap just like you would a tortilla. You can place your sandwich fillings and toppings in a large lettuce leaf and roll up.
Not all lettuces are great for wraps, but collard greens, Swiss chard, mustard greens, kale, butter lettuce, or iceberg lettuce all have large leaves that can be rolled.

, If you're overly concerned about calories or carbs, there is one additional method for serving your sandwich. You can try a naked or open-faced sandwich instead of the traditional sandwich.


A naked sandwich is one that doesn't have any bread or wrap. It's just the filling.
For example, you could do turkey and cheese roll ups stuffed with sliced raw vegetables.
An open-faced sandwich is one where you only use a single slice of bread. It cuts down on the calories and carbohydrates that you're consuming. These are especially great for hot sandwiches.
For example, you could make an open-faced tuna melt using only one slice of whole wheat bread.

, Most of the time you make a sandwich, you're most likely going to add some type of sauce, dressing or condiment. It adds a little moisture and extra flavor.


Be mindful of what types and how much of these condiments you add. You could start with a fairly nutritious or low-calorie sandwich and send it overboard with high-calorie or high-fat condiments.Try to choose condiments that are a little lower in calorie. Try mustard, salsa, hot sauce, horseradish, relish, hummus, reduced fat mayonnaise with olive oil, or a drizzle of olive oil and vinegar.
Make sure to measure out the appropriate portion size as well. Many are only 1 teaspoon or tablespoon per serving.

, Many sandwich fillings contain some sort of protein. Whether it's peanut butter and jelly or a ham and cheese, protein usually plays an important role; however, many protein options for sandwiches are overly high in sodium.Sandwich fillings that are frequently high in sodium include nut butters, deli meat, bacon, sausage, salami, and frozen veggie patties.
A diet high in sodium can increase your risk for high blood pressure and stroke. Sticking to lower sodium items is better for your health.Instead of traditional deli meat items, try the following lower sodium items: roasted turkey or chicken breast, low-sodium deli meat (look for this on the label) or sliced grilled steak.
Add about 3 – 4 oz of lean protein to your sandwich. This is about one serving and will help keep you satisfied.

, A nice slice of cheese really completes a sandwich. Don't skip it in favor of lower calories. Cheese can also add extra nutrients to your sandwich.


Cheese is part of the dairy food group. It contains a decent amount of calcium, Vitamin D and even has some protein.Whether or not you choose fat-free, reduced fat or full fat cheese is up to you. The calorie difference between these options is minimal. Fat-free cheese is more processed than the full fat, so you may enjoy the flavor of the full-fat.
Make sure to measure the appropriate serving of cheese. Only add one slice or about 1-2 ounces per sandwich.

, An easy way to make any sandwich or wrap a bit healthier is by adding vegetables. They can add a whole host of beneficial nutrients to your meal.Vegetables are great to add to sandwiches. They can add flavor and crunch without many added calories.
In addition, vegetables are high in fiber, vitamins and antioxidants. Adding just a few to your sandwich can really boost the overall nutritional content.
You can add any type of veggie to your sandwich. It can be as simple as lettuce and tomato or you could a little more fancy with caramelized onions and roasted red peppers.
One serving of vegetables is about 1 cup or 2 cups of leafy greens. You probably won't be able to get an entire serving on a sandwich, but aim for about 1/2 serving.

, If you enjoy the traditional BLT, you may also love a BALT — or a BLT that has avocado. It's a simple twist on a classic, but something you're bound to love.


Start by toasting two pieces of 100% whole grain bread. You can also use 100% whole wheat wrap as well.
Spread 1 tablespoon of low-fat, olive oil based mayo on one side of the toast or wrap.
Top with three to four slices of cooked bacon (it should be around 3 oz), two to three leaves of romaine lettuce and one to two thick slices of a ripe tomato.
Last, top with 1/2 of a thinly sliced avocado. Sprinkle with salt and pepper and either roll up your wrap or top with the remaining slice of bread.

, If you're looking for a vegetarian based wrap, try this Mediterranean wrap. It's packed full of vegetables and makes for a great, high-fiber meal.


Start with a 8"" 100% whole wheat wrap. Spread on about 3 – 4 tablespoons of your favorite hummus. Evenly spread the hummus over the entire wrap.
Then top with 1/2 of an avocado that's been sliced very thinly. Sprinkle with a little salt and pepper to taste.
Then layer on: 1/4 cup of sliced roasted red peppers, 2 tablespoons of diced black olives, 1/4 cup of thinly sliced cucumbers and 2 tablespoons of crumbled feta cheese.
Roll up your wrap tightly. Slice in half and enjoy.

, Cut down on your carbohydrate intake by making spicy salmon lettuce cups. Using sweet, cup-shaped butter lettuce is a great substitute for bread in this recipe.


Start by laying out two leaves of butter lettuce. Try to use the bigger, outer leaves. You can also use iceberg lettuce leaves as well.
Fill each lettuce cup with about 1/3 cup of canned salmon (you can also use tuna in the recipe as well).
Lightly drizzle about 1 teaspoon of your favorite hot sauce on top of each salmon cup. You can add more if you like things more spicy.
Also top each of your salmon cups with about 1/4 cup of pico de gallo, 1 teaspoon fresh cilantro chopped and salt and pepper to taste.

, A warm, cheesy tuna melt is a great sandwich. Keep it portion controlled by using whole wheat English muffins instead of traditional sandwich bread.


Start by separating the halves of a whole wheat English muffin. Toast until your desired doneness.
While your English muffin is toasting, mix together a 3.5 oz can of tuna with 2 tablespoons of low-fat mayo with olive oil, 1 tablespoon of relish, and salt and pepper to taste.
Scoop half of the tuna salad onto one side of the English muffin. Repeat with the remaining tuna salad and English muffin half.
Top each half with 1 tablespoon of shredded cheddar cheese. Place under the broiler for about 30 – 60 seconds or until the cheese melts.

Bread
Ham (It doesn't matter what type you use)
Butter
A spread you like putting on your bread (Nutella, Peanut Butter, Jam, etc.);
, Get a slice of bread and grab a cup. If you don't want to waste bread, use a small glass or possibly a shot glass to make the circles. Push the cup down on the bread and twist it a few times and when you take it out of the bread a bread circle should be in the cup or on the plate/counter.

, Turn on your panini press and let it heat for at least ten seconds then smear a little bit of butter under your bread circles and drop them on. There isn't a problem if you hear a sizzle, it's just the butter melting around the bread.

, Get a slice of ham and fold in half or fold it so there is a little loop in the middle. When you've folded it, use a spatula or something you can pick it up with that has a flat surface and then drop it on your panini press with the bread circles. This is so the ham will become a little more crisp depending on how long you leave it on the panini press.

, When you've put the ham slice on the panini press, flip your bread slices but before you flip them, smear a bit of butter on the top and then flip it. After flipping it, leave the side to ""cook"" for at least 10-15 seconds depending on how crisp you want them.

, A few seconds after you flip your bread circles, flip your ham but before you flip them do the same thing with the bread circles and smear a little bit of butter on it. This will cause the ham to be moist and juicy.

, Smear a bit of butter on your bread circles again and then flip them. After flipping them, turn of your panini press so it can cool down and doesn't overheat. Don't worry, it won't immediately go cold, it will stay hot and cool nice and slowly.

, After it's been 10-15 seconds, turn your panini press on and flip your ham doing the same thing you did the first time you flipped them. Then flip your bread circles, again, smearing butter on top before you flip them.

, When it has been 10-15 seconds, turn of your panini press and put your bread slices and ham on a plate. Make sure to clean any stains with a cold cloth. The water will help with the panini press cooling down.

, Put your folded ham in the middle of your bread slices and spread your chosen topping spread on the top and eat!

Sambar powder (purchased or homemade)
Tamarind paste, which you can make by purchasing dried tamarind and soaking it.
Black mustard seeds
Curry leaves
Turmeric is a sixth optional ingredient.
Masoor dal (red lentils) take less time to cook than toor daal. But you can make toor daal easily in a pressure cooker.;
, Like many Indian dishes, sambar is a combination of a grain like masoor or toor daal and a tadka, which is the Indian word for “tempering”.


Tadka, or tempering, is done by heating whole or ground spices in hot oil or glee and adding it to a dish. It is a widely used method in Indian cuisine for many dishes, including sambar.In sambar, the tadka is traditionally made with several spices, including mustard seeds, sambar powder, asafoetida (also called “hing”) a key ingredient in Indian vegetarian cooking that helps you to digest, Indian chili powder, and curry leaves. However, you can add other spices like cumin, turmeric, and fenugreek seeds, The nice thing about sambar is you can make it as light or as hearty as you’d like based on the amount of water you add, as well as the types of fresh vegetables you include in the dish. Some possible vegetables for sambar include:


Onion: a required vegetable that will serve as part of the base for the sambar.
Tomato: this will help to balance out the sourness of the tamarind paste.
Spinach: a nice, light dash of green in the stew.
Potatoes: heartier but a great addition to the stew.
Carrots
Drum sticks: a long, green vegetable that resembles a bean, popular in Indian dishes. The soft, jelly interior of the drum sick is eaten and the skin is discarded.Pumpkin, or white pumpkin.
Brinjal, also known as eggplant.
Okra, also known as “lady fingers”, a highly nutritious pod like vegetable., If you are using tomato, spinach, eggplant, or okra, give the vegetables a light rinse before you cut them up. If you are using potatoes, carrots, drumsticks or pumpkin, peel the skin off the vegetables with a peeler or a sharp knife.


Peel off the skin of the onion.

, Cut the onion, tomato, and other vegetables into small, bite sized pieces.


To chop up the drumsticks, first chop off the tops of the drumsticks and then peel them with a sharp knife. Dice them into finger length pieces of equal size., Tamarind adds a subtle sour flavor to the sambar. To prepare the tamarind paste:Place warm water in a bowl and soak the tamarind for about 30 minutes.
Once the tamarind is soft, squeeze the tamarind pods with your fingers and remove the pulp.
Strain the tamarind juice with a strainer. Set the tamarind paste aside.

, While you can make sambar in a pot on the stovetop, using a pressure cooker will cut down on the cooking time.

, Use a colander to rinse the toor daal under cold water until the water underneath runs clear., Then, pour enough water to just cover the contents.


To further save time, you can also soak the toor daal for 15 minutes in hot water before putting it in the pressure cooker., Close the lid of the pressure cooker and weigh it down. Leave it on high., Open the lid of the pressure cooker and mash the daal with a ladle or spoon. They should be soft and mushy.

, Stir well. Then, add in the turmeric powder, the red chili powder, a pinch of asafoetida, and salt.


Add two cups of water. Stir the ingredients well.

, Be careful not to overcook the vegetables.

, Add the sambar powder.


Add water if needed to give a medium thick consistency to the stew. Add more water for a thinner stew.

, Once the stew is done cooking, keep it covered and set it aside.

, Use a colander to rinse the daal under cold water until the water underneath runs clear., Bring it to a boil over medium-high heat and then turn the heat down to a simmer.


While the daal is cooking, ladle out any foam that comes to the surface.
Once the foaming stops, mix in the turmeric.

, If you are using spinach in your sambar, add the chopped spinach and cook for 3-4 minutes, or until the spinach is wilted.


If you are using other vegetables like carrots, potatoes, eggplant, drumsticks, or okra, add them to the daal.

, Mix well. Simmer for 5 minutes. A golden residue should form on the surface of the lentils.

, Make sure the tamarind dissolves completely.


Add more water to the daal if you want a thinner stew.
Cook the stew for a few more minutes and then remove it from the heat.

, Heat 2-3 tablespoons of oil or ghee.

, Wait for the mustard seeds to start popping.


To speed this up, you can cover the pan with a lid.
Once the mustard seeds have popped for a few seconds, turn the heat down and add the curry leaves and the dried red chili.
You can also add in the fenugreek seeds if you are using them.

, Fry them for a few seconds.


Some recipes recommend adding the chopped onions at this point, rather than in the pressure cooker with the daal.
If you add the chopped onions, sauté  them in the spices on low heat for about 10 minutes until they turn transparent.

, If you are adding it to the daal in a pressure cooker, immediately cover the cooker once you’ve added it, so the aroma and flavor from the tadka gets infused in the daal.If you are adding the tadka to daal in a pot on the stovetop, mix the tadka into the daal and cover the pot., Like most stews, the flavors of sambar become better and deeper with time.However, you can also serve sambar as soon as it is made.

, Sprinkle chopped cilantro or mint leaves over the sambar before serving., Dosas are fermented lentil and rice crepes that are easy to make.You can also purchase dosas at an Indian supermarket.
Another option is to add yogurt or achar (Indian pickles) on the side to complement the sambar."

Check out other frying articles.",How to Make Beer Batter," Beer batter can be made with any style or variety of beer, so you should feel free to experiment with different styles to see what you like best. If you've got Bud Lite on hand, that would make for just as good a beer batter as a craft IPA.


Generally, ales and lagers are used to make beer batters. The lighter and more carbonated, the lighter the batter. If you're not a big fan of beer flavors, use a lighter lager or a pilsner.
Darker stouts, porters, and ales are also perfectly fine for making beer batter, and will add a malty richness to the batter. Sometimes, these beers are significantly less carbonated, so it might be a good idea to cut it with half sparkling water.;
, It's fine to just use beer in the batter, but some people like to cut it in half with an equal amount of water to stretch the batter a bit, and to save the beer for drinking with dinner.


While beer batter is similar in some ways to a basic pancake batter, never add milk to beer batter. Milk added to beer will curdle.
If you're wondering, the process of frying the beer cooks off all the alcohol. Adding more beer won't make the fried food more boozy.

, Into your beer mixture, beat an egg directly into the liquid, until its frothy. Some people leave this step out and just stick to a basic beer-and-flour batter, which is perfectly effective. But, beating in an egg helps to add a little body and golden richness to the batter, helping it to crisp up a little more nicely.

, Holding your whisk in one hand, start adding flour to the beer mixture, a few tablespoons at a time, whipping it vigorously to avoid lumps. Integrate all the flour you add until you add more.


If you use one 12 oz bottle or can of beer, you'll need about 2 cups of flour to make batter. This will make enough batter to coat about 20 fish fillets.

, If you want a fluffier, more cakey beer batter, it's also good at this point to add about a 3/4 of baking powder, like if you were making pancakes. If you don't have it on hand, it's also fine to leave out.

, Depending on how much batter you're making, and what you're using with it, you may want it thicker, or thinner, depending. Some people prefer a thicker, hearty coating, while others prefer a thinner and lighter version, which can be more crispy. Totally up to you.


Some people suggest adding flour until the whisker can stand straight up in the bowl. Match the batter to complement what you're making. If you're making a really light, flaky fish, or squash chips, try to keep the batter somewhat lighter in turn., Generally, beer batter is seasoned with little more than salt and fresh black pepper, but you can use whatever seasonings match the dish that you're eventually planning to make.


If you're making fish, add a little Old Bay, or Cajun spice mix to the batter.
If you're making vegetable chips, or fried potatoes, try adding a pinch of curry powder, or turmeric.

, After you've made your beer batter and prepared the food that you're going to batter it with, set up a battering station just to the side of the stove, where you can drop the food into the oil, and bring it out effectively. If you can, frying food is a little easier with a helper, since it takes a lot of steps that need to happen pretty quickly.


To the left, put your raw fish, or chopped onions, or other vegetables, then put the bowl of batter between the food and the oil. On the other side of the range, have a plate waiting with some paper towels, to place the fried items onto when they're done cooking.
It's a good idea to wear gloves and long sleeves, and to pull your hair back while you're doing this. It's not the cleanest process. Also, its' s a good idea to crack a window, because the smell of frying oil is pretty strong.

, The best pans for frying food evenly are big cast-iron skillets, which will distribute the heat and offer a more even cooking.


If you don't have one, use a flat-bottomed skillet with as heavy a bottom as you've got, or a deep fryer.

, Vegetable oil needs to be heated to 375 degrees F to fry food in it effectively.If the temperature is too low, the batter will absorb much of the oil and will become extremely greasy and cloying. If you don't have a food thermometer, the best way to tell is to look for the oil to start shimmering on top some.


It's also a good idea to add a little bit of batter by itself while the oil is heating. When you see it start to sizzle quickly, you know its time to add the battered items you're making.

, When the oil is ready, and not before, batter a few pieces of fish or vegetables, whatever you're planning on frying, and place them immediately into the hot oil.


Make sure food is dry before dipping into wet beer batter. If your fish fillets are very delicate, or damp, it's good to dust them lightly in flour before dipping them in the beer-batter. This helps fish fillets and shellfish hold the batter slightly better.
Don't soak the food in the batter. It should collect enough to create the crust just by quickly submerging it in the batter and removing it.

, Carefully lay your food into the hot oil, by dropping it away from you, very gently. Drop one end of each fillet or vegetable in to the food, and then lean it back toward the back of the skillet, away from you. This way, the oil will spatter in that direction.


Adding food will lower the temperature of the oil slightly, so you want to be sure to avoid overcrowding the skillet. You can add a few pieces, depending on the size of the food you're frying, but usually no more than 3-4. If you overcrowd the pan, nothing will cook properly, and the food will be oily.
When the oil is hot, it will start to spit and spatter a bit, even when you're not dropping stuff, which means you should be extremely careful to avoid burns.

, Just leave the food alone as it fries, checking every minute or two for brownness on the bottom side. Flip species when they're golden, and let the other side fry.

, Fish and vegetables will cook pretty quickly in the fryer, so they're usually safe to remove when the crust is golden brown. Remove them with your metal turner immediately, shifting them to the plate prepared with paper towel.

Serve.",How to Make Barbacoa1," Blend the ingredients together at medium to high speed until a thick puree forms.


Do not drain the adobo sauce from the chipotle chiles before adding them. You should pour the sauce into the blender along with the chiles.;
, Place the beef on top of it, and pour the beef broth over the meat. Place the bay leaf on top.


Coat the beef in the sauce by turning it a few times, dipping all sides in the sauce at least once in the process.
Use a 5-qt to 7-qt (5-L to 7-L) slow cooker for best results. Cut the beef into several chunks, if necessary, to fit it into the slow cooker.

, If you want it done sooner, set the slow cooker to high and cook the beef for 6 hours.Resist the temptation to open the lid and peek at your meal as it cooks. Doing so releases the trapped steam, and that steam is partially responsible for cooking the meat. As a result, the overall cooking time can increase 15 to 30 minutes every time you open the slow cooker.

, Remove the beef from the slow cooker and place it on a cutting board or rimmed baking sheet. Use two forks to shred the beef into pieces, working from the outside in.


While shredding the beef, you should also discard any fat.
A rimmed baking sheet or cutting board works best since some of the juices inside the beef can run as you work with it. Without a rimmed surface, these juices can create a big mess.

, Transfer the shredded beef to a large bowl. Ladle a little of the cooking liquid into the bowl, mixing after each addition. Add enough sauce to keep the beef thoroughly moist, but do not add so much that the beef drown in it or becomes soupy.


If you have some cooking liquid left behind after you coat the beef, you can fill a spare ice cube tray with it and freeze the liquid for later use. These cubes of barbacoa sauce can be used to flavor stocks, soups, gravies, and other dishes later on.

, If you are not ready to serve the barbacoa yet, return it to the slow cooker and switch the appliance to its ""warm"" setting.


You can keep it warm using this method for another 2 to 4 hours. After that point, you should consider transferring any uneaten beef to airtight containers and storing it in the refrigerator. Reheat it in the microwave after refrigerator storage.

, The beef barbacoa is ready to eat. Serve it to your family or guests while still warm, and offer it with an accompaniment of tortillas, onion, cilantro, and salsa.

Serve.",How to Make Barbacoa2," Heat a heavy skillet over medium heat on the stove. Add the dried guajillo chiles to the skillet and cook for about 5 minutes, or until they turn puffy and change color.Do not add any oil, butter, or margarine to the pan before toasting the chiles.
Turn the chiles occasionally as they cook.
When done, set the chiles aside for a couple of minutes until they are cool enough to touch. Once cool, you need to remove the stems, seeds, and veins.
Wear food-grade plastic gloves when handling chiles to protect your skin and eyes.

, Place the toasted and deveined chiles in a small bowl and pour boiling water on top of them. Cover the bowl with a lid or plastic wrap, and let the chiles soak for a full 1 hour.

, Add the cumin and cloves to the hot skillet used for your chiles. Toast, stirring frequently, until the cumin seeds just begin to pop.


Remove the toasted seeds from the heat as soon as they are ready.
Note that this step can be done while you are waiting for the chiles to cool, or it can be done afterward. Regardless, the pan should be both hot and dry when you add the cumin and cloves to it.

, Place them in spice grinder or coffee grinder and grind them into a powder.


If using a coffee grinder, make sure that it has been thoroughly cleaned before use and is thoroughly cleaned after use. Otherwise, you could end up with coffee-flavored sauce or cumin and clove tainted coffee.

, Place the cumin powder, clove powder, ancho chile powder, onion, garlic, oregano, thyme, vinegar, and lime juice in a blender. Remove the chiles from the water and add them as well, along with 3 Tbsp (45 ml) of the chile-infused water. Cover and blend at a medium to high speed until a smooth paste forms.


A food processor could be used instead of a blender, but either way, you need to produce a smooth paste when done.
Stop the blender occasionally and scrape the sides down with a spatula before continuing to blend.

, Place the beef into a large mixing bowl and cover it with the marinade paste. Cover the bowl securely using plastic wrap, then put it in the refrigerator 6 hours to overnight for marinating purposes.


For best results, turn the beef several times before you sealing off the bowl. Coat all sides of the beef in the sauce as you turn the roast.

, Prepare a large roasting pan by lightly spraying it with nonstick cooking spray.


Wait until the oven has completely finished preheating before moving on to the next step.

, Transfer the beef roast to the roasting pan. Pour the marinade over it, and place the bay leaf on top. Cover the whole thing with an oven-safe lid or aluminum foil and cook until the meat becomes very tender.

, Remove the finished beef barbacoa out of the oven. Allow it to rest on the counter for roughly 45 to 60 minutes. When done, shred the beef with two forks.


Keep the cover on the roasting pan while the beef rests.
This resting period allows the beef to finish cooking and forces the juices to distribute themselves more easily. It also gives the beef a little time to cool to a more comfortable, easier to eat temperature.
Discard the bay leaf before shredding the beef.

, The beef barbacoa is ready to eat at this point. It is usually served warm with tortillas and various toppings, like chopped onions or cilantro.

Clean the beef tongue.,
Place all the ingredients in a slow cooker.,
Cook on low for 8 hours.,
Remove the skin of the tongue.,
Shred the meat.,
Moisten the shredded meat.,
Serve.",How to Make Barbacoa3," Rinse the beef tongue under cool running water and pat dry with clean paper towels.


When buying beef tongue, it is especially important that you purchase it from a reliable source. You may need to buy it in frozen form, rather than buying it fresh, since it is not a common cut of meat in most geographic areas.

, Put the beef tongue in the bottom of the slow cooker. Surround it with your cut onions and garlic cloves, then sprinkle it with salt. Pour the water over the entire thing.There is no need to turn the beef tongue. The flavors of the garlic, onion, and salt should sink into the meat as it cooks.
Cover the slow cooker with its lid before continuing.

, The meat should be tender enough to shred when done.


If you do not have a full 8 hours, you could switch the slow cooker to high and cook the beef tongue for 4 to 5 hours, instead.
Do not remove the lid during the initial cook time. Doing so can release too much steam, and since the steam is partially responsible for cooking the meat, letting it escape can increase the overall cook time by another 15 to 30 minutes.
If the meat does not feel tender after 8 hours, you may need to cook it for another 1 to 2 hours.

, Place the cooked beef tongue in a large dish or rimmed baking sheet. Make a shallow cut in the skin at the open end of the beef tongue, then peel the rest of the skin off using your fingers.


You should also trim away any fatty tissue at the bottom end of the tongue using the knife.
The majority of the cut will be edible meat, even after you cut away the skin and fat.

, Use two forks to shred the tongue meat into pieces. Work from the outside and move inward into the cut of meat.

, Place the shredded tongue meat into a large mixing bowl. Ladle a little of the cooking liquid on top, then toss well to coat.


Use enough liquid to moisten the meat without drowning it.
Ideally, the liquid should be degreased and strained before you pour it over the meat.

, The barbacoa beef tongue is ready to eat and enjoy. Serve it on warm tortillas, and offer garnishes such as cilantro, chopped white onion, and salsa.

Just choose a savory jam that will compliment the fillings. Consider grilling the sandwich for an extra toasty flavor. Try one of these combinations:Smoked turkey with raspberry horseradish jam
Hamburgers with onion jam
Grilled cheese with tomato jam

, You can easily make a cheese ball using your favorite type of cheese. Let it chill completely, so it sets up and set out several types of savory jams to serve with the cheese and crackers. Or you could mix savory jam into a soft cheese to create a dip.


For example, stir onion or garlic jam into soft goat cheese for a rich dip.

, Whisk together a quick vinaigrette to use in salads or to dress roasted vegetables. Pour a little vinegar (you can use any type you like) and olive oil into a small bowl. Stir in a few teaspoons of savory jam and whisk the vinaigrette until the mixture is combined.You could try raspberry horseradish jam combined with balsamic vinegar and olive oil. Or use peach jalapeno jam with champagne vinegar and olive oil.

, You can quickly add flavor to a dish by spreading savory jam over it during the final minutes of cooking. Use a pastry brush to spread a savory jam over ham, chicken, pork tenderloin, or salmon. Glaze the dish during the last 15 to 20 minutes of cooking time.If you glaze a large roast when it starts cooking, the glaze could burn because the roast needs to cook for so long. That's why it's important to wait till the end of the cooking time.

, Cook your favorite pasta noodles and cook up a basic sauce. Stir a few tablespoons of a savory jam into the sauce for an instant flavor boost. You can add it to marinara or basic white sauces. Toss the noodles with the sauce until they're coated.


For example, you could make a basic fettuccine alfredo, but add garlic jam to the sauce for an even stronger flavor.

, Instead of spreading classic marinara sauce or alfredo sauce on your pizza dough, spread savory jam. Top the pizza dough or flatbread with a few simple ingredients, so you don't overwhelm the flavors of the jam. For example, use a roasted red pepper jam with fresh mozzarella and basil.


You could also use pineapple sriracha jam on a pizza with ham and cheese for a fresh take on a Hawaiian pizza.

Warm the pan.,
Pour the cold-pressed sesame oil into the pan.,
Transfer the hot oil carefully into a glass bowl, and allow the oil to cool to room temperature.,
Store the sesame oil.",How to Toast Sesame Oil,";
,


Place the clean, dry pan on a stove top burner set to medium heat. It is important to use a hot pan to toast the oil.
Ideally, you should be able to feel heat radiating from the surface of the pan before you pour in the oil. Hold your hand a few inches above the pan. If you can only hold your hand in this position for a few seconds before the temperature becomes too much, the pan is ready for toasting.

,


Start by pouring a small amount of the sesame oil into the heated pan. Carefully grip the handle of the pan with your dominant hand, and slowly rotate the pan from side to side. Keep the liquid moving during its entire cooking time to prevent possible burning of the sesame oil. The sesame oil is properly toasted when it acquires a golden brown color. In addition, a rich, nutty scent will begin to develop. When this occurs, remove the pan from the heat source.

,


If you want to toast more oil than the pan can accommodate at one time, you can repeat the process until you have prepared the desired amount.

,


After all of the toasted oil has reached room temperature, it can be placed in an airtight container. This container can be kept in the refrigerator for up to 1 year. Be sure to put a label on the container indicating the product and its preparation date.

Enhance your brownies.,
Add filling to your muffins.,
Make homemade pop tarts.",How to Use Fruit Preserves2," If you have some cherry, strawberry, or raspberry preserves you want to get rid of, add them to your brownie mix. Use a store bought brownie kit or follow your own brownie recipe. After you mix the brownies up, fold the preserves into the batter. Use ½ cup (118 ml) to one cup (236.6 ml).It may take a bit of experimenting to get the right amount of preserves. If you make the brownies once and the fruit taste isn’t very strong, add a little more next time.
Any fruit can be used, but the ones mentioned above tend to mix well with chocolate.

, Use a package of muffin mix, or mix up a batch of your favorite muffin recipe. When you fill the wrappers or muffin pan, fill each section half full. Then put about one tablespoon of fruit preserves on top of the muffin mix. Fill each muffin section the rest of the way with muffin mix. Bake the muffins as you normally would.The muffins will bake up as usual but will now have a tasty, gooey center of fruit preserves.

, Buy flat sheets of pre-made pastry dough. Cut them into smaller, rectangular sections. Spoon preserves onto half of the pieces, then cover each one with another piece. Press the edges with a fork to mold the two pieces together. Freeze the tarts for a few hours, then bake for 25 minutes at 375℉ (190 ℃).This works for pretty much any flavor of preserves, depending on what you have and your preference.
If you want, after you take the poptarts out of the oven, top them with some warm cream cheese spread or icing.

Make a preserves and whipped cream treat.,
Enhance your cocktails with preserves.,
Make a fruit spritzer.",How to Use Fruit Preserves3," Fruit preserves are added to whipped cream with crushed vanilla wafer cookies for a classic English treat. For a single serving, use about ⅓ cup (78.9 ml) whipped cream and ½ cup (118 ml) fruit preserves. Crush four or five cookies into the mix. Larger batches can be made by multiplying the recipe.Only use preserves and cream that are thoroughly chilled. If necessary, chill the treat for a half hour or so after you mix it up.

, The next time you mix up a cocktail that includes fruit, use preserves instead. Strawberry and peach are great for whiskey cocktails. Mixed berry and raspberry are great for vodka. It’s best to add the alcohol and fruit preserves to a shaker and shake it to mix them thoroughly.Pour the drink over ice. Sometimes it’s best to strain it, as well.

, Scoop a heaping spoonful of preserves into a pint sized canning jar (or a shaker). Add ¼ cup (60 ml) warm water, put the lid on, and shake. Then remove the lid, add ice, and top the jar off with club soda or sparkling water. You have a refreshing fruit flavored sparkling water. This works well with any preserves you have on hand."

Make a red wine steak marinade.",How to Make Red Wine Marinade1," Red wine and rosemary are earthy flavors that work well with pork, roasts, and chicken meals. If you don't have fresh rosemary, you can substitute dried rosemary. Just use one tablespoon instead of two. For the rosemary red wine marinade, measure and mix together:⅓ cup (80 ml) of dry red wine
½ cup (120 ml) of red-wine vinegar
2 tablespoons of chopped fresh rosemary
1 teaspoon of salt
½ teaspoon of freshly ground pepper;
, Soy sauce adds depth of flavor to a red wine marinade which makes it great for chicken or pork dishes. You can use reduced-sodium soy sauce if you're watching your sodium intake. Measure out and mix together these marinade ingredients into a bowl:1 cup (240 ml) of soy sauce
1 cup (240 ml) of red wine (like merlot or cabernet sauvignon)
1 cup (240 ml) of red wine vinegar
1 small diced shallot
2 finely minced cloves of garlic

, Red wine works well as a marinade for juicy steak. Use the same type of wine in the marinade that you plan on serving with the steak. Measure out and whisk together the following ingredients for the marinade:1 cup (240 ml) of dry red wine
1/3 cup (80 ml) of soy sauce
2 tablespoons of lemon juice
2 tablespoons of Worcestershire sauce
2 tablespoons of Dijon mustard
2 tablespoons of honey
1 teaspoon of minced garlic

Choose a food to marinate.,
Pick an acid for the marinade base.,
Select an oil or fat for the marinade.,
Add herbs and spices to the marinade.,
Mix your red wine marinade.",How to Make Red Wine Marinade2," You can marinate almost any food, although some foods work better with a red wine marinade than others. Consider marinating a food that also has robust, earthy flavors similar to those found in red wine. Good foods to marinate in red wine include:


Steak or beef
Chicken
Pork
Salmon
Tofu
Eggplant and mushrooms

, Acidic foods are important in a marinade because they tenderize the food you're marinating. Since you're making a red wine marinade, most of the acid will come from the red wine, although you could also add other acidic foods to develop flavor. You should use 1/2 cup to 1 cup (120 to 240 ml) of acidic liquid for your marinade. Other acidic foods include:Red wine vinegar
Honey
Dijon mustard
Tomato puree
Worcestershire sauce

, To give the red wine marinade extra flavor, you should include 1/4 cup to 1/2 cup (60 to 120 ml) of oil or fat. For a basic marinade, you could just add olive oil or melted butter. But if you want to add additional flavor, try using:Peanut oil
Sesame oil
Walnut oil
Grapeseed oil

, You'll only need to add 1/2 teaspoon to 2 teaspoons of seasonings to the marinade, but they'll give a lot of flavor to your overall dish. Think about the other flavors you're serving with the meal so you choose herbs and spices that work well together. Consider adding:


Spices: salt, pepper, cayenne, curry, onion powder, allspice, cinnamon, paprika
Herbs: rosemary, parsley, sage, cilantro, horseradish, wasabi, ginger

, Once you've chosen the oil, herbs, and spices to add to the red wine base, mix them together in a small mixing bowl. Stir together the red wine (and any other acidic foods you're using) with the oil until they're combined. Then you can gently stir in any fresh herbs or seasonings.Taste the marinade and adjust the seasonings according to your liking before you use the marinade.

Consider tenderizing your meat.,
Combine the food with the marinade.,
Refrigerate and marinate the food.,
Remove the food and cook it.",How to Make Red Wine Marinade3," Most thin cuts of meat, seafood, and tofu are ready to marinate. But if you have a thick cut of meat, like a large steak, you may want to tenderize it so it soaks up more of the marinade. If the meat is over one-inch (2.5 cm) thick, use a sharp knife or jaccard meat tenderizer to poke holes in the meat.The meat tenderizer does the best job of preparing the meat for marinating. Only use it if the meat is thick since thin cuts will do a fine job of absorbing the marinade.

, Place your meat, seafood, tofu or vegetables into a large, sealable freezer bag. Pour the red wine marinade into the bag and carefully press out as much air as you can. Zip the freezer bag shut so it's completely sealed. Press the bag to incorporate the food and the marinade.


Consider setting the bag of marinating food in a baking dish. This way, if there are any leaks, the dish will catch the mess.

, Marinating times will vary depending on what food you're preparing. Small or thin foods (like salmon or shellfish) only need to marinate between 5 and 30 minutes. Larger cuts of meat (like stew meat, chicken, or pork chops) will need to marinate between 1 to 3 hours.Big cuts (like rack of lamb or ribs) should marinate overnight.

, Take the food out of the refrigerator and let it set out until the marinade is at room temperature. Only let the food sit out for up to 20 minutes before you cook it. You can cook the food in the marinade or remove it to cook the food separately.For example, try cooking the chicken in a rosemary red wine marinade along with potatoes.
Avoid cooking the food and serving it with the raw marinade. If you want to serve the marinade on the side, bring it to a boil in a small saucepan before serving it.

Purchase two 16-ounce packages of frozen peaches.,
Wash, pit, and quarter the peaches.,
Simmer the peaches.,
Strain and jar the peach syrup.,
Thicken your syrup if its consistency is too thin.,
Keep the peach pulp for use in smoothies or cooking.,
Store the syrup in your refrigerator.",How to Make Peach Syrup," Your peach syrup will taste best if it’s prepared with fresh and organic peaches.Visit your local supermarket and see what they have in stock. When selecting peaches, look closely at the skin and make sure that the peach is not torn or bruised. The peaches you select should not be firm (a sign of under-ripe fruit) but should gently give if you squeeze slightly.


If applicable, look in your supermarket’s organic section, or visit a nearby organic foods or health-food store. Peaches sold at these locations will likely be healthier and will have been grown under organic conditions.;
, If you live in a city or neighborhood that has a frequent farmer’s market, plan to purchase your peaches there. Peaches from a local vendor are likely to have been picked within only a few days, and will have been grown without pesticides.


Farmer’s markets are typically only open during the spring and summer months, roughly from April through September. Look online or ask at a local grocery store to find out if there’s a farmer’s market near you.

, If you’re preparing the recipe in a hurry and don’t have time to prepare whole peaches, or if you are unable to find ripe, fresh, or organic peaches, just grab frozen peaches out of the frozen-foods section at your local grocery store.As with shopping for fresh peaches, look for organic bags of frozen peaches. These will have been prepared without pesticides.

, To begin preparing the peaches for the sauce, you’ll need to wash off any dirt from the fuzzy skin of the peach. (Be sure to leave the skin on however, as it contains both nutrients and flavor.) Then slice the peaches in half, and use your fingers to pry out the peach pit. Finally, cut the peaches in half again, so that you are left with peach quarters.Although this recipe only calls for four peaches, it can easily be doubled or tripled. As long as you’re washing and cutting peaches, consider preparing eight or twelve instead of only four.

, Take your peach quarters, and place them in a large saucepan. Add 1 cup of water, ¼ cup of fresh lemon juice, and 3 cups of granulated sugar. Do not stir the mixture, but cover and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Once the mixture is simmering, reduce to a low temperature and allow it to simmer for 30 to 45 minutes.Do not stir the peaches while they’re simmering. Even gentle stirring can smash the peach quarters and break them apart. In order to have relatively well preserved peach pieces, let the mixture simmer unstirred.

, Once your peach syrup has simmered, turn off the burner and remove the saucepan. You’ll need to strain the syrup to separate the syrup itself from the peach quarters. To do this, pour the contents of the saucepan into a fine colander and set this over a large bowl or container. Let the liquid syrup filter out through the colander for about an hour.As the syrup strains, use a wooden spoon to press down on the solid peach material. Press gently: if you exert too much pressure on the peach quarters, they may become damaged and turn the syrup cloudy.

, If the syrup is thinner or runnier than you would like it to be—or if you want to set aside a portion of the syrup and thicken it so that you have syrup of two separate consistencies—you can thicken the syrup using cornstarch. Take a cup of your peach syrup and, using a whisk, blend 1 tablespoon of corn starch into the syrup. Then transfer a mixture to a saucepan and bring to a boil, using the whisk to stir constantly.You can use the color of the syrup to gauge if it has thickened fully. When you’re mixing in the cornstarch at first, the mixture will be cloudy, but after the syrup has boiled for a few minutes, it’ll become clear again.

, The peach pulp itself will still have a strong flavor after simmering and straining, although its consistency will be mushy. You don’t need to throw the pulp away; rather, let it cool and then freeze the pulp in plastic bags or Tupperware containers. The pulp can be combined with other fruits in a smoothie, or added on top of yogurt.If you’d like to even out the consistency of the peach pulp before freezing it, spoon the pulp into a blender and puree it to a uniform consistency.

, Once you have strained the syrup, let it cool down to room temperature; this will take roughly an hour. When the syrup has cooled down, you can pour it into jars, cans, or plastic Tupperware containers and store it in your refrigerator. The fresh peach syrup will keep for about two weeks, so you should plan to consume it all within that period of time."

",How to Make Tomato Paste," Roughly chop the tomatoes with a sharp kitchen knife, cutting them into small pieces.









Plum tomatoes work notably well for this recipe, but you can use just about any other variety of summer tomato desired. Smaller tomatoes generally have a sweeter, lighter taste and are not often used in tomato paste. Larger tomatoes have a richer taste. For the most complex flavor, use several varieties for your paste.
The pieces of chopped tomatoes should be about as small as 1/2-inch (1.25-cm);
, Add 1/4 cup (60 ml) olive oil to a 12-inch (30.5-cm) skillet and heat over high heat.









For the best flavor, use extra-virgin olive oil. Other grades of olive oil also work well. If you do not have olive oil in your pantry, you may substitute canola oil or a flavorless vegetable oil.
Let the oil heat for a few minutes before proceeding further.

, Add the chopped tomatoes to the skillet. Season them with a little salt, to taste, and bring them to a boil. Cook until softened.









Be aware that the tomatoes may splatter some when you add them or as you cook them. To reduce splatter, use a skillet with tall sides.
Stir the tomatoes continually as you cook them.
The tomatoes should become very soft. After they reach a boil, you should cook them for about 8 minutes or so.
Remove from heat and let cool slightly once softened.
The amount of salt you add really depends on your own sense of taste. As a guideline, though, add about 1/2 tsp (2.5 ml) salt for every 5 plum tomatoes or 2 beefsteak tomatoes.
For a more complex flavor, you could also add 3 cloves of peeled, smashed garlic and 2 bay leaves to the tomatoes as they soften.Just make sure to use the tomato paste in recipes that complement the strong flavor of garlic.
For a unique yet flavorful twist, you can skip the salt altogether and add 1 Tbsp (15 ml) soy sauce, instead., After the tomatoes have cooled slightly, pass them through a food mill. This should separate the skin and seeds from the usable tomato liquid and pulp.









Use the finest plate of a food mill to ensure that all the seeds are sorted out.
If you do not have a food mill, you can remove the skins and seeds separately. Remove the skins before softening the tomatoes in the skillet. After softening them, push the pulp through a fine-mesh strainer to remove the seeds.An easy way to remove the skins before cooking the tomatoes is to drop each tomato in boiling water for 15 to 20 seconds. Quickly transfer the tomatoes to ice water to stop the cooking. At that point, the skins should be easy to peel away with your fingers.
When this process is finished, you should have a thin tomato liquid.

, Transfer the pulpy tomato liquid back into your 12-inch (30.5-cm) skillet.









The bottom of the pan should only be covered by about 1 inch (2.5 cm) of tomatoes. If the level of tomatoes is much lower, the tomatoes are likely to burn. If the level is too much higher, the tomatoes will take a long time to reduce down into paste.
If necessary, transfer the pulpy tomatoes into a smaller or larger pan so that the tomatoes are closer to 1 inch (2.5 cm) deep. You do not need to do anything to prepare the new pan before adding the tomatoes to it.

, Cook the tomatoes uncovered and on medium-low heat until they reduce down to a paste-like consistency.








Stir the tomatoes occasionally as they cook to prevent burning or sticking at the bottom of the pan.
Leave the lid off so that steam and moisture can evaporate into the air. Otherwise, the tomatoes will not be able to reduce properly.
You should be able to see steam coming off the tomatoes in the pan, but they should not boil or simmer. If you see bubbles beginning to surface, reduce the heat down to low.
It can take 2 to 3 hours for the tomatoes to reduce down to paste.

, If the tomatoes are not breaking down evenly, puree them in a food processor or blender.









This step should be done once the tomatoes reach a sauce-like consistency. Do not blend them while they are still liquidy, and do not wait until some of the tomatoes have reduced down into paste.

, Prepare a rimmed baking sheet by coating it with the remaining 2 Tbsp (30 ml) of olive oil.Use a 13-inch by 18-inch (33-cm by 46-cm) baking sheet. Make sure that it has a rim; otherwise, the tomato puree with ooze out over the sides and onto the counter or inside the oven.
If desired, you could also use a large Dutch oven. Leave the lid off as you bake the tomatoes, however.
Olive oil works best, but canola oil or a flavorless vegetable oil can be used if you do not have olive oil stocked in your pantry.

, Pour the briefly-cooked tomato puree over the prepared baking sheet in an even layer.









Spread the puree with a spatula to even it out or gently shift the pan, shaking it side to side while keeping it flat on the counter.

, Most of the water should evaporate and the surface should deepen in color.









Use a spatula to turn the puree over on itself every half hour or so. If you do not do this, the tomatoes will not reduce evenly.
At the end of this stage, the tomatoes should reach a thick sauce-like consistency.

, Turn the oven temperature down to 250 degrees Fahrenheit (130 degrees Celsius). Continue cooking for an additional 20 to 25 minutes.









By the end of this cooking stage, your tomatoes should reduce down to a thick paste. The color should also be that of a deep brick red.

, Place the pieces in a large soup pot or stew pot. Add enough water to cover all of the pieces by about an inch. Bring the water to a boil, reduce to a simmer, and cook the quinces for 45 minutes or so, until the pieces are soft.To test whether the quince pieces are done, poke them with a fork. If the fork slides in easily, the quince is ready.
Overcooking the quince will affect the flavor, so make sure it is simmering, not boiling, as it cooks.

, Use a potato masher to mash the quince into pulp, leaving no large lumps. The mashed quince should be slightly runny, like loose applesauce. Add a little water if it seems too thick.

, Set out a large bowl. Place a mesh strainer over it, and cover the strainer with a large piece of cheesecloth. Pour the quince pulp into the cloth-covered strainer. The juice will begin to run into to the bowl, while the pulp stays in the cloth. Let the pulp strain for about 4 hours.


Check the juice in the bowl every so often. You should end up with 4 to 5 cups after a 3 to 4 hours; if it doesn't seem as though you're getting enough juice, mix some water into the pulp and continue letting it drain.

If you like very sweet jelly, add a full cup of sugar for every cup of juice.
For jelly that is tangy and not too sweet, reduce the sugar by a teaspoon per cup and add a few teaspoons of lemon juice.

, Stir the mixture constantly so the sugar doesn't get stuck to the sides and bottom of the pot. Continue stirring until the sugar has completely dissolved into the juice.

, The jelly will begin producing a layer of foam on its surface as it cooks. Use a spoon to skim this off and discard it. Keep skimming off the foam until the sugar is dissolved.

, As the jelly heats, it will begin to change consistency, since quince have natural properties that cause jelling to occur. When the jelly is ready it will cool into a gelatin-like substance, rather than being runny like juice.


Check to see if the jelly is ready by spooning a bit onto a cold plate.After a few seconds, touch it. If it feels like jelly and slightly resists your touch, it's ready. If it's wet like juice, keep cooking it.
You can also determine whether the jelly is ready by checking its temperature. Use a candy thermometer to monitor the temperature; the jelly should be ready when it reaches 220 °F (104 °C).

",How to Make Simple and Fresh Strawberry Jam," Once you have selected the berries you are going to use--whether you picked them yourself or bought them at the store--place them into a colander and cool water over them, stirring the berries around and making sure they are thoroughly rinsed. You don’t want any bacteria that may have been on the berries lingering in your jam.


You can also use frozen strawberries if you don’t have access to fresh strawberries.;
, Use a knife or spoon to cut or scoop the stems and leaves off of the top of the berries. Your goal is to remove any lingering bits of green. Once all of the berries have been hulled, pour the berries into a large mixing bowl. Use a large wooden spoon to crush the berries so that they turn into a clumpy mush. Crushing the berries releases the little bit of pectin that they contain naturally.


You should have about six cups of crushed berries after the mushing process.
You can also chop the strawberries up into quarters rather than crushing them.

, Pectin is what helps the jam become thick--it occurs naturally in fruit and most store-bought pectin comes from apples. Mix the sugar and pectin together. Pour the crushed strawberries into a large cooking pot and add the pectin-sugar mixture.If you don’t want to use pectin, you will have to use about seven cups of sugar in your recipe. Your jam might be a little runnier than normal jams.

, Stir the berries and the pectin mixture. Continue to stir it every so often so that it doesn’t burn while it comes to a boil. When the mixture is boiling, add the rest of the sugar (about four cups) and stir.

, Once the mixture has been boiling on high for a minute, remove it from the heat. Skim off any foam that has formed on the top of the jam mixture. The foam is just jam that is stuffed full of air so you can leave it on the mixture if you want--it is harmless.Scoop the foam off and put it in a bowl if you want to use it later. You can actually recover the foam, making it back into jam that you can use right away.

, Let a spoon sit in ice cold water for several minutes. Once the spoon as chilled, scoop a spoonful of the jam ‘juice’--the liquid part of the jam--and let it cool off to room temperature on the spoon. When it is room temperature, check its consistency. If it has thickened up nicely, you are good to go.If it is still pretty watery, add ¼ of a package of pectin and bring the mixture back to a boil for another minute.

, It is important to make sure that your jars are very clean because if they contain any bacteria, that bacteria can cause your jam to go bad while it sits in your pantry. You can actually put your jars into a dishwasher to sterilize them. If your dishwasher has a ‘sanitize’ cycle, even better. Keep the jars in the dishwasher on ‘hot dry’ until you need to use them. Making sure they remain hot will ensure that they don’t shatter when you pour the hot jam into them.If you don’t have a dishwasher, you can use hot, soapy water to wash your jars. After you’ve scrubbed them up, rinse them with hot water and then place them in a pot of boiling water for 10 minutes. Leave them in hot (but not boiling) water until you are ready to use them.

, The water should be very hot but not quite boiling. Once it has reached this level of heat, place your jar lids into the boiling water. Doing this will sanitize the lids, which is just as important as sanitizing the jars. Imagine opening your jar of jam in the middle of winter as a special treat, only to find that the jam has gone completely bad. It would be very upsetting., Use extra caution when taking the lids out of the water--they will be very hot. Use tongs or a ‘magnetic can lifter’ to get the lids out safely. You can purchase a magnetic lifter at any kitchen supply store or online.

, Fill the jars up to about a fourth of an inch from the top of each jar. Make sure that you wipe up any spilled jam on the sides or around the mouth of the jar. Place the lid on top of each jar, put the ring around the lid, and tighten until you can’t tighten it anymore.

, There should be enough water in the pot that when the jars on placed in the water, there will still be about two inches of water left above the jars. Place a washcloth on the bottom of the pot so that when you do put the jars in, they don’t clink around against the bottom of the pot.


If you have one, use a canner for the rest of this Part. Bring the water in your canner to a boil. Make sure that there will be at least one to two inches of water above the jars when you put them into the canner.

, Whether you are using a regular pot or a canner, you will need to let the jars boil for roughly 10 minutes. However, the altitude you are making jam at will affect how long you need to process your jars. Follow these basic processing times:


0 to 1,000 feet (0.0 to 304.8 m): boil your jars for five minutes.
1,001 to 6,000 feet (305.1 to 1,828.8 m): boil your jars for 10 minutes.
Above 6,000 feet (1,828.8 m): boil your jars for 15 minutes.

, Use tongs to get the jars out of the water without burning yourself. Put the jars in a cool, draftless spot to cool down overnight. The next day, either remove the rings or loosen them so that they don’t rust into place (forcing you to smash your glass jars to get at your delicious jam).

, Before you put your jam away in the pantry, you will want to make sure that the lids are sealed properly so that you don’t go to open a jar only to find that your jam has gone bad. Press down in the center of the lid. If the center doesn’t move, you’re good to go. If it makes a popping noise and the center pops up and down, the lid has not properly sealed. You will need to refrigerate your jam and use it up.,"

Boil the jars for 10 minutes.If you live over sea level, add one extra minute for each 1000 feet (300 meters).

, Turn the heat off and take the lid off. Leave the jars in the canner for about 5 minutes. The water will stop bubbling during this time which will make it easier to lift out the jars. Use a canning lifter to take the jars out and set them on a clean kitchen towel on the counter.Close any windows to ensure there aren't any cold drafts that could cause the jars to crack.

, Leave the jars to sit out for 12 to 24 hours. The jars will be completely cool and you can test the seals. Unscrew the bands and press on the middle of the lid. The lid shouldn't spring back or make a wobbly sound when you press it. The lid should look slightly pulled down at the center. This means that it's sealed properly.Always label your jelly with what it is and when you made it. Tea jellies will keep for 1 year.

Set the pineapple upright and slice off the outside skin in strips., Slice the pineapple into small, 1 inch cubes. You don’t have to be precise, as you will be blending the pineapple. Just make sure that the pieces are small enough to put in a food processor or blender.Cut out any little knots or seeds that you may come across while cutting the pineapple.

, Drop the pineapple pieces into a blender or food processor. Blend until the pineapple reaches a smooth, somewhat pulpy consistency. Remove any seeds or rough pieces from the mixture., Wash the two lemons and cut them in half. Either in a lemon juicer or by hand, squeeze the lemon juice into the pineapple mixture.

Finished.

",How to Make Pineapple Jam3," If you plan on canning and keeping the pineapple jam for a long time, you will have to make an environment that will allow the jam to keep. Sterilize Bottles and Jars for Canning to ensure that the jam won’t spoil after a couple months.Make sure to use the canning jars that have the rings and the screw-on top. These jars provide an airtight seal and are optimal for canning.
If you plan to eat the jam within the next few weeks, you don’t have to bother with the canning process: you can simply pour the jam into a jar and keep it refrigerated.

, After you have finished making the jam and sterilizing the jars, pour the jam immediately into the sterilized jars. You can use a funnel or measuring cup to transfer the jam from the pot to the jar if you are worried about spilling.Don’t fill up the jars completely. Leave about a ¼ inch (0.6 cm) of space at the top.

, Because jam is sticky, it can make jars extremely hard to open if it gets stuck on the rim. Before you close the jars, use a clean towel to wipe the rims and remove any excess jam., Place the jars in a large pot of water on the stove. Make sure that the jars are completely covered in water, with at least 2 inches of water above the tops of each jar. Boil them for five minutes, then remove the jars using a pair of tongs.You should see a small indent at the top of the jars after you take them out of the bath. This means that they are sealed and won’t spoil for about 18 months!
Again, you can skip this step if you plan on eating the jam within the next month or so.

, Let the jars cool on the counter until they reach room temperature. Then store them either on the shelf or in your refrigerator. If you went through the sterilization and canning process, the jam is usually best eaten after two weeks, as it can be a bit runny if eaten in the days following canning.,"

Test the marmalade before canning it.",How to Make Orange Marmalade1," Seville oranges are the classic marmalade orange, with a thin but bitter peel and a sharply sweet inside that makes a decadent combination. However, many cooks have success with navel, sweet, or whatever you can find in the grocery store.Note that, while the ratios here are roughly correct, you can add more sugar later on if the oranges aren't quite as sweet as you'd like.;
, Cut the ends off first and set aside. Then, using a sharp knife of a kitchen mandoline, slice the oranges into as thin slices as you can get. They should be close to 1/8"" thickness. Discard the seeds as you go.


Citrus rinds naturally contain pectin, the agent that causes ""jelly-ing."" This makes the recipe remarkably simple, though you can make it without the rinds if you prefer.

, The smaller the pieces, the easier it will be to extract the juice and make your marmalade.

, If you want softer, more evenly consistent marmalade, you'll want to break up the rinds. Simply slice them off first, cut into pieces and add to the fruit.

, You'll need a big, 8-quart pot to fit everything, with plenty of room on top. Don't fill up a small pot to the brim -- you have a lot more to add, and the mixture will bubble up over the top., Simply grate the lemon skin in, then cut it in half and juice it into the pot with the oranges and water. Make sure you don't add any seeds!


While the lemon is a great addition for the final flavor, it is not strictly necessary, and can be replaced with another small orange if desired., Turn the heat on high and let the pot rise to a nice rolling boil. You don't actually need to boil everything for very long, but you do need to get the water up to this temperature., Stir every few minutes as you do. A rapid simmer is when lots of small bubbles rise and break the surface, but you don't have the ""rolling"" water of a full boil.

, Don't let the mixture sit for long or the sugar might burn -- keep it moving.

, If you have a candy thermometer, set it to 222F, as this is the temperature needed to finish cooking. It will slowly darken in color as the sugar dissolves and cooks.


Note -- if you plan to eat all of the marmalade in the next few days you do not need to can it.

, The following test is perfect after 12 minutes or so, letting you know how it all came out. If it is ready, let the pot sit for 10 minutes to cool before proceeding. You'll know if the marmalade is done with a simple and easy ""plate test:""


Before boiling, place a small plate in the freezer.
Place a small dollop of marmalade on the cold plate
Wait 30 seconds.
Tilt the plate -- it should be a slow-moving gel, barely moving down the plate.
Add more water if it is too hard. Keep cooking if it is too soft and wet."
"
Peel the oranges and lemon completely, saving the peels.,
Pull off as much ""pith,"" the white stuff surrounding the orange as possible, saving for later.,
Cut the unpeeled oranges into slices on a rimmed baking sheet or dish.,
Slice up the rinds into strips or small chunks no wider than 1/2"" inch.,
Fill a small muslin or cheesecloth bag with the pith and rinds.,
Place the bag and 6 cups of water to the pot and let sit overnight.,
Wait a day, then cook over medium heat for 1-2 hours or until the peel is soft.,
Remove the muslin bag, let it cool, then squeeze any liquid back into the pot.,
Lower the heat and add the sugar, stirring in constantly.,
Raise the temperature and boil the mixture without stirring for 8-10 minutes.,
Test the marmalade by spreading on a cold plate and letting it cool.,
Turn the heat off and let it sit for 10 minutes before canning.",How to Make Orange Marmalade2," The peel of an orange not only has essential flavor, it contains pectin. Pectin is the ingredient that causes liquids to gel, making it essential for marmalades and jellies.

, Pith contributes a lot of the bitterness to your marmalade. Thus, you can add or subtract it based on your desired taste -- save a ton for a bitter, well-balanced marmalade and ditch about half for a sweeter spread., The rimmed dish will help you save all the juices easily instead of splattering them all over the kitchen. Add the fruit and juices into a large saucepot -- at least 8-quarts.

, Cut up the rind as you see fit. If you don't mind little chunks of softened rind, leave them as 1/2"" ribbons. If you really hate the idea of seeing rind and want a smoother marmalade, you can cut it very fine, or grate it into a pulp., These two ingredients contain most of the pectin, but also a lot of bitterness. By soaking them in this cheesecloth bag instead of directly adding to the marmalade, you can extract the pectin without all of the added bitterness.

, This will slowly break down and extract the pectin, as well as remove some of the bitterness., You want a nice, rapid simmer, not a boil. You should be able to feel it in the muslin bag, and it should feel soft and pliable when squeezed.

, This will extract the last bits of pectin, helping ensure that your marmalade sets properly. Discard the muslin bag and contents.

, Keep the spoon moving as you add the sugar, helping it dissolve in slowly without burning. Don't start boiling until all the sugar has dissolved., Remember -- don't do this until all the sugar has dissolved. If the mixture starts to rise and seems like it will overflow, simply lower the heat a bit until it falls again.

, Put a plate in the freezer while the mixture boils. After 8-10 minutes, spoon out a little marmalade and put it on the cold plate. Wait 30 seconds, then tilt the plate to see how the jelly reacts. It should appear gel-like and move slightly, but not have runny liquids coming out of it.


If it seems too set and doesn't move at all, add a little hot water to the pot and stir in.
If it seems too runny, let it cook for another 2-3 minutes.

, If there is any foam that rises to the top as it cools, simply spoon it off and throw it away.

Push the top of the can down -- it will spring back if you canned properly.",How to Make Orange Marmalade3," Canning requires boiling your jars full of marmalade, but your glass jars shouldn't be directly on the heat of the stove. This small, metal rack will elevate the jars enough to keep them safe. If you don't have a canning rack, you can use:


Round cake rack
Metal mesh basket
Folded kitchen towel

, Cover your rack, cans, lids, etc. with enough water that there is an inch of it over the top of the highest can. This first boil will sterilize your equipment. Boil for ten minutes.If you have a serialize, you can simply use this instead. Sterilizers use boiling water to kill germs for you.

, Keep the water boiling, however! Once you're done sterilizing, remove the cans and carefully pat them dry -- they'll be hot!

, As the mixture cools, it will expand slightly, so be sure to leave some room at the top. The jars must still be pretty warm -- adding hot marmalade to cool jars will crack them., Close them up like normal, putting on the lid and then tightening the ring around it securely.

, If necessary, add more water to ensure the cans are covered completely. Make sure they are not touching each other, or the bottom of the pan, and simply let them boil for 10 minutes.


If you are at or higher than 6,000ft above sea level, you must let the jars boil for 15 minutes, not 10., Set the jars out on the counter in a cool, dry place and let them drop back to room temperature. After the first few hours (when they don't burn to the touch) loosen the rims on the jars a half turn to prevent them from rusting or sticking., Everyone has played with this little top on jelly jars from the store, but this is the time actually use it. If canned properly, the ""button"" should simply pop back up. Well-canned marmalade will last up to a year."

Check that they jelly was properly preserved by pushing the top down.",How to Make Grape Jelly," The better the grapes, the better the jelly. It doesn't matter if they are seeded or seedless, green, white or red. That said, seeded grapes usually have a stronger flavor, and the majority of jellies are made with red or Concord grapes.You can also use 5 cups of grape juice in a pinch.

, You should have roughly five lbs of grapes to work with.


If you plan on canning all the jelly yourself, start preparing the cans now.


, If you need a little extra to make sure that you have the berries covered, use it.








, Raise the heat and put the cover on, letting the berries boil for ten minutes. Every few minutes give everything a nice big stir.








, Put about 2 cups at a time into the bag and let the juice drain. The jelly bag will collect the pulp, skin, and any seeds while the juice that you will use for the jelly drains out. You should have about 5 cups of juice at the end of this process.








Squeeze the juice through the bag with clean hands or by pressing it gently with a spoon. Empty and discard the pulp periodically if the juice is draining too slowly. Rinse the bag if needed.
If you don't have a jelly bag, try forcing it through a mesh strainer lined with cheese cloth., Get a vigorous, rolling boiling going for about a minute before moving on to the next step..








, Keep the boil going for a quick, hard minute, stirring constantly.








, Move quickly here -- you want the jelly to chill in the jars, not in the pot. Get the foam off with a slotted spoon and move on.









For a little different flavor, consider adding 2-3 tablespoons of lemon juice here, giving your final jelly a bit of tangy-ness., This is why preparing the jars ahead of time is so essential. By letting the mixture cool out in the open, you open the possibility that the jelly will crystallize and turn to a chunky, unappetizing mixture.








Leave roughly 1/4 of an inch between the top of the jar and your fill line., Canning requires you to heat the jars (after the are filled with jelly) to sterilize them and preserve the fruit. You should have your hot water bath boiling at the same time as you jelly.The following method will help you if you do not have dedicated canning equipment. However, getting a canning set is almost always easier than using a homemade water bath.;
, This allows you to work efficiently, as opposed to rushing around as the jelly finishes. If you don't have a dishwasher with a sterilize setting, wash them with soap and water. Then boil the jars for 10 minutes, leaving them in the water until you're ready to use them. The lids should be kept in hot (but not boiling) water for 5-10 minutes.


The jars need to be hot when you pour in the jelly, otherwise they may crack.

, Canning jars have a lid and a ring. The lid needs to have an unbroken rubber seal along the outside edge, and these can only be used once for canning. The rims screw on top of the lid to close the jar completely.








, If you live above 1,000 feet above sea level, let them cook for the full ten minutes. Try to keep at least two inches of water above the top of the cans to speed up the process. Also, make sure that you have a tool capable of safely remove the hot cans from the boiling water before you begin.









If you live above 6,000ft above sea level, you should let the jars boil for closer to 15 minutes., Place the jars in a cool place (not the refrigerator -- that's too cold) and let them cool back to room temperature. After 1-2 hours, when they don't burn you when touched, loosen the rims on the jars a half turn or so to prevent it from rusting or sticking onto the jar.







, It shouldn't easily pop up and down, and shouldn't make a noise when pushed. If it does then you don't have the jar completely sealed, and the preserves will quickly spoil if you're not careful. Properly preserved jelly should last up to 12 months.

Most people use sour cherries for cherry jam, because they are easy to sweeten, while remaining slightly tart.
If you use sweet cherries, reduce the amount of sugar you use.;
, It saves valuable time in the kitchen.

, Grab a large bowl for the cherries.

, Then, insert the cherry into the small bowl of the cherry pitter. Hold the cherry pitter over the small bowl and squeeze the pitter to expel the pit.


Use a chef’s knife to pit cherries on a cutting board. Place a cherry on the board. Smash it with the side of the knife, like you would a clove of garlic. Remove the pit from the broken cherry.
Use a paring knife to cut the pit out of the cherry. This will take longer than the smashing method and it is recommended when you want to keep the cherries looking presentable in a salad or dessert.
Insert a partially unfolded paper clip into the top of the cherry and dig the pit out.,, The more you chop them, the easier the jam will be to spread.

, Put it on a burner and turn it to high heat.

, These standard packages are available at kitchen/canning shops or online. Stir well to combine.

, Lemon juice contains extra pectin and adds flavor. Also, add one-fourth cup (59ml) of rum or alcohol of your choice if you want a little extra flavor., Bring it to a full boil. Turn it to medium heat., Traditional cherry jam is sweet, so five cups of granulated sugar is added for four cups of cherries.

, Let it boil for one minute. Remove it from heat., Fill it half full. Bring it to a boil while you pit your cherries.

, Reduce your heat to a simmer and leave them in the water. You want to pour hot cherry jam into hot jars to avoid cracking.

Large stockpot
Candy thermometer
Wooden spoon
Five pint-sized mason jars or 10 half-pint jars with lids and rings
Ladle
Large canning pot with lid and canning rack
Canning tongs
Large roasting pan
Oven mitts
A lint-free towel
Towel;
, Place the canning rack into the bottom of your canning pot. Fill it with enough water so that it will cover the filled jam jars with an extra one to two inches (2.5 to 5 cm) of water. Put on the lid, turn the heat on high, and bring the water to a boil.Once the jam is ready and has been put into jars, you will have to boil the filled jars in a water bath to sterilize everything and kill bacteria. This will help to preserve the jam longer.

, Clean the jars, lids, and rings with hot, soapy water. You can also run the jars through the dishwasher, but the lids and rings should be hand-washed. Rinse the jars, lids, and rings and set them on a clean drying rack.


Preheat your oven to 150 F (65 C). Place the jars in the roasting pan and into the oven. It’s not necessary to sterilize your jars before canning, but they should be warm to prevent them from cracking when the hot jam is introduced.Leave the jars in the oven until you're ready to pour the jam.
Be sure to use new lids every time you can food. The lids are only designed to be used once, and may not seal properly if they're reused.

, Run cold water over the apricots and rub them with your hands to remove dirt, debris, stems, and leaves. Pat the fruit dry with a clean towel. To pit and dice the fruit:Cut the apricots in half, being careful of the pit in the center. Pull the halves apart and remove the pit.
Cut the apricots into half-inch (1.25 cm) cubes.
Apricots have a very thin skin, so they don’t have to be peeled for jam.

, Place the apricots into the stockpot and cover them with the sugar and lemon juice. Give the mixture a stir to combine everything.


The acidity in the lemon juice will help kill bacteria, keeping the jam from spoiling and free of mold.
For a jam with some added spice, add 1 tablespoon (a ¼ inch cube) of freshly grated ginger to the pot as well.To make a jam with less added sugar, you can use as few as 4 cups (900 g) of sugar with this recipe., Place the stockpot on the stove and heat it over medium–high heat until the sugar dissolves and the mixture comes to a boil. The heat will also help the acidity in the lemon juice to draw pectin from the fruit, which gives the jam it’s gel-like consistency.Stir the mixture occasionally so that the fruit doesn’t stick to the bottom of the pot.

, Once the fruit comes to a boil and starts to get bubbly and foamy, stick the candy thermometer into the pot, making sure it doesn’t touch the bottom.After the mixture boils, stir it frequently to prevent the jam from burning.
When the jam gets to 220 F (104 C), turn off the heat and remove the pot. At this temperature, the water from the fruit has boiled off and the jam will become thick., During the cooking process, a foam will have formed on the top of the jam. Use a spoon to skim off this top layer.


Once the foam is gone, you can immediately pour the jam into the prepared canning jars., Use the oven mitts to protect your hands from the heat and remove one jar at a time from the oven.


You will fill and lid one jar at a time, leaving the other jars in the oven to stay warm as you're working.
As you're filling, it’s important to work as quickly as possible without burning yourself, because the jam must stay hot., Use the ladle to fill each jar with jam, leaving about ¼ inch (0.63 cm) of space between the jam and the top of the jar.


Take your lint-free towel or paper towel and get it damp with warm water. Clean any spilled jam from around the rim and threads of the jar. This will ensure a proper seal.Center a lid over the jam, and then screw on the ring. Set the jar aside. Repeat until the jam is gone and all the jars have been filled.

, Use the canning tongs to place the filled and lidded jars one at a time into the boiling water in the canning pot. When all the jars are positioned upright on the canning rack, return the lid to the pot and return the water to a boil.


Once the water is boiling, set a timer for 10 minutes. Because the jars weren't pre-sterilized, you must boil them for at least 10 minutes to ensure the jam and jars are properly sterilized.
Add an additional minute of boiling time for every 1,000 feet (300 m) above sea level you are. For instance, if you live 1,500 feet (460 m) above sea level, boil the jars in the water bath for 11 minutes., When your boiling time is up, remove the pot from the heat and let it sit for five minutes. Use the canning tongs to remove the jars from the pot, keeping the jars upright at all times.Place the jars onto the dry towel, leaving at least one inch of room between the jars.

, Leave the jars on the towel to cool for 12 to 24 hours. After that time, test the seal on each jar. To test the seal:


Unscrew the ring from the jar. Press your finger against the lid and try to move it around. If it doesn’t budge, a good seal has been formed. Return the ring to the jar, wipe the jar and lid with a towel, and label the jar so you know what it is.
If any lids didn’t form proper seals, you can either place them in a new water bath for another 10 minutes, or put the jars in the fridge for immediate use.Homemade jam that’s unopened will last for one to two years in the pantry, and then another six months to a year in the refrigerator once it’s opened."

Jelly recipes are typically presented with the amount of half-pint jars they will make. For example, if a recipe makes four half-pint jars, you’ll want four eight-ounce (240 mL) jars.
Plastic-lined lids are compatible with acidic ingredients like vinegar and lemon juice, whereas other types of lids like waxed and cellophane are not.;
, If you have a dishwasher, wash the jars on the regular cycle. Then set the dishwasher to “heated dry” until the jelly is ready to fill the jars. Alternately, boil the jars in a pot of water for ten minutes. Leave them in the hot water until you’re ready to fill them with jelly.Cooking jelly with apples is an overnight process, so you won’t need to do this until the second day.

, Fill a small pot with hot tap water. Place the metal lids into the water over low heat for at least five minutes. This will clean them and soften the seal. Leave them there to soak until you’re ready to use them."

",How to Make Apple Jam," Wash your apples and peel them. Core the apples to remove their stems. Carefully dice the apples finely so they're no larger than 1/4"" cubes. Place all of the apples in a large 4-cup measuring cup. Pour cold water over the apples to fill the measuring cup up to the 4-cup mark. Place the water and apples in a large cooking pot.You can use any apples. Try Cortlands, Pink Ladies, Pippins, or Jonagolds. These will all cook down well. Using more than one type of apple will also give more depth of flavor to your jam.;
, To the apples, stir in 2 tablespoons of lemon juice, 1 teaspoon of ground cinnamon (optional), 1 teaspoon of ground ginger (optional), 1/8 teaspoon of ground nutmeg (optional) and 1 box (1 3/4 ounces) of powdered pectin. Make sure these are stirred completely into the apples.The spices will add an apple pie flavor to your jam. If you want to taste just apple, leave the spices out.

, Turn the heat on to medium-high and bring the apple mixture to a full rolling boil. Add 4 cups of granulated sugar and 1 cup of packed brown sugar. Stir the sugar in completely and bring the jam back to a boil. Let the jam boil for one full minute while you stir constantly.A rolling boil will constantly bubble even if you stir it.

, Turn off the heat and carefully move your pot of jam to a cold burner. Stir in 1/2 teaspoon of butter. This will cut back on the foam and add a slightly creamy flavor. Use a large shallow spoon and skim off foam that you see on the top of the jam. When your jam has cooled a little, taste it to adjust seasonings as needed.Leaving foam on your jam will make your jam cloudy and can make it rubbery.

, To make a citrus flavored apple jam, cook your prepared apples with lemon juice until the apples soften and break down. Stir in pure honey and sugar. Bring the jam to a boil over medium-low heat and add liquid pectin. Boil the jam for 2 more minutes and add lemon zest. You can them process the jam in 7 pint jars. To make this variation, you'll need:12 cups of chopped peeled, cored, and diced apples
2 cups of lemons juice
2 cups of honey
3 cups of granulated sugar
1 envelope of liquid pectin
Lemon zest from 3 lemons

, For a soothing flavor, create a ginger liquid by pureeing 12 ounces of chopped fresh ginger with 8 ounces of water. Strain the liquid through cheesecloth to get 2 cups of ginger liquid. To make the jam, place all of the liquid into a large pot with 8 cups of peeled, cored and diced or grated apples and 5 cups of granulated sugar. Bring the jam to a boil and let it boil for 25 to 30 minutes. You can then process the jam, which will make about 6 pints.If you're using a candy thermometer to check if the jam is set, the temperature should reach between 215 and 220 degrees F.

, Mix together prepared apples, whole fresh cranberries, sugar and water in a large cook pot. Bring the mixture to a boil over high heat and let it cook for 10 to 15 minutes. Add the lemon zest and juice. Keep lightly boiling the jam until it thickens. You can process it in about 4 to 5 pint jars. You'll need:8 cups of apples
6 cups of granulated sugar
1 cup of water
The juice and zest of 2 lemons

, If you like the taste of apple jam, but don't want to use as much sugar, make apple butter in a slow cooker. Place 5 pounds of quartered apples in a slow cooker along with 1 cup of apple cider and 1 cup of apple cider vinegar. Once the apples are soft (after cooking 3 or 4 hours), mash and strain them to remove the peels and seeds. Add 1/2 cup of packed brown sugar, 2 tablespoons of maple syrup, 1/2 teaspoon of ground cinnamon and 1/2 teaspoon of ground nutmeg. Cook a few more hours until the apple butter is thick and you can process it in 3 pint jars.You should never just cut back on the sugar in a jam recipe. Sugar is important for preserving the jam, so if you just reduce the sugar, your jam may not hold up as well over time. Instead, choose an apple butter recipe, which naturally uses less sugar.

, Place your clean jam jars, lids, and bands in your large canning pot filled with water. Bring the water to a simmer so the jars heat up. Be sure to use fresh lids so the seals are intact. You can use lids that have been used before though.Your jars must be hot when you fill them with the hot jam. If the jars are cold, the hot jam may cause the jars to shatter.

, It may help to place a wide funnel over your jam jar. Carefully pour or ladle the jam into your jar. Leave about 1/4"" of headspace at the top of the jar. Wipe the jar rims and threads with a clean cloth to make sure there's no jam stuck to the outside or top of the jar.Avoid leaving too much headspace. If you leave more than half-an-inch of headspace, there will be too much oxygen at the top of the jar and processing won't be able to sterilize the space so your jam will spoil faster.

, Place warm lids and rings over the jam jars. Twist them on to just fingertip tight. Use a canning tool to gently lower them into your pot filled with hot water. The water should cover the jars by 2 inches. Bring the water to a boil. Cover the pot and boil the jars for 10 minutes.Resist the urge to twist the bands on tightly. Fingertip tight will let air escape from the jar while it's processing.

, Turn off the heat and carefully use a canning tool to lift each jar out of the water. Set them on a clean towel on your counter. Make sure it's in a draft-free spot so the temperature remains constant. Let the jars sit 12 hours and then you can check the seals.To check the seals, press down on the lid. You shouldn't feel any give and the lid shouldn't spring back when you remove your finger. It should remain flat if it was processed correctly.

Spread the herbs out on paper towels. Blot them lightly.Some examples of edible flower petals are nasturtiums, violets, pansies, rose petals, violas, calendulas, dianthuses, marigolds, geraniums and daylilies.Some examples of herbs you may want to use are parsley, apple mint, tarragon, lemon thyme, fennel, lemon balm, marjoram and mint.
You can use the leaves or flowers for certain herbs, such as scented basils, bee balm, chamomile, chive, garlic, ginger, rosemary and lemon verbena., If the stems aren’t woody, you can chop the herbs with the stems included. Otherwise, separate the leaves and discard the stems. Chop enough herbs and flowers to firmly pack your measuring cups.For example, rosemary, thyme, tarragon, oregano and marjoram all have woody stems. Pinch the top of the stem with one hand. Strip the leaves with your other hand by running your fingers down the stem from top to bottom.Soft herbs like cilantro, parsley and chervil have tender stems. You can chop their stems along with the leaves., Brew tea using the herbs you’d like to include in your jelly. You can use any edible fresh, frozen or dried herb leaves and flowers, if desired. Some flavor combinations will blend well, and some won’t, so this is a good way to test the taste before committing to a jelly flavor., Choose water if you want the flavor of your herbs to stand alone. For example, you may want to use water for strong flavors like fennel or basil with cloves.To use wine or juice, select complimentary flavors.

Try red grape juice with lemon balm, white grape juice with lemon thyme, or purple grape juice with regular thyme.
Lemon verbena pairs well with lemonade, while pineapple sage blends nicely with pineapple juice.Mint, sage, rosemary and scented geranium go well with apple juice.
White wine pairs well with parsley or sweet woodruff.

You can find it in most supermarkets, in the canning or baking aisles, and it can be bought as a liquid or a powder. However, if you do use pectin, then you should read the instructions for the exact sugar-to-fruit ratio of ingredients you should use. This will make the recipe vary slightly.







;
, You can't use any old jars -- you'll need to get jars that are specifically meant for canning. To do this, boil the jars in water for 10 minutes. Then, place them upside-down on a clean towel and drape another towel over them until you are ready to use them. You may not need all 12 jars, especially if you are using larger jars, like pints, but it is much easier to prepare too many than too few.









It's crucial that you sterilize the jars correctly because the basic principle of canning is to kill all the microorganisms that spoil food, then to seal the jar tight to keep them out.


, First, wash the fruit under running water and then do whatever you have to do to get it to be ready to eat. Peel it, remove the pits, the stems, or whatever else you need to remove. Then, cut the fruit into small manageable chunks. If you're using raspberries or blueberries, you don't need to cut them, but if you're using apricots or strawberries or other fruit larger than berries, then you should cut them into 1







, Once you've washed and prepared the fruit and have given it a little bit of time to dry, then you should crush the fruit with a potato masher or a wooden spoon. You don't have to go crazy with this -- the fruit will naturally soften and will become more malleable as you boil it. How long you spend crushing the fruit depends on what kind of jam you'd like -- if you'd like thicker jam with larger chunks of fruit, crush the fruit for 1-2 minutes; for smoother jam, go for 3 minutes.









, First, place the 8 cups of fruit in the pot or pan, and then add the lemon juice and butter to the mixture. Add 1/4 cup of lemon juice and 1/2 teaspoon of butter and margarine. Gently stir in the ingredients. You can warm the butter up to make it easier to stir in. The lemon juice will cut some of the sweetness of the jam.








, A full, rolling boil is one where the bubbles do not stop or lessen when you stir it. Stir constantly and all the way to the bottom to avoid burning the fruit. Boiling the fruit mixture will make the juice come out of the fruit and will keep the pot from burning.









, Pour in the sugar, with the heat still on, and stir it in until it dissolves completely. You will notice that the fruit becomes clearer and brighter when you add the sugar. Continue stirring constantly. For this recipe, you should use 4 cups of sugar for 8 cups of fruit a (1:2 sugar to fruit ratio), but know that ratios can vary. If you're using a more bitter fruit, like orange, then the ratio should be more like 2:3 (two cups sugar for every three cups fruit).








Don't skimp out on the sugar. You may think that this will make the jam healthier, but it will actually ruin the consistency of the jam.

, Heat the mixture under low heat until it reaches the right consistency; the time this takes varies by the type of fruit you're using, since some fruit takes longer to soften. If you're using pectin, check out the time required for boiling on the package. Continue stirring constantly.









You can test the consistency of the jelly with a chilled spoon.

, When the mixture is ready, turn off the heat and remove the pot from the burner.









, It will be whitish, and some batches will have more than others. You don't have to get every speck, but if you leave it in the jam, it will change the consistency and not taste very good.








, Use a canning funnel to guide the jam into the jar. Make sure to leave 1







, Boil about an inch of water in the bottom of a medium saucepan and remove it from the heat. Place the seals into the water. Push them down so that they sink, and try not to stack them on each other, so that they heat evenly. Allow them to soften for a minute or two. You can do this step while you ladle and wipe rims, if you time it right.








Place a softened seal on each jar. A magnetic lid wand will help you get them safely out of the boiling water. To release the seal, set it on a jar and tilt the wand. If you don't have a lid wand, you can use a small pair of tongs.
Screw a clean ring down over the seal and tighten it with snug hand pressure. Don't tighten so much that you press all the seal material off of the rim.

, To do this, lower the jars onto a rack in a water-bath canner or large stock pot. If you use a large stock pot, place a rack or other spacer on the bottom so that the jars do not rest directly on the bottom of the pot. Add enough hot water to cover them by 1-2 inches. You can measure it to the first knuckle, as shown. Then, cover the canner and bring the water to a gentle boil.








, Remove the jars from the boiling water. Jar tongs are a secure and safe way to do this, or you may be able to raise the entire rack in a water-bath canner. Place the jars on a clean towel to cool. Allow the full jars to cool for 24 hours in a place free from drafts. You may hear the metal lids make a loud plinking sound. That is simply the contents cooling and creating a partial vacuum in the jar.








, The vacuum created when the contents cooled should have pulled the ""dome"" lid down very tightly. If you can press the center of the lid down, it did not seal. It should not spring back. If any jars have not sealed, you can place a fresh lid on them and process them again or refrigerate those jars and use the contents soon.









Wash the jars in cool, soapy water to remove any sticky residue on the outsides. You can remove the rings at this point, since the seals should be holding themselves on securely. Allow the rings and jars to dry thoroughly before replacing the rings, to prevent rust.

, Leave about a quarter inch of headroom. A canning funnel (not used here) makes for less mess. Wipe the jar rim with a clean towel, if there is any jam on the jar rim. The rim must be clean in order to have a good seal.


The frothy foam shown in the photo is edible, but it's not the most attractive or tasty part. You can skim it off with a spoon, if you wish. A pat of butter or margarine added as the jam boils also helps keep so much foam from forming.

Before eating them or using them in cooking, they should be washed well to avoid any chemicals that they might have been sprayed with. Ideally, you should use roses that haven't been sprayed at all and that were grown specifically for this purpose. Always check for insects and discard any petals that are brown.
Soak the petals in water for three days. This is optional.
Place the rose petals into a bowl and sprinkle the sugar over them to make sure that each petal is coated. Bruise them well with your fingers and cover the bowl with plastic film. Allow it to remain overnight in a cool spot that is not too dry and not too humid (e.g. the refrigerator).
Get a saucepan and pour in the remaining sugar, water and lemon juice. Dissolve contents over a low heat. Including the pips (seeds) of the lemon is supposed to contribute pectin, which will help thicken the jam,although some recipes do not specify their need, so the choice is yours.
Stir the rose petals into the mixture and allow to simmer 20 minutes. Bring to a boil and continue to boil for 5 minutes until the mixture thickens. If you have a jelly thermometer, cook and stir until the jam reaches 221°F or 105°C (don't let the bulb touch the bottom of the pan) or until a spoonful dropped onto a cold plate jells and holds its shape.Then, if you included the pips/seeds, remove them with a spoon, or you can leave them in if a person is careful not to eat them when they eat the jam.;

, Bring to the boil and simmer for approximately half an hour.

, Crab apple jelly is normally strained through muslin, which results in a clear jelly, but if you don't have any and don't mind the jelly being cloudy, you can use a fine sieve. If straining through muslin you will need to leave the pulp to strain in its own time (if in doubt, leave it overnight), as squeezing it to speed up the process will result in a cloudy jelly.

You can slice the onions to the thickness you prefer — however thick, they'll still take the pickling solution. Some people prefer to cut the onions in a full moon, which makes them easy to grab with a fork; others prefer them smaller, cut them into half moons., Heat enough water to completely submerge the sliced onion.

, Throw the cloves, cinnamon, chili, and thyme into a pot and toast them over medium-low heat until they become aromatic, about 3 - 5 minutes.

, Count to 10, and then strain the water and onions through a sieve.


Why parboil the onions? Parboiling removes a little bit of the acid zing from raw onions. You don't have to parboil if you like the zing of raw onions, but a slightly mellower onion makes the pickling juice really stand out.

, You can let the onions rest there or remove them after 10 seconds. Onions which are left in the ice bath will continue to mellow while the sulfur compounds (the onion's natural defense) diffuse into the water.Once onions are done, drain them completely and place them into a container.

, Turn on the burner to medium high and bring the pickling juice to a simmer, dissolving the sugar completely. Simmer for an additional minute.

Store pickled onions in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks.Red onions which are pickled will turn slightly pink as they age.

, Try your pickles on homemade tacos, sandwiches with richer cuts of meat (like pork), or a hearty stew.

, The above spices are just one combination that works well together. There are lots of spices that work well in a pickling liquid for onions. Here are just a few:


Fresh whole garlic. A little goes a long way, but who doesn't like the combination of garlic and onion? Simply divine.
Fresh ginger. Cuts through the acidity with its distinctive taste.
Bay leaf. Dried bay leaf has a smoky, fresh complexity.
Fresh herbs. Experiment with rosemary, oregano, marjoram, or tarragon, among many others.
Juniper berries. Fruity, spicy, complex. These berries give gin their distinctive taste.
Star anise. Great substitute for or addition to cloves.
Mustard seed. This seed adds a bit of smoky tang to the onions.;
, If you've only got yellow or white onions, but still want that distinctive pink color in your onions, beets are your friend. They've got a natural red dye that's close to flavorless. And did we mention they taste excellent, too?

, The traditional English approach to pickled onions is to use smaller yellow onions, or shallots, and then keep them whole. Malt vinegar is generally used instead of apple cider or sherry vinegar.Give it a go for a different culinary experience.

Peel the onion and garlic cloves. You can peel the cucumbers too, if desired, but doing so is not necessary and only a matter of personal preference.;
, Slice each cucumber in half lengthwise. Drag a spoon down the lengthwise center of each half, removing the strip of seeds.While pickling cucumbers and English cucumbers are the easiest to work with, you can actually use regular cucumbers for this, too. The process will be the same and the relish should still taste just as great.

, Using a knife, cut off both ends of each cucumber. Dice the cucumbers into small pieces measuring 1/8 to 1/4 inch (3 to 6 mm).


Chopping the cucumbers by hand will give you the greatest control over the size of the pieces, but to save time, you could use a food processor instead. Use a medium ""chop"" blade, and process the cucumbers very slowly to avoid turning them into mush.

, Dice the peppers and onion into 1/8 to 1/4 inch (3 to 6 mm) chunks. Mince the garlic as finely as possible.


You'll also need to discard the stems, membranes, and seeds of the peppers before dicing them.
As with the cucumbers, chopping by hand will give you more control, but you can use a food processor if desired. Process each vegetable separately.

, Place the diced cucumbers, peppers, and onions in a large bowl. Toss the vegetables together with the salt, then cover the entire batch with cold water.


Note that you should not add the minced garlic to this mixture. Set it aside until later.
The bowl you use should be made of glass, plastic, or another non-reactive material.
The water should be very cold to keep the vegetables as fresh as possible. If desired, you can add 1 cup (250 ml) of ice to the water, as well, to cool the mixture further.

, Set the mixture aside and let it rest for 4 to 6 hours at room temperature.


Technically, you can move onto the next step after 2 hours if you're in a hurry. You can also allow the vegetables to soak overnight. Longer resting times should help prolong the lifespan of the relish, which is beneficial if you plan on storing it long-term.
Check the mixture every hour or so. If the water level decreases significantly, add more cold water. If the water temperature becomes too warm, add more ice.

, Pour the contents of the bowl through a fine mesh colander, discarding the soaking water. Thoroughly rinse the vegetables with cool, running water.


Agitate the colander carefully while rinsing the vegetables to promote even coverage.
Allow the rinse water to completely drain from the vegetables before continuing.

, Return the vegetable mixture to the bowl and cover it with additional cold water. Allow the mixture to soak for another hour.

, Pour the contents of the bowl through the colander, discarding the water and keeping the vegetables.


You do not need to rinse the mixture this time, but you may need to gently press the vegetables against the sides and bottom of the colander to squeeze out as much excess moisture as possible., Place the vinegar, sugar, minced garlic, dill seeds, mustard seeds, celery seeds, and turmeric in a 4-qt (4-L) saucepan. Set the pan on the stove over medium-high heat.You can use white vinegar, cider vinegar, or red wine vinegar; each will add a slightly different flavor profile and tint to the finished relish.
Similarly, you can use white sugar or brown sugar. White sugar works best with white vinegar and red wine vinegar, while brown sugar works best with cider vinegar.
You can add the spices directly to the vinegar and sugar, but if you prefer a clear relish, consider placing them in a spice bag or cheesecloth satchel instead. This bundle of spices can be removed before you pour the relish into jars.

, Allow the mixture to reach a rolling boil, then reduce the heat to medium and drop the liquid to a simmer.


Allow the pickling mixture to simmer for 5 minutes, stirring frequently. The sugar should be fully dissolved before you continue.

, Add the cucumbers, onions, and peppers to the simmering liquid. Increase the heat to medium-high again, and allow the liquid to reach a boil.


After the mixture boils, reduce the heat to medium again to drop the liquid to a simmer. Continue cooking for about 10 minutes, or until most of the excess liquid evaporates.
Stir the contents of the saucepan frequently to prevent them from burning and sticking to the saucepan.

, Sanitize the canning jars and lids in boiling water.Dry well with paper towels.


If you have a dishwasher, you can clean the jars in the dishwasher instead of using boiling water. You'll still need to boil the lids, however.
To reduce the amount of wait time, it's best to perform this step while simultaneously soaking or cooking the relish.

, Fill a water canner halfway with water. Cover it with its lid, and start heating it over medium-high heat. Allow the water to reach a rolling boil.


It's best to prepare this water bath while the relish cooks.
If you don't have a water canner, you can use a large stockpot with a heat-proof rack placed in the bottom.
Note that a water bath is only necessary if you plan on processing the cans of relish for long-term storage. If you intend to use the relish within one month, you can skip this part.

, Ladle the finished relish into the sanitized jars, leaving 1/4 to 1/2 inch (0.6 to 1.25 cm) of empty headspace in each jar.


Briefly and gently stir the sides of each jar to release as many air bubbles as possible.
Use a damp cloth to wipe excess liquid from the jar rims, then tightly screw the lids on top of the jars.

, Carefully lower the cans of relish into the boiling water. Allow the water to reach a boil again, then cover the canner and process the relish for 10 minutes.


Do not allow the jars to touch each other or the sides of the canner.
The hot water should cover the jars by at least 1 or 2 inches (2.5 or 5 cm).
If you live at higher altitudes, you may need to process the jars longer. For altitudes between 1000 and 6000 feet (0.3 and 1.8 km), process the jars for 15 minutes. For altitudes above 6000 feet (1.8 km), process the jars for 20 minutes.

, After you finish processing the jars, use jar tongs to remove them from the hot water. Cool them on a wire rack or folded towel for an hour, or until they drop to room temperature.


After the jars cool, press on the center of each lid. If the lids stay down when pressed, the jars processed correctly. If it pops up, the jars are not sealed. Do not re-process unsealed jars; simply store them as you would store opened jars.

, Place the jars of processed, sealed relish in a cool, dark place. They should remain good for at least 6 months, but most will last for 12 to 18 months.

, Once you open the jars, keep them in your refrigerator and use the relish within one month.If you chose not to process the jars at all, you should still be able to store them in your refrigerator for up to one month.

When done correctly, the bean will have an open slit running down one side, while the other side remains closed. This will allow the seeds inside the bean to emerge from the casing and flavor the crème anglaise.


Vanilla beans can be found in specialty cooking shops or gourmet grocery stores. They can also be ordered online.
The longer the vanilla bean, the stronger the vanilla flavor will be in the finished sauce. Look for a 2–4 inch (5.1–10.2 cm) piece for this recipe.
If you don't have a vanilla bean, add 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract instead.
As an alternative try orange or lemon crème anglaise. Simply switch out the zest of 1 orange or 1 lemon for the vanilla bean.;
, Fill the bottom of the bain marie with 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6 cm) of water and place it on the stove on medium heat. Allow the water to come to a simmer.


A bain marie, also known as a double boiler, is a pot nested inside another pot. The pot on the bottom is used to hold water, while the top pot holds the food item you are cooking.
The purpose of a double boiler is to heat foods at a lower temperature. If you do not have a bain marie, fill a saucepan about 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6 cm) with water and place a metal mixing bowl or a smaller pan on top.

, Place two containers on a flat surface, one to hold the egg whites and the other to hold the yolks. Hold one hand over the container reserved for the egg whites and crack an egg into the hand. Let the egg whites slip through the space between your fingers, but not the yolk. Place the yolk in the bowl reserved for egg yolks.


Repeat this process with the rest of the eggs (6 total) until all the egg yolks are separated from the egg whites.
You can also separate eggs by holding a cracked egg over a bowl and passing the yolks back and forth between the shell halves so that the white drops into the bowl. Place the separated yolk into a second bowl.

, Place the yolks and the 6 tablespoons of sugar into a medium-sized metal mixing bowl. Whip them vigorously with a wire whisk until the mixture is pale yellow and fluffy. You may use an electric mixer instead.

, Put the 2 cups of milk and the vanilla bean into a small saucepan. Heat it over medium low heat until it's heated through to the point of scalding, but not boiling. Remove it from heat.


You can tell when the milk is scalded by watching the edges of the pan. When you see steam begin to rise where the milk touches the edge of the pan, it's time to remove it from heat.
If you want a richer sauce, use 2 full cups of cream. For a less rich sauce, use only milk or one cup of milk and one cup of cream.

, Slowly pour the milk into the mixing bowl containing the sugar and egg mixture while whipping constantly with the wire whisk. Continue until the milk has been thoroughly blended with the sugar and egg mixture., Make sure the water in the bottom of the double boiler is simmering, and pour the egg, sugar and milk in the top part of the bain marie (or mixing bowl, if you made your own double boiler).

, Stir it constantly with a small rubber spatula. Do not let the sauce get too hot, as it can curdle. Keep stirring until the sauce is thick enough to coat the back of a metal spoon, then remove it from the heat.

, It is always served ice cold, never hot. Pour the sauce into a glass container and set it in the refrigerator. Serve only when it is entirely chilled. You can make the sauce a day ahead and pull it from the refrigerator when you're ready to use it.

, This is a classic way to serve crème anglaise, since it provides a delicious balance for chocolate and other cake flavors. Pour some of the sauce into the middle of a dessert plate, so that it spreads and forms a shallow pool. Place the sliced cake on top of the crème anglaise. Top with a second drizzle of crème anglaise, some berry coulis or chocolate syrup for a perfect presentation.

, The light, creamy crème anglaise pairs wonderfully with a scoop of tart sorbet, like lime, raspberry or peach. Pour some crème anglaise into a sorbet dish, then place a scoop of sorbet in the middle of the dish. Top with a mint sprig to add even more flair to the dish.

, If you want a light, delicious dessert, serve crème anglaise with some simply chopped fruit. Try it with strawberries for a heightened, gourmet version of strawberries and cream. It's also perfect with blackberries, cherries or mango slices.

Find a place to shop for low-carbohydrate thickening agents.,
Pick up some coconut flour.,
Buy agar agar.,
Find some psyllium husk.,
Purchase some chickpea flour.,
Find some xanthum gum.,
Buy oat fiber.",How to Thicken a Low Carb Sauce1," If you want to cook low-carbohydrate sauces, you should make sure you have the right ingredients in your kitchen. Although some of these ingredients can be hard to find, you should be able to pick most of them up at your local health food or bulk goods store. Common low-carbohydrate thickening agents include coconut flour, agar agar, and psyillium husk.;
, Coconut flour is a tasty vegan thickener that tastes a bit like cake and is much healthier than conventional flour. It has lots of fiber and protein but very few carbohydrates, which makes it a wonderful low-carbohydrate thickener. It is used in all kinds of baking such as pies, puddings, cookies, smoothies, and truffles., Agar agar is a seaweed that is very low in calories and does not have any sugar or fat, while containing some nice fiber. It comes in powdered flakes and ends up having a gelatinous texture in sauces. It is also used in many vegan dessert recipes., Psyllium husk is almost free of calories and contains mostly fiber. It can be used in all kinds of sauces, smoothies, baking, and soups.


Psyllium husk is great for replacing the fiber that is hard to get in low carbohydrate diets. It will reduce your appetite and improve your digestion., This flour tastes great in a wide variety of baking recipes. Chickpea flour is almost free of gluten and has lots of protein as well as iron and fiber.Chickpea flour can be used in both savory and sweet recipes., This gum is a gluten-free thickener that can be used in smoothies, muffins, and other baked goods.


Avoid using xanthum gum if you are experiencing hard stools, nausea, appendicitis or other abdominal troubles. It could cause intestinal gas and bloating.It is safe to consume up to fifteen grams of xanthum gum a day., Oat flour has complex carbohydrates with lots of vitamins, which is preferable to simple carbohydrates. Oats also make you feel full quickly, so adding just a bit of oat fiber as a sauce thickener goes a long way.Oats are great for lowering cholesterol and maintaining a healthy heart. They may also reduce the risk of colorectal cancer."

When utilizing hot chiles (e.g. habaneros, jalapeños, Thai bird chiles, serranos, poblanos, chipotles etc., ) use caution and don't expose your hands or mucous membranes to the peppers; you'll want to wear gloves and wash your utensils and cutting board thoroughly after use.;
, Make sure you've got on hand a cutting board, knife, gloves, boiling water, your clean vegetables and herbs, olive oil, bowl, vinegar, kosher salt, and pepper mill.

, This is a quick-blanched sauce. The boiling water will bring out the flavors of the herbs and spices, but it is not a cooked sauce. Sauce Chien is best served freshly prepared, so make only as much as you think you'll need, serve immediately, and discard. You can keep the raw ingredients refrigerated and make again just by mixing together and adding boiling water to serve.

, You'll want an avocado, peeled English cucumber, red or orange pepper, red onion, cilantro, purple basil, Thai basil, flat leaf parsley (any combination of leafy herbs will do), garlic, scallions or chives, red pepper, and a tropical fruit- like mango, papaya or pineapple.

, Add your favorite chiles, halved. (habanero will be spicy, jalapeños less so). Use your favorite. Removing the seeds is optional- seeds will make the sauce MUCH hotter. Add the hot chiles conservatively, rendering the dish as spicy as you'd like it.


You may remove the chiles just before serving to impart heat to the sauce, but avoid an unsuspecting guest biting into an unwanted fiery mouthful.

, Add a sprig of fresh thyme. Cover the mixture with fresh lime juice (or lemon) and add a few splashes of vinegar. Add a couple tablespoons of olive oil. Add Kosher salt to taste. Adding fresh ground black pepper is optional. Mix ingredients and let the flavors meld until ready to serve.

, Just before serving, pour a few tablespoons of boiling water to the sauce. Stir. Once the mixture begins to cool, remove the sprig of thyme and, if you'd like, the hot chili peppers.

, Serve room temperature or slightly warm, with a slotted spoon. If the sauce is too liquid, pour off a bit of the water and serve with a little extra lime juice and vinegar.

, Sauce Chien is especially great with grilled or roasted whole fish, served outside in hot weather. A drink containing an acid, like a margarita, lemonade, or yoghurt smoothie will act as a heat buster. A chilled ice or granita as an intermezzo will prepare your guests' palates for the next course. Enjoy!

Cook a low carbohydrate white sauce.,
Create a low carbohydrate hollandaise sauce.Throw three egg yolks into a food processor.,
Make a low carbohydrate roux.",How to Thicken a Low Carb Sauce2," You don’t necessarily need to add anything to a sauce to thicken it. Instead, simply simmer a sauce until the flavor intensifies and the texture becomes thick. If you are cooking meat or fish, you can take out the protein while you thicken the sauce and then add it back in at the end.By avoiding the addition of flour and other common thickening agents, you can make your sauce lower in carbohydrates.


You can reduce and thicken sauces quicker by using a pot with a larger surface area.If you are in a hurry, you can divide the sauce into two pots and reduce them both at once., Many people use roux with flour and chicken stock to make enchilada sauce, which results in a high carbohydrate sauce. Instead of roux with flour, you can use tomato paste:Use a large and deep frying pan on a medium heat setting. In your frying pan, add three cups of chicken broth, three tablespoons of tomato paste, one bay leaf, a quarter cup of pure chile powder, two teaspoons of ground cumin, a teaspoon of dried oregano, half a teaspoon of salt, half a teaspoon of granulated garlic, half a teaspoon of onion powder, half a teaspoon of erythritol, a quarter teaspoon of chipotle chile powder, a sixteenth teaspoon of ground clove, a sixteenth teaspoon of ground cinnamon, and two tablespoons of butter, olive oil, or ghee. , Melt two tablespoons of coconut oil, which has plenty of healthy fats that are easily turned into energy.Next, add two tablespoons of coconut flour and stir it into the coconut oil until the two are thoroughly mixed. Finally, add one cup of almond milk which is low in carbohydrates and has lots of vitamin E, magnesium, calcium, and potassium.Add the sauce to whatever recipe you desire.

, Melt seven ounces of coconut butter in the microwave or in a small saucepan on the stove. Next, gradually add the coconut butter to the egg yolks in the food processor. Finally, add a tablespoon of lemon juice. By omitting any flour and using coconut butter instead of regular butter, your sauce will be low in carbohydrates and full of beneficial fats to carry you through the day.


You can make it even more low-carbohydrate by serving your eggs benedict with hollandaise sauce on iceberg lettuce or thin crackers instead of English muffins.

, Roux is a mother sauce in a lot of French and European recipes.Traditionally, roux is made with half flour and half fat, which is usually butter. To make a low carbohydrate roux, simply replace the flour with a low carbohydrate option such as coconut flour or chick pea flour.Coconut flour has very few carbohydrates and chick pea flour is especially great if you want to lower the gluten in your diet.Melt a cup of butter in a saucepan over a medium heat burner. Once the butter gets hot, you can whisk in three quarters to one cup of coconut flour or chickpea flour. You can cook the roux for twenty minutes to get a nice blond colour or for forty-five minutes to get a darker color roux. After cooking, place it in the refrigerator and break off pieces whenever you need some roux for a recipe."

;
, In a separate bowl, roughly combine flour, salt, and pepper. Whisk this mixture into the melted butter, combining until smooth and paste-like.









, Heat over medium heat until the mixture bubbles without letting it brown - about 1 minute. This is mixture of fat and flour is called a roux and can be used as a base or thickening ingredient in a variety of recipes including gumbo and other thick soups.








, It's not essential to heat your milk before adding it to your white sauce, but doing so can help ensure your end product is silky smooth. If you'd like to do this, heat your milk in a separate pan over low heat just until small bubbles form around the edges, then remove from heat.









, Stir your milk into your roux mixture. For smoothness, it's best to add a little milk, stir until fully incorporated into the sauce, then repeat. If you add all the milk at once, it may not incorporate fully, leaving you with an uneven, lumpy sauce.








, When you've added all your milk, use a whisk to gently stir your sauce, making sure to break up any remaining solid portions. Stir until your sauce is even throughout.









, All that's left to do is to cook your sauce until it reduces to your desired thickness and taste. Cook for about 2-3 minutes more, frequently stirring and sampling your sauce to ensure evenness. If needed, feel free to add additional salt and pepper to taste. Serves about 4.









When cooled, this sauce can develop an unappetizing skin. To avoid this, cover it with wax paper or pour a thin layer of milk on top before putting it in the fridge.

, One of the most useful properties of basic white sauces is that they're so easy to modify for a wide range of purposes. For instance, if you'd like to give your sauce an added ""kick"", try adding red pepper. You might also try grating cheddar cheese into your sauce for scrumptious cheesy flavor. Experiment - because its flavor is so neutral, most common ingredients complement a basic white sauce well.

Pour all of the ingredients (minus corn starch) into a bowl.,
Mix your ingredients (minus corn starch) thoroughly.,
Add corn starch to thicken as necessary.,
Alternatively, mix in a jar.,
Add sauce during the stir fry process.",How to Make Stir Fry Sauce1," Most stir fry sauces are remarkably easy to make — it's usually just a matter of mixing the ingredients together and adding the mixture to your dish! We've provided a few sample recipes above. For stir fry beginners, it doesn't get much easier than the ""Basic"" sauce at the top of the list. Not only is it easy to make, but also mild and pleasing to the taste.


To begin, pour all of your ingredients except cornstarch into a bowl that's big enough to accommodate them.;
, Using a spoon, an electric mixer, or another mixing utensil, give your liquid sauce ingredients and sugar a quick stirring until they make a mixture that's uniform in color and texture. If you're using the ""Basic"" recipe above, make sure the sugar in the recipe is dissolved before proceeding or it may give the dish uneven ""sweet spots"" when it's added.


If you're having a hard time getting the sugar to dissolve, try heating the sauce up somewhat — as a rule of basic chemistry, liquids dissolve substances like sugar more easily when they're warm.However, you won't want to heat the sauce to the point that it's very hot or boiling — this can caramelize the sugar, giving the sauce a ""sticky"" texture and an odd taste.

, Finally, add your corn starch and stir to combine. You have some freedom with this step — corn starch is a thickening agent, so the more you add, the thicker your sauce will become.The ideal thickness of your sauce is usually a matter of personal taste. The 1/2 teaspoon recommended in the recipe above should give a fairly liquid sauce, but anything from zero corn starch to twice the recommended portion is acceptable.


Note that this thickening rule applies to the rest of the recipes in this article as well. Though it may not be explicitly mentioned below, adding additional corn starch to any of the following recipes will make a thicker sauce, while removing corn starch from the recipe will make a thinner sauce.

, If you don't have any stirring utensils handy or you want to prep your sauce for storage in the fridge, consider mixing it in a jar. With this method, all you need to do is add your sauce ingredients to a jar, close the lid tight, and shake to combine. Make sure the lid is secure — a big mess is in store if it pops off!.


Other containers work just as well as jars as long as they can achieve an airtight seal. For instance, plastic fridge containers (like Tupperware, etc.) work great in a pinch.

, Once your sauce is done, stir fry your meat, vegetables, tofu, etc. as you normally would by heating a pan to high heat, adding oil, and then tossing your ingredients in. Once your stir fry ingredients have achieved a good sear and are more or less finished cooking, pour your sauce in. Your sauce should quickly heat. Within about 30 seconds to a minute, remove the pan from heat and serve!


Another good option is to use your sauce for dipping. In this case, keep it cool and separate from the other ingredients in its own bowl. This is a good choice if, for instance, once of your guests is allergic to some of the ingredients in your sauce.

Customize your recipe.",How to Make Vodka Sauce," Vodka sauce is traditionally served with penne or rigatoni pasta, though you can use it to top any type of pasta that you like. As you start to prepare the sauce, bring a pot of water to boil on the stove to cook your pasta.Be careful not to overcook your pasta. Test it a minute or two before the instructions say it will be done to see if the texture is right. It should be slightly firm when you taste it because it will continue to cook while you drain it and in the sauce.
You don’t necessarily have to use vodka sauce on pasta. It can make a delicious sauce for pizza, chicken, and fish too.;
, Set a large skillet or saute pan on the stove, and set the burner to medium heat. Add 2 tablespoons (30 mL) of olive oil and 2 tablespoons (30 g) of butter, and heat until the butter is completely melted.While the combination of butter and olive oil offers the best flavor for the dish, you can use 4 tablespoons (120 g) of butter by itself or 4 tablespoons (120 mL) of olive oil by itself if you don’t have the other ingredient on hand.
You can tell that the oil and butter are at the right temperature when the mixture goes from completely smooth to rippled in the pan.

, When the butter and olive oil is properly heated, add 1 cup (approximately 1 medium onion or 150 g) finely chopped onion 2 to 3 cloves of chopped garlic to the pan. Allow the garlic and onion to cook for approximately 5 minutes, or until the onion becomes soft and slightly brown.Stir the onion and garlic as they cook to ensure that they’re well combined.
Watch the pan carefully to ensure that the onion and garlic don’t burn.

, Once the onion and garlic have cooked for several minutes, remove the pan from the heat and carefully pour in ¾ of cup (180 mL) of vodka before returning it to the stove. Stir it into the onion and garlic, and allow the contents to cook for 2 to 3 minutes so the vodka can start to reduce.If you would like a sharper flavor to your sauce, you can add up to 1 cup (240 mL) of vodka. You may want to experiment to see what amount you like best.
To reduce the risk of fire, don't pour the vodka directly from the bottle into the pan. Instead, pour it in a measuring cup first and then add it to the pan from the cup.
Make sure to have a lid for your pan nearby when you add the vodka. If it ignites, immediately place the lid on the pan to smother and kill the flames.

, When the vodka, onion, and garlic mixture has cooked for a few minutes, it’s time to add the tomato puree to the sauce. Pour one can of puree, approximately 14 ounces (397 g), into the skillet, and stir until all of the contents are thoroughly combined. Reduce the burner’s heat to low.You can swap the tomato puree for a can of tomato sauce, but you’ll wind up with a slightly thinner sauce.

, When the tomato puree is completely mixed with the vodka, onion, and garlic, add 1 cup (240 mL) of heavy cream to the pan. Stir carefully to ensure that it’s fully incorporated into the sauce. Instead of the bright red of the tomato puree, the sauce will now have a creamy light orange color.Make sure that your burner it turned to low. You can burn the sauce very easily at this point.
The sauce requires heavy cream to give it the right consistency. Avoid replacing it with whole milk or half-and-half if possible.

, When the cream has been completely stirred into the pan, it’s time to season the sauce. Mix in ¼ to ½ (1.25 to 2.5 g) teaspoon of salt and fresh ground black pepper to taste. Add a pinch of crushed red pepper flakes too to give the sauce a little heat.Use as much or as little crushed red pepper as you like. If you aren’t a fan of spicy foods, you can omit it entirely.

, If you’ve made pasta to serve with the sauce, make sure to save a cup of the water that you cooked it in just before you drain it. That way, you can use the water to thin the sauce if it turns out to be too thick when you combine it with the pasta.Add just enough pasta water to make the sauce and pasta combination easy to stir together.

, Turn off the burner that the vodka sauce is on, and drain your pasta. Place the hot pasta directly into the pan with sauce and then toss the together to ensure that the pasta is evenly coated.Don’t put all of your cooked pasta into the sauce at once. Instead, add approximately ½ to ¾ and make sure that there is enough sauce to coat all of it. If there’s excess sauce, finish adding the rest of your pasta.
You should have enough sauce for approximately six servings of pasta.

, When the vodka sauce and pasta are fully combined, mix in 1 cup (450 g) of grated Parmesan cheese. For serving, you can top the pasta and sauce with a little more grated cheese.You can also garnish your pasta and vodka sauce with some fresh basil leaves for added color.

, While pasta and vodka sauce is a common dish, you can customize the recipe to suit your tastes. You may want to add some type of protein to the dish to make a hearty meal, or mix in some vegetables for added flavor.

",How to Make White Sauce2," Add your butter and olive oil to a heavy-bottomed saucepan. Heat over low-to-medium heat until the butter is fully melted but hasn't begun to smoke or brown.








, Add your minced garlic and heavy cream to the saucepan and stir until well-mixed. Add pepper (to taste) and heat to a low simmer. Stir often.








, Add your cream cheese, parmesan, and asiago. Stir to incorporate, making sure that all cheeses have completely melted before proceeding.









This step affords you a great deal of freedom - feel free to fine-tune your mixture of cheeses to find one that better suits your taste. Some chefs, for example, like to substitute mozzarella or add a dash of sharp white cheddar for added flavor.

, Add just a dash of your dry white wine to your sauce, then stir to incorporate. After the wine has been absorbed, sample your sauce. Depending on how you like the flavor, you may want to add more wine to your sauce as you see fit. Keep in mind that adding a great deal of wine will give you a somewhat watery sauce, meaning you'll have to allow it to reduce for longer.








, If it isn't still simmering, bring your sauce up to a low simmer, then allow it to gradually reduce, stirring frequently. Frequent stirring is essential - since it will be relatively thick, Alfredo sauce is susceptible to sticking and burning. You want your end product to be thick, creamy, and flavorful without being gummy or solid. When you've reached a good thickness, immediately remove your sauce from heat and serve with pasta. Serves 4-6.

Grate orange zest.,
Mix your ingredients (minus red pepper).,
Add pepper to taste.,
Pair with protein and rice.",How to Make Stir Fry Sauce2," This easy Szechuan sauce (named for the westernized title of Sichuan province in China) is quick, easy, flavorful, and spicy. The only thing that's more difficult about this recipe than the basic recipe above is that it requires you to grate a small amount of orange zest.Don't skip out on this small but important step — the orange zest gives the sauce an impeccable flavor and fragrance.


To grate orange zest, simply take a ripe orange and rub the rind against a microplane grater (or an ordinary cheese grater) to shred off small flakes. Try to take the outermost layer of the rind, rather than the inner pith, as the outside is the most flavorful part of the rind.

, Once you've grated your orange zest, the rest of the recipe is easy. Simply add your ingredients to a bowl or jar and mix thoroughly until they are uniformly combined. It's OK if small flecks of orange peel remain — these give the sauce an added tangy flavor (with the perfect hint of bitterness).

, Next, add your desired amount of spice. Obviously, the more you add, the hotter your sauce will be. The serving recommendation above — one chopped red pepper — should produce a sauce that has some ""kick"" but isn't completely overwhelming for those with less of a taste for spice. If you don't have red peppers handy, try adding dry red pepper flakes for the same effect.


When in doubt, be conservative. You can always add more spice if your stir fry turns out too mild, but you can't take spice out once it's been added!
If you don't have red pepper flakes, an Asian chili sauce like Sriracha or even American-style hot sauce like Tabasco can substitute well.

, This delicious Szechuan sauce is great with a huge variety of dishes (including vegetarian ones), but is especially tasty with meat and other protein sources. Below are just a few suggestions for accompanying stir fry ingredients — regardless of which you choose, serve the stir fry and sauce over rice for a classic Asian combination:

Combine stock, soy sauce, wine, sugar, cornstarch, vinegar, water, and sesame oil.,
Cook the ginger and pepper in peanut oil.,
Combine all ingredients and cook until slightly thickened.",How to Make Stir Fry Sauce3," This recipe is slightly more complicated than some of the others in the article as it requires some of the ingredients to be cooked separate from each other, then combined, rather than cooked all together.To begin, mix the ingredients above in a bowl, then mix thoroughly as normal, making sure to dissolve the sugar.

, Next, heat a pan on the stove over high heat. Add the peanut oil, then, just before it begins to smoke, toss in the ginger and red pepper flakes (if the oil starts to smoke, reduce the heat slightly before adding the other ingredients). Allow the ginger to cook until fragrant and golden, stirring frequently (this should only take a minute or two).


To mince your ginger, first, use a sharp knife to shave off its light brown skin, exposing the whitish or orange-ish flesh underneath. Chop the ginger into very fine pieces or use a food processor to render it into tiny bits.

, Pour the liquid mixture into the pan with the ginger. Stir to combine. Allow the sauce to simmer until it thickens slightly, gains a glossy appearance, and smells appetizing (this shouldn't take much longer than a minute).


When the sauce is ready, remove it from heat, add it to your stir fry as normal (or set aside as a dipping sauce) and serve!

Whisk hot water into peanut butter.,
Mix in the rest of the ingredients.,
Serve as normal.",How to Make Stir Fry Sauce4," This savory peanut sauce pairs fantastically with chicken, creating a mouthwatering (and very filling) flavor combination.To start making your sauce, combine equal portions of peanut butter and hot water (serving suggestions above). Whisk together to combine.


As noted in the ingredients section, the water should be hot, but not boiling. You want the water to make the peanut butter liquid enough to add to your sauce, not to cook it.

, Once you've softened your peanut butter, add the other ingredients and continue whisking to combine. As above, feel free to add more or less chili sauce to the mixture to increase or decrease its spiciness. Mix thoroughly until you achieve a uniform appearance and texture.


If you're using chunky peanut butter, you may want to pulse the sauce in a food processor for a smoother texture, though this isn't necessary if you don't mind solid bits of peanut in your sauce.

, Once you've combined your ingredients to your liking, your sauce is ready to serve! Because it contains protein- and fat-rich peanut butter, this sauce can make a hearty, filling dish even if paired with nothing more than rice. However, for a full, protein-rich meal, try pairing with chicken and brown rice — this is great for a post-workout protein load or simply an ordinary (yet satisfying) dinner!

In a stock pan, add a little oil and add the fish scraps.",How to Make Stocks for Soups and Sauces," Brown the carcass all over while breaking it up with a wooden spoon. The browner you cook it, the browner the stock. Alternatively roast the carcass or chicken pieces until richly golden brown and add to the stock pot.


Note: The leftover roast carcass removed of most meat is good to make a basic stock if you are economically minded and intend to make a chicken soup for the next day, as you can add the leftover roast meat to the soup at the last minute.
This is not ideal for making basic stock as you would have to be very mindful of other flavours added to the chicken before roasting (such as sage and onion, garlic, lemon, spices etc) that will come through into the stock that may be undesirable in other dishes.;
, Simmer very gently for 30 minutes to 1 hour, although if you desire a nice clear stock it is best to cook at a lower 80-85C / 175-185F.
A pressure cooker is a very useful way to make stocks quickly when you don't need the stock to be clear. A slow cooker can also work quietly in the background while you do other jobs.
Other additions may be 100ml of white wine, 3 small mushrooms (halved) or 1 tomato, in quarters.

, It can be stored in the fridge in a large jar with lid, or frozen in snap lock bags or in containers for easy portion use. Alternatively, strain and allow it to sediment to collect the clear stock for Consommé soups. (see tips)

, Transfer the pan into a preheated moderate oven and roast until well browned.

, Scrape the roasting pan clean with a wooden spoon to incorporate all the extra flavour into the water and pour this into the stock pot, add another 3 cups of water to the roasting pan to ensure all flavour and juices are collected and add this to the stockpot.

,
To make a make a sauce stock, boil the stock until reduced to 1/3 of its volume and use to enrich gravies and other sauces.
To make a sauce base, boil to reduce to 1/4 volume to a rich syrup and add other flavourings to taste such as sautéed mushrooms or red shallots, mustard, red wine, crushed peppercorns or sautéed ginger or garlic.

, However, for light beef stock, you don't need to roast the portions but add them raw to the pan with cold water and vegetables.


Light beef stock has a very delicate flavour so is good for light soups.

, Alternately, cut the vegetables into large chunks and roast until golden. Add the water to cover and bouquet garni and simmer gently for 30 minutes.


Other additions like chicken stock may be 100ml of white wine, 3 small mushrooms (halved) or 1 tomato, in quarters.

, Cook over low heat and add water, vegetables and bouquet. Simmer very gently no more than 20 minutes.


50mls of white wine may be added to fish stocks. This stock needs minimal cooking as prolonged cooking will make the stock turn grey and bitter.

You can put the butter in a microwave-safe container and melt it in the microwave ten seconds at a time, stirring it every ten seconds.The butter will melt very quickly this way, so don’t let it burn. You can also melt the butter on the stove.


Use a double broiler to melt the butter slowly.You need a bowl that fits over a small pot.
Place the butter in the bowl.
Bring water to boil in the small pot.
Place the butter bowl over the boiling pot of water, and let the steam from the water slowly melt the butter.
Stir the butter to make it melt more quickly.
You can also melt the butter directly in the pan in which you’ll make the medium white sauce.
However you melt the butter, put the melted butter in the pan in which you’ll make the medium white sauce.;
, Stir the mixture over medium heat until it’s smooth. Make sure not to have the heat up so high that the flour burns — you want the mixture to come together slowly.

, Pour it into the pan slowly, making sure not to splash it up over the sides of the pan. With your other hand, stir the mixture continuously to ensure that it’s coming together in an even consistency.

, You might want to lower the stove’s heat level a little bit so the sauce doesn’t burn. The longer you let it cook, the thicker the sauce will be, so keep an eye on it. Stir the sauce continuously and let it cook until it reaches the consistency you like. The end product should have a smooth consistency.

,, Use yellow onions because they don’t have as sharp a bite and they cook down well. Dice the onion into small pieces until you have about a teaspoon of onions.

, If you’re using canned mushrooms, drain them in a colander to remove all excess liquid. You don’t want your sauce to be too watery, so drain them well. To prepare fresh mushroomsRemove the stems from the mushrooms by snapping them off with your hand.
Dampen a paper towel with water.
Wipe dirt off the mushroom heads one by one.
You can rinse the mushrooms quickly in cold water, but don't let them soak because mushrooms absorb water very quickly.

, Put the butter in a separate skillet, and stir it over medium heat until it’s melted.

, Cook them over medium heat for a few minutes, until the onions change colors to a golden brown. You don’t have to stir continuously, but stir every once in a while to make sure your mushrooms and onions aren’t sticking to the pan.

, Continue to heat the mixture over low heat for a minute or two, stirring occasionally. This will marry the flavors together and give you a cohesive sauce. Taste the sauce to see if it needs any more salt or pepper.Add salt and pepper while you’re still warming the sauce. Adding seasoning after you’ve taken the sauce off the heat will result in a sharp, unpleasant saltiness.

Find one that is heatproof, holds at least 1 ½ quarts (1.4 l), and will fit inside your slow cooker when the lid is in place..If possible, use a 2 to 2 ½ quart (1.9 to 2.4 l) bowl. That will give you more room to mix the ingredients.;
, Add 1 14-ounce (300 ml) can of sweetened condensed milk, ½ cup (115 g) of melted butter, 1 cup (300 g) of light corn syrup, 2 teaspoons (10 ml) of vanilla, and 1 ½ teaspoons (7 ½ ml) of lemon juice to the bowl. Stir the ingredients so they’re fully combined.You’ll usually have an easier time mixing the ingredients with a whisk. However, a wooden spoon or rubber spatula can also work.

, Once all of the wet ingredients are mixed, stir in 1 cup (225 g) of white sugar, 1 cup (225 g) of brown sugar, and ½ teaspoon (3 g) of salt. Mix until the sugars and salt are completely blended into the other ingredients.If you want to make a salted caramel sauce, increase the salt to 1 tablespoon (17 g).

, When all of the ingredients are mixed, set the bowl inside the slow cooker. Try to arrange it so there’s an equal amount of space around all sides of the bowl., Once the bowl is inside the slow cooker, pour hot water around the outside of the bowl. Make sure to fill the cooker with enough water so its level is equal to that of the ingredients inside the bowl.There’s no need to use boiling water. Hot water from your tap is fine.

, Place the lid on your slow cooker, and turn it on. Set the temperature to high, and allow the sauce to cook for several hours, adjusting the cooking time based how thick you’d like the sauce to be.Cook the sauce for 4 to 5 hours if you want it to be light and thin.
Cook the sauce for 6 to 7 hours if you want it to be medium colored and slightly thicker.
Cook the sauce for 9 to 10 hours if you want it to be dark, extremely thick, and have a more robust caramel taste.
Don’t try to cook the sauce on low. Caramel sauce requires a higher cooking temperature.

, When the sauce has finished cooking, carefully remove the bowl from the slow cooker. Use a whisk to rapidly mix the sauce until it is smooth and creamy.Be sure to use a potholder or oven mitt to remove the hot bowl from the slow cooker to avoid burning yourself.

, If the sauce is thicker than you’d like it to be, whisk in a tablespoon (15 ml) of heavy cream at a time. Stir well to ensure that it’s fully incorporated and only add more cream if the sauce is still too thick.If you prefer, you can substitute milk or water for the heavy cream.

, Once you’re happy with the consistency of the sauce, pour it into a glass jar or other airtight container. You can serve it warm or at room temperature. If you aren’t going to use it right away, cover it and store it in the refrigerator for up to a week.You can heat the sauce up in the microwave after you’ve refrigerated it. Heat it on medium-high in 15 second intervals until it’s the temperature and consistency that you desire.

Remove your mixture from the heat source when the gravy thickens.",How to Thicken Gravy1," You can buy both of these items at your local grocery store. Flour or cornstarch will help to thicken any sauce, and gravy is no exception. As long as you can avoid making lumps this option is the fastest way to thicken your gravy.;
, You should put slightly more water than cornstarch or flour. There are no exact measurements here because it all depends on the amount of gravy that you have. This isn’t an exact science so you’ll have to eyeball it, but you should use approximately two tablespoons of cornstarch per cup of gravy. Make sure that you make this mix in a separate bowl. Stir thoroughly until smooth.

, Don’t pour it in all at once, make sure you do this very gradually. Pour a little bit, stir, and then pour some more. Continue this process until all of your mixture is in the gravy. Now give the gravy another good stir to get rid of any cornstarch lumps that might still be in there. , When the gravy takes on a viscous look it’s probably ready to go. You can also taste it with a spoon to see if it has reached the thickness you wanted. It’s all about your own personal taste. Just don’t let it burn. Now you are ready to serve your gravy!

This method is more time-consuming than the water and flour method, but the risk of lumps is minimized. Normally you should choose a fat like butter, leftover fat from the meat pan, or a suitable oil such as olive oil. The ratio is usually about half fat, half flour, although a little extra flour doesn't hurt. , You want the saucepan to be sturdy so that you can stir in there without the pan moving all over the place. Keep the stove on about medium heat and turn it down if you smell the butter burning. This will depend on what type of stove you have.

, Mix well, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon. Constant stirring helps to avoid making lumps. When the mixture starts to froth a little transfer it to the gravy. It should take about five minutes before the mixture froths. , Make sure you stir it well, you want the mixture to fully incorporate itself into the gravy. Otherwise you risk your gravy tasting a little strange. Keep stirring until the gravy thickens – that’s how you’ll know the mixture is incorporated. If the gravy still isn’t thick enough to your liking you can always repeat the process with another roux.

The arrowroot must be added to a little cold liquid and blended into a paste before being added to the hot gravy. , The beauty of arrowroot is that it will stay clear, which can be important for lighter colored gravy. You don’t have stir really hard, just keep the arrowroot in motion while your gravy comes to a boil.

, Any further cooking can have the reverse effect and thin the arrowroot. As soon as you see bubbles in the gravy remove the gravy completely from the hot stove plate. Don’t just turn the stove off and let the gravy sit on there – it will continue to boil! , Hopefully it has reached the consistency that you were looking for.

Mix in a saucepan or pot. Heat the mixture on the stove until it comes to a boil. Lower the head and keep it at a steady temperature. It needs to be at boiling temperature to pickle the cucumbers.
""Pickle crisp"" is a commercial pickling product used to keep pickles crispy. It's basically calcium chloride. A natural alternative to pickle crisp is to use grape leaves in the jars, which was the traditional way to keep the pickles from softening.

, How you want to spice your pickles is up to you, but a typical ""pickling spice"" mixture includes black peppercorns, dill seeds, smashed or sliced garlic cloves, and red pepper flakes if you like some kick.You can either throw the dried spices into the pickling solution, or you can stuff the spice mix into the jars after you've prepared them and before you've inserted the pickles. Either is an effective way of spicing the pickles, but packing an amount in each jar will ensure an even amount of spice in each jar.

, Wide-mouth jars are the easiest to stuff and ladle into. As a rule of thumb one quart jar can hold about four cucumbers. Have extra jars on hand just in case. While you can reuse glass jars and rims, you can't reuse lids. Typically you can buy a box of new jar lids for a few dollars.


Take all of the lids, rims, jars and boiling water canner and run them through your dishwasher removing any residue that might be on them. Inspect them and make sure there are no cracks or other issues.

, Place a canning rack at the bottom off the boiling water to keep the jars off the super-hot bottom of the pot, which risks cracking them. Place the jars inside. Boil the jars for at least five minutes.


Do not boil the lids. The rubber seal on the lids will be ruined if you boil them. On your stove or in the microwave, you can heat water to just under a boil and sterilize the lids in that.

, Set each jar right side up on a towel on your work surface, making sure everything is in reach--you'll need your jars, lids, lid bands, and pickling solution all close by. It can be a quick process, so it sometimes helps to have a partner at this point.

, Remove the cucumbers from the salt/ice mixtures and pat them dry, then pack them into the jars leaving at least half an inch from the where the jar mouth narrows.


Again, you can either line the bottom of the jars with the picking spices or include them in the solution. Either way, this is also your chance to include any fresh spices you might like to add, like smashed garlic cloves, fresh dill leaves, or grape leaves for crispness., You can use a small funnel and put it on the rim of your jar if you want, or just ladle it in if you feel confident of your pouring skills. Pour in the pickle juice till it is about a half an inch from the top of the jar.


You need to make sure the pickles are completely submerged under the solution. Any pickles exposed to the air will spoil, and possibly ruin the jar. Grape leaves can be good for this, using the leaves to push the pickles down and then leaving the leaf on top., Wipe the mouth of the jar of any dripped pickling solution before you do this, using a clean cloth dipped in the hot sterilizing water. Screw the lid on tightly.

, Keep the jar upright and make sure there is an inch of water above the lids. If you don't have enough water left from the sterilizing of the jars, pour more in. Close the lid and let it boil on high.


Turn off heat after 5 to 15 minutes and let the jars sit until the water stops boiling and cools down some. Take your jar lifter and remove jars from water and place on towel. Let sit for 24 hours.
Do not remove or attempt to tighten the lids. If you hear a distinctive ""pop,"" it means the jars have sealed.

, Properly sealed jars should be good on the shelf for a year or more. Keep them in a cool and dry area, out of sunlight.


Let the pickles sit for 10-14 days before putting them in the fridge. This will complete the pickling process. If you really want to, you can open or eat them before they've pickled, but they'll be better once you've let them sit and pickle for several days. When they're pickled, put them in the fridge and let them cool down for a delicious cold snack.

Turn the heat until medium-high and allow the pan to warm.It’s very important to measure the drippings carefully. If you don’t add enough, the gravy will wind up lumpy.;
, Add ¼ cup (31 g) all-purpose flour to the drippings. Use a wire whisk to incorporate the flour, stirring constantly. Move the whisk quickly to ensure that the flour and drippings are fully blended and there are no lumps. Allow the gravy to cook for 2 to 3 minutes or until the mixture is smooth and bubbling slightly.








Make sure to stir the gravy constantly while it’s cooking to prevent lumps.
While the gravy shouldn’t have lumps, it will be very thick and gloppy at this stage. It will take on a thinner consistency when you add liquid to it.

, Stir 2 cups (470 ml) of chicken or turkey broth into the drippings and flour mixture. Adjust the heat to high, and allow the gravy to come to a boil, making sure to stir constantly.








In addition to chicken or turkey broth, you can use turkey juice or water as the liquid to thin out the gravy. In fact, you can use any combination of the liquids that add up to 2 cups (470 ml).

Add enough water to the pan to cover the giblets and neck by at least 2 inches (5 cm). Turn the heat to medium, and bring the pan to a gentle boil.If desired, you add seasonings to the pan. For example, you might stir in a sliced onion, chopped celery, salt, and/or pepper before you bring the water to a boil.

, After the pan has boiled, reduce the heat to low, and let the contents simmer on the stove for an hour. That will cook the giblet and neck meat and form a giblet broth for possible use later.It’s best to cover the pan while the contents are simmering. Use the lid if you have one, or place a piece of foil over the top.

, Once the pan has simmered for an hour, remove it from the stove. Take the giblets and turkey neck out, and set aside.

Add as much or as little of the meat to the gravy as you like. If you want it to have a chunky texture, mix in more of the meat. If you prefer a smoother texture, add less.

, After you’ve mixed in the giblet and neck meat, examine the gravy’s consistency. If it seems too thick, add in a little more chicken, turkey, or giblet broth to make it smoother. Make sure to season it with salt and pepper to taste as well.Be sure to taste the gravy before adding any salt. You don’t want it to be overly salty.

, When you’re happy with the flavor, remove the gravy from the stove and transfer it to a gravy boat or other serving bowl. Serve it with your meal while it’s still piping hot."

, Gravy is just cooked flour in a fat, and that fat can be animal fat, butter, or both. But you can't have a completely dry pan or there will be nothing to absorb the flour and make a gravy.


Butter isn't strictly necessary, but it helps if you're using a lower-fat sausage, like turkey or chicken sausage.

, You need to do this slowly, as the flour wants to be incorporated evenly into the liquid. The best way to do this is to break the 1/3 cup of flour into three parts, adding and stirring each one in individually. Keep the whisk moving, breaking up and clumps and stirring until none of the flour is at all visible.








, In a pinch, 2% will also work, but don't use skim -- you need the fat to help bind the gravy. If you can, measure out the milk ahead of time and let it warm slightly towards room temperature. You need to add the milk slowly because you don't want to rapidly change the temperature of your gravy. Pour a bit in, stir and let it simmer, then add some more.

Trim and slice the country ham.,
Consider soaking the ham.,
Heat a skillet and dry the ham.,
Fry the ham.,
Add coffee to the drippings.,
Stir in water and sugar, optional.,
Serve the red eye gravy.",How to Make Red Eye Gravy," Purchase about 6 ounces (160 g) of country ham and cut it into 1/4-inch thick slices. If you're using large center-cut pieces of ham, cut them in half so you have two medium-sized pieces. Take a small knife and cut about 1/4-inch thick slits in the fat along the edges of the ham, about every three inches. This will prevent the ham from curling as you fry it.Country ham is very salty, so you probably won't need to add extra salt to the ham or gravy. If you don't want to use ham, you could try making the gravy by frying up bacon and using the drippings.;
, If you'd like to reduce the saltiness of the ham before you cook it, place the slices in a large bowl. Fill the bowl with water and let the ham soak for 30 minutes to 1 hour. This will also make the ham plump up. Drain the water before you're ready to fry the ham.You could also soak the ham in milk to give it additional flavor.

, Place a large skillet on the stove over medium-high heat and add 1 tablespoon (14 g) of unsalted butter. Melt the butter while you dry the ham. Pat the ham dry with paper towels to remove any excess moisture. The pan is ready when the melted butter starts sizzling.It's important to use unsalted butter since the ham is so salty. This will prevent the gravy from becoming overly salty as well.

, Place a few pieces of ham in the hot skillet and fry them for 2 to 3 minutes. Turn the ham over and fry them for another 2 to 3 minutes. The ham should darken as it cooks. Use tongs to carefully remove the fried ham to a serving plate.If the ham is lean, you may need to add another 1/2 of a tablespoon of butter.

, Keep the skillet on the stove over medium-high heat. The drippings and grease from the ham should still be in the skillet. Pour in 1/2 cup (120 ml) of strong black coffee into the skillet. Use a wooden spoon to stir the drippings and coffee well.Use caution when pouring in the coffee. It will probably sputter and foam a little as you add it to the hot drippings.

, Pour in 1/2 cup (120 ml) of water and stir the red eye gravy well. If you'd like to remove a little of the bitterness, add a 1/2 teaspoon of sugar. Let the gravy cook for 3 to 4 minutes until it becomes a little syrupy and cooked down. You can serve the red eye gravy or thicken it a little.To thicken it a little, add 1 tablespoon (14 g) of unsalted butter and whisk the gravy for one minute.

, Plate up your fried country ham and set out a small ramekin or gravy boat full of the red eye gravy. This way, you can portion out as much gravy as you like. Red eye gravy also goes well with:


Biscuits
Fried eggs
