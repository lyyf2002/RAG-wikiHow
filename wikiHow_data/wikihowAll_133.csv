Know that pork gravy is made from the drippings of cooked pork.,
Collect the juices from the cooked pork.,
Pour the juices from the pan or skillet into a glass measure.,
Skim the fat from the top once it has separated from the juices.",How to Make Pork Gravy1," In order to collect the drippings to make the gravy, you need to cook the pork first. This can be done in one of two ways.



Roast the pork: Select your cut of pork and place it in a oven-proof dish or pan fat-side down. Preheat the oven to 400°F (204°C). When the oven has heated, place the roasting dish and pork into the oven. Roast the pork for 30 minutes and then flip it so the pork is fat-side up. Rotating the pork allows the whole pork cut to roast thoroughly. Remove the pork and let it stand for 10 minutes.Sautee pork chops: Season your pork chops with salt and pepper on both sides. Heat butter in a large skillet or pan on medium-high heat. If you prefer, you can use olive oil instead of butter. Place the pork chops in the skillet and cook them until they are brown on both sides and cooked all the way through. This should take three to five minutes. The pork is done when the meat is white on the inside.;
, When you pick the meat up from the pan or skillet, hold the meat over the pan for a few second. Doing this allows the extra juices to drip off the meat and into the pan.

, The glass measure allows you to see when the fat separates from the juices. Let the drippings stand in the container until the fat floats to the top.


If you do not have a glass measure, you can use a small cooking pot.

, Put the fat in its own small stove top pan. You will need roughly three tablespoons of the fat for the gravy.

",How to Make Pork Gravy2," You should have three tablespoons of fat. Place the pan with the fat back on the stove. Add three tablespoons of flour to the fat and stir.

, You should cook the mixture for one to two minutes, stirring constantly. Make sure to scrape any browned bits free from the bottom and sides of the pan.

, You will want to have 2 cups of dripping mixture. Measure how much drippings you have and then pour the drippings into a mixing bowl. Add the liquids of your choice so that you have two cups of drippings.


Add pork broth or stock to your drippings for a truly salty, pork flavor.
Add sherry or red for a more gourmet gravy. Gravies benefit from a bit of acidity. Wines or sherries add a depth of flavor to the gravy that comes from the addition of the acidity.
Some people enjoy making gravy by mixing the drippings with a can of cream of mushroom soup., Stir both mixtures in the pan over medium heat. The gravy should become smooth and thick. Add salt and pepper to taste.


If it is not thick enough for your taste, add another tablespoon of flour.

, Enjoy!

Tilt the pan to one side, so you can pour all of the meat drippings into a measuring cup.Make sure that the measuring cup that you’re using is heat-resistant and can hold at least 2 cups (473 ml).;
, While the drippings from the meat have plenty of concentrated flavor, it will also have a lot of fat. Let the drippings sit for a moment so the fat rises to the surface. Use a spoon to carefully skim the fat from the top and discard.You can purchase a measuring cup specifically designed to separate the fat out of a liquid. When you pour the drippings through it, the fat stays behind so you don’t need to skim it.
You can also reserve 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of the fat to use in place of the butter when you make the roux for the gravy if you prefer.

, When you’ve removed all of the fat from the drippings, pour the chicken stock into the measuring cup with them. You want the total amount of liquid to equal 2 cups (473 ml), so add enough stock to reach that level and set the mixture aside.If you prefer, you can substitute beef stock or vegetable stock for the chicken stock.

, Take the roasting pan and place it on your stovetop across two burners. Add 2 tablespoons (28 g) of butter to the pan, and heat it on medium-high heat until it melts, which should take approximately 3 to 5 minutes.The butter will melt more quickly if you cut it into pieces before adding it to the pan.
Stir the butter as it’s melting to ensure that it heats evenly and doesn’t scorch.

, When the butter is fully melted, mix 2 tablespoons (18 g) of all-purpose flour into the pan with a whisk. Lower the heat to medium-low, and allow the mixture to cook until it turns a pale brown, which should take approximately 1 to 2 minutes.By combining the butter and flour in this way, you’re creating a roux, which helps thicken up gravies and sauces.
Make sure to whisk the butter and flour the entire time that you’re cooking the roux to ensure that the mixture is smooth and doesn’t scorch.

, When the roux has become a light brown, slowly start to pour the drippings and stock mixture into pan. Add a small amount to start, and stir it into the roux with a wooden spoon. After that liquid is worked into the roux, continue to add more until all 2 cups (473 ml) are added.When you’re stirring the drippings mixture into the pan, make sure to scrape the wooden spoon along the bottom to work loose any brown bits of meat that might be stuck there. This technique is know as deglazing the pan, and helps add extra flavor to the gravy.

, After you’ve mixed in all of the drippings mixture, allow the gravy to come to a full boil, which should take 3 to 5 minutes. Next, lower the heat to medium and let the mixture simmer until the gravy starts to thicken, which typically takes 2 to 3 minutes.You’ll know the gravy is thick enough when it coats the back of the wooden spoon without dripping off.

, Once the gravy has thickened, stir in 3 sprigs of fresh rosemary that have been chopped and 3 sprigs of fresh thyme that have been chopped into the gravy. Mix until the herbs are well incorporated.You can mix in whatever combination of fresh herbs that you prefer. Parsley and sage are other options that work well in a gravy.

, After you’ve mixed the herbs into the gravy, stir in some salt and pepper. It’s important to taste the gravy, though, so you know how much of each seasoning you want to add., Take the roasting pan off the heat, and place a wire strainer over a large measuring cup. Pour the gravy through the strainer, using a wooden spoon to push it through and remove any clumps of flour, meat, or herbs. Next, transfer the gravy to a gravy boat or other serving bowl to serve with your meal.If you’re not ready to serve your meal right away, make sure to warm the gravy again before you bring it to the table.

Brown the hamburger in a large, deep skillet.,
Remove from heat and sprinkle in flour.,
Place over medium heat and gradually add milk.,
Season with salt, pepper and onion salt.,
Serve.",How to Make Hamburger Gravy1," Heat the pan on the stove over a burner set to medium-high. When a drop of water flicked into the pan starts sizzling immediately, it's hot enough. Crumble the beef into the pan and cook until pleasantly brown. Use your spoon or spatula to break up larger pieces.


If you're using leaner ground beef (e.g., 95/5), you can add a small amount of oil to the pan to keep it from sticking. Fattier grades of ground beef (e.g., 80/20) will make enough grease on their own. See ""Tips"" below for help choosing fat or lean beef.;
, Stir well so that the flour absorbs the grease and oil that has appeared in the pan from cooking the beef. You want the mixture to be as smooth and even as possible.


When the flour is completely absorbed, you will have a roux — a type of sauce made by cooking flour and liquid fat., Add about 1/2 of the total milk at first, stirring as you go. Keep stirring until the mixture is well combined. The gravy should gradually start to thicken as the heat evaporates the liquid.


At this point, you can add as much of the remaining milk as you want. The more milk you add, the thinner the gravy will be. When it's at the consistency you want, heat it to boiling, stirring occasionally, then remove from the heat.

, Add these dry seasonings to the hot gravy and stir to combine. Give the mixture a test taste. If you like the way it tastes, you're ready to serve.


If you think the recipe could use a little extra flavor, feel free to add more of any of the seasonings. Go slowly, stopping to taste-test often. Remember: you can always add more, but you can't take any out.

, Spoon the gravy over your food and enjoy!


Garnish with small chunks of fresh chopped onion if desired.

Try seasoning with basil and sage.,
Add bouillon for savory flavor.,
Try thickening with cornstarch instead of flour.,
Add tangy steak sauce for a barbecue flavor.,
Heat the recipe up with red pepper.,
Use fat-free milk for a healthier alternative.",How to Make Hamburger Gravy2," The basic gravy recipe above tastes great on its own, but it's not the final word on hamburger gravy. For example, if you want to give your gravy a slightly more complex taste, try adding these dried herbs with the salt, pepper, etc. at the end of the recipe. The bitter aromatics of sage and the sweetness of basil pair well to make a gravy that's a little more filet mignon than hamburger.

, Bouillon is a common ingredient in gravy recipes. Its salty, meat-y flavor make for a mouthwatering gravy. To use bouillon, just stir it into the mixture along with the flour. Both beef and chicken bouillon make good choices.


You can also use broth for a similar flavor. About one 14-ounce can of chicken or beef broth should be plenty.

, If you don't have any flour or you like a slightly thicker gravy, this is the way to go. However, since cornstarch can form unappetizing clumps if you add it directly to hot liquids, you need to prepare the recipe a little differently:


While the beef cooks, combine the corn starch with the milk in a small bowl. You can also combine it with the broth if you're using it. Stir until well-combined. Add the liquid-cornstarch mixture gradually to the pan, stirring as you go.

, Steak sauce goes excellently with beef, so it only makes sense that it would go with hamburger gravy. The sour-savory taste of most steak sauces makes the perfect companion to the smooth taste of the basic gravy. Add your favorite steak sauce at the end of the recipe with the salt, pepper, etc.


Barbecue sauce and hot sauce also work well here.

, Gravy is delicious, but it's not something that people usually associate with the word ""spicy."" If you have a bold palate, try adding red pepper flakes or cayenne to your gravy. The latter will give it a nice pinkish color in addition to plenty of heat.


Don't forget to add gradually and taste the gravy often to avoid adding too much!

, Cutting down on the fat in your gravy is as simple as adding nonfat milk in place of 2% or whole milk in the recipe. Since nonfat milk is slightly more watery, you may need to heat the gravy for slightly longer to get the same thickness (or add a little extra flour/cornstarch).


You can also use leaner grades of ground beef to reduce the fat in the dish even more.

Heat 1 cup of broth (stock) in a pot over medium heat.,
Put 2 tablespoons each of butter and flour into a small bowl and cream together.,
Add the butter-flour paste to the stock, whisking vigorously.,
Turn down the heat to low and wait for it to thicken.,
Season to taste.",How to Make Gravy1," What kind of stock? Whatever you want! Chicken, beef, and vegetable are all good – it just depends on what you're pairing it with (chicken goes with chicken, etc.) and what your personal preferences are.


As this recipe only makes 2-4 servings, you won’t need a very large pot. However, you can easily double (or even triple) the recipe if need be. The more gravy you need to make, the bigger the pot you’ll need.;
, Make sure your butter is soft, but not melting (otherwise it will be nearly impossible to cream). It will eventually turn into a smooth paste – what the French call a “beurre manié.”


If your butter is just chunking up, leave it alone to sit for a bit – it's too cold. Move your broth to low and come back in 5 or 10 minutes. Then resume as normal.

, It’ll start out just like the butter and flour – a bit chunky and not at all appealing to the eye. Then slowly the paste will infuse into the broth, thickening it slowly.


Keep whisking throughout the rest of this recipe. This keeps the air flowing and will result in your gravy thickening more quickly.

, If the gravy is too hot, it will start to boil – which is not what you want, as that thins it and makes it foamy. On low, keep whisking lightly, keeping an eye on how thick it is getting. This could take up to 10 minutes. Be patient!


Once you think it's thick enough, give it the spoon test. Dip a spoon in and then lift it out. Does it stay covered? Does it drip off like a gravy should?

, Especially with quick gravy (that doesn’t have pan drippings or cream), you may find that you prefer it with a bit of salt and pepper, or any other spice you're particularly fond of. Give it a taste test regularly to make sure you don't over-season it.


Remember that the gravy will likely be eating in tandem with another food. If the gravy itself isn't strong, that's fine. It will be combining with other flavors anyway.

Place them in a medium sized pot and pour in enough water so that it covers the giblets completely by about 2 inches (5.08 cm). Then turn the heat up to medium and let them cook.Many butchers remove the neck and other giblet parts and put them in a sealed bag which they place in the body cavity of the bird.While you are making the giblet gravy, you should also Cook a Turkey. You will use the drippings collected from the turkey to add to the gravy, so be sure to roast the turkey in a pan that collects the drippings in the bottom.
Try to time the cooking of your turkey so that it is done roasting either right before you make the gravy or after you finish cooking the giblets.;
, Cook the giblets over medium heat until they reach a boil. Once the water is boiling, turn the heat down to low and let the giblets simmer for one hour.Simmering the giblets cooks the meat and also infuses the water with flavor to make a broth.

, Once the giblets have simmered for about an hour, the meat will be cooked through and the water will have been turned into a broth. Use a slotted spoon to remove the giblet meat and the neck and reserve the broth., Wait until the neck has cooled, then use your fingers to pick and strip the meat away from the neck. It should come off in thin strips. When you have taken off all the meat, dispose of the remainder of the neck., Place the giblets on a cutting board, then use a heavy knife to dice them into small pieces about ½ inch (1.27 cm) long. Then combine the neck meat with the giblet meat and set them aside while you prepare the rest of the gravy., While you are making the giblet broth, you should also be roasting the rest of the bird. When the turkey is done roasting, take it out of the oven and move the cooked turkey off of the roasting pan., Take the roasting pan that the turkey was cooking on and pour the drippings into a medium sized bowl. Use oven mitts because the pan will be extremely hot!, Leave the turkey drippings in the bowl for about fifteen minutes. You should see that the liquid starts to separate, with the dark drippings at the bottom of the bowl and the clear fat rising to the top., After the mixture has finished separating, use a ladle or large spoon to scoop the clear fat on top out of the mixture. Make sure not to use too much force and mix up the liquid as you are scooping out the fat.You can also slowly lower the ladle into the liquid and let the fat spill over into the bowl of the ladle. This will ensure that the mixture doesn’t get mixed.
Reserve some of the fat so that you can add it to the gravy.

, Take the roasting pan you used to make the turkey and straddle it over two burners. Turn the heat up to medium low on both burners and allow the pan to heat.Using the roasting pan as opposed to a clean pan gives the gravy more flavor, because the dried drippings coating the bottom of the pan will get liquefied by the heat and will add to the flavor of the gravy.

, Once the pan has heated, pour some of the fat that you separated out from the drippings into the pan. Add as much or as little as you want, depending on how rich you want the gravy, but make sure to add at least two tablespoons (29.5 ml)., Once the fat has heated, about two minutes, add in ½ cup (118.2 ml) of flour. Use a whisk to mix the fat and the flour to make a paste. If the paste looks too thin or greasy, add in a few more pinches of flour until the consistency is thick.Keep cooking the mixture, whisking constantly, until it browns, about ten minutes.

, Pour in the 4 cups (946.3 ml) of no sodium chicken, turkey or vegetable broth. Then add in half of the drippings that you separated from the fat., Use a whisk to mix the broth and the drippings in with the flour paste. Cook it until the gravy has thickened, about five to ten minutes., When you are happy with the consistency and thickness of the gravy, add in the chopped giblets and neck meat. Stir to mix the meat in with the liquid., After you add in the giblet meat, spoon up and taste the gravy. Add salt and pepper if you wish. You can also add more fat or drippings for more flavor., Serve the giblet gravy by drizzling it over turkey, mashed potatoes or green beans. If the gravy gets cold before serving, heat it up in a pot over the stove or microwave it in a microwave-safe bowl. Store any leftover gravy in a sealed container in the refrigerator for up to three days.

Start making a roux.,
Whisk until well-blended – and keep whisking.,
Add 1 cup of stock to start.,
Keep it over low heat to thicken.,
Once thickened, add in ⅓ cup of cream.,
Season to taste.",How to Make Gravy2," A roux (pronounced “roo”) is where you cook flour and butter together until it’s a perfect, smooth consistency – then you’ll be adding cold stock and cooking it until it has thickened into a sumptuous gravy. Here’s how to begin:Cut up 8 tablespoons (½ cup) of ‘’un’’salted butter into chunks (salted will make your gravy too salty). Then add the chunks to a medium-sized saucepan.
With the pan on low heat, melt the butter until it’s foamy. If the butter starts burning, the oven is on too high.
Add ½ cup of white flour to the pan.

, At first it will look like an unappetizing, buttery, gloopy paste, and then slowly it will transform into something smooth and silky. Keep whisking while it’s on low so the air circulates and the mixture thickens.


Eventually (6-12 minutes) it’ll start to smell like a pie is baking in the oven. It won't happen immediately. At this point, your flour has cooked and your gravy won’t taste flour-y.

, Chicken, beef, or vegetable stock all work. Keep whisking as you’re adding the stock, until it all gets absorbed. Once that cup is absorbed, add in another and then whisk until that one is absorbed, and another and then whisk, and another and then whisk, and eventually you will have one smooth, but thin, gravy.


Again, it will be thin – don't be alarmed if it looks more like soup at this juncture; that's totally normal. That's what it's supposed to look like.

, Your gravy is done when it coats a spoon and comes off in drips – not a steady, thin stream. This could take around 10-15 minutes.


Stir it regularly so it doesn't film over, the bottom doesn't overheat, and the air and heat circulate evenly. It will take a while, so be patient.
It's not done yet! Don't be alarmed if it still seems like it's in the works, because it is!

, Whisk it for 2-3 minutes, giving it the spoon test once more. It should thickly coat the back of a spoon and resemble the gravy you have pictured in your mind. All done!

, Though your gravy doesn't necessarily need any more additions, salt and pepper are a favorite of many. However, you may consider a few of these more off-the-beaten-track family traditions:Ketchup

Save the pan drippings from your roast.,
Skim off the fat.,
Add the fat and an equivalent amount of flour to the pan.,
Mix the fat and flour together.,
Add the broth.,
Season to taste.,
Finished.

",How to Make Gravy3," To make gravy, the first step is to save the drippings and scraps from the pan that you used to cook your meat, whether it was chicken, turkey, beef, or duck. This will give a great flavor to your gravy that can’t be replicated through a mix or broth.

Put them into a wide-brimmed bowl. You’ll need to separate it later, so the wider the brim, the better.


, Let the drippings sit for a minute or two, until the fat has separated on the top. Then, use a spoon to skim the fat from the top and transfer the fat to a measuring cup. Don't be tempted to throw it away! While it may not look appetizing, it's what will give your gravy that delectable edge.

Make sure that you keep track of how much fat you have, because you will need an equal amount of flour. You should end up with about ¼ cup (however, if you don't have that, don't worry).
Keep the rest of the drippings, too (the non-fat part) – you will need these later as well.


, Pour the fat from the measuring cup into a large pot or pan over medium to medium-high heat. Then add an equivalent amount of flour – that is, if you have 1/4 cup of fat, use 1/4 cup of flour.

If you want to make a large serving of gravy and do not have enough fat from the drippings, you can use butter to make up the difference. Simply add the butter to the pan with whatever fat you have, and then let the butter melt before adding the flour (you’ll need more flour, too).
Don't have flour? You can easily substitute cornmeal.


, Stir the fat and flour with a wooden spoon until the mixture thickens and turns a medium shade of brown, like peanut butter. This should take a couple of minutes. Be careful not to let it burn!


If it is scorching on the bottom, it is burning. The best way to avoid this is to stir evenly and to turn down the heat just a bit if you suspect it is too hot.

, This is where you add the rest of the drippings from the cooking of the meat. Pour the drippings into the pan and whisk them together with the fat/flour mixture. Stir until the whole mixture has the smooth, viscous consistency like gravy.


If you do not have enough drippings to make the amount of gravy that you desire, you can use canned broth. Try to use broth that matches the type of meat you are serving, i.e. beef broth with beef, chicken broth with poultry.


, With pan drippings, it's likely your gravy will already taste good on its own. However, plenty of people add a dash of salt or pepper, and some even add cream (sour or regular) or even ketchup, soy sauce, or coffee (with beef gravy, of course). What taste would you like to see in your gravy?

If you want, you can add the turkey wings and drumstick. You can also add vegetables like onions, carrots, celery and garlic for more flavors. Add 8 cups (2 L) of water to the stockpot and bring it to a boil. Reduce heat and let the mixture simmer for about 1 hour. Strain the stock into a bowl and discard the remaining solid pieces.If you like your gravy a little chunkier, consider leaving in any meaty pieces of turkey. You can also puree the remaining vegetable and meat and add it to the gravy. However, be sure to discard and bones or cartilage.

, Heat 4 tablespoons (57 g) of butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Once the butter melts, whisk in ¼ cup (60 g) of flour. Vigorously whisk the roux for about a minute.

Be sure to whisk the roux to avoid any lumpiness.

, Once the roux has set, slowly pour your stock into the mixture. Continue to whisk as you the stick to break down any clumps. Let the stock and roux mixture simmer for a few minutes or until it no longer tastes like flour.

At this point you have plain turkey gravy.

, Add 2 tablespoons (32 g) mustard seeds and whisk them into the gravy. Reduce the heat to low and allow the mixture to simmer for a few minutes. Season with a pinch of salt to taste.You can also add 2 teaspoons (5 mL) of soy sauce and a pinch of black pepper for a little more flavor.
This recipe makes about 8 servings of mustard seed gravy.

Choose the right container, if necessary.,
Select a room with a consistent temperature.,
Keep honey away from sunlight.,
Make sure containers are tightly sealed.",How to Store Honey1," You can store honey in the container it originally came in. However, if your container is damaged or leaking, you can transfer your honey to another container in your kitchen. You can store honey in any of the following:Plastic buckets or containers
Glass jars
Mason jars;
, Honey is best stored between 50 and 70 degrees Fahrenheit (10 and 20 degrees Celsius). Variations in temperature can cause honey to darken and lose flavor. When storing honey, choose a location within the right temperature range that is not prone to changes in temperature.A kitchen pantry is generally a great place to store honey. However, keep honey away from the stove and out of the fridge. These places are prone to sudden changes in temperature.

, Sunlight can also damage honey, so it's bet to keep honey in a darker place. Do not, for example, store honey on a window ledge. Honey can be easily stored in a pantry or cabinet., You want to minimize the amount of air exposure honey gets. Make sure the jar or container you use is tightly sealed before putting honey away for storage. Honey's flavor can be affected by flavors in the air, and honey can also absorb moisture when overexposed to air. This can also cause it to change color and flavor."

Select a container for your honey.,
Put your honey in the freezer.,
Thaw out the honey when you want to use it.",How to Store Honey2," If you're not going to use honey for a few months, it may crystalize. While this process is normal, and reversible, it can be a hassle. To prevent crystallization, you can store honey in the freezer. You will need a container with a little extra room, as honey will expand some when frozen. If you just bought a jar of honey, you may need to use some of the honey or transfer it to a bigger container to make room in the jar.Some people like to use an ice tray to freeze honey. This way, when you need honey, you can thaw out one cube at a time. You can freeze honey in an ice tray and then transfer the cubes to a plastic bag.

, Once you've transferred your honey to your chosen container, place it in the fridge. Honey can last a few years when stored in the freezer.While honey lasts a long time in the freezer, it's never a bad idea to write down the date on frozen food items.

, Thawing out honey is simple. You simply leave it in an airtight container and allow it to gradually thaw out at room temperature. Do not attempt to speed up the process of thawing out honey."
"
Fix honey that has crystalized.,
Keep honey away from warmer areas in the kitchen.,
Do not store honey in the refrigerator.",How to Store Honey3," Honey can last for years, and natural honey can theoretically last indefinitely.However, honey may start to crystalize after awhile. You do not need to throw away crystalized honey. You can bring the honey back to its liquid state with boiling water.First, bring a pot of water to a boil. Then, set your jar of honey into the pot. Keep the container tightly sealed.
Turn off the heat on your stove. Leave the honey container alone until it's cool. The honey should have returned to its liquid state.

, Many people store honey in the kitchen. This is the most convenient place to store honey, as it'll be on hand when you need to use it. However, keep it away from warmer parts of your kitchen. Excessive heat can harm honey. Do not store honey near an oven, for example., While honey can be frozen and thawed later, it should never be stored in the fridge. This can cause honey to crystalize faster. If your kitchen is too hot to store honey, choose a cooler place in your home rather than placing honey in the fridge."

Finished.

",How to Make Citrus Gravy," To make a delicious gravy, you need the drippings from a turkey or chicken. After it’s finished roasting, take the pan out of the oven and remove the meat so you can mix the gravy in the pan.If you’re not ready to eat the turkey or chicken right away, leave it on the cutting board. Place a sheet of foil over it, though, to keep it warm. It should rest for approximately 15 minutes before carving.;
, Once the meat is out of the roasting pan, examine the drippings. You don’t want any fat in your gravy, so use a spoon to carefully skim any visible fat from the drippings.The clear fat in the drippings will rise to the top, which makes it easier to tell it apart from the dark, flavorful juices. Be careful not to stir or slosh the liquids together, though.
You’ll have an easier time skimming off the fat if you gently tilt the pan so all of the drippings collect in one corner.

, Add ¼ cup (30 g) of flour and ½ cup (118 ml) of turkey or chicken stock to a small bowl. Use a whisk to carefully blend the two together until the mixture is smooth. Set the bowl aside.You can use store-bought stock or make your own with the leftover bones, skin, and giblets from a turkey or chicken.

, Set the roasting pan on the stovetop, and turn the burner(s) to medium. Pour 1 cup (237 ml) of dry white wine into the pan, and bring it to a boil, which should take 5 to 10 minutes.Depending on the size of your roasting pan, it will likely need to span two burners on the stovetop.

, Allow the mixture to cook for 2 to 4 minutes, or until it is reduced by approximately half. Use a wooden spoon to scrape the browned bits from the pan to mix it into the wine.The browned bits from the bottom of the pan will start to dissolve into the wine and other drippings.

, Once the stock has reduced, mix in the remaining 3 ½ cups (828 ml) of stock. Turn the heat up to medium-high, and bring the mixture to a boil again, which should take approximately 5 minutes.Stir the mixture regularly while you’re bringing it to a boil.

, When the mixture has come to a boil, allow it to cook for several more minutes. It should reduce by approximately half again, which should take 6 to 8 minutes., When the mixture has reduced, add the reserved flour and stock mixture to the pan. Whisk the mixture until the gravy begins to thicken, which should take approximately 1 to 3 minutes.It’s important to whisk the gravy constantly as it’s thickening to keep it from burning.

, Once the gravy has thickened, mix 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of Meyer lemon juice into the pan. Stir well until the juice is fully incorporated.You can substitute 4 teaspoons (20 ml) of lemon juice plus 2 teaspoons (10 ml) of orange juice for the Meyer lemon juice if you prefer.

, After the lemon juice is mixed in, remove the roasting pan from the stove. Pour the gravy through a fine mesh sieve into a measuring cup to strain any solid bits., Once the gravy is strained, mix in ¼ teaspoon (1.4 g) of salt and freshly ground pepper to taste. Pour the gravy into a gravy boat for serving.The gravy is best served hot, so if you aren’t going to use it right away, reheat it before bringing it to the table.

Spoon the honey into a glass jar.,
Boil a saucepan of water.Fill a deep saucepan roughly halfway with water.,
Remove the pan from the heat.,
Lower the honey into the water.,
Stir the honey.,
Store at room temperature.",How to Melt Honey1," Transfer all the honey you want to melt into a tall, room temperature glass jar with a lid. Loosely cover the jar.


A glass jar is the ideal container since the glass can withstand hot temperatures while also allowing that heat to be transferred to the honey inside.






Make sure that the jar you use is room temperature, though, and not cold. Glass can shatter under extreme changes in temperature.






Using a lid will help prevent water from accidentally getting inside the jar and into the honey. A lid is not strictly necessary, though, especially if the jar is fairly tall.





;
, Place this saucepan on the stove over high heat, keeping it there until it reaches a rolling boil.


Before boiling the water, make sure that you have enough water in your saucepan to melt the honey. Place the jar inside the saucepan and check the water level. The level of water should approximately match the level of honey inside the jar.







, After the water reaches a steady boil, remove it from the stove and set it down on a heat-resistant surface.


Alternatively, you can keep the water on the stove and reduce the heat to low. Before placing the jar of honey in the water, though, you need to make sure that all simmering stops. Hot temperatures will not make the honey inedible, but temperatures above 110 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees Celsius) can destroy some of the beneficial health properties of the honey.







, Sit the jar of honey directly on the bottom of the pan so that it is now surrounded on all sides by hot water.


If you are using a lid, make sure that the lid is on very loose. You want to prevent water from getting inside while allowing air to escape. If you tighten the lid too much, pressure could build up inside of the jar and cause the glass to crack.







, Periodically remove the lid and stir the honey while the jar is still sitting inside the hot water. This can help the honey melt more evenly and at a quicker pace.


Continue doing this until the honey melts. If you are trying to melt crystallized granules out, keep at it until you no longer see any crystals left. If you are trying to melt thick, raw honey, continue melting it in the hot water until it thins to the consistency of store-bought honey.






This process can take a long time depending on how much honey you have. Expect to wait anywhere from 20 to 60 minutes.







, When done, remove the jar from the water and dry it off with a clean dish towel. Tighten the lid on securely and store the honey at room temperature until you are ready to use it.


The ideal storage temperature is 50 to 70 degrees Fahrenheit (10 to 21 degrees Celsius).At colder temperatures, the honey will begin to crystallize. You should also keep the honey away from hot, moist conditions for similar reasons.






Make sure that the lid is airtight. Otherwise, the honey can lose moisture and start to crystallize again.

Melt the butter.,
Whisk in the flour.,
Gradually add the broth.,
Season the gravy.,
Serve.",How to Make Gravy Without Drippings1," Place the butter in a large saucepan and set it over medium heat. Allow the butter to melt completely.To help the butter melt faster, cut it into six to eight chunks before tossing it into the saucepan.
Rotate the saucepan as needed to spread the butter evenly across the bottom.;
, Sprinkle the flour evenly over the melted butter, then quickly and continually whisk the two ingredients together.


Add the flour gradually to prevent any of it from burning or clumping together.
After combining all of the flour and butter, continue whisking for another 1 or 2 minutes. Prolonged exposure to heat should ""cook out"" the raw flour taste and give the resulting gravy better flavor.

, Pour the broth or stock into the saucepan, whisking well and continually after each addition.Use chicken or turkey broth to create a gravy for poultry dishes, or beef broth to create a classic beef gravy. For a generic brown gravy, consider using two parts beef broth and one part chicken broth.
Continue cooking the gravy until the mixture bubbles. Once it bubbles, it should also thicken to the right consistency.

, Sprinkle the gravy with black pepper and chopped parsley, if desired. Mix well to combine.


Adjust the amount of each seasoning to taste.
Since canned broth is usually quite salty, extra salt usually isn't needed. You can add some to the gravy if desired, however.

, Remove the pan from the stove and serve the gravy while it's still hot.


If you aren't ready to serve it yet but plan to do so soon, keep the pan on the stove over very low heat until the rest of the meal is ready. Stir the gravy occasionally.
If you won't be ready to use the gravy soon, pour it into an airtight container and refrigerate it. Simmer it on the stove until heated through prior to serving.

Use honey in barbecue sauce.",How to Sweeten Foods with Honey," For a sweet snack, try drizzling some honey over fruit. This will give your fruit a slightly sweeter taste. Apple slices with honey, for example, can be a great treat.If you normally eat dessert, try to replace your dessert with honey and fruit. This will satisfy your sweet tooth in a healthy fashion.
Make sure to only use a little honey. As fruit is already sweet, a little bit goes a long way. Have your fruit coated in small drops of honey rather than lathered in it.;
, If you want a frosting or glaze for something like cupcakes or cake, avoid using glazes made with powdered sugar. Instead, drizzle some honey over your baked goods and then spread it around. This will lessen the amount you need, as pure honey is sweeter than sugar-based glazes, and lessen the amount of cane sugar a recipe uses.This works best if you apply the glaze as soon as you take an item out of the oven.

, If you usually reach for sugary snacks in the morning, use honey on your breakfast food instead. Honey can add sweetness to basic breakfast foods, minimizing your need to eat sugary meals at breakfast.If you, say, normally have toast with cinnamon and sugar, use honey instead.
You can also squirt a small amount of honey over low-sugar, healthy types of cereal.
If you're an oatmeal eater, use honey instead of brown sugar to sweeten your oatmeal.

, If you dislike black coffee or tea, a little honey can help.You should wait until your coffee or tea is cool enough to sip before adding the honey.Remember, honey is very sweet. Only a few drops are necessary.

, If you enjoy a healthy smoothie rich in fruits and vegetables, do not sweeten it using sugary beverages. Instead of adding half a cup of orange juice, for example, swap out the orange juice for water and add a squirt of honey. This should result in a sweet-tasting, healthy smoothie without the added calories and sugar., If you're swapping honey for sugar in a baking recipe, you should reduce the amount of honey. Honey is sweeter than sugar, and replacing half a cup of sugar with a half a cup of honey will result in your baked good tasting too sweet.In general, for every one cup of sugar, use 1/2 to 2/3 of a cup of honey.
Use your best judgment when adding honey. If your baked good tastes a little bland after adding half a cup, for example, add a bit more until you get the flavor you want.

, Honey is a liquid, so it will affect the ratios of your baked goods. Liquids, such as oils and milks, should be reduced to make room for the honey. In general, subtract a quarter cup of other liquids for every cup of honey you use., Even if a recipe does not call for it, baking soda is necessary if you're substituting honey in baked goods. Honey is acidic. Baking soda will help counteract the acidic effect, allowing your baked goods to rise properly., Honey caramelizes and burns faster than table sugar. Lower the temperature in your oven when cooking with honey to prevent baked goods from burning. When cooking with honey, reduce the regular baking temperature by 25 degrees., For a more savory use of honey, you can sweeten up regular mustard slightly using honey. A honey mustard sauce can add a bit of sweetness to things like sandwiches, hamburgers, and hot dogs.A quarter cup of mustard, a tablespoon of honey, and a teaspoon of mayonnaise can be blended to make a basic honey mustard.

, To make a sweet spread for toast in the morning, make a simple honey butter spread. Simply use an electronic mixer to whip a stick of butter with three to four tablespoons of honey.If you want to cut back on sugar intake in general, go for a smaller amount of money.

, A healthy, semi-sweet peanut dip can be used as a dipping sauce for veggies. Thin peanut butter with a small amount of hot water to start.Mix in some honey to give the sauce the sweet bite.
From there, add flavors like hot sauce, garlic, soy sauce, red pepper flakes, and Asian chili sauce until you get your desired taste.

, Barbecue sauce is a great, semi-sweet sauce you can make using a little honey. All you need to do is mix a quarter cup of honey with a small can of tomato paste.You can then add a few teaspoons of powdered mustard.
Mix in Worcestershire sauce until you reach your desired taste.

Place the honey in a microwave-safe container.,
Microwave on medium power.Place the container of honey in your microwave.,
Stir the honey.,
Store melted honey at room temperature.",How to Melt Honey2," A thick glass container, like a glass canning jar, is usually a safe choice. Spoon the honey you need to melt into the container.


It is best to check the container to verify that it is microwave-safe before using it. Typically, this information is labeled on the bottom of the container.






Never use a metal container.






Plastic containers are debatable. Many are marked as being microwave-safe, but there is some evidence that chemicals from plastic can leech into the contents of the container when heated.







, Set the power to 50 percent, then microwave the honey for 30 to 40 seconds.


The exact amount of time can vary based on how powerful your microwave is and how much honey you have inside the container.






Keep an eye on the honey as it melts inside the microwave. If it appears fully melted before the full amount of time passes, stop the microwave and remove the container.







, Carefully remove the container of honey from the microwave. Stir the honey with a spoon to distribute the heat. If some of the honey has not yet melted, return the container to the microwave and heat for another 20 seconds at medium power.


Repeat this process as needed. Heat the honey in 20-second intervals at 50-percent power, stirring after each interval, until the honey melts.






If you are trying to decrystallize honey, stop heating it once you can no longer spot any crystals. If you only want to melt honey to a thinner consistency, simply stop heating it once it has become thin enough for your liking.







, Pour the melted honey into an airtight storage container. Store that container in a dry, room temperature location until you need to use the honey.


The ideal temperature range is between 50 and 70 degrees Fahrenheit (10 and 21 degrees Celsius). Colder and hotter temperatures can speed up the crystallization process. Moist conditions should also be avoided.






The container must be an airtight one if you want to prevent moisture loss and crystallization.

Mix a little water into the honey.,
Store in the refrigerator.,
Finished.

",How to Melt Honey3," Spoon some honey into a small jar or dish. Add fresh water to the honey, 1 Tbsp (15 ml) at a time, mixing after each addition. Continue until the honey reaches your desired consistency.No heat is required for this method.






Since you aren't actually melting the honey in this process, you cannot use this method to decrystallize hardened honey.
In addition to thinning out the honey, water will also dilute the taste.
The exact amount of water you need will depend on how thin you want the honey to be and how strong you want the flavor to remain. Typically, though, you will not want to exceed a ratio of equal parts honey to water., While undiluted honey is best stored at room temperature, a honey syrup like this is best stored in the refrigerator. This thinned out honey will only last for about three weeks, though.


After three weeks pass, the honey will start to lose its flavor and may show signs of crystallizing.
Store this thin honey syrup in an airtight container to prevent moisture loss.

Pour in the broth.,
Whisk in the brandy, if desired.,
Add the cream.,
Season the gravy.,
Strain, if necessary.,
Serve.",How to Make Gravy Without Drippings2," Add the butter to a large saucepan and set it over medium-low heat. Allow the butter to completely melt.


Cutting the butter into smaller chunks can help it melt faster.
Occasionally turn the saucepan as the butter melts. Doing so should spread the butter over the bottom of the pan more evenly.

, Add the chopped onion to the melted butter. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 12 to 15 minutes or until the onions are lightly browned.If you're in a hurry, you can increase the heat to medium and shorten the cook time to about 5 to 8 minutes. You should not increase the heat beyond that, however, since doing so may burn the onions.
Adding onions to the gravy base will add more flavor, which is especially important when you aren't working with pan drippings.

, Sprinkle the flour over the onions and butter. Quickly and completely whisk it into the contents of the pan.


After the flour has absorbed the remaining butter, continue cooking for another 1 to 2 minutes so that the heat can remove the raw flour taste.

, Gradually pour the broth into the saucepan, whisking continuously to combine. Cook for another 4 to 5 minutes, or until the gravy bubbles and thickens.If you haven't done so already, increase the heat to medium.
Note that you can use any broth for this recipe. You can even combine broths to create a more complex flavor. For instance, using two parts beef broth and one part chicken broth can create an appetizing brown gravy suitable for potatoes and other side dishes.

, If you want to further deepen the flavor profile of the gravy, add the brandy. Stir well to combine and cook for another 2 or 3 minutes.


The heat should break down the alcohol while you cook it, leaving only the flavor behind.

, Remove the gravy from the heat and pour in the cream or milk. Whisk well to combine.


It's best to use room temperature or slightly warmed dairy to prevent it from curdling once it touches the hot gravy.
Continue whisking until the gravy takes on an even coloration.

, Sprinkle the gravy with ground black pepper, to taste, then stir to combine.


Since most broths are already quite salty, you probably won't need to add any salt, but you may still do so if you prefer gravies with stronger, saltier tastes.

, You can serve the gravy as it is, but if you don't want chunks of onion in it, strain out the onions by pouring the gravy through a strainer.


Choose a strainer with medium holes. Fine mesh strainers will also work, but you may need to force the thick liquid gravy through these tiny holes using a spatula.

, Enjoy the gravy while it's still hot.


If you need to keep it warm, set the saucepan back on the stove over very low heat and whisk it occasionally until you're ready to use it.
You can refrigerate leftovers in an airtight container, but you'll need to heat them on the stove again prior to use.

Combine the water and cornstarch.,
Melt the butter.,
Add the shallot.,
Whisk in the flour.,
Gradually pour in the broth.,
Whisk in the cornstarch slurry.,
Season the gravy.,
Serve.",How to Make Gravy Without Drippings3," Whisk the two ingredients together in a small bowl until the cornstarch dissolves, forming a thick slurry. Set the dish aside.


Cornstarch and flour are both thickeners, but cornstarch also gives thickened liquids a mild gloss, while flour alone can leave gravies looking dull. Since cornstarch is sensitive to prolonged cooking, however, you'll need to use both cornstarch and flour as thickeners in this recipe.

, Toss the butter into a large saucepan and set it over medium to medium-high heat. Let the butter melt completely.Cutting the butter into smaller pieces prior to adding it may help the butter melt faster.
Spread the melted butter over the entire bottom of the pan by shifting the pan as it melts.

, Toss the chopped shallots into the melted butter. Cook, stirring frequently, for 30 to 60 seconds or until the shallots become notably fragrant.


Shallots have a mild, sweet onion taste that is also somewhat reminiscent of garlic. If you don't have any, you can use 1/4 cup (60 ml) chopped sweet onion or 2 large, minced garlic cloves. You may also omit the ingredient completely, but doing so will result in less flavorful gravy.

, Sprinkle the flour over the contents of the pan. Cook, whisking continually, for about 5 minutes or until the roux looks golden brown.


You need to cook the flour roux for at least 1 minute after the flour absorbs the remaining butter; otherwise, the gravy may retain some bitterness from the taste of raw flour.

, Pour the broth into the seasoned roux, whisking constantly to combine. Bring the mixture to a boil while you continue whisking.


You can use nearly any broth for this recipe, including beef, chicken, or turkey. To create a generic brown gravy, consider using two parts beef gravy and one part chicken gravy., Once the gravy is at a boil, pour in the cornstarch slurry and whisk well. Continue simmering the gravy for another 3 to 5 minutes, or until it thickens.


Note that the water and cornstarch may separate as the slurry sits, so you may need to quickly stir the slurry before mixing it into the gravy.

, Sprinkle the gravy with black pepper, as desired, and mix to combine.


Most commercial broths are fairly salty, so you probably won't need to add any extra salt. If you choose to do so anyway, add the salt in small amounts and taste the gravy in between each addition.

, For the best flavor and texture, serve the gravy immediately, while it's still hot.


You can keep the gravy warm by setting it on the stove over very low heat, but try to use it within the next 15 to 20 minutes. Cornstarch can break down when exposed to prolonged heat, and if that happens, the gravy will become thinner.
Refrigerate any leftovers and reheat them on the stove prior to use. Whisk the gravy well to work out any congealed lumps.

For healthier sauce, try using Miracle Whip, or low-fat version mayo.;
, Looking for a little extra flavor in your fry sauce? Mix things up with some salt, pepper, and a little vinegar for an added punch. Because there is vinegar, a common ingredient in ketchup, you actually need less of the red stuff. In a bowl, mix the following ingredients well:


1/4 cup mayonnaise
2 tablespoons ketchup
1 teaspoon vinegar
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon sea salt, In order to get a little heat in your life, throw in a dash (1-2 tablespoons) of your favorite hot sauce., The base of most barbecue sauces, tomato paste and vinegar, are the same basic ingredients as ketchup.

2 tablespoons mayonnaise
1/4 cup white sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon paprika
1/4 teaspoon ground mustard
1/2 teaspoon onion powder

Melt the butter in a small saucepan.,
Crush the garlic.,
Add the garlic to the butter.,
Stir in the dried herbs.,
Serve warm.",How to Make Garlic Sauce1," Add the butter to a small saucepan and heat over medium to medium-high until it melts.


The butter should be completely melted, but avoid letting it boil or smoke. Both reactions indicate that the fat has begun to break down, which could affect the taste of the finished sauce.;
, Crush an unpeeled garlic clove with the flat end of a large kitchen knife. Remove the peel after you crush the garlic clove.Place the garlic cloves on your chopping board one at a time. Position the flat side of the knife over the garlic clove and give the other flat side a firm, forceful smack with the palm or heel of your hand. The garlic should now be crushed.
Discard the skin. Sprinkle a little salt on the cutting board to soak up any juices and roughly chop the garlic into small pieces using the sharp edge of your knife.

, Place the crushed garlic into the hot, melted butter and cook, stirring continuously, until the garlic begins to turn light brown.


The garlic should also take on a stronger scent once it has cooked long enough.
This is a quick process and will usually take no longer than 1 or 2 minutes.
Watch the garlic carefully as you cook it. Garlic can burn rapidly, and once the garlic burns, the taste of the sauce will be ruined. You will not be able to salvage the sauce and will need to start over if this happens.

, Add the basil and oregano to the sauce and stir until evenly distributed and heated through.


If working with fresh herbs instead of dried herbs, multiply the amount added by a factor of 3. In other words, you would use 2 Tbsp (30 ml) basil and 3 Tbsp (45 ml) oregano.

, This sauce is best when used immediately.


This sauce tastes great when drizzled over pasta, rice, potatoes, chicken, and fish.

Boil for 15 minutes.,
Swirl in the butter.,
Serve warm.",How to Make Garlic Sauce2," Place the saucepan on your stove and set the eye to high heat.


Only turn on the heat once you are ready to press onto the next step. If you let the garlic and shallots sit in a dry, hot saucepan for too long, they may end up burning.

, Pour the two liquids into the saucepan and stir well to combine them with each other and with the other ingredients.


Add the ingredients quickly, before the pan has a chance to fully heat up. If you add the ingredients after the pan has already become hot, the shallots and garlic may burn, and the liquid ingredients may end up splattering as you pour them in.

, Stir the sauce occasionally to prevent any of the solid ingredients from sticking to the bottom or burning.


Leave the saucepan uncovered for the duration of the cooking process.

, Add the butter and gently combine it into the other ingredients by stirring the sauce with a whisk.


Remove from the heat as soon as the butter has finished melting.
After removing the saucepan from the heat, continue whisking the sauce. The butter must be completely and thoroughly combined, so you should see no streaks of butter appearing throughout the sauce as you stir it.

, This sauce is best served warm and fresh.


This is another sauce that works great when spooned over potatoes, pasta, rice, chicken, fish, veal, or pork chops.

Chop the pepper and garlic.,
Combine the peppers, garlic, vinegar, and salt in a small saucepan.,
Simmer for 10 minutes.,
Blend the contents of the saucepan.,
Let cool slightly.,
Refrigerate for 3 days before serving.",How to Make Garlic Sauce3," Place the bell peppers, spicy peppers, and garlic on a cutting board and chop the ingredients roughly into small pieces.


Consider sprinkling the cutting board with a little salt before chopping your peppers and garlic. The salt will help absorb some of the liquid, so the flavors will not be lost.
Good spicy peppers for this recipe include habanero peppers and fresno peppers. If you decide to use tiny tepin chili peppers, double the amount to about 8 chiles.

, Bring the ingredients to a boil over high heat.


Stir the ingredients occasionally as they come up to a boil, but do not stir constantly, since doing so may make it more difficult for the contents of the pan to heat up.

, Reduce the heat to medium and cook at a gentle simmer, stirring occasionally.


Resist the urge to stand above the saucepan and get a big whiff of the sauce as it cooks. The hot peppers in this recipe can actually burn your eyes and nose if you come into direct contact with the smoke they produce.

, Pour the thick, chunky sauce into a blender and blend for a full 10 seconds at a low to medium speed.


Alternatively, you could pulse the sauce for a few seconds at a time until you come up with a consistency you prefer.
As another alternative, you could use a submersion blender to thin out the sauce instead of a traditional blender. Place the submersion blender directly into the saucepan and blend the contents until you reach your desired consistency.

, Allow the sauce to cool to room temperature before you transfer it to a glass jar for storage.


If you put hot sauce into a glass jar and refrigerate it immediately, the glass is more likely to shatter.

, After 3 days, the flavors should have settled, leading to a more blended and improved hot garlic sauce.


This garlic sauce goes great with a wide variety of foods, from eggs to burgers and rice to chips.
You can store this sauce sealed and refrigerated for several weeks to a couple of months.

, Stir the ingredients, coating them in oil, and fry gently until they begin to soften.


This should only take about 2 to 3 minutes.
Watch the garlic carefully as you cook it. Garlic burns relatively easily, and once it burns, the flavor of your sauce can be ruined.

, Decrease the heat to medium and cook the sauce mixture until it thickens and reduces by roughly three quarters.


This, too, will only take about 2 to 3 minutes.
Once reduced, add a dash of salt and a dash of black pepper, to taste, and stir the seasonings in well.

, Remove the sauce mixture from the heat and let it cool until it becomes cool enough to touch.


The sauce may need to cool for 5 to 10 minutes before you can transfer it to your blender.

, Pour half of the thick, chunky sauce into a blender and blend at a high speed for 10 to 20 seconds. Gradually add the remaining 3/4 cup (190 ml) of cooking oil as you blend the ingredients together.


The consistency should be smooth and thin. If the garlic sauce is clumpy in some parts but runny in others, the oil may not have blended in correctly. Continue blending the sauce longer until this imbalance evens out.

, Add the liquified sauce back the the skillet of chunky sauce. Stir well and let cool completely.


The flavors will settle as the sauce cools, so even if you plan to use it immediately for a hot dish, you should still let it cool first before using it.

, You can serve the sauce immediately or pour it into a glass jar and store it for two weeks.


This garlic sauce works especially well when served with shellfish, in stir-fries, or with Chinese-inspired dishes.

Use small serving bowls if you want to present the sauce as an optional dipper.For example, you may want to serve multiple dipping sauces, such as ginger scallion sauce in one ramekin and soy sauce in another.

, Add a seafood or meat to your meal. Make a tasty pairing using noodles or rice, with or without meat. You can also add this sauce to vegetables.For example, try ginger scallion sauce with poached chicken, pan-seared duck, or steamed fish.
Try this sauce with a tossed salad or roasted cauliflower. If you like spiciness, put some red jalapeno pepper or sriracha on the side.

, Compliment ginger scallion sauce with a red wine. Choose a fruity wine with a rich flavor that isn’t heavily tannic. For a non-alcoholic beverage, try a dressed-up sparkling water.For example, try an Australian Grenache.
For sparkling water, try adding mint leaves, lime, and honey to taste. All of these flavors blend well with ginger.

, Yes, it stinks, but it is necessary to bring the vinegar to a higher temperature to avoid cracking the glass.

, Doing this will maintain the cleanliness of the infusing. Chopping the ingredients will allow juices and aromas to flow from the greater surface area and flavor the vinegar.

, After allowing the glass to cool for five minutes, place your ingredients in your jar and pour the vinegar on top. Make sure not to burn yourself from the vinegar or glass.

, Put on the lid and stow it on a shelf for 2 weeks to 2 months. For some herbs it's better to let it sit longer to get the full flavor into the infusion.

, Using a funnel or cheesecloth, pour the aged infusion into a dispenser bottle or another container. Use the cheesecloth to filter out any sediment. You may want to leave some, not all, of the spices in. Dried herbs is a good one for this.

, Mix with your favorite oil and shake it liberally onto your salad or other dish.

Consider white balsamic vinegar.",How to Buy a Good Balsamic Vinegar,"


Balsamic vinegar comes in 3 distinct types. The first is the authentic and traditionally made balsamic vinegar. It is labeled as Aceto Balsamico Tradizionale. No other vinegars are allowed to bear that name. It is the most expensive of the 3, and prices vary by the age of the product. A 12 year aged vinegar could cost as much as $100.00 USD for 3.4 fl. oz. (100 ml), while a 25 year aged product could sell for $400.00 USD for the same tiny amount.
Commercial grade balsamic vinegars are the second, and most common, type of balsamic vinegar. This vinegar is usually a combination of wine vinegar and additives to artificially simulate the taste and texture of the traditional product. Coloring, thickeners and caramel can all be added. There is no aging for this product, and it is very affordable and easy to find in your supermarket.
Condimento grade balsamic vinegar is usually a combination of the traditionally made product and the mass produced vinegar. This product can be made in a variety of ways. It can be made in the traditional way but aged for less than 12 years. Or, it can follow the traditional process but be made outside of Modena or Reggio Emilia, so it cannot be labeled as a more expensive product. More often, however, it is made using a combination of an unaged, but traditionally made product, combined with grape juice to dilute it.;
,


There is little point in using the most expensive balsamic vinegar in a salad dressing. Therefore, choosing the appropriate vinegar for your use is important. If you want a good product for salad dressings, then a high-end commercial product with few added ingredients is a good choice.
Gourmets and foodies might find the condimento grade balsamic a good choice. It works splendidly in a dressing, but equally well as an ingredient in other dishes. It can be reduced to a syrupy consistency that can mock the texture, if not taste, of the aged product.
If you are out to impress or you just want the best of the best, then pick up a bottle of the aged vinegar. Use it sparingly. It is a great topping for artisan ice cream, for dipping strawberries, or for a full umami flavor explosion, top slivers of Parmesan Reggiano with a drop of balsamic, then chew slowly.

,


While not an authentic balsamic vinegar, white balsamic vinegar has become recently widely available. It is a light colored vinegar that is used in place of regular balsamic when discoloration is undesirable. White balsamic is made from combining white wine vinegar with white grape must, and then cooked slowly. It is not generally aged.

Measure out everything before beginning.,
Melt 3 tablespoons butter in a small saucepan.,
Sprinkle in 3 tablespoons of white flour, whisking constantly.,
Add your 2 cups of warmed liquid slowly and bring to a boil.,
Lower the heat after boiling and let simmer until your desired thickness.,
Season the gravy to taste.,
Serve while still warm.",How to Make Brown Gravy1," If you have to leave something on the stove to measure an ingredient it could over-thicken or burn quickly. Have everything you need ready and measured ahead of time:


3 tablespoons butter
3 tablespoons flour
2 cups warmed liquid (chicken/beef/vegetable stock, condensed beef broth)
Salt and pepper to taste

Optional: 1/2 teaspoon Kitchen Bouquet, onion/garlic powder, paprika.;
, Melt the butter on medium heat, stirring occasionally to prevent burning. Once it is completely liquefied, move on.


You'll be mixing flour into the butter and you do not want any chunks, as this will lead to a lumpy gravy. Whisking flour and hot butter together is the basis of a ""roux.""

, Stir continuously until the mixture becomes smooth. It is often easiest to add the flour 1 tablespoon at a time, using your whisk to quickly break up chunks and smooth out the sauce. You should notice it thickening.


The longer you cook the flour, the darker and richer it will get. For a light gravy, move on as it turns tan. For a rich brown gravy, keep stirring and cook for an extra 3-5 minutes.
Butter and flour give the gravy its thick, rich base. You can add more of both for a richer, thicker gravy, keeping the 2 cups of liquid the same, but keep the ratio of flour and butter equal., Warm the liquid up in a separate pot or in the microwave before adding it. Only pour it in 1/4 cup at a time, whisking it in well before adding the next bit. You don't want to cause any rapid temperature changes in your gravy.There are a lot of options for liquids here, and it all depends on the meal you are serving. Traditionally, brown gravy has a beef base (which gives it its color), made with either beef bouillon and water or beef broth. Some other options include:


2 cups beef stock.
1 can condensed beef broth.
You can also mix in some milk or water for a lighter gravy, but keep the ratios (2 cups total) the same.

, As soon as the gravy starts to boil, lower the heat and let it simmer until it is as thick as you want it.


The gravy will also thicken a bit as it cools, so take it off the stove 1-2 minutes before your desired consistency.

, Add a pinch of salt and pepper as it simmers, as well as any other flavorings your desire. 1/2 teaspoon of Kitchen Bouquet, a browning and seasoning mixture common in many gravies, is a great way to get ""classic"" gravy flavor and coloring. Other options include:


1/2 teaspoon garlic and/or onion powder
1/2 teaspoon paprika
1/2 teaspoon fresh thyme and rosemary
Dash of Worcestershire sauce., Either pour over meat slices directly before serving or pour into a small serving jug and place on the table for diners to serve themselves from.

Measure out ingredients as your meat finishes roasting.,
Remove the roast from the oven and set aside the meat.,
Strain the fat out from the liquid.,
Heat the fat on the stove on medium heat.,
Deglaze the pan with a splash of cool liquid and a whisk.,
Whisk in 2 tablespoons (29.6 ml) of flour, one at a time.,
Add the 2 cups of warmed liquid slowly and whisk well.,
Cook over medium-low heat for 10-15 minutes, or until desired thickness.,
Season the gravy as it thickens.,
Consider straining the gravy before serving.,
Serve warmed.",How to Make Brown Gravy2," The best gravy is made from pan drippings -- the juices and fats that come off the meat as it finishes roasting. This could be a beef roast, a chicken, or a turkey. When the meat has a few minutes to go, get your other ingredients out and ready to mix into your gravy:


2 tablespoons flour or cornstarch
2 cups pre-warmed liquid (chicken/beef/vegetable stock, water, milk)
Salt and pepper to taste

, All roasts need to ""stand"" for 5-10 minutes before being cut up, so you have a little time to make your gravy. Tent the meat by placing foil loosely over the top and set it aside on a cutting board while you attend to the pan drippings.

, Using a fine mesh sieve, separate the fat from the liquid. Save both. The fat will function just like the butter used for a basic gravy, mixing with the flour to form a roux.


For quicker gravy, you can skip this step and simply heat up 2 tablespoons of drippings. However, the chunks of fat will lead to a lumpier, potentially less flavorful, gravy., They should still be warm, but this is especially important if you've moved the drippings to another pan. However, you can also just make the gravy in your roasting pan as well. Simply put the metal pan over two burners on the stove, add the fat back in, and heat up both burners.

, Use a splash of red wine, water, or stock and then scrape up any brown bits of meat and juice from the bottom of the pan. As soon as you add the liquid you'll likely get a loud sizzle, and you need to work quickly with a whisk or spatula to scrape up all the stuff on the bottom of the pan.


Deglazing is when you use a cool liquid to clean a hot pan, removing the flavorful, caramelized bits and adding them to your sauce or gravy., Using a wire whisk, add the flour slowly with one hand while whisking with the other. You want to make a smooth, consistent sauce. Keep whisking until you've removed all the lumps.

, Lower the heat to medium-low and pour in your liquid 1/4 cup at a time. Whisk it in, removing lumps, then add the next 1/4 cup. Start by using the strained pan juices, then move on to other liquids if you don't have 2 cups worth. Traditionally you use stock or broth, either chicken, beef, of vegetable, but creamy gravies can use milk or heavy cream for a richer sauce. You can also combine them, using a cup of each. Whatever you use as a liquid, be sure to warm it in a separate pan or in the microwave first.


If your gravy seems a little watery, add 1 tablespoon butter or fat and another pinch of flour and whisk well.

, Stir occasionally, and let the gravy simmer as it thickens. Remember, however, that all gravies will thicken as they cool, so remove it 1-2 minutes before your desired consistency.

, Because it is made from pan juices, the gravy will likely have a similar flavor profile as the meat that provided the base. You can add a light mixture of these same spices to help your gravy compliment the rest of the meal, or you can customize it with a variety of spices, such as:


1 teaspoon of green herbs, like thyme, sage, tarragon, rosemary, parsley, or chives.
1 teaspoon cayenne, paprika, crushed red pepper, dried mustard powder, onion and/or garlic powder.
1/2 teaspoon Kitchen Bouquet or Worcestershire sauce for brown coloring.
Salt and pepper, to taste., Though not strictly necessary, you can run the gravy through a sieve before serving to remove lumps and chunks of meat. Simply pour the gravy into a sieve placed over a metal bowl, then use your wooden spoon to push it through the mesh and into the serving bowl. This leads to a restaurant quality, smoother sauce.

, Lower the heat to low and cover if you need to prepare the rest of the meal, then serve in a dish or poured directly on top of meat. Cool gravy will thicken and congeal, and is generally unappetizing.

, Thoroughly combine these dry ingredients in a medium bowl using a whisk or fork. Do not pack the ingredients down as you mix.


For best results, spoon the flour into your measuring cup and level it off with the back of a kitchen knife. Avoid scooping the flour directly into the cup, since doing so will pack the flour down and cause you to gather too much flour.

, Use a pastry blender to cut the two ingredients into the flour mixture until coarse crumbs form.


If you do not have a pastry blender, you can use a butter knife. Cut the shortening and butter with the knife, tossing the pieces about in the flour mixture as you work.
Work quickly so that the butter does not melt.

, Use your hands or the back of a spoon to form a well in the flour mixture. Slowly pour the buttermilk into the well all at once. Stir with a spoon to combine.


Only stir long enough to moisten the dough. It should be neither sticky nor dry; instead, it should be fairly tacky.
If the dough seems too dry, add 1 to 2 Tbsp (15 to 30 ml) of additional buttermilk to moisten it.

, Gently fold the dough over itself two or three times using your hands. Shape into a rough piece roughly 3/4-inch (2-cm) thick.


Lightly flour your hands before handling the dough to prevent it from sticking to your skin.
If you decide to use a rolling pin, lightly flour the rolling pin before bringing it into contact with the dough.

, Use a 2-inch (5-cm) round biscuit cutter, dipped in flour, to cup the dough into rounds. Arrange these rounds on your prepared baking sheet, placing them 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) apart.


You could use the rim of a glass in the absence of a biscuit cutter or cookie cutter.
Dip the biscuit cutter in flour in between cuttings to prevent the dough from sticking.
Press straight down with the biscuit cutter. Do not twist the cutter as you form the biscuits.
Leaving space in between the biscuits will give them crunchy sides. For soft sides, place them together so that they just barely touch.

Continue whisking over low heat until the gravy begins to thicken notably.

, Pour roughly 2 cups (500 ml) of beef stock or beef broth into the saucepan, whisking it in gradually yet thoroughly.


Alternate back and forth between adding stock and whisking it in. You should be able to maintain the consistency fairly well if you add the stock gradually.
If the gravy starts to become thinner than you would prefer, stop adding the stock and let simmer, stirring frequently, to evaporate some of the liquid off.
This step will take at least 5 minutes.
You could also use water, milk, cream, or some combination of liquids instead of the stock.

, Sprinkle the seasonings into the gravy and give a quick stir to incorporate them into the liquid.

Remove the roux from heat.,
Store the roux.",How to Make a Roux1," The fat you use to make a roux greatly impacts its flavor. Using bacon drippings creates a smoky, salty base for the dish you're making. Butter adds richness, and shortening and other types of oil tend to create a lighter flavor. Use the fat recommended in the recipe you're using, or if it's not specified, consider these options:









Use bacon or pork drippings to make a roux you'll be using for gumbo or another dish that will have smoky elements like sausage.
Use butter to make a roux you'll be using for a creamy soup, such as a chowder. This is also a good choice if you're making a roux for macaroni and cheese.
Shortening makes a good roux base for lighter gratin dishes, since it doesn't have an overwhelming flavor.;
, Use a cast iron skillet or another heavy frying pan. Place the pan over medium heat and add the fat. Let the fat heat until it has just melted. If you're using oil, let it heat for just about 2 minutes.







, Place the flour in the skillet with the fat. Use a whisk to begin stirring the mixture constantly. Use the whisk to break up any lumps in the flour and distribute it evenly through the melted fat.









If you want a thicker, past-like roux, add an extra 1/4 cup of flour.
For a thinner, more liquid roux, reduce the flour by 1/4 cup.

, Continue whisking the roux constantly while it cooks. The mixture will begin to thin and darken after several minutes. Continue cooking it until it has the color and consistency you need for your recipe.









Some recipes call for a blond roux. In a blond roux, the roux mixture turns to a light golden color and has a mild flavor. It's usually ready after about 8 minutes.
You might see a recipe that calls for a dark roux, also called a chocolate roux. It can take about 60 minutes to achieve this color. Some people find it easier to start the roux on the stove and finish cooking it an over heated to 325 degrees., When the roux has reached the color and texture you want, remove it from heat. It's now ready for you to use in the recipe you're following.








, If you want to use the roux later, place it in a food storage container and keep it covered in the refrigerator. It will harden as it cools, but it will melt when you add heat. You can scoop out as much as you need on a recipe-by-recipe basis.

Roasting is a cooking method whereby cuts of meat are cooked in an oven in a dry environment, meaning there is little or no liquid added to the cooking vessel. This results in a juicy and moist cut of meat, provided you select the right cut of beef to roast. The best cuts are those with little or no connective tissue and plenty of fat or marbling. Some good candidates for roasting are: rib roasts, sirloin tip roasts, tri-tip roast and the tenderloin.;
,


Searing the roast is the first step in creating flavor in the gravy. Pat the roast dry with paper towels, season it with salt and pepper, then add 2 tbsp. (30 ml) of oil to a heavy bottomed steel pan or pot. Let the oil become very hot. Using tongs, add the meat to the pan and let it sear until dark brown but not burned. Turn the meat and continue this process until all sides have been seared.

,


Aromatic vegetables such as garlic, onion, celery and carrots are needed to build a flavor base for roast beef gravy. While your pan is still hot, add peeled and coarsely cut vegetables to the pan and stir them until lightly browned and aromatic.

,


Using a 1/2 cup (120 ml) of red or white wine or chicken or beef stock to the pan and stir it around to loosen any bits stuck to the bottom. Let this reduce until only a few spoonfuls remain, then pour this into your roasting pan.

,


Spread the vegetables out on the bottom of the roasting pan. Set the beef on top of the pan and cook the beef until it has reached your level of desired doneness.

,


When cooked, remove the beef from the roasting pan and set it aside to rest. This will allow the juices to redistribute and it won't make a mess when cutting. Add any accumulated juices to the roasting pan.

,, (30 ml) of all purpose flour to the vegetable mash and stir it around.

Add 2 cups (480 ml) of beef stock, water that you cooked vegetables or potatoes in, or even plain water, to the vegetable mash. Stir it to combine. Set the roasting pan on the stove over a medium high heat. Stir constantly until the mixture boils and begins to thicken.

,


Once the gravy has thickened and boiled for 1 to 2 minutes, turn the heat off and set a sieve over a bowl. Pour the mash into the sieve and gently press down to extract as much gravy from the mashed vegetables as possible. Discard the mashed vegetables.

Make a more complex marinade.",How to Cook with Apple Cider Vinegar2," With a knife and cutting board, dice up two cloves of garlic. Make sure that you chop the garlic very finely. You do not want large chunks of garlic in your dressing.For a less intense flavor, you might consider using shallots.

, In a medium-sized bowl, combine all of the ingredients. Then whisk them together. Make sure that you combine the oil and vinegar thoroughly. Taste the dressing and add more salt and pepper if needed., Lightly pour some of the dressing on your leafy salad. This dressing pairs well with most leafy greens, particularly kale or arugula. In addition, apple slices and fresh walnuts also go well with the dressing., After whisking everything together, let the marinade sit for about thirty minutes, stirring occasionally. Once it is set, add your meats and veggies and let it marinate for a few hours. You can leave it all in the same bowl that you mixed it in and simply cover it up, or you can place the meat, veggies, and marinade in a large freezer bag. Finally, cook the meat and veggies.

With marinades, you can substitute apple cider vinegar for wine or balsamic vinegar. It balances out the savory flavors of the meats and vegetables with a hint of tang and sweetness.

, If you want to add some extra flavor to your marinade, consider including some additional ingredients. These can be things like Worcestershire sauce, soy sauce, hot sauce, red pepper flakes, onion flakes, or garlic powder. Particularly with chicken and pork, these ingredients will make the meat more flavorful."

Firm up a poached egg.",How to Cook with Apple Cider Vinegar3," Vinegar is a common ingredient in many desserts. Because it creates carbon dioxide bubbles when it reacts with baking soda, bakers use vinegar to give cakes and other baked goods extra fluffiness. Bakers tend to choose apple cider vinegar because of its sweet and fruity flavor. In addition, all of the vinegar flavor cooks out of the finished product., If you make a sauce, soup, or gravy that is particularly salty, you can add a little apple cider vinegar to help balance out the dish. Just a splash of apple cider vinegar while the sauce simmers will cut the saltiness and add a hint of sweetness. You can even use it to cut the saltiness of cheese sauces., If you want to add some zest to a drink, consider adding a splash of apple cider vinegar. It will add a little bite and a little tartness to whatever you are drinking. Consider adding a splash to your morning smoothie or your afternoon tea.If you like to detox, apple cider is a common ingredient in many detox drink recipes.

, If you prefer your poached eggs to be firm, add a little apple cider vinegar to your water. Once the water comes to a boil, a splash of vinegar should do the trick. The vinegar helps the whites firm up faster while keeping the yolk nice and runny."

, Remove the fat from the top of the pan drippings using a spoon. Reserve 2 Tbsp (30 ml) and discard the rest.


Transfer the 2 Tbsp (30 ml) of reserved fat to a small saucepan and set aside.

, Pour enough beef stock or beef broth into the removed drippings to create 2 cups (500 ml) of liquid.


If desired, you could use water, milk, or cream instead of the stock, but beef stock or broth will create a stronger beef taste.

, Add 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of flour to the fat in the saucepan and cook over medium heat until smooth.


Stir the flour and fat together until thoroughly blended.
The combination of fat and flour is referred to as a roux.
For a thicker gravy, use 2 Tbsp (30 ml) of flour.

, Slowly pour the combination of pan drippings and broth into the roux, whisking continually to prevent lumps of flour from forming.


If possible, whisk and pour at the same time to maintain more even control over the consistency of the gravy. If this is too difficult, however, you can alternate back and forth between adding the drippings mixture and stirring it in.

, Bring the gravy to a boil and stir until it thickens.


Do not cover the saucepan.

, Add salt and pepper to the gravy, as desired, in order to season it. Stir well to incorporate the seasonings.


If you are uncertain about how much to use, try adding 1/4 tsp (1.25 ml) salt and 1/4 tsp (1.25 ml) ground black pepper.

, Pour the beef gravy into a gravy boat and serve with your meal.

",How to Make Beef Gravy3," Place the saucepan on the stove over medium heat and let the butter melt completely.


Proceed to the next step as soon as the butter is melted. Do not allow too much smoking or sizzling to occur after the butter melts.
You could also use a medium skillet instead of a small saucepan.
Note that this version of beef gravy can be prepared even if you do not cook a roast or other cut of beef. As such, it is perfect for use with mashed potatoes or pre-cooked beef dishes.

, Add the chopped onion to the melted butter in the saucepan and stir continually for several minutes.


Use a heat-resistant flat spatula to stir the chopped onion.
Cook the onion for 2 to 3 minutes or until it becomes tender and translucent. Do not let the onion brown or burn.

, Add the remaining 2 Tbsp (30 ml) butter to the pan and let it melt. Immediately after it melts, stir in the 1/4 cup (60 ml) of flour.


The combination of butter and flour, or flour and any other fat, is referred to as a roux. This is an essential component of forming a thick gravy or sauce.
Make sure that the onion, butter, and flour are thoroughly mixed. There should be no visible clumps of flour remaining.

, In a separate dish, combine boiling water and beef bouillon granules. Stir the granules into the water until dissolved.


You could use 3 beef bouillon cubes instead of 3 tsp (15 ml) beef bouillon granules, if desired.

, Slowly stir the beef-flavored liquid into the butter, flour, and onion in the saucepan. Whisk the ingredients in as you pour to prevent lumps from forming.


If you cannot pour and whisk simultaneously, alternate back and forth between pouring a little of the liquid in and stirring the liquid into the roux.
Try to maintain a smooth consistency as you add the liquid.

, Bring the gravy to a boil over medium heat and let it cook for several minutes.


Stir the gravy occasionally as it cooks.
Do not cover the saucepan.

, Ladle the gravy into a gravy boat or other serving dish. Serve alongside the rest of your meal.

Add the seed.,
Move the honey someplace cool to rest for a week.",How to Make Creamed Honey," The process of making creamed honey involves adding seed honey to liquid honey. Seed honey has already crystallized, so it promotes more crystallization in fresh liquid honey. One of the seed types you can use is honey that’s already been creamed.Creamed honey can be purchased in many grocery stores, health food stores, at farmers markets, and at bee farms.
Creamed honey will sometimes be labeled whipped, spun, or set honey.;
, Another seed you can use to make creamed honey is the hardened sugar crystals from previously liquid honey. Unprocessed honey naturally crystallizes over time, and you can collect this hardened honey and powder it to use as seed honey.


Collect the crystallized honey from an old jar of honey. Place the crystals in a blender or food processor and grind the crystals into a fine powder. This breaks down the large crystals, and these will seed the growth of more small crystals in your new batch of creamed honey.You can also grind the crystallized honey using a pestle and mortar.

, If you don’t have creamed honey or an old jar of crystallized liquid honey on hand, you can make your own crystals with a jar of new honey that hasn’t been pasteurized or filtered.


Take the lid off the jar of honey. Place the jar in the fridge. Reduce the temperature of the fridge to 58 F (14 C) or lower.Over the next few days, the sugar in the honey will gradually crystalize. Collect the hardened crystals once you have enough for a seed to make your creamed honey.
Process the crystallized honey in a blender, food processor, or with a pestle and mortar to turn it into a fine powder.

, There are two main types of honey available on the market: raw unfiltered honey and pasteurized honey. The pasteurization process kills pollen, spores, and bacteria, and you can do this on your own by heating the honey before adding the seed. To make pasteurized creamed honey, you'll need:


Your liquid honey and seed honey
A medium saucepan with a lid
A rubber spatula or wooden spoon
A candy thermometer
A sterilized storage jar with a lid

, Pour the liquid honey into the saucepan and heat it over medium–high heat. Use the candy thermometer to monitor the temperature, and bring the honey to 140 F (60 C).Along with killing bacteria, heating the honey will also remove any large crystals that have already formed. If large crystals form rather than small ones, the honey will harden instead of becoming smooth and spreadable.
To make a larger batch of creamed honey, increase the ratios of liquid honey and seed honey. For the seed honey, use about 10 percent of the quantity of liquid honey., To prevent burning, stir the honey regularly as it heats. While it’s heating up, you can also add additional flavorings and ingredients to the honey if you like. You can gradually add in:Cinnamon
Vanilla
Dried herbs, such as thyme or oregano

, When the honey reaches 140 F (60 C), remove it from the heat. Set it aside and let it cool to about 95 F (35 C). As the honey cools, bubbles will rise to the surface. Skim the bubbles and the foam off the top., While the honey is still between 90 and 95 F (32 and 35 C), add in the seed honey. Stir gently until the seed honey has been fully incorporated into the liquid honey.


It’s important to stir gently so that you don’t create more air bubbles.

, Place the lid on the saucepan and set the honey aside to rest for at least 12 hours. During this time, more bubbles will rise to the surface, and the seeding process will begin.


Over time, the small sugar crystals in the seed honey will help more small crystals grow. As the crystals spread, the entire mixture will turn to creamed honey.

, Once the honey has had time to rest, skim off any bubbles that have risen to the surface. Transfer the honey to a sterilized glass or plastic container and screw on the lid.


It’s not absolutely necessary to remove the air bubbles from the honey, but it will improve the appearance of the final product.

, Transfer the honey to an environment that constantly remains around 57 F (14 C). Leave the honey to crystallize for at least five days, and up to two weeks.Good places to store the honey during this time include a basement, cold cellar, refrigerator, or cold garage.
Once the honey is ready, store it in the cupboard or pantry.

, To make raw, unprocessed creamed honey, the process is quite similar to pasteurized creamed honey. The main difference is that you don’t heat the unpasteurized and unfiltered raw honey before adding the seed.


To make the process easier, transfer the liquid honey to a wide-mouth or mason jar with a lid. This will make it easier to stir in the seed.

, Pour the creamed honey seed or powdered crystallized honey into the liquid honey. Stir it gently for about three minutes, until the seed is fully incorporated into the liquid honey.Stirring to vigorously and introducing too much air can damage the honey’s delicate flavor.
At this point, you can also add other ingredients for extra flavor.

, Place the lid onto your honey jar. Transfer the honey to someplace that’s always around 57 F (14 C), and let it rest for a week as it crystalizes and becomes creamed honey.


Don’t be alarmed if bubbles form in the raw honey. This is just the result of minor fermentation.Once the honey is ready, store it in the pantry.

Heat the butter in a small saucepan.,
Whisk in the flour and seasonings.,
Cook until lightly browned.,
Slowly whisk in the milk.,
Cook until thickened.,
Serve warm.",How to Make Country Gravy1," Melt 2 Tbsp (30 mL) of butter in a small to medium saucepan over medium heat.


Let the butter melt completely before moving on to the next step, but try to avoid letting it boil or steam.
You could also use a large skillet to make country gravy instead of a saucepan.
If you were cooking meat in your skillet before you started cooking the gravy, you can use the leftover pan drippings from the cooked meat instead of or alongside the butter.Reduce the amount of butter so that the butter and pan drippings combined equal no more than about 2 Tbsp (30 mL) of fat.
Vegetable oil can also be used instead of butter, but it is a little less traditional.;
, Add the flour, salt, pepper, paprika, and garlic salt to the butter in the pan, quickly whisking the ingredients together into the butter until the mixture forms a smooth paste.


The flour, salt, and pepper are necessary. The flour and butter combine to form a thickening agent known as a ""roux,"" which is a vital component of the gravy. The salt and pepper are basic seasonings needed in order to provide the gravy with country-style flavor.
The paprika and garlic salt are optional, however, and many basic country gravy recipes do not include them. The spices add a hint of extra flavor to the gravy without being too overpowering., Cook the roux over medium heat for about 10 minutes, stirring frequently to prevent burning.If you want the gravy to remain whiter, do not let the roux brown. Only brown the roux if you want something slightly deeper in color and flavor.
Do not cover the pan.

, Add the milk a little at a time, whisking thoroughly the entire time so that lumps do not form.


Adding too much milk at once will make it almost impossible to break down the lumps and create a smooth gravy. Only add about 1/4 cup (60 mL) at a time.
Start with roughly 1 cup (250 mL) of milk. If you do not like how thick the gravy is, add up to an additional 1 cup (250 mL) to thin it out.

, Continue cooking the gravy, stirring frequently, until it bubbles and thickens.


This should take another minute or two.
Again, note that more milk can be added if you prefer a thinner gravy.

, Remove the thickened gravy from the heat and serve immediately.

Try flavoring desserts with the reduction.",How to Make a Balsamic Reduction," Choose a high-quality balsamic vinegar that's flavorful and sweet. Look for a balsamic vinegar of Modena which can have a great complex flavor (especially the more expensive it is). Balsamic vinegars of Modena reduce down well.Lighter balsamic vinegars are more tart while darker ones are usually sweeter.
Avoid using a traditional balsamic vinegar (labeled ""Aceto Balsamico Tradizionale"" and stamped ""D.O.P""). This vinegar will lose flavor when heated.;
, You can make any increment of balsamic reduction you like. If you use a lot of balsamic reduction on a regular basis, consider starting out with a whole bottle of balsamic vinegar. A bottle is usually around 16 ounces (2 cups). Pour the balsamic vinegar into a small heavy saucepan.If you're only planning on using the balsamic reduction for one meal or dessert, consider starting with just 8 ounces (1 cup) of balsamic vinegar.
Using a wide and shallow pan will help the balsamic vinegar cook down more evenly.

, If you're planning on drizzling your balsamic reduction over berries, a dessert, or ice cream, you may want to stir in 1/2 cup of granulated sugar to the pan with the balsamic vinegar. As the mixture reduces, the sugars will caramelize a little and give a slightly sweet taste to your reduction.Some people recommend adding sugar or other flavors (like cinnamon, orange, fig, or fresh herbs) to an already finished reduction. That way, you could use a straight balsamic reduction for more things.

, The goal with reducing the vinegar is to slowly allow moisture to evaporate so that the liquid is reduced by half or two-thirds. This will make the balsamic reduction thick and syrupy. Cooking the vinegar over medium heat may prevent the reduction from burning.At this point, you may want to turn on your kitchen fan since the balsamic vinegar will begin to evaporate as it reduces.

, If you're heating the balsamic vinegar in a wide shallow saucepan, it will quickly begin bubbling from the center. If you're using a smaller deep saucepan, it may take longer for the vinegar to come to a boil.


Stay close to your stovetop while the vinegar is heating. It will only take a few minutes to begin boiling. If you let the vinegar boil too long, it can burn.

, Once you see that the vinegar is bubbling a lot, turn the heat down to low. The boiling will slow to a simmer. Make sure the mixture continues to simmer as it reduces. If you notice it stop, turn up the heat till it begins bubbling a little.


Simmering is just below the boiling point, so the vinegar should still be slightly bubbling.

, The liquid will gradually evaporate so that only half or two-thirds of the vinegar remains. If you're having trouble gauging how much has evaporated, look at the side of your saucepan. You should see a line at the point where the vinegar originally was. Use this to gauge how much moisture has evaporated.If you added sugar to your vinegar, you can stir the mixture occasionally to keep it from sticking to the pan.
If you'd like a thinner sauce for drizzling, cook it closer to 10 minutes. If you want a thicker sauce, cook it for closer to 20 minutes.

, Pour your reduction into a bowl and allow it to cool completely before serving. It will get slightly thicker as it cools. If you plan on drizzling the reduction, transfer it to a squeeze bottle or small pitcher.


For longer storage, put the reduction in an air-tight bottle and refrigerate it for up to two weeks., Drizzle roasted vegetables with the reduction to add another complex flavor. Balsamic reduction also works well when drizzled over pizza or grilled salmon. You can also use the reduction as a dip. For example, try dipping a grilled cheese sandwich in your reduction.If you want to keep things simple, try drizzling the reduction over a fresh ripe avocado.
You can also add a few teaspoons of the reduction to your pasta sauce to create a more unique flavor.

, A traditional Caprese salad is one of the most well-known salads to use balsamic reduction as a dressing. This fresh mozzarella and tomato salad simply uses the reduction as a drizzled dressing. But you can also combine the reduction with other salad dressings to improve their flavor. Or you can make your own simple balsamic dressing by combining and shaking together these ingredients:Equal parts of your reduction and extra-virgin olive oil (try for 1/4 cup of each)
1/2 teaspoon grainy mustard
1/8 teaspoon sea salt
a few grinds of fresh-ground black pepper

, Strawberries are a popular fruit to pair with balsamic reductions. You can drizzle the reduction over fresh or roasted strawberries, peaches, or figs. For other sweet ideas, drizzle the reduction over vanilla ice cream.You can also drizzle cheesecake or berry pies with a little balsamic reduction. The reduction will cut some of the dessert's sweetness.

Let it simmer.,
Make a roux.,
Add slurry.",How to Fix Gravy Gone Wrong1," Depending on how much time you have until you need to serve it, simmering your gravy will help it thicken. If your gravy is particularly runny, let it simmer at medium heat for one hour. This will burn off excess moisture and help the sauce congeal.Be sure to keep an eye on the gravy and stir it regularly. This will keep it from getting too thick or become lumpy.;
, Take a fat - butter, oil, or meat drippings will do - and melt it in a pan over medium heat. Once the fat has melted and become hot, add an equal amount of flour and quickly whisk the mixture. Gradually add the roux to the gravy, whisking the mixture as you add it.


The amount of gravy you need to thicken will determine how much of each ingredient you need for the roux. As a rule of thumb, one tablespoon (15ml) of fat and flour will thicken one cup (237ml) of stock or runny gravy., If you are pressed for time and need to thicken your gravy immediately, add slurry to your gravy. Slurry is a mixture of cornstarch and water that you can use to thicken your gravy quickly.Mix one 1 tablespoon (15ml) of cornstarch with an equal amount of cold water. Then, slowly add the slurry to your gravy while whisking the mixture, letting it boil for a few seconds to thicken.If your gravy is particularly runny, you may need to repeat this step a few times to get the thickness right.

Give the oil a few minutes to heat before adding any other ingredients. It needs to be sufficiently warm, yet not quite smoking.
Any standard cooking oil will work, including vegetable oil, canola oil, or olive oil. You could also use margarine or butter, if desired.
Skipping the butter and using oil makes this recipe vegan as well as gluten-free.

,


Rice flour and oil will form a roux, much like wheat flour and butter do.
You can use either sweet or regular rice flour. Both are gluten-free.

, Stir the rice flour roux constantly for two minutes or so.


You do not have to let the flour brown, but doing so will lend a nutty flavor to the country gravy.
Do not let the flour burn.

, Gradually pour the soy milk into the roux, whisking constantly so that lumps do not form.


Add the soy milk a little at a time. Pour 1/4 cup (60 mL) or so into the pan, whisk well, and repeat until 2 cups (500 mL) has been used.
Bring the mixture to a light boil or simmer. You may need to increase the heat of the eye in order to do so, but do not increase it past medium-high.

, Sprinkle with salt, pepper, garlic powder, and the remaining soy milk. Keep whisking until it reaches your desired thickness.


If the country gravy seems a little too thin, continue heating it at a light simmer. The liquid will gradually reduce, making the gravy thicker.
If you suspect that the gravy is getting too thin as you add the soy milk, you do not need to add the full remaining 1 cup (250 mL).

, Remove the country grave from the heat and use while still fresh and warm.

",How to Make Country Gravy3," Pork sausage and bacon are both fairly common to country-style gravy, but they are not necessarily a standard ingredient.


Crumble roughly 1/8 lb (60 g) of sausage into the pan for every 2 cups (500 mL) country gravy you plan to prepare.Crumble 4 to 6 slices of bacon into the gravy for every 2 cups (500 mL) of country gravy.
Cook the sausage or bacon first and set aside. Use the fat from the meat to help form the roux for your gravy.

, Cook about 1/4 lb (115 g) ground beef for every 2 cups (500 mL) of gravy you plan to prepare.


Cook the hamburger first. Make sure that the beef is fully browned and fully cooked before removing it from the pan.
Add about 2 Tbsp (30 mL) of the rendered fat back into the pan to serve as the fat base for your roux. Add the flour, seasonings, and milk according to standard recipe instructions.
Stir the cooked, crumbled ground beef back into the country gravy just before serving.

, Different seasonings can give your country gravy a slightly different taste.


For a kick of heat, try adding 1/2 tsp (2.5 mL) ground cayenne pepper, 1 tsp (5 mL) chili powder, or 1/4 tsp (1.25 mL) ground white pepper per 2 cups (500 mL) of gravy.
For a warmer taste, add 1/4 tsp ground nutmeg, ground cloves, or ground allspice to 2 cups (500 mL) of country gravy.
For a more savory taste, add 1 Tbsp (15 mL) fresh herbs like cilantro, oregano, or parsley.

, Stirring in grated or shredded cheese can turn country gravy into something that can satisfy any cheese-lover at your table.


Add about 1/2 cup (125 mL) grated or shredded cheese per 1 cup (250 mL) sauce.
Stir the cheese in at the end, just before serving. Stir until the cheese melts completely.
Try cheddar, mozzarella, or your favorite type of cheese.

, Onions and mushrooms can add a gourmet touch to a standard country gravy.


Sauté 1 cup (250 mL) sliced mushrooms and 2 Tbsp (60 mL) chopped onion in butter or oil. Prepare 2 cups (500 mL) of country gravy in the same skillet or saucepan without removing the mushrooms and onions.

Whisk the gravy.,
Use a strainer.,
Add more liquid.",How to Fix Gravy Gone Wrong2," If you improperly add your thickening agent, you may get lumpy gravy. One way of working out lumps is to give the gravy a good whisking. This will help break down the congealed clumps of cornstarch or flour. Especially when you are making a roux, be sure to use a whisk to prevent initial lumpiness.Avoid using a using spoon to mix your roux. Always whisk it to prevent lumps.

, If your gravy is particularly lumpy, you may just have to strain it. Take a mesh strainer and pour your gravy through it and into the serving dish. This should remove most of the clumps from your gravy.


If you still have lumps, strain the gravy until they are gone.

, If your gravy is extra lumpy or thick, you can add stock or water to the mixture. Heat up the stock or water and then pour it into your hot gravy, whisking the mixture as you do it. Continue adding liquid until the gravy is the consistency that you want.This is also a great tip for heating up gravy that has congealed in the refrigerator.

Sprinkle some salt.,
Give a splash of fortified wine.,
Add more bouillon or stock.,
Toss in some seasonings.",How to Fix Gravy Gone Wrong3," If the flavor of your gravy is a little underwhelming, add a little salt. Take some table salt and sprinkle it onto the gravy. Repeat until the gravy is to your taste. Be sure to taste the gravy as you add the salt so that you do not make it too salty.Too much salt can easily overwhelm the other flavors on your plate.

, You can also add a small amount of sherry, port, or Madeira to bring out the flavors of the gravy. Give small splashes of wine, tasting it after each addition, to avoid adding too much alcohol. Combine a small amount of fortified wine with some salt for the best results., You can also add more stock or bouillon if available. This will enhance the meaty flavor of the gravy. Make sure that you use the correct bouillon or stock. Your beef gravy will taste different with chicken stock added to it.


If you are less discerning about pairing meat and gravy, you can get away with using chicken stock for turkey gravy and vice versa.

, Depending on the type of gravy, you might also add some more seasonings. Black pepper can add an extra bit of flavor to any type of gravy. If you are making a beef gravy, add marjoram, bay leaf, sage, and thyme. For chicken and turkey gravy, add a little oregano, rosemary, sage, thyme, and pepper. For pork, use garlic and onions with small amounts of oregano and sage."

Continue adding butter until the salty taste is less pronounced., Begin by adding about ½ teaspoon (5ml) of sugar to your gravy. Let the gravy absorb the sugar and then taste it after a few minutes. Keep adding small amounts of sugar until the saltiness disappears.Be sure to avoid adding too much sugar and making your gravy sweet.

, Stir in one teaspoon (10ml) of cider vinegar into your gravy. Let the gravy simmer for a few minutes and then give it a taste. Add small amounts of vinegar until the salt flavor is gone.Be sure to not to add too much and make your gravy taste like vinegar.

Know what “raw” honey really means.,
Find local sources.,
Spot the difference.",How to Choose Raw Honey1," Understand that truly raw honey has not been processed, filtered, or artificially heated in any way. This preserves its natural antioxidants, minerals, and enzymes, which can provide health benefits.However, be aware that laws and guidelines regarding labelling are very loose. Don’t assume that honey is 100% raw just because the labelling describes it as “raw,” “pure,” or “natural.”Processing, filtering, and heating honey does strip away many of its nutrients. However, if you aren’t able to find truly raw honey, treated honey is still healthier than sugar and many other sweeteners.;
, If possible, research and/or visit local bee farms. If the farms themselves are too far out of reach, visit sellers closer to home (such as farmers markets or natural food stores) who stock their product and deal with them directly. Either way, purchase your honey directly (or as directly as you can) from a nearby source, whose practices and trace-of-sale are more easily verified than a global company’s. Ensure that your honey is in fact 100% raw by speaking directly with the producers or as few middlemen as possible.Again, be wary of labelling when browsing honey in your grocery store. Due to relaxed regulations, honey that was imported from afar can still be labelled as “local honey” as long as it was repackaged locally.

, Since you can’t always trust labeling, develop an eye to identify raw honey from treated honey. Expect honey that has been processed, filtered, and heated to appear “clean,” with little or no crystals or other visible particles suspended in the liquid. In contrast, expect raw honey to crystallize more readily than treated honey, resulting in a less smooth liquid. However:This is less of a rule and more of a guideline. Any form of honey may crystallize or liquify over time, depending on its exposure to heat. Raw honey may appear by chance to be smooth liquid with little or no “impurities.”
Treated honey is generally heated before packaging for aesthetic reasons, in order to attract customers who may be put off by crystallized honey’s lack of consistency.
Treated honey is also filtered to remove elements (such as pollen) that customers may think of as impurities.Therefore, a honey that has crystallized and/or appears to contain “specks” is more likely to be raw.

Pop your honey bear's top.,
Heat slowly in warm water until honey is not viscous (It is a liquid) and is warm to hot to the touch.

,
Note: Don't over heat.,
If it is not too hot you are either lucky to live in a warm place or the honey was overheated and you waited for it to cool down or it is not hot enough.,
Look for chunks of honey that don't appear to move when the honey is dripping back down the walls of the bear.,
Your crystals have disappeared.,
Get out a bowl almost as tall as the bear, as wide as possible.,
Make sure the lid is closed and seals adequately for partial submersion.,
Wait a long time or until you can not tell the difference between the temperature of the water and the temperature of the room.

,
Dry off and store your honey in a more consistently warm place.

,
Try an easy alternative.",How to Decrystallize Honey," ***Below 65°F (the temperature of a cool kitchen) honey will form a stable solid phase similar to granulated sugar (like the way ice forms from water below 32°F ). Frequent temperature excursions below 65°F can lead to the nucleation of a dispersed, abundant solid phase and make your honey bear annoying and in extreme cases useless.***;
,, This causes cooling rate issues that will be discussed later. This is also important because it will prevent you from proceeding.

, Pick it up, close the top and shake vigorously until you think the crystals should have dissolved. Imagine you're stirring 10 packets of sugar into a glass of iced tea. If your crystals haven't dissolved, go back to step 1 as your honey is not hot enough.


Remember: be careful. You may need an oven mitt.

, If in doubt, now is the time go back to step 1.

, Done right? Wrong. Here's the hard part ... waiting for your honey to cool. ""That's weird"", you say, ""The crystals dissolved so what's the problem?""


The problem is: if the honey cools too quickly air bubbles from shaking the honey will be trapped in the viscous (thick and not always, but in this case delicious) liquid. The air bubbles seem to be good locations for nucleating the crystals which means all that shaking will have been in vain.

, Run the hottest tap water you can. If your tap water is really hot, maybe you should consider turning down the temperature of your water heater later. The large volume of water is really important here because it is what dictates cooling rate. Large volumes tend to have less surface area per volume and can thus not transfer heat as effectively, given the same material. The result? Slower cooling rates. This is a good thing for us.

, Place the bear in the bowl. Fill the bowl as full as you can without spilling it everywhere. Basically we want hot (at least as hot as the honey) water touching as much of the bear walls where honey is as possible. For fuller bears, place the bear at an angle (lean it against the side of the bowl) so that the distance that the air bubbles will have to travel is minimized. If your setup is working you should start to see air bubbles accumulating on the top surface of the honey. For this reason, it helps to put the honey label down if you have tipped it over.


Note: If you do not see air bubbles accumulating at the top you either did not shake hard enough on step 3 or your bear was not heated enough. Maybe you just had a nightmare that you had bad honey.

Taste for potency.,
Sample different floral varieties.,
Shop for “food grade” honey.",How to Choose Raw Honey2," Expect the flavor of honey to vary in strength. For bold flavors, favor honey that appears dark in color. For a honey that won’t overpower other ingredients, choose a lighter shade.Flavor is, obviously, a matter of taste. However, consider using darker, bolder honeys to liven up relatively bland foods, like white toast or basic tea.
Conversely, use lighter honeys when you only want to sweeten something without drastically altering how it tastes.

, Since bees feed on nectar produced by a variety of flowers, expect the flavor of honey to vary depending on which flower they fed on. Check the packaging’s label or ask the bee farm or seller to find out which type(s) of flowers were used for each product. If possible, ask for a taste test or buy small samples to find which kinds please you the most.Honeys come in both “monofloral” and “multifloral” varieties.
Monofloral means that only one type of flower was used.
Multifloral” or “floral blend” indicates that several were used.

, Be aware that, in addition to eating, honey is also marketed for medicinal uses. Learn which varieties are chiefly marketed as food and which are touted for exceptional medicinal properties, such as Manuka.Although there is little reason to not eat medicinal-grade honey just for the heck of it, expect these varieties to possibly cost more (perhaps prohibitively so, if you eat honey regularly)."
"
Be wary of medicinal claims.,
Consider allergies.,
Only feed to children older than 12 months.",How to Choose Raw Honey3," As with raw honey’s labelling, realize that many of the claims regarding the health and medicinal benefits of eating raw honey are not necessarily supported by research. Although some uses have been generally proven to be beneficial and others show promise, keep in mind that the jury is still out on a great many of them. Always consult with your doctor about the known risks and benefits before treating yourself with raw honey. Credible uses include:


Using honey as a cough suppressant.Using Manuka honey as an antibacterial treatment on wounds., Do not consume raw honey if you are allergic to bees, since honey that hasn’t been processed or filtered may contain body parts. Additionally, find out what sort of nectar the bees fed on. Understand that bees leave traces of pollen in honey. If you are allergic to specific types of pollen, avoid any raw honey that may contain traces of it. Although it is not common, be aware that you may suffer a severe allergic reactions to the pollen in raw honey.Symptoms to look out for include itching, hives, and swelling.

, Do not feed honey (raw or otherwise) to anyone under one year of age. Be aware that honey may contain toxins that can cause botulism. Expect children under the age of one to be the most vulnerable."

Visit your local farmer's market.,

Find a local beekeeper.,

Visit a local health food store.",How to Buy Natural Honey1," Find different booths and merchants that are selling their honey, and ask them about their product. Natural honey from local farmers is typically sold as raw, or un-pasteurized. This means that the honey has not been heated, and only slightly strained to remove any wax particles. Ask the farmers if their honey is raw.
, Ask the merchants at the farmer's market for some names of local beekeepers. You may also check the yellow pages in your area for beekeepers who advertise their honey for sale. Many beekeepers strain and jar their honey, and some may be willing to sell you comb honey, which is directly from the hive. In many areas, even cities, you may find that your neighbors keep bees and are willing to sell or even give away honey., Many organic food stores stock honey in pure or raw form. Look at the labeling and ask the store personnel for assistance. You may also ask if they carry honey from local bees."
"

Search for honey on the Internet.",How to Buy Natural Honey2," Look for growers and manufacturers of honey that state it is raw or un-pasteurized. Keep in mind that many online merchants will state that their honey is 100 percent natural, which may mean that it has actually been heated up to temperatures of 120 degrees F (48.8 C). For completely raw honey, check labels carefully, and make sure there is a money back guarantee in case you are dissatisfied. Shop for websites that are as close to your region as possible."
"
Know your region's honey purity laws.,
Check the label, but don't take it for granted.,
Taste the honey if a sample is offered.",How to Verify the Purity of Honey1," Some countries or regional governments issue honey standards that require the mention of added substances. Others do not have laws relating to honey purity, or may release voluntary guidelines with no ability to enforce them. Try to find honey purity laws in your area so you know how much faith to put in honey labels in your local grocery store.


Any product sold in the European Union as honey must be free of additives by law, including antibiotics used to treat bees for disease.Any honey with defects seriously affecting the taste must be sold as ""baker's honey"" intended for use in processed foods.The United States government does not test for honey purity, and allows trace amounts of antibiotics. A USDA logo does not mean the honey is pure.Florida is the only U.S. state that requires honey to display all additives as long as it is both manufactured and sold within Florida.Beware substances sold under a different name, such as ""honey blends"" or ""honey products,"" which do not fall under this law.;
, Check around the brand name or logo in addition to the ingredient list to check for ""additives"" or ""added flavors."" Pure honey should only have one ingredient: honey. However, even if no other ingredients are listed, the manufacturer may not be telling the truth.








, Tasting is not an accurate way to test for additives, but if taste is your main concern, it could be all you need to make a decision. Note that a ""weird"" taste does not necessarily mean the honey isn't pure. There are many varieties of honey made from the nectar of different flowers, saps, or even the secretions of sap-eating insects.Each of these produces different flavors, and even the honey of one beehive can vary from year to year as they collect nectar from different sources.









Most sellers will not allow you to open a jar before purchasing. Ask whether you can taste a sample, but do not insist if one is not available.

Add a spoonful of liquid honey to warm water.,
Set fire to a cotton pad or candle wick dipped in honey.,
Drop honey on blotting paper or a paper towel.",How to Verify the Purity of Honey2," Honey's wonderful, delicious variety works against you when you're trying to find a simple test. Different types of pure honey can cover a large range of density, flammability, and other characteristics. While the following tests are based on true principles, in practice your results may be inconclusive. Try several of these tests to see if the honey fails or passes consistently. In many cases, you can get nothing more than a good guess.

, Add a spoonful of honey to a glass of warm water, stirring slowly or not at all. If the honey has been mixed with certain kinds of sugar syrup, it will dissolve in the water. Most pure honeys, and unfortunately some adulterated honeys as well, will stick together and sink as a solid lump, or remain stuck as a lump on the spoon.









Note that pure or adulterated honey is also sold in creamed (evenly crystallized) form or solid honeycomb form. These will always be difficult to dissolve, whether or not the honey is pure.

, This test only checks for added water in the honey, which may prevent the honey from burning. Dip a cotton pad or the cotton wick of a candle into a bit of the honey, and shake off the excess. Attempt to light the cotton pad or wick. If it burns easily, then it probably has no added water, but may or may not have other substances added. If it refuses to burn or makes a cracking sound instead, water may have been added.








, If honey has been diluted with water, it may be absorbed or leave a wet mark on an absorbent material such as blotting paper. Pure honey should not be absorbed, but unfortunately neither will honey diluted with most sugar syrups.

Don't let ants make your decision for you.,
Realize that mixing honey and alcohol is not a useful test.,
Be skeptical about claims of pure honey turning one direction or forming shapes.,
Test additional claims yourself.",How to Verify the Purity of Honey3," Ants are interested in anything sweet and nutritious. Ants will eat honey, colored corn syrup, and anything in between.

, Some sources claim that mixing impure honey into methylated spirits or other alcohol will dissolve it and make the solution milky, while pure honey will stay undissolved at the bottom. Other sources claim the exact opposite! This myth dates back at least to 1893, and was not accepted by professional beekeepers even then., There are several myths around the internet about only pure honey turning clockwise when poured, or only pure honey forming hexagons when left on a plate and covered with water. There is no scientific evidence that impure honey will behave differently in these situations.

, There are many anecdotes floating around about different ways you can test honey for purity, and many of them have not been scientifically tested. If you think something sounds plausible, try testing a jar of honey you think is pure. Then mix it with agave syrup, sugar syrup, or some other added sugar and perform the same test. If you consistently get different results with the diluted syrup than with the pure honey, the test might be useful. Keep in mind that no one household test can detect every possible additive in honey, however.

Use a microwave cautiously when liquefying honey.,
Transfer your honey from any plastic containers into a glass jar by spoon.,
Start microwaving honey in 30 second increments on the defrost setting.,
Check for liquefaction of the honey after 30 seconds, particularly near the surface of the jar.,
Microwave for additional increments of 15 to 30 seconds, stirring after each microwaving session.",How to Liquify Honey1," If you want your honey to retain the benefits of “raw” honey, use the microwave with caution. While quick and efficient, microwaving can easily destroy the beneficial enzymes by overheating them.;
, Besides presenting a possible health hazard, plastic containers don't transfer heat as well as glass does. Bottom line: you'll get the job done quicker and more safely if you move your honey to a glass jar instead of using a plastic container.

, Cooking time for your batch will vary based on the amount of honey you’re liquefying, the starting temperature of the honey, and its sugar content as well as content the wattage of your microwave. It is best to start off at low power and use short microwave times. This may take more cycles and an extra minute or two, but you won't ruin the taste of the honey or inhibit the effectiveness of the good enzymes during the liquefaction process.


Experiment to find what works for you in your environment, but experiment cautiously. Above 100°F (38ºC), the flavor of honey is altered; above 120°F (49ºC), the beneficial enzymes in the honey start to break down and stop being effective.

, If pockets of honey have started to liquefy, stir the honey to help transfer the heat. If the honey hasn’t started to liquefy, continue microwaving in 30 second increments until some crystals start to liquefy.

, Continue until the honey has nearly liquefied, then stir until the process is complete.


If most of the honey has liquefied but some stubborn crystals remain, you may want to finish the job off manually by stirring the honey vigorously instead of continuing to heat it.

Only raw, unfiltered honey will crystalize. Make sure you purchase unfiltered, pure honey.Unfiltered honey may have an added cost, but it's the only way to get crystalized honey.
It may be easier to find unfiltered honey in an organic grocery store or the organic section of your store.;
, Exposure to air may make honey crystalize faster. Plastic jars are generally more porous than other storage options. If your honey did not already come in a plastic jar, transfer it to one to speed up the crystallization process., If you're buying your honey from a local business, like a farmer's market, ask the provider which honeys crystalize fastest. Honeys infused with things like rose petals may crystalize faster than other types of honey., A low glucose-to-water ratio speeds up the process of crystallization.Try adding a tablespoon or two of water to your honey and mixing it in. This may result in faster crystallization., Honey stored in temperatures around 50 degrees Fahrenheit (10 degrees Celsius) will crystalize much faster. Store your honey somewhere like the fridge. Use a thermometer to determine your fridge's heat to make sure it hovers around the 50s.Do not freeze your honey. This will prevent it from crystalizing.

, Unfortunately, there is no exact formula to know how long honey crystalizes. When kept at the right temperature, most honey will crystalize but this can take anywhere from weeks to years.When your honey crystalizes, you will realize the honey is formed into large crystals with white air bubbles in between., If you already have some crystalized honey, transfer this to a container of runny honey. The presence of honey crystals may speed up the crystallization process., Crystalized honey is thicker than regular honey. You can use it as a spread on things like bread, bagels, toast, and English muffins., Meats like pork and chicken can taste great with a honey glaze. You can just as easily use crystalized honey as regular honey to glaze your meats prior to cooking them., Honey crystals can be dropped in hot drinks like coffee and tea. They dissolve just like sugar cubes and will sweeten up your drink."

Keep your honey jar lid closed tightly.,
Wipe down the jar and surfaces after using them.,
Store in a glass or plastic container in a room temperature area.,
Keep your honey in the refrigerator.",How to Keep Ants out of Honey1," When you’re not using your honey or other sweeteners, make sure that any lids or seals are completely closed. This is the easiest way to prevent hordes of ants from going for a swim in your precious condiments., Honey is runny and notorious for leaving drips down the side of the jar or on counters. Any exposed honey will attract ants so clean up after you're done cooking or preparing food. Take a damp paper towel with a little dish soap and wipe down the honey jar and table and place any used utensils in the sink or dishwasher.

, Honey is best kept between 70-80 degrees Fahrenheit and away from direct sunlight.A pantry or cupboard is usually the best place for honey as it won't be as affected by the elements. If your honey didn't come in an airtight container, relocate it to a repurposed glass jar or sealed plastic container.If you want to keep your honey on the counter, take note of where sunlight comes through your kitchen windows so you can avoid placing your honey in its path.
Honey does not react well to fluctuations in temperature so try and keep it away from drafty areas and vents in your house.

, You are able to store your honey in the fridge, but bear in mind that honey will crystallize if it drops below 65 degrees Fahrenheit. As long as you don't cause the honey's temperature to bounce around, a chillier environment is just fine.However, the honey will be a little slower to pour out when you want to use it.


Place the jar in a bowl or hot water to help break up and dissolve the crystals.
Honey can also be frozen.
Be cautious though, any moisture that gets in the honey can cause it to ferment whether in the fridge or pantry. This can produce mead but it does ruin the original honey."

Liquefy honey in a water bath if you're particular about preserving natural enzymes.,
Transfer your honey into a glass jar if necessary.,
Fill a large saucepan with water and gently heat it up to about 95°-105ºF (35-40ºC).,
Submerge the crystallized honey in the warm water.,
Stir the honey periodically to speed up the liquefaction.,
Remove honey from the water bath when it has fully liquefied.",How to Liquify Honey2," Many people use honey in their diet because it contains enzymes that assist in digestion and promote overall health. If you are one of them, and find yourself with a crystallized mass of hard honey, use a warm water bath for best results.


As mentioned above, microwaving can not only affect the taste of the honey, it can also zap the honey beyond the point in which its enzymes break down. Since you can control the temperature of a water bath more easily, you are less likely to lose the beneficial aspects of honey using this method.

, Avoid plastic containers if you can; not only are they shallower (making tipping over a very real possibility), they are also worse at conducting heat., After water has reached about 105°F (40ºC), remove the saucepan from the heat source. The water will continue to heat even after the heat source has been removed.


If you don't have a thermometer to accurately judge the temperature of the water, look for bubbles to start forming on the outside of the saucepan. Small bubbles start forming at 105°F (40°C).You should still be able to dunk a finger in the water comfortably at 105°F (40°C).
Do not exceed 115°F (46°C) when warming. If there's any doubt about the temperature of your water, let it cool down and start over. Honey that is warmed above 115°F (46°C) is not longer considered raw., Open the honey jar and carefully place the honey in the water bath. Wait for the warm water to begin breaking down the glucose crystals on the sides of the honey jar.

, Crystallized honey is a poor heat conductor; stirring will help transfer heat more evenly from the sides of the jar to the middle of the honey.

, Since the water bath — removed from its heat source — will only get colder, you're in no danger of overheating the honey by simply leaving it in the water bath. Stir occasionally for best results; otherwise, set it and forget it.

Stir the honey crystals to produce friction.,
Filter raw honey through a microfilter to retain small particles that speed up crystallization.,
Avoid storing honey in cold cupboards or in refrigerators in order to keep it liquefied longer.,
Apply gentle heat to head off further crystallization if you see sugar crystals forming.",How to Liquify Honey3," Stirring the honey with a sturdy spoon will cause friction.Anyone who's gotten a friction burn will know firsthand that rubbing two surfaces together very quickly produces heat. This heat helps liquefy the honey. So if you find yourself with a clump of crystallized honey and don't have a microwave or burner, or simply want to try something new, stir vigorously for 30 seconds to a minute and see if the problem isn't solved.


If you're trying to prevent crystallization in the first place, the type of honey you have will determine how quickly it crystallizes. Honey with high glucose content will crystallize much faster than honey with low glucose. So alfalfa, cotton, and dandelion honey will crystallize much faster than sage, longan, or Tupelo honey.Stirring these types of honey is just a delay tactic.

, Small particles like pollen grains, flecks of wax, and air bubbles become the “seeds” of crystallization if left in honey. Remove them with a polyester microfilter and prolong the life of your liquefied honey.


If you don’t have a microfilter, consider using a fine nylon cloth or even cheesecloth on top of a sieve as a filter.

, The ideal storage temperature of honey ranges from 21-27°C (70-80°F). Try to store honey in an environment with a fairly regulated temperature.

, As soon as you notice crystals forming, liquefy them. The first crystal growth starts slowly but will accelerate if the crystals are left undisturbed, so stay vigilant and you won’t have to deal with a crystallized mass of honey nearly as often, if ever.

Eliminate ants without pesticides.,
Kill any ants as soon as you see them.",How to Keep Ants out of Honey2," You can redirect ants away from your main honey source by putting a small dish of a spoonful of honey or sugar water outside near your house. Ants will go for this source first and as they consume the dish’s contents, refill it and periodically move it away from your house to draw them away.Make sugar water by mixing a 1:1 ratio sugar to water. Dissolve the sugar by putting it into hot water and then let it cool.
Another trap you can make is with peanut butter and bacon grease or a combination of sugar and Borax. Fill a small container with the mixture, place aluminum foil over the top, and poke holes for the ants to get in.
These diversions will not kill ants, only distract them from your kitchen. You will need to be sure to move the trap away from your house to prevent an invasion.

, Ants cannot traverse through water so it’s a natural deterrent and protection for your honey. Fill the bottom of a small dish or saucer and place your honey container in it. Make sure you don’t overfill it with water, you want just enough for a small pool. This method is best to use if you keep your honey stored out on a kitchen counter.Check the plate frequently to ensure that the water hasn't evaporated.
This method can be used when the lid is lost permanently; just keep adding more water as needed.

, Store-bought traps are a tried and true ways to capture ants and kill them. The one caveat is that traps only kill ants that make it into your home; it doesn’t keep them away. Place traps around your kitchen appliances or any corner that traps dirt and crumbs.


You can also get outdoor traps that snag the ants before they make it into your home.
Keep the traps out of reach from children and pets as they contain toxic chemicals., If you have small children, pets, or allergies, you may find the best option for your home is to kill persistent ants without chemicals. Set out a dish no the ground with a toxic solution to ants in it, or spray them down directly with vinegar or lemon juice.


In a container, mix 1 part baking soda with 1 part powdered sugar and set it out. The sugar attracts the ants and the baking soda reacts to their digestive systems and they explode., Stay on top of the intruders by squishing them into a paper towel or tissues as soon as you see them. Getting them as soon as you see them will help stall them finding any of your sweets. Depending on the size of your invasion, this may not be practical, but it is a good temporary fix.

Redraw your boundaries after a rainfall or if you start to see ants again.You can also seal off your house permanently by using a caulk gun to go over any cracks or any possible tiny entryways. The glue will fill fill any holes your eye may have missed.

, Create a natural boundary around your house with herbs and plants that naturally keep away pests. You could create a garden area around your doorways or walkways or set up a small windowsill planter. Mint, tansy, yarrow, garlic, and chrysanthemums are some options you can plant.For a fun, different plant, get a venus fly trap to put in a window in your kitchen. They eat ants and are a fun pet alternative for apartments and renters.

, Ants will hang out in bushes or shaded areas. If there are any shrubs that brush up against your house, take some hedge trimmers and chop off any branches that reach out towards your home. While poking around, you may also find the ants' nest that you can then get rid of as well."

Refrigerate leftover chipotle sauce.",How to Make Chipotle Sauce," Chipotle sauce can be made with any type of rich, creamy base. Choose the one that has your preferred flavor and consistency. If you have extra ingredients on hand, combining more than one creamy base will result in a sauce with a little more depth. Try one of following combinations:1/2 cup sour cream and 1/2 cup mayonnaise for an extra-decadent sauce
1/2 cup yogurt and 1/2 cup sour cream for a lighter version of chipotle sauce
1/3 cup sour cream, 1/3 cup yogurt and 1/3 cup mayonnaise for the creamiest consistency;
, Chipotle peppers are actually dried jalapeño peppers. The drying process lends them their classic smoky, spicy flavor. When you buy them canned in adobo sauce (look in the section of the grocery store that carries Mexican food products), they've been rehydrated to make them easier to blend. Depending on how how you want your chipotle sauce to be, place one or two peppers in the food processor.


If you know you can take the heat, don't be afraid to add a third pepper.
Spoon in a tablespoon or two of the adobo sauce for extra smoky flavor.

, These two ingredients aren't strictly necessary, but they really enhance the flavor of the sauce. Drop the entire peeled garlic clove into the food processor. Cut a lime into quarters and squeeze the juice into the mix, too.


You can substitute the juice of half a lemon for the lime juice.Try adding 1/2 teaspoon of garlic powder if you don't have fresh garlic.

, Process the sauce until the chunks of pepper and garlic have blended with the creamy base to create a smooth, pourable puree. The red hue of the adobo liquid will give your sauce the classic reddish chipotle hue.

, Dip a spoon into the mixture and taste the sauce. It may already contain just enough salt and spice to suit your needs. If it still needs something extra, add 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon of salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Replace the lid on your food processor and blend for another 15 seconds.Sour cream, mayonnaise and chipotle peppers in adobo all contain sodium, so you may not need extra spices.
You can also squeeze in more lemon juice or add more garlic at this time.

, Whether you're serving it as a dip or a condiment, you'll want to transfer it from the food processor to a serving bowl. Use a spoon to scrape down the sides of the food processor container.


If you want to get fancy, you can pour the sauce into a squirt bottle. This will allow you to control how you drizzle the sauce over your food.
If you don't have a squirt bottle, use a clean ketchup or salad dressing bottle.

, Chipotle sauce can be used in a variety of dishes. A little chipotle sauce can make a regular meal taste restaurant-quality. You can use chipotle sauce as a dip for tortilla chips, or try it in the following ways:


Make a chipotle grilled cheese sandwich. Spread the sauce on the bread before grilling.
Use it as a condiment for fish tacos.Make chipotle nachos. Drizzle the sauce over nachos after the cheese has melted.
Serve it with grilled chicken salad. Chipotle sauce makes a delicious salad dressing.

",How to Make Catsup," Here's a trick you may not know:


Put the tomatoes, a few at a time in a large pot of boiling water for no more than 1 minute (30 - 45 seconds is usually enough)
Plunge them into a waiting bowl of ice water. This makes the skins slide right off of the tomatoes! If you leave the skins in, they become tough and chewy in the sauce, not very pleasant.;
, Wash your hands, then squeeze each tomato and use your finger or a spoon to scoop and shake out most of the seeds. You don't need to get fanatical about it; removing just most will do.

, Toss the squeezed tomatoes into a colander or drainer. This helps more of the water to drain off. You may want to save the liquid: if you then pass it through a sieve, screen or cheesecloth, you have fresh tomato juice; great to drink cold or use in cooking!

, Cook the tomatoes for about 20 - 30 minutes over medium heat to make them mushy enough to go through your food mill or sieve.

, Some of the seasonings will straight into the pot with the tomatoes, the rest will go into a spice bag you make from a piece of cheesecloth. Into the pot of simmering tomatoes, put: chopped onions, salt, garlic, black pepper, cayenne pepper and sugar.

, Tie the corners of the cloth together to make a little bag (you can use a plastic twist tie)

, Let it simmer for 30 minutes, while the tomatoes cook. You may need to add more vinegar, so you finish with 3 cups of liquid.

, Discard the seeds and skins that remain in the sieve.

, Stir frequently. You want it to get as thick as you like your ketchup, remembering that it will also thicken a little bit after you cool it.

, The dishwasher is fine for the jars; especially if it has a ""sterilize"" cycle. Be sure to let it go through the rinse cycle to get rid of any soap!

,,, Fill them to within ¼-inch of the top, seat the lid and hand-tighten the ring around them. Be sure the contact surfaces (top of the jar and underside of the ring) are clean to get a good seal!

, Put them in the canner and keep them covered with at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) of water. Keep the water boiling. Process the jars in a boiling-water bath for 35 minutes for pints and 40 minutes for quarts. Remember to adjust the time if you are at a different altitude other than sea level!


If you have a pressure canner, be sure to follow their directions. Process the sauce for 30 minutes for pint jars and 35 minutes for quarts, at a pressure of 10 to 11 pounds.

, You can then remove the rings if you like. Once the jars are cool, you can check that they are sealed verifying that the lid has been sucked down. Just press in the center, gently, with your finger. If it pops up and down (often making a popping sound), it is not sealed. If you put the jar in the refrigerator right away, you can still use it. Some people replace the lid and reprocess the jar, then that's a bit iffy. If you heat the contents back up, re-jar them (with a new lid) and the full time in the canner, it's usually ok.

Measure the ingredients.,
Warm the milk.",How to Make Bechamel Sauce1," The ratio of milk to flour to butter is very important in Bechamel sauce, since the texture and flavor of the sauce relies on only these three ingredients. Be sure to use exact measurements: 2 tablespoons butter, 4 1/2 tablespoons flour, and 3 cups milk.


If you prefer a thicker sauce, scale back the flour by 1/2 cup. For a more liquid sauce, add 1/2 cup milk.
Using full fat milk will result in a thicker sauce than using low fat or skim milk.;

Wash the apples.,
Peel the apples.,
Core and slice the apples.,
Cut the apples into chunks.Use a sharp knife to cut each slice down into four or so smaller chunks.,
Transfer the apples to the crockpot.,
Sprinkle with lemon juice.,
Add your seasonings and water.,
Cook on low for 6 hours.,
Puree the applesauce, if desired.,
Serve.",How to Make Applesauce in a Crockpot," Rinse the apples under cool to lukewarm running water and pat them dry with clean paper towels.









Even though you will be removing the skin from the apple, you should still rinse them to remove any noticeable dirt or grime before you do anything else. Dirt from the skin can get transferred to the flesh of the apple underneath during the peeling process.
The apples should be more sweet than sour, so Gala, Fuji, Jonagold, Red Delicious, Melrose, Honeycrisp, and Golden Delicious are good options.
For the richest, most complex taste, use a variety of apple types.;
, Use a vegetable peeler or smooth paring knife to gently slice away the peel from each apple.









You could also use a three-in-one peeler-corer-slicer. These hand-operated devices accomplish all three tasks at once. You secure the apple on the base and rotate the apple against a small blade that peels it. Meanwhile, a sharp center ring cores the apple and another blade cuts it into slices., Use an apple corer to remove the core and a knife to slice the remaining apple into about eight pieces.









If you do not have an apple corer, you can either cut around the core with a paring knife or cut the core out of each slice after you cut the apple into slices.
There are also combination corer-slicers. This tool has a round center blade that cuts out the core, but it also has smaller straight blades that slice the apple as you press down on it.,









Technically, you can make applesauce in your slow cooker even without cutting the apples down this small. As long as you peel and slice them, you can still prepare applesauce. Cutting them down into chunks allows you to form slightly smoother applesauce, though.

, Evenly disperse the apple chunks in the slow cooker, packing them in without crushing them.








For this amount, you can get away with using a 3-quart (3-liter) crockpot. If you use a 5-quart (5-liter) crockpot, it will only be about half full. Anything larger than that will be too much.
The applesauce should not burn to the side of the crockpot, but if you want to be extra cautious, you can use a specially-designed plastic slow cooker liner to make clean-up even easier. You could also spray the bottom and sides of the crockpot with a light coating of nonstick cooking spray before adding the apples.

, Pour the lemon juice directly over the apples and lightly toss the chunks with a wooden spoon to coat them.









The primary purpose of the lemon juice is usually to prevent cut apples from browning too much. Since the apples naturally brown during the cooking process, many cooks skip this step, finding it unnecessary. Lemon juice can also help balance the sweet flavor of the apples and other ingredients, however, so it is still recommended.

, Sprinkle the apples with your cinnamon, brown sugar, and vanilla. Gently pour your water over and around the apple chunks, letting it fill up empty gaps beneath the surface.









You do not need to cover the apples with water. In fact, doing so can lead to very watery, runny applesauce, so it is not recommended.
You could also mix the flavorings in with the water before pouring it all over the apples. Doing so can help to disperse the flavors throughout the entire bunch of apples chunks, but since this is being cooked slowly, anyway, the flavors will end up being spread out evenly even if you only sprinkle them over the top of the apples.
Some cooks also prefer to add the cinnamon, sugar, and vanilla at the end of the cooking process. Cooking these ingredients with the apples allows them to permeate the flavor more thoroughly, though, and the flavor may not be as “deep” or complex if you only add these ingredients in at the end.

, Cover the lid and cook the apples until they break down in mush.









Exact cooking time can vary. Some recipes only call for 4 hours on low, while others call for as much as 12 hours. Technically, you can leave the apples in overnight without ruining your applesauce, even though doing so is unnecessary.A larger batch of apples may need to be cooked for at least 8 hours on low or 4 hours on high, but for a batch of this size, 4 to 6 hours should be sufficient.
If the applesauce seems watery once it finishes cooking, leave the lid off and cook on high for an additional 30 minutes to help reduce the amount of water.

, When you finish cooking the apples down, you will naturally be left with fairly chunky applesauce. You can puree this to make it smoother if you prefer chunk-free applesauce.









You can leave the applesauce as is if you prefer chunky applesauce, or you can gently mash it with a metal spoon to make the chunks a little smaller.
If you prefer smooth applesauce, use a hand mixer or immersion blender to puree the applesauce until smooth. You can blend the sauce while it is still in the crockpot., Your applesauce is now ready. You can enjoy it warm or cool it down in the refrigerator before eating it.

, Put them in a pot large enough to hold them all and add enough water to cover the bottom of the pan. You don't want to boil them; you want to steam them, so add liquid accordingly.








, Add about 2 teaspoons of lemon juice (or some other citric) to slow down oxidation and a pinch of salt to help break down the apples.

",How to Make Bread Sauce3," Cut the fresh white bread of your choice into thick slices. With a knife, remove the crust from each slice. Place the bread on a drying rack and leave on the counter overnight to become stale.


If you’ve forgotten this step, you can dry the bread in the oven. Preheat the oven to a very low temperature. Cut the bread and remove the crust. Put the bread on a baking sheet and place in the oven. Once the bread feels dry to the touch, remove it from the oven. Do not toast the bread., Peel the large white onion. Cut the onion into quarters. Stud each quarter with 1 to 2 cloves.

, Pour ½ pint soy milk into a sauce pan. Add the onion to the pan. Gradually heat the soy milk to a boil., Once the soy milk comes to a boil, remove it from the heat. Cover the pan with a lid. Allow the mixture to infuse for 1 hour., While the sauce infuses, prepare your bread crumbs. Tear apart the stale bread into cubes over a mixing bowl. The mixing bowl will catch the cubes and all of the crumbs. , After 1 hour, uncover the infused sauce. Add 1 knob (1 ½ to 2 tablespoons) of vegan margarine. Pour in the bread crumbs. Season the sauce with salt and pepper to taste., Return the saucepan to a burner. Let the sauce simmer over a very low heat until it is thick. This will take approximately 15 minutes., Once the sauce is thick, remove the pan from the heat. Take out the onion and add a splash of vegan cream if desired. Pour the bread sauce into a warmed bowl or gravy boat and serve to your guests.,"

Melt butter on the stove.,
Stir in the cream and Parmesan cheese.,
Heat until simmering.,
Add salt and pepper to taste.,
Optionally, use the pasta water to thin the sauce.,
Serve!",How to Make Alfredo Sauce1," Use a standard saucepan over medium-low heat. Your goal with this sauce should be to gently bring it to a warm temperature and a smooth consistency. Low, slow cooking is best. This can take patience.;
, Gently stir the mixture as you add the ingredients to keep them from burning or sticking. Continue stirring to combine.


If you can, use fresh-grated Parmesan. The taste difference is noticeable compared to using pre-grated cheese. Fresh cheese also tends to be less vulnerable to ""seizing."" See below for an explanation.

, Wait until the sauce reaches a gentle boil. Just a few small bubbles will be forming. At this point, start gently stirring until it becomes noticeably thicker. This is usually about eight minutes.Resist the temptation to crank up the heat. Turn it down if you notice your sauce boiling rapidly. Not only can this burn your ingredients and produce an unpleasant bitter taste — it can also make your cheese ""seize"". When cheese is heated too quickly, the proteins in the cheese coil up rather than separating gently. This separates the fat and moisture from the cheese, leaving an unpleasantly hard product that refuses to melt., The sauce is ready to season when it's at a pleasantly thick consistency. You can add whatever seasonings you want, but plain old salt and pepper work great on their own. Stir to mix evenly after adding.


A few shakes or pinches of each seasoning should do the trick. If you're worried about adding too much, try adding just a single pinch, stirring, and tasting the sauce. Repeat until you're satisfied!

, If you saved the water from the pasta pot, you can use it to thin out a sauce that is too thick and rich. The water retains some of the flavor of the pasta, giving the sauce a nice ""bready"" flavor while thinning it.


If you accidentally add too much water, just simmer it a little longer to thicken it again.

, When the sauce tastes just how you like it, it's ready to serve. Spoon steaming portions over your favorite pasta. The recipe in this section should serve about six.


Alternatively, try using it to lend creamy flavor to your favorite meat and vegetable dishes, including chicken, shrimp, broccoli, and much more. This sauce's mild flavor is highly versatile, so you can use it for almost any entrée.

",How to Make a Yogurt Paste Marinade,";
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"
"
Try adding a few cloves of garlic.,
Try adding white wine.,
Try adding a twist of lemon for a citrus twist.,
Try adding a small pinch of nutmeg.,
Use yogurt instead of heavy cream for a lower-calorie sauce.,
Try using only butter and cheese for a traditional variation.",How to Make Alfredo Sauce2," Garlic's pungent, savory taste is the perfect accompaniment to creamy Alfredo perfection. As you melt the butter, mince a clove of garlic or two. Then, cook them on their own in the butter for about a minute before adding the rest of the ingredients. This brings out their natural flavor and aroma. Leave the garlic in the sauce as you serve it.

, The sweet, slightly acidic taste of most white wines adds a refined dimension to simple Alfredo recipes. Slowly mix in about 1/3 of a cup of wine just before you add the salt and pepper to the recipe. You may find that you need to simmer the sauce slightly longer to re-thicken it after adding the wine.


Most white wines will work well. The crisp, fresh taste of Chardonnay, for instance, will elevate the dish's smoothness.Avoid dessert wines like moscato, as these will be overpoweringly sweet.

, The acidic flavor of lemon juice ""cuts"" the fat of the alfredo sauce. The interaction between the flavors can be tangy but mouth-watering. To add this citrus flavor to your sauce, halve a lemon while you're waiting for the sauce to come to a simmer. Use a fine grater or microplane to zest the peel into a small pile. Once the sauce has thickened, add the zest. Then, squeeze the juice from the lemon half in. Stir to combine.


You may want to squeeze the lemon into the sauce through a strainer to prevent any seeds from falling in.

, Nutmeg may not be the first spice you'd think of that would fit well in a creamy alfredo sauce. However, in small quantities the spice can add a savory, pleasantly aromatic quality to the dish. Try stirring in a very small pinch of nutmeg (no more than 1/4 teaspoon) when you add the Parmesan cheese. If you like the effect you get, you can keep adding more in tiny increments.

, Alfredo sauce tastes great, but one look at the ingredients list will reveal that it's calorie-dense and loaded with fat. Try substituting an equal amount of your favorite low-fat plain yogurt for the cream in the normal recipe. Greek style yogurt is also OK. The dish will still be rich, but not as rich.


The yogurt will also give the recipe a slightly ""tangier"" taste (similar to a Stroganoff sauce). Some prefer this.
You may want to add about a tablespoon of flour to the recipe at the same time as you add the yogurt. Yogurt can curdle when exposed to high heats, but flour tends to prevent this.

, The earliest versions of the modern Alfredo sauce used only two ingredients: cheese and butter.When melted and combined, these form a smooth, rich, golden mixture that coats the pasta evenly. This version of the sauce is simple but hearty and delicious If you're looking to experiment with old-fashioned flavors, try leaving out the cream, water, and seasonings from the recipe above. You also may want to double the amounts of cheese and butter you use to get a similar amount of sauce.


For a more authentic taste, use fresh, unsalted butter. Before refrigeration, salt was added to butter so that it would keep longer. When people wanted to make a great recipe, they would use unsalted butter, which had to be fresh because it wouldn't keep for very long.

Add demi glace to meat dishes.",How to Make a Red Wine Demi Glace,"









Heat a large saucepan over medium heat and melt 1/4 cup of butter to begin making demi glace. Stir occasionally until the butter is completely melted.
Reduce the heat slightly if the butter begins to brown.;
,









Slowly sprinkle flour over the melted butter. Use a wire whisk to incorporate the flour into the butter and prevent it from clumping. The butter and flour will form a roux and look like a thickened paste when completely combined.

,









Pour broth into the pan. Use a whisk to stir the roux of flour and butter off the bottom of the pan and mix it into the broth. Whisk the mixture until the roux is fully mixed into the broth and all clumps have been broken down.

,









Stir red wine into the broth using a circular motion. Be sure the red wine is thoroughly incorporated into the mixture.

,









Allow the red wine demi glace to simmer at low heat for 1 hour. Stir the mixture occasionally. Reduce heat slightly if there is any buildup on the bottom of the pan. This is a sign that your sauce is too hot and could burn.

,









Check the broth and wine after 1 hour to see if it has reduced in volume. The liquid should have reduced to approximately half its original volume in the pan. This concentrates the flavor and thickens the sauce.

,









Dip a spoon into the demi glace, then turn it over and look at the back. The demi glace is ready if it glazes the back of the spoon and stays on it.
Simmer the sauce for an additional 20 minutes if the demi glace is still runny when you test its consistency. Then perform the same consistency test to check the thickness of the sauce.

,









Melt an additional 1/4 cup of butter slowly into the demi glace over low heat. Stir the sauce continuously as the butter melts so it mixes completely into the sauce.

,









Use the finished demi glace as a glaze or drizzle over steaks or roasts. You can also serve demi glace on the side like a gravy. Demi glace is a concentrated sauce with strong flavor, so use it in moderation until you know your tastes.

Select your starch.,
Measure your starch into a separate bowl.,
Whisk in equal parts cold water.,
Whisk the slurry into your sauce.,
Bring to a simmer.,
Season if necessary.",How to Thicken Sauce1," Cornstarch is the most common to use for thickening, but you can also use potato starch, arrowroot flour, tapioca flour, or rice flour. When combined with liquids and heated, these starches swell and form a thickening gel.Flour isn’t recommended for this method because it has a strong flavor and doesn’t have the same thickening power as the other starches. Similarly, instant flour can be whisked directly into sauces without being mixed with water first, but it’s not recommended.
Starches are often used to thicken soups, gravies, fruit toppings, and savory or sweet sauces.;
, Use one tablespoon of starch for every cup of liquid you want to thicken., For every tablespoon of starch you added, add one tablespoon of cold water to the starch. Whisk until there are no lumps and the starch is fully incorporated.

, Pour the starch slurry slowly into the sauce you want to thicken, whisking constantly to incorporate the slurry into the sauce.

, To release the starch molecules, you must heat the sauce to a simmer, otherwise the starch won’t thicken.

, Since you’ve diluted the sauce by adding some water and starch, taste it again after thickening to see if you need to adjust any of the herbs or spices.

"

Select your gum.,
Combine guar gum or agar with liquids first.,
Add pectin or xanthan gum directly to sauces.",How to Thicken Sauce2," A few of the most familiar food gums that are used as thickening agents are xanthan gum, agar, pectin, and guar gum. They are popular because they only require small quantities to thicken, and they don’t alter the color or taste of sauces.Xanthan gum is a versatile thickener that can be used in most dressings and sauces, and will also act as a preservative.
Agar (sometimes referred to as agar agar) is often used commercially to thicken dairy-based products, and can be used as a gelatin substitute in fruit preserves and desserts. It comes powdered or in flakes.
Pectin is often used in jams and jellies, and fruit-based sweets, but it can also be used to thicken yogurt and dairy products.
Guar gum will thicken when it’s cold and can be added to baked goods to increase their fiber quantity.It’s most often used in salad dressings.

, Both agar and guar gum need to be mixed with other liquids before being added to sauces or dressings. Agar gets mixed and heated with water first, and guar gum can be added to oils already called for in the dressing recipe.


For agar flakes, use the ratio of one tablespoon of flakes per cup of liquid; for agar powder, use one teaspoon of powder per cup of liquid. Dissolve agar into four tablespoons of warm water in a saucepan. Bring to a boil on the stove, and boil for five to 10 minutes. Mix into sauce you want thickened.To thicken dressings with guar gum, use only one-half teaspoon per two and a half cups of liquid. Whisk or blend guar gum with oil called for in your dressing recipe before incorporating other ingredients., In the last 15 minutes of cooking, pectin and xanthan gum can be added right into your sauce. Pectin must be brought to a boil for at least one minute to activate the gelling action. Xanthan gum will thicken without being boiled.


Add three-quarters of a tablespoon of pectin per one cup of savory sauce, or 2 tablespoons of pectin per cup of sugar used in a sweet sauce. Whisk vigorously as the pectin comes to a boil and while it’s boiling.
Using the weight of your liquids as a base, add between 0.1 and one percent xanthan gum depending on the desired consistency. Vigorously whisk or blend xanthan gum into your sauce."

Place equal parts flour and butter in a bowl.,
Roll the dough into teaspoon-sized balls.,
Add individual balls to simmering sauce.",How to Thicken Sauce3," Beurre manié is French for kneaded butter, because you knead the butter and flour together. Using a fork or your fingers, knead the flour and butter together until a smooth paste or dough is formed.


You can use a food processor for larger quantities of beurre manié.
Beurre manié is an ideal way to thicken savory soups, gravies, and sauces.

, These portions will be added one at a time to whatever you are thickening.

, Whisk one ball of butter dough into your sauce at a time. For every ball you add, allow the sauce to simmer for at least one minute, giving it time to thicken, before adding another ball. Add balls of beurre manié like this until your sauce reaches the desired consistency.Leftover balls of beurre manié can be stored in the freezer for future use. Be sure to thaw to room temperature before adding to a sauce.

Choose a fat to use.,
Place fat into a sauce pan over medium heat.,
Stir in equal parts flour to the sauce pan.,
Stir while cooking.,
Remove from heat.,
Whisk the cooled roux into your sauce.,
Adjust seasonings as needed.",How to Thicken Sauce4," A roux is another French word that describes the paste created by cooking fat with equal parts flour. The recommended fats are oil, butter, or drippings. A roux can be used to thicken gravies, savory sauces, or soups.

, Depending on how thick you want your sauce, use between one and three tablespoons of fat plus equal amounts of flour per cup of liquid. For a thinner sauce, use one tablespoon of fat and one tablespoon of flour per cup of liquid; for a medium-thick sauce, use two tablespoons each of fat and flour; for a thick sauce, use three tablespoons each of fat and flour., Depending on how much fat you used, add the equivalent in flour to your butter or oil.

, For a basic white roux for thickening, cook the flour and fat together for a few minutes, until they are fully incorporated and start to froth.

, When the roux is cooked, set it aside and let it cool for a few moments. A hot roux will separate if you add it to a sauce.

, Bring the sauce to a simmer and cook for at least 20 minutes to cook off any remaining flour taste., If any herb or spice tastes have been lost in the thickening process, add them now prior to serving.

"
Crack an egg and separate the yolk from the white.,
Beat the egg yolk in a separate bowl.,
Add small amounts of liquid until you have a full cup.,
Whisk the egg mixture back into your sauce.",How to Thicken Sauce5," Using eggs as a thickening agent works best with custards, puddings, and rich cream sauces.

, As you whisk the egg, slowly ladle in small portions of your warm sauce (such as your Alfredo or pudding). This is called tempering the egg, which means that you slowly heat it so that you can add it to something hot without it immediately cooking and scrambling.

, Once you’ve added enough liquid, continue whisking for a few seconds so that the egg is fully incorporated into the liquid.

, Bring the sauce to a boil and simmer until it has thickened."
"
Bring your sauce to a simmer.,
Stir occasionally to prevent burning.,
Reduce until you achieve the desired consistency.",How to Thicken Sauce6," Don’t let it boil. This method works well with most sauces, because as a sauce heats up, the water will evaporate, leaving a thicker and more concentrated sauce behind.


Reducing a sauce will particularly concentrate sweet, sour, and salty flavors, but it may also boil off some of the herb and spice flavors, so taste the sauce as it reduces and be prepared to adjust the seasonings when it has fully reduced., As the water evaporates and the sauce reduces in quantity, it will continue thickening. Depending on what you’re making, your recipe may tell you to reduce the sauce to half, a third, or even a quarter of its original volume.

, If you aren’t working from a recipe, the rule of thumb is that a sauce is ready when it reaches nappé consistency, which basically means it will coat the back of a spoon without running off."

Measure out a tablespoon of potato flakes for every cup of sauce.,
Gradually add potato flakes to your sauce.,
Adjust the seasoning as necessary.",How to Thicken Sauce7," Potato flakes are pre-packaged dried mashed potatoes, and you can add them as a thickener to country-style sauces and rich gravies, stews, and soups. Avoid this method with clear sauces or sauces with delicate flavors.


This is a quick-fix thickening method, so the potato flake proportions are more to taste than an exact measurement.

, As your sauce simmers, add potato flakes a little at a time. Stir to incorporate, giving each addition time to thicken. Add more potato flakes as needed until the desired consistency is reached.


Adding foods like potatoes, pasta, or oats to a rich and savory sauce will also naturally thicken the sauce because of the starch present in the food.

, Before serving, taste your sauce and adjust the herbs and spices if the potato flakes have altered the flavor of the sauce.

",How to Make Hot Sauce1," Pepper selection is important. This will determine how mild or hot your sauce will be. Here is a small list of peppers and how they taste:



Jalapeños: These peppers are ideal for making mild sauces. They have a strong flavor with less kick than other peppers. They are typically green and about 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) with a curved shape. They look a little ""stubby"".
Serranos: These peppers look like jalapeños but are twice as hot. Use these peppers for a hotter sauce. They look similar to jalapeños but are not as wide. They're green when they're not ripe, but the color varies when they do ripen.
Pequin: These peppers look like small red berries. They have a unique flavor and are very hot. The difficulty encountered when using this pepper is obtaining a large enough quantity to make a good sauce.

Habanero: This pepper is one of the hottest of all peppers. Use this pepper if you want to burn your mouth with fire. It looks shriveled and is usually bright orange or red.
Bhut Jolokia: The ""ghost chili"" at over one million Scoville units. This rare chili comes from parts of India.;
, After selecting the pepper, you should further determine the heat your sauce by deciding on the appropriate quantity of peppers. Mild sauce will use half a pound (.23 kg) and hot will use 2 pounds (.9 kg).

Taste the sauce and season.",How to Make Garlic Cream Sauce2," Heat the oven to 400 F/ 204 C. Tear off a square of aluminum foil. The piece should be around a square foot in size.

, Take your whole head of garlic and set it on the middle of your aluminum square. Drizzle it with 1 1/2 tablespoons of olive oil. Then, wrap the aluminum foil around the garlic, sealing it in and making a pouch.

, Set your pouch of garlic in the oven, directly on a rack. Let it cook for 30 minutes. The garlic will be soft when it's finished cooking. Remove it from the oven and foil. Let it cool.

, The individual cloves of garlic should be soft enough that you can squeeze them right into the pan. Do this for the entire head of garlic. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons of olive oil and heat a minute over medium heat.

, Add the flour to the sauté pan and stir well, making sure to reach all areas of the pan so that the flour is completely incorporated. Continue to stir while cooking the mixture, or roux. The roux should start to darken a bit in color.

, You can simply microwave the stock while your roux is cooking, or you can heat the stock in a pot on the stove. Don't let it boil.

, Very gradually pour the stock into your roux while whisking with your other hand. This should be a slow process so that the stock has a chance to be absorbed into the roux without separating into clumps.

, Keep the temperature around medium, or medium-low if it starts to boil. The sauce will start to thicken up pretty quickly.


You should notice a lot of evaporation as the sauce reduces to about half of the volume. Stirring frequently will help prevent scorching, or burning.

, Stir to combine the stock/garlic mixture and cream. Remove the sauté pan from heat.

, You can either use an immersion blender or regular blender. If using an immersion blender, transfer the sauce to a deep bowl. Then, stick the immersion blender in it and process until the sauce is smooth. If using a regular blender, transfer the sauce to the blender and blitz until smooth.


Blending the sauce will also smooth out any lumps of roux you might not have whisked completely.

, Add salt and pepper, according to your taste. Use immediately or return the sauce to the sauté pan, where you can keep it warm over low heat.

Making caramel sauce is a fast process; if you are wasting time looking for ingredients when your sugar is burning, you're not going to end up with caramel sauce you'll want to eat.;
, On medium-low heat, add the butter and sugar to a heavy-bottomed, 2- or 3-quart saucepan..



Do not stir the sugar and butter as it dissolves. If you need to, swirl the mixture gently to combine the ingredients, but not much. You want the caramelization to start from the bottom and let it work its way up.

, Leave the sugar and butter mixture on medium-low for 5 to 8 minutes. Keep an eye on the caramel sauce. Swirl the mixture if necessary to prevent burning, but do not stir.


If you find that you end up burning some of the sugar before the rest of it is melted, the next time you attempt your caramel sauce, add a half cup of water to the sugar at the beginning of the process. This is called a ""wet"" caramel sauce. (See below.)
The wet caramel sauce recipe will help the sugar to cook more evenly, although it will take longer to cook—the water will need to evaporate before the sugar will begin to caramelize.

, After 5 to 8 minutes, the mixture should turn a light brown. You should still see small bunches of sugar crystals which have not yet crystallized.


If sugar crystals start forming on the sides of the pan, use a brush to wipe them back down into the mixture.

, Continue cooking until the remaining crystals caramelize and bubbles start to form. The color should be deep auburn. This could take two minutes, or it could take another five.


This is the time to really guard against burning. You don't want to leave the sauce unattended at this point.
If you're worried about the sauce burning, you can turn the heat down to low. It's better to take a little longer cooking, than to hurry the process and burn the caramel.
Keep resisting the urge to stir. Swirl if you need to, but don't stir yet!

, After all the sugar crystals have caramelized, take the pot off the burner, and mix in the cream a little at a time. Now is the time when you can finally use a whisk to stir.


Mix in the cream in small batches and stir vigorously. The mixture will foam up and grow in volume.
As you mix in the rest of the cream, the sauce will turn a darker color. The sauce will keep on bubbling as the cream gets incorporated into the sugar and butter.

, Pour the caramel into a heat-resistant bowl or jar, through a strainer. Any uncaramelized crystals left will not make it into the final mixture.

, Except, of course, the caramel that you put on your ice cream!


Store in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks. Warm it up before serving.

Large mixing bowl
Food processor
Mixing spoon
Sterilized jars and lids for storage;
, With a small knife, cut the stem from the tomatoes by cutting an angled hole around the stem, about a half inch (13 mm) deep. Pop the stem out of the tomato.


To prepare the tomatoes for blanching, cut a small and shallow X in the bottom of each one.

, Blanching means to boil something for a brief time and then drop it into ice water to stop the cooking process. Blanching helps to make vegetables more vibrant in color, and makes them easier to peel. To blanch the tomatoes:Fill a large pot with water and bring it to a boil over medium-high heat. Fill a large bowl with equal amounts of ice and water.
When the water is boiling, boil the tomatoes in batches of four or five. Leave each batch in for 45 seconds to a minute, until the skin begins to split.

You can leave the sauce chunky, or continue pureeing until it’s smooth.If you don’t have a food processor or blender, you can chop the tomatoes into small pieces with a knife.

, Transfer the tomatoes to a large pot. Heat them over medium heat and bring them to a simmer. For a thinner and runnier sauce, simmer the tomatoes for about 30 minutes. For a thicker and richer sauce, simmer for 90 minutes. For a sauce that’s between thick and runny, simmer for about an hour.


While the sauce is simmering, you can also add a few other ingredients for flavor, such as a few cloves of minced garlic, a bay leaf, or a couple sprigs of fresh basil or oregano., When the sauce has reached the desired consistency, add the red wine vinegar and salt.

While you’re waiting for the water to boil, place cold water in a large bowl until it’s halfway full and add a couple of handfuls of ice to make an ice water bath for the tomatoes., Once the water has come to a boil, place 2 pounds (907 g) of ripe tomatoes in the pot. Add the tomatoes one at a time, though, to prevent splashing. Leave the tomatoes in the water for approximately 45 seconds to a minute, or until their skins begin to split.Any kind of red tomatoes will work for the sauce, but roma tomatoes are a good option. You can also do a combination of several types of tomatoes.
Use a pair of tongs to drop the tomatoes into the boiling water so you don’t burn yourself.

, When the tomatoes have sat in the boiling water for approximately 45 seconds, use your tongs to remove them from the pot and drop them into the ice water bath. Let them sit until their skins begin to crack and peel away from the fruit.Depending on how large your ice water bath is, you may need to boil and bathe the tomatoes in small batches so you don’t overcrowd them.

, After the tomatoes’ skin begins to crack, remove them from the ice water and use your fingers to gently peel away the skin. Use a sharp knife to roughly chop the tomatoes, cutting away any hard pieces.While you can throw away the tomato skin, you may want to save it to make your own tomato paste.

, Place a large bowl on your work surface, and gently squeeze the tomatoes over it to remove any excess water and seeds. Next, place the tomatoes in a strainer over the bowl and press again to remove any seeds that you might have missed.You don’t have to remove all of the seeds, but try to get rid of as many as you can.

, Place 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of olive oil in a medium saucepan. Turn the heat to medium-low, and allow the oil to heat until it starts to shimmer, which should take approximately 3 to 5 minutes.You can use whatever type of olive oil you prefer, but extra virgin will provide the best flavor for the sauce.

, When the olive oil is heated, mix 1 medium onion that’s been finely chopped into the pan. Let the onion cook on medium-low until it softens and becomes translucent, which should take approximately 5 to 7 minutes.Stir the onion periodically to ensure that it cooks evenly. You don’t want it to brown or color at all.

, Once the onion is softened and translucent, add 2 to 3 cloves of crushed garlic to the pan. Mix it with the onion, and allow the mixture to cook for another 2 minutes.You can add the garlic according to your tastes. Add 3 cloves or more if you like a strong, garlic flavor. Limit it to 2 cloves if you prefer a milder taste.

, When the onion and garlic have cooked for a couple of minutes, mix the chopped tomatoes into the pan. Use a wooden spoon to break the tomatoes further as you stir them into the onions and garlic., After the tomatoes are mixed with the onion and garlic, mix in 1 teaspoon (4 g) of sugar, a dash of red wine vinegar, and 3 stems from fresh basil, putting the leaves aside for use later. Add salt and pepper to taste as well, and stir until all of the ingredients are well combined.If you don’t want as a sharp a taste in the sauce, you can substitute red wine for the red wine vinegar.

, Once the ingredients are fully combined, turn the heat on the pan up to medium. Allow the sauce to come to a simmer, which should take approximately 3 to 5 minutes., When the sauce has come to a full simmer, lower the heat to medium-low. Let the sauce cook until it becomes thick, which should take approximately 45 minutes. Be sure to stir the sauce occasionally as it simmers to ensure that it cooks evenly.If you prefer a thinner sauce, simmer it for longer. The longer it cooks, the thinner it will becomes.
If you want a smoother sauce, you can run it through a blender or use an immersion blender in the pan after it’s simmered.

, After the sauce has thickened, roughly tear the basil leaves and mix them into the pan. Give the sauce a taste, and add more salt and pepper if necessary.If you want a spicy tomato sauce, commonly known as arrabiata sauce, mix in a pinch or two of crushed red pepper with the basil., Just before you’re ready to serve the tomato sauce, drizzle a little extra virgin olive oil into the sauce. Mix gently, so the oil doesn’t just pool on the top of the sauce.You can omit the oil, but if you’re going to add it, make sure to use extra virgin olive oil.

Choose high quality tomatoes.,
Boil the tomatoes whole.,
Quickly dip the tomatoes into a bowl of ice water.,
Slide the skins off.,
Cut the tomatoes into halves.,
Scoop out the seeds and squeeze out the water.,
Drain the tomatoes.",How to Can Tomato Sauce2," In general, Roma tomatoes tend to work well for canned sauces because they contain less water and create a thicker sauce. Beefsteak, lemon boy, and better boy varieties also work well. Regardless of the type used, the tomatoes should be ripe and firm. Avoid using tomatoes that are mushy, bruised, or rotten.

, Set a large pot of water to a boil. Plunge each tomato into the boiling water for 30 to 45 seconds before removing it with a heat-resistant spoon or tongs.

, Immediately after the tomatoes are removed from the boiling water, they should be plunged into a bowl of ice water. This loosens the skins, making them easier to peel off for your sauce.

, You should be able to remove the skins by peeling them back with your fingers at this point, but if not, you can slide a smooth, sharp knife in between the skin and the meat of the tomato to begin the process.

, Remove the stem and the tough parts around the stem. Also remove any bruised, soft sections of the tomato.

, Hold each tomato half over a sink or extra bowl. Gently squeeze the half to drain it of excess water and the remove a good portion of the seeds. After the tomato is mostly dry, take a spoon to clear out the remaining seeds. You do not need to remove every last seed, but you should try to get most of them out.

, Place the tomato halves into a colander placed over the sink or over a large bowl. Allow the tomatoes to drain for 15 minutes or so. Removing as much moisture as possible will leave you with a much thicker sauce, and it will also reduce the amount of cooking time needed to create the sauce.

, Stir frequently to promote even cooking and to reduce burning.

, Stir the new ingredients into the onions until evenly distributed. Allow the mixture to cook for another minute or two.

, Give the contents of the stockpot a good mix. Due to the large volume of tomatoes, it may take a few minutes of stirring before you see that the ingredients have mixed together evenly. Heat to a boil.

, Simmering the mixture for 15 to 30 minutes should be enough to break the tomatoes down and create a chunky sauce. You may need to simmer the sauce longer if you want something a little thinner, though. For a thinner sauce, allow the contents to simmer until the volume is reduced by one-third. For a thick, smooth sauce, simmer until the contents are reduced by one-half.

Let the syrup cool.",How to Make Vanilla Syrup1," Give the ingredients a few good stirs to mix them well. The sugar will not dissolve right away. This is OK.


Almost any medium-sized pot will do. You may want to avoid cast iron — it can be tricky to clean syrup off of.;
, Set a burner to medium-high heat and stay near the stove. Stir every minute or so. As soon as the water reaches a gentle but steady boil, reduce the heat slightly to maintain this simmer.

, This usually takes about three minutes or so, but it's a matter of personal preference.Feel free to let the mixture boil for longer if you want a thicker syrup. Stir often.


As the mixture boils, the water will evaporate and enter the air as vapor. However, the sugar will remain, which causes the mixture to get thicker.

, When the syrup has reached your desired thickness, remove it from the heat. Carefully pour the vanilla extract in. Stir to combine.

, When the syrup is at a pleasantly warm temperature, it's ready to consume or add to your dish. Enjoy! See the ""Serving Suggestions"" section below if you're looking for ideas of how to use your syrup.


Be very careful about spilling or touching the syrup while it's still hot. Its stickiness can make it very hard to get off, which can lead to bad burns.
If you don't want to use the syrup immediately, you can also transfer it to an airtight container and store it in the fridge. Since it's mostly sugar and water, it won't go bad for a very long time.

Bottle and store the syrup.",How to Make Yacon Syrup at Home,"

If you grow your own Yacon roots at home, dig up some of your roots (depending on how much syrup you'd like to make). If you have a large area of roots, it is advisable to harvest the most mature plants. Once you've collected the roots, wash them under a pressurized hose to remove any dirt residue.
If you purchase Yacon roots at the market, select the healthiest and freshest-looking roots. Take them home and rinse them in your sink to remove any residue left on the roots.;
, Using either a potato peeler or a paring knife, peel the Yacon roots and discard the peels. Take out your food processor and put all of the peeled roots inside, then juice them., Pour the Yacon juice into a pot, then put the pot on the stove. Cook the juice on medium heat until you see a film developing. Skim the film off of the top and the sides, then bring the juice to a boil for a few minutes before letting it simmer overnight. The next day, bring the juice to a boil again and skim the film off of the top and sides. At this point the juice should be darker and smell like molasses or treacle., Let the juice cool down, then use a sieve to strain the syrup. The thin liquid that can pass through the sieve is the syrup itself, and the thicker material that remains in the sieve can either be discarded or put in a separate container and used to sweeten foods., Pour the strained syrup into a bottle or container of your choice, then place it in the fridge so that it will keep longer."

Try using a fresh vanilla bean, rather than extract.,
Try using a mix of brown and white sugar.,
Add fruit juice for sweet variations.,
Add herbs for a more complex flavor.,
Try using alcohol instead of water to make a flavored liqueur.",How to Make Vanilla Syrup2," There's no beating fresh, natural ingredients — even when it comes to something like syrup. Actual vanilla beans can be a little more expensive than liquid extracts, but the taste difference is noticeable. Use the steps below to slit a vanilla bean so you can use its flavorful insides:Set the vanilla bean on a cutting board. Use a sharp knife to carefully split it down the middle, making two long and skinny halves.
Press one half flat against the cutting board. Use the dull side of your knife to scrape the inner filling out of the bean. You may need to press down fairly hard to get it all out.
Add the scrapings to your recipe in place of vanilla extract. One bean's worth of scrapings usually equals about three teaspoons (one tablespoon) of extract., When it comes to making syrup, both kinds of sugar work wonderfully. The rich, molasses-like taste of brown sugar can add dimensions to the syrup's flavor, so some prefer it to the ordinary white variety. This is also a great way to use up dry, caked brown sugar from the pantry. You're dissolving it, so its starting texture doesn't matter.


If you're using the basic syrup recipe above, try adding 3/4 cup of brown sugar in addition to the two cups of white sugar. You'll also want to add 1/2 to 3/4 cup of water to compensate for the extra sugar., Vanilla's great on its own, but one of the best things about its neutral flavor is that it pairs well with so many different things. For example, you can try replacing part (or all) of the water in the basic syrup recipe with fruit juice to make a custom fruit flavor. A few juice ideas are below:


Orange juice (for an orange creamsicle syrup)
Berry juice (for berries and cream syrup)
Apple juice (for apple pie and ice cream syrup)
Most supermarket fruit juices are quite sugary on their own, so try halving the sugar in the recipe if your fruit syrup comes out too sweet.

, Using common herbs, you can add delicious infusions to a basic vanilla syrup recipe. Try adding the example herbs below (or your own favorites) to the syrup after it has cooled, then letting them soak for an hour or two. For best results, always use fresh herbs — never dried ones. Use two sprigs per recipe except where noted.Rosemary
Thyme
Lavender
Basil (one to three leaves, crushed)

, Mixing adult beverages? Substitute hard alcoholic liquor for water in the basic syrup recipe to make a sweet vanilla liqueur. This makes a fun group activity when you're drinking with friends — just be sure to make the liqueur before you start drinking to avoid accidents with the hot syrup.


Generally, you'll want to use a liquor with a neutral flavor so that the vanilla (and whatever other ingredients you've added) can shine. 80-proof non-flavored vodka works well (and can be fairly cheap).

Try with berries or peaches instead of cream.",How to Make Vanilla Syrup3," Vanilla syrup is a versatile ingredient when it comes to drinks. A few spoonfuls in any bitter beverage will give it a delicious creamy flavor. Below are just a few ideas for drinks you may want to try your syrup in:


Coffee or tea
Hot cocoa
Lattes, etc. — note that chains like Starbucks use vanilla syrup to make their vanilla-flavored drinks.
Italian sodas
Cocktails

, Vanilla syrup is a great topping for desserts. Its rich flavor goes well with most types of ice cream (except, perhaps, vanilla). You can even add it to chocolate ice cream for a ""backwards"" version of a typical ice cream sundae. Cakes, pies, and other sweet confections also go well with the syrup.


For a lower-calorie treat, try your syrup on frozen yogurt instead.

, Maple syrup may be the gold standard for pancakes, but vanilla syrup can make this breakfast classic into a decadent dessert. Try this combination on its own, or, if you're cooking breakfast for a group, set out a selection of spreads, fruits, and other toppings and let your guests make their own choices.

, Vanilla's rich, sweet flavor satisfies the same urge as whipping cream, only with less fat (and more sugar). Try serving strawberries, blueberries, peach slices, or your other favorite ""...and cream"" fruits with vanilla syrup for a new spin on an old dessert favorite.

Know the benefits and disadvantages of maple syrup.,
Select a genuine maple syrup.,
Find the right recipe.,
Substitute one cup (150 g) white sugar with ¾ cup (105 g) maple syrup.,
Experiment with other substitutions and sweeteners.,
Try a maple-specific recipe, such as maple ice cream.",How to Sweeten Foods with Maple Syrup1," Sweetening a dessert with maple syrup rather than refined sugar can be a delicious way to liven up your favorite, treacly treat, but you should know that it’s not an identical sugar substitute. Perhaps most importantly, you should know that maple syrup cannot leaven or moisten baked goods—that is, add air and water to them—as sugar does, so your finished product will come out denser and drier than the original, refined sugar recipe.It will also yield a slightly less sweet product, and it will darken your dessert due to its natural brown coloring.;
, Oddly enough, your fondest memories of maple syrup-drenched pancakes might not involve maple syrup at all! That’s because many of the syrups people think are maple—such as popular brands like Aunt Jemima—are actually just high fructose corn syrup with an aromatic additive to mimic the flavor and smell of maple. In order to avoid these insidious imposters, check the label and make sure it says ‘maple,’ rather than ‘pancake syrup’ or ‘breakfast syrup.’You should also consider what kind of maple syrup you’re purchasing. Grade A has a subtler flavor and a lighter coloring, while Grade B is darker, thicker, and stronger. Also, expect to pay more for a bottle of Grade A than you will for a bottle of B., It’s best to use maple syrup in items that don’t require creaming—that is, beating sugar and butter together so that the granulated sugar cuts air bubbles in the butter and leavens the pastry. Add it instead to no-bake goods, such as candies, caramels, no-bake cookies and brownies, and ice creams.If you really want to add maple flavor to your baked goods, use granulated maple sugar—essentially evaporated maple syrup—instead of syrup. The ratio for this substitution is 1:1., When using maple syrup instead of refined sugar in your desserts, you should use three quarters of the amount of sugar which the recipe demands. Otherwise, follow the original recipe in all other respects, including cooking and refrigeration times.If you’re using maple syrup in a baked good despite the caveats, reduce all the other liquids in the recipe by three tablespoons.

, If your maple-sweetened dessert turned out just right, great! If not, you can try the substitution trick on other recipes, or try the same recipe again while combining the maple syrup with other sweeteners, such as molasses. Practice and tinkering will (eventually) make perfect!

, You don’t have to limit your experimentation to old recipes where you replace the ingredient of refined sugar with maple syrup. Instead, try using a dessert recipe that originally called for it. For example, you can make your very own walnut-maple ice cream by mixing water, coconut butter, maple syrup, and sea salt, then freezing, and blending the mixture in a food processor with walnuts.Alternatively, no-bake maple brownies contain just five ingredients—coconut flour, cocoa powder, a nut butter of your choice, maple syrup, and pumpkin puree—and take only minutes to make!"

You can make baked beans with molasses on the stove top or in a slow cooker. Bake the beans from scratch with the molasses or add molasses to canned beans for extra flavor and sweetness.

Follow a simple recipe for stove top baked beans using two tablespoons of molasses, Dijon mustard, and two apples for sweetness.Prepare baked beans in the slow cooker with ¼ cup molasses., If you enjoy smoothies in the morning to help you start your day, try adding molasses for nutrients and natural sweetness. Molasses is a good addition to smoothies if you are vegetarian or vegan, as it is high in iron and easy for your body to absorb.

Use molasses for skincare and haircare.",How to Use Blackstrap Molasses3," Blackstrap molasses is high in iron, vitamin B, and other minerals. It is a good natural remedy if you suffer from anemia, where you feel fatigued due to an iron-deficiency. Make sure you use organic, unsulphured blackstrap molasses for this remedy.Prepare the molasses by dissolving 1 tablespoon in hot water. Have one dose of molasses a day to help with your anemia.

, Blackstrap molasses can be used to help treat constipation. The magnesium content in molasses can encourage your colon to work properly and get your bowels moving. Take one tablespoon of molasses before bed at night. Dilute the molasses in a cup of hot water, milk, prune juice, or fruit juice if the taste is too strong.You can try increasing the amount to two tablespoons a night if you are really constipated. However, do not take more than two tablespoons as a time and try to decrease the amount of molasses you take every night over time.

, Blackstrap molasses contains nutrients that can help reduce menstrual cramps, particularly vitamin B6, iron, potassium, calcium, and magnesium. Take 1 to 3 teaspoons of blackstrap molasses a day while you are menstruating to reduce your cramps. You can also add a spoonful of molasses to herbal tea and drink it that way to help treat cramping.Do not take more than 6 teaspoons of molasses a day. Having too much molasses can lead to loose stools.
If you have diabetes, do not take blackstrap molasses on a daily basis as it is high in sugar.

, Blackstrap molasses can be used to help treat skin conditions like acne, eczema, and rosacea. Make a nourishing face wash out of molasses by diluting 1-2 teaspoons of molasses in warm water and then let it cool. Apply it to your skin and leave it on for five minutes before rinsing it off with water.Blackstrap molasses can also be used to hydrate your hair.

Add molasses to the soil.,
Put molasses in your compost.,
Use molasses as an insect repellant.",How to Use Blackstrap Molasses4," Blackstrap molasses is a good supplement for your garden, as it contains micro and macro nutrients and boosts the moisture and growth in the soil. Use organic, unsulphured blackstrap molasses in your garden for the best results. Add the molasses to the soil in small doses, starting with 1 tablespoon of molasses per gallon of water during feedings. You can then increase the amount of molasses, especially as flowers or plants start to grow. Flowering plants require more potassium, which the molasses can provide.

, You can also add blackstrap molasses to your compost to improve the nutrients in the compost. Start by adding a few tablespoons of molasses into the compost. Then use the compost in your garden.Adding molasses to your compost is a good idea if the soil in your garden is poor or low in nutrients. Compost with molasses can encourage plant growth when added to the soil.

, The sugars in molasses can help repel and kill common garden pests and insects. The molasses will help to encourage the growth of microbes, which will enrich the soil, and reduce the presence of pests. Add 1 teaspoon per gallon of water to your garden to help repel insects.Make sure you dilute the molasses in warm water so it dissolves before you add it to the watering system for your garden.

If you're more of a tea person than a coffee person, try maple syrup in your tea instead! Maple goes particularly well with green tea and lemon flavors., Since it’s the first time you’re experimenting with maple syrup in your coffee, start with a teaspoon when first testing the new combo. Sip the result and decide if it’s sweet enough for your taste or not.

, Now simply add as much—or as little—maple syrup as you like! Just keep in mind that one tablespoon of maple syrup contains 52 calories and 12.4 grams of sugar.

Select a root vegetable, such as squash, carrots, or sweet potatoes.,
Blend olive oil or butter with maple syrup.,
Slather the mixture on your vegetables.,
Roast until soft.,
Serve vegetables with a grain or protein.",How to Sweeten Foods with Maple Syrup3," When selecting the ingredients for your recipe, think about hearty root vegetables that stand up well to roasting. Butternut squash, carrots, beets, parsnips, and sweet potatoes all roast beautifully in the oven, and their flavor profiles mesh beautifully with maple.


You can choose to roast just one kind of vegetable for your dish, or chop and mix together several different kinds.

, Depending on how many root vegetables you’re working with, you should mix about ½ cup (170 g) maple syrup with two tablespoons (28.6 g) butter or olive oil for every 2.5 pounds (1 kg) of vegetable. Add salt or pepper according to your usual cooking preferences.You can also experiment with more elaborate glazes, such as ones including chicken broth, garlic powder, honey, or rosemary., Drizzle the maple glaze on top of the vegetables and gently toss them in a bowl to make sure the glaze distributes evenly. Then lay the coated vegetables evenly on a baking sheet.

, Roasting times can vary significantly among different root vegetables, so the basic rule-of-thumb is that you should roast until your veggies become tender and start to brown. Check your oven often to make sure that you don’t burn them., Roasted vegetables go well with just about anything, but they pair particularly well with grains, such as quinoa or rice. If you want something a bit heartier, serve them alongside a portion of meat, such as lean red meat, pork chops, grilled chicken, or fish.You can also use your roasted vegetables in a soup, or you can mix them up with eggs for a hearty, healthy omelet!"

Choose your sugar.,
Measure water and sugar.,
Heat and stir.,
Wash sugar off the side.,
Set aside the syrup to cool.,
Sterilize a container.,
Store the syrup.",How to Make Sugar Syrup1," White, granulated sugar is the default for simple syrup, but you do have other options. Superfine sugar reduces the risk of crystallization. A raw brown sugar such as turbinado or demerara creates a brown, molasses-flavored syrup good for rum or bourbon cocktails.Do not use confectioner's sugar (powdered sugar). This usually contains cornstarch, which does not dissolve in water. The syrup will be cloudy or grainy.;
, Measure the sugar and water and combine in a saucepan. Use an equal amount of both ingredients for a basic syrup. For a more concentrated syrup, use up to twice as much sugar as water.


A more concentrated syrup has a higher risk of crystallizing back into solids, but will last longer in the fridge. Some bartenders prefer a concentrated syrup because it can sweeten a cocktail without adding too much water.
For greater accuracy, measure ingredients by weight on a kitchen scale. Using volume measurements (cups or milliliters) won't cause major issue, but you'll end up with about ⅞ the amount of sugar., Turn on the heat under your sugar-water mixture. Stir until all the sugar crystals have dissolved. The sugar usually dissolves within a few minutes, but a large batch may take longer.


Do not let the mixture boil. If you lose too much water, the sugar may not be able to dissolve.
For very concentrated syrups (at least a 2:1 ratio of sugar to water), stir the last bits of water gently. Too much stirring when the maximum amount of sugar has dissolved can cause crystals to reform., A single grain of sugar left in the syrup can create a large mass of solid crystals. If you see any sugar left on the side of the pot, brush it down to the syrup using a wet pastry brush. Alternatively, just put the lid on the pot for a few minutes, and the condensed water should run down the sides and clean them.Because the lid traps most of the water vapor, it's all right if the syrup boils for a short time while the lid is on. To be safe, stick with a brief simmer.

, it will be ready to store once it reaches room temperature.


If the sugar crystallizes when it cools, either too much water boiled away, or not all the sugar dissolved. Add a little water and heat it up again.

, Bring a small, separate pot of water to a boil. Once boiled, pour directly into a clean jar or bottle. Pour boiling water over the lid of the container as well.Sterilizing the container will reduce the chance that your syrup re-crystallizes, and prolong shelf life.


Unless using immediately, store in a clear container so you can watch for signs of mold.

, Dump the hot water out of the container, and immediately pour in the room temperature syrup. Fasten the lid and store in the refrigerator.


A 1:1 syrup stays good for about one month.
A 2:1 syrup stays good for about six months.
To keep your syrup useful for much longer, stir in a spoonful of high-proof vodka."

Caramelize the syrup.",How to Make Sugar Syrup2," Sugar will dissolve in room temperature water, if you shake it hard enough. Because there's no heat to sterilize the syrup, this version will only last about two weeks. As far as taste goes, bartenders have lined up on both sides of the hot-cold debate. Give it a whirl and decide for yourself:Combine equal parts sugar and water in a sealed container. (Using superfine sugar may shorten the shaking time.)Shake for three minutes, then let rest for one minute.
Shake for another 30 seconds, or until all sugar is dissolved.

, Simmer the syrup with herbs or spices for about 30–45 minutes to extract flavors.Try cinnamon and nutmeg syrup for winter holiday desserts, or basil syrup for sophisticated cocktails.


If using herbs, remove them as soon as they turn brown.Strain out leaves once the syrup is done.
The addition of other ingredients may shorten the shelf life. Stir a spoonful of vodka into the cooled syrup to prevent mold.

, Adding gum arabic to the syrup creates a silky texture, and lowers the chance of crystallization. This old-fashioned recipe is making a small comeback due to the appealing texture it lends to cocktails:Bring water nearly to a boil. Slowly mix in an equal amount gum arabic, by weight. Stir until gluey and mostly combined.
Let sit for two to three hours, off the heat. Stir again to work in lumps.
Start making sugar syrup, as above. Use twice as much water as you did for the gum arabic.
Once sugar is dissolved, reduce to a simmer. Stir in gum arabic mixture slowly, while stirring.
Let cool, then skim off and discard scum from the top of the syrup.

, Add this dark caramel flavor to whiskey cocktails or a bittersweet chocolate cake. Wear gloves and stand back from the pan, as molten sugar can cause severe burns. Try it out as follows:Heat the sugar (alone) in a stainless steel saucepan, stirring once every 30 seconds.
For caramel syrup: Add water as soon as the sugar melts. This will cause spattering and steaming, so stand back as you pour. Stir rapidly and constantly until syrup forms.
For burnt caramel syrup: Turn on stove ventilation or open windows — there will likely be smoke. Wait until sugar forms thick bubbles, than (in another 15 seconds or so) turns dark. Add water and stir carefully. It may take a while for the solid sugar to dissolve.

, You can use crushed, dried herbs, but avoid using ground spices; they will be too hard to filter out. If you'd like to make several different flavors, pour the simple syrup into jars first, then add your desired herbs or spices. Here are some ideas to get you started:


4 cinnamon sticks, broken in half.1 tablespoon lemon, lime, grapefruit, or orange zest.1 tablespoon dried herbs, such as thyme, lavender, or rose petals.3 to 4 fresh rosemary, thyme, or lavender sprigs.1 cup (25 grams) fresh mint or basil leaves.½ vanilla bean pod, seeds scraped and added in., During this time, the herbs, spices, or flowers you added will steep and release their flavors into the simple syrup., They may look pretty in the jar, but they will shorten the shelf life of the syrup.Place a fine, mesh strainer or sieve over a glass jar or bottle, and pour the simple syrup through it. Discard the herbs, spices, or flowers that get caught in the strainer.

You can discard the leafy bits, or save them for later to eat as a green. Next, wash the beets under warm, running water. Use a vegetable or clean, plastic scrubber to make sure that all of the dirt is removed.Store the leafy greens in a sealed container in the refrigerator if you plan on eating them later.;
, Use a sharp knife to cut the sugar beats into thin slices. Any sharp knife, like a chef’s knife or serrated knife will do. If you have a food processor, you can use that to shred them instead.Make sure to cut the beets on a cutting board, or you risk cutting into the counter or table top.

, Put the sliced beets into a saucepan and cover them with water. Turn the heat to medium and cook the beets until tender. You can poke them with a fork to make sure they are tender enough. You should stir the beets about every five minutes to prevent them from sticking to the pan.You should use a large or medium saucepan.

, Once your beets are tender, pour them through a colander. You should have a container, like a large bowl, underneath to hold the beet water. You can use the sugar beets however you want after you separate them from the water. You can use them in a recipe immediately after, or you can store them in the refrigerator to be used later.You should store the beets in an airtight container. Try to use them as soon as possible.

, Pour the beet water in a medium saucepan and bring it to a boil. You should boil it until the beet water turns into a thick syrup. Once it has turned into a syrup, turn the heat off and allow the molasses to cool.Allow the molasses to cool for at least thirty minutes.
Use a spoon to check the consistency of the syrup.

, Once it has cooled, put the molasses into an airtight container. Store the container in a place that maintains a room temperature. It should last for up to 18 months. Once the container is opened, you can store it in the refrigerator, but it often grows thick and harder to pour once refrigerated. As it ages, the top layer will begin to crystallize and become what is known as beet sugar. You will need to remove this top layer.You can crush the beet sugar and store it in another air tight container for use.
Write the date that the molasses was prepared on the container it is stored in. The molasses has gone bad if it becomes moldy or fermented."

Choose sorghum or sugarcane.,
Purchase or prepare the cane.,
Strain the juice.,
Place the pot over a heat source.,
Turn the heat off.,
Bottle the molasses.",How to Make Molasses2," Sugarcane is the most common sources of molasses, but sorghum can be used as well. Sorghum is often used as an alternative to sugarcane since sugarcane only grows in tropical and sub-tropical location. Sorghum grows in a temperate climate and is often more accessible than sugarcane.Sorghum canes are typically harvested in late fall, like late September or early October, before the first frost hits. You can tell the canes are ready for harvesting when the cluster of seeds at the top of the canes have turned yellow or brown.
Sugarcane is ready to be harvested when leaves have dried up and become yellow or brown. The plant core structure should be weak., If you do not purchase prepared sorghum or sugarcane, you will need to prepare it from harvest. First, strip all of the the leaves from the cane with a sharp knife or by hand. Then, cut the seeds off with a sharp knife or machete. Next, cut the stalk as close to the ground as possible. Leave the stalks up against a rack for a week and then run them through a mill. Keep a container under the mill to collect the liquid.It is better to purchase if you do not have access to a harvest or mill.
You will probably have to cut the stalks about five or six inches from the ground to avoid soil contamination.
The debris, stalk, and pulp can be composted or kept to be used for other process later on.

, Take the liquid that you have collected in a container and strain it through a cheese cloth or fine sack. This will remove any large particles. Once the juice has been strained, pour it into a large boiler pan.The size of the pot depends on how much juice you have. Typically, the pot should be at least 6 inches deep.

, Put the pot over a stove top or other heat source. Bring it to a boil. Once it is boiling, bring the heat to a low and constant temperature that is just high enough for a steady boil. Allow the juice to boil for six hours. Skim off any green substance that forms at the top of the molasses.Stir regularly during the six hours to prevent sugar from sticking to the bottom of the pot.
Skim the green substance off with a large spoon of molasses strainer.

, You can turn off the heat when the molasses has turned from green to yellow, or when it gets thick and small strands appear as you stir. Turn the heat off and remove the pot from the heat source. At this point, you can allow it cool and boil it again two or three more times for thicker, darker molasses.Light molasses is made from the first boil. It is thinner and sweeter than molasses that has been boiled two or three times.Dark molasses is the product of the second boil. It is darker, thicker, less sweet, and stronger in flavor than light molasses.
Blackstrap molasses is the product of the third and final boil. It is the thickest, darkest, and least sweet type of molasses.

, Once you are satisfied with the color and consistency, pour the molasses into a container while it is hot. It is easier to handle while it is hot. Make sure to use an airtight container. If using glass, heat it before pouring hot molasses into it or the glass may crack. Store in a room temperature (or colder) area for up to 18 months.The top layer will crystallize and turn into sugar after a while. You will to remove this top layer. You can crush it and store it in another container.

Pour the mixture into a saucepan.,
Check on the mixture after an hour.,
Store the molasses.",How to Make Molasses3," Molasses can be made by starting with pomegranate fruit, or by starting with pomegranate juice. It is easier to start with pomegranate juice because you will need to take apart and juice the fruit anyway. Either way, you will end up with the same result.Any type of pomegranate juice will do. Just make sure it is actually made from pomegranates, instead of artificial flavoring.

, You will need 6-7 pomegranates. If you are starting with the actual fruit, you will need to take it apart in order to juice it. First, find the crown of the pomegranate. Then, take a paring knife and make a circular incision into the crown. Score the pomegranate. Next, tear the pomegranate into sections. Remove the arils (seed pods) by prying them loose. Once you have opened it, you should be removing the arils over a medium-sized bowl filled with water. Repeat this step for each of the 6-7 pomegranates.Put a newspaper or paper towels underneath the pomegranate while you are opening it.

, You do not need to worry about this step if you are starting with pomegranate juice. At this point, most of the seeds should be floating in water in your bowl. Remove membrane from the bowl and drain the water. Then, pour the arils into a high-speed blender and blend it until it looks like a smoothie. Next, strain the juice through a fine-mesh strainer. Pour the juice in a container.You should have enough for 4 cups of juice.

, Add lemon and sugar to the juice to create a mixture. You will need ½ cup, or 100 grams (3.5 oz), of sugar and ¼ cup (50ml) of lemon juice, which is equal to about one medium-sized lemon. Stir the mixture thoroughly.Adding sugar and lemon keeps the molasses fresher for longer, as well as making the molasses have a sweet and tart flavor., Put the saucepan onto stove on medium-high heat. Bring it to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium-low when the juice begins to boil. The mixture should be bubbling slightly at this point. Allow it to simmer for one hour.Stir the mixture occasionally during the hour it is simmering. Stirring it prevents the sugar from sticking to the bottom of the saucepan.

, Most of the liquids should have burned off at this point. It’s okay if the mixture is still slightly runny because it will thicken once it cools down. Remove the saucepan from the heat. Allow it to cool.Allow the mixture at least 30 minutes to cool. Check on it every so often to see if it has cooled down.

, Pour the molasses into a jar. Make sure it is a jar that can be sealed tightly. Store the jar in the refrigerator. The molasses should last for up to fix months.Pomegranate molasses is great as salad dresses, in sauces, as a meat marinade, and as a topping on desserts."

Make sure your trees are ready to be tapped.,
Select trees.,
Purchase taps.,
Tap the tree.,
Attach a collection container.,
Tap more trees.,
Collect the sap.",How to Make Maple Syrup1," Maple season occurs during the spring when nights are below 32 degrees Fahrenheit (0 degrees Celsius) and days are starting to get warm. This causes the sap to start flowing in trees.

The maple season is over when this temperature pattern ends. At this time the color of the sap will become darker. If sap is collected after the season is over it will be low in sugar content and have an undesirable taste.;
, There are many different types of Maple trees. Various types have different sugar content; the higher the better. The Sugar Maple has the highest sugar content. The maple tree has a distinct five point leaf. Typically, a tree should be at least 10 inches in diameter before it is tapped., These are also known as spiles.Online is the easiest place to buy taps. Most taps are the same, but the collection containers differ quite a bit. Determine what style of collection container you will use: a bag, an attached bucket, a ground bucket, or a tube network (usually used by advanced syrup-makers). If you don't feel like buying a bucket, a clean milk jug will work fine. Avoid buying and installing a tube network if you haven't tapped before., Drill a hole on the side of the tree that receives the most light, above a large root or under a large branch. The hole should be the size of your tap. It should also be around 1 to 4 feet (30 to 120 cm) above the ground and a 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) longer than your tap. The hole should be at a slight downward angle.

An electric hand drill works well for this task.
You could also drill a hole using a hammer and a long nail; hammer it in, then remove it.

, It is best to cover containers to keep out rainwater and bugs., 40 gallons of sap makes just one gallon of syrup, which is why store-bought maple syrup is so expensive. A good number of trees to tap for a beginner is 7 to 10; you'll get about 10 gallons from each tree per season, so you'll end up with a few gallons of maple syrup., Over the course of a few weeks, check the collecting containers every few days.Transfer the sap to sealed buckets or other large containers for storage. Keep collecting sap until the season has ended. Now you're ready to turn the sap into syrup."
"
Filter the sap.,
Build a fire to boil the sap.,
Add sap to the pots.,
Check the temperature.",How to Make Maple Syrup2," If you have a smaller amount of sap, this is easiest done with a coffee filter. This is only to remove any sediment, bugs, or twigs from the sap. You could also reach in and remove large pieces of debris with a slotted spoon. The sap will be filtered again later, after it's boiled., Syrup is made by removing water from the sap, so that only the sugar remains. Sap contains only about 2 % sugar. You can use an evaporator, which is a machine made specifically for boiling sap into syrup, or a less expensive alternative like a good, hot fire (you can also boil it in a pan on the stove, but you're evaporating so much moisture that your whole house will fill with steam). To build an outdoor fire for sap boiling, follow these steps:

Get one or more 5 gallon pots.
Dig a shallow hole in the ground where you want to build the fire.
Build a box out of cinder blocks around the hole. It need only be large enough to accommodate all of your pots. Set a fire grate in the box to hold the pots, leaving enough space below the grate to build a fire.
Build a fire under the grate so it will heat the pots.

, Fill them about 3/4 full of sap. The flames should lick the bottom of the pans and bring the sap to a boil. As the water evaporates, slowly add more sap. Continue stoking the fire and adding sap to the pots until the pots are half full with the remaining sap.

The process of boiling sap down to syrup takes many hours, and you can't take any breaks or you'll end up with burned maple syrup. The fire needs to be hot enough to keep the sap boiling constantly, and you need to keep adding more sap when the liquid gets low - even if it means staying up all night.
You can hang a coffee can with a handle over the sap pot. Cut a hole in the bottom so the sap trickles out gradually. This way you won't have to be there to monitor its progress at all times.

, When you're finished adding sap and the remaining liquid starts to get low, use a candy thermometer to check the temperature. It will have rested at 212 degrees Fahrenheit or so during the boiling process, but once most of the water has evaporated, the temperature will rise. Remove the liquid from heat when it reaches 219 degrees Fahrenheit.If you remove the syrup too late, it will thicken or burn, so make sure you monitor it closely.
You can finish the syrup inside if you want to be able to control the heat and temperature more closely.

"
"
Filter the finished syrup.,
Pour the syrup into sterilized containers.,
Remove taps from trees at the end of the season.",How to Make Maple Syrup3," When the sap is boiled it produces niter, or ""sugar sand."" The niter will settle to the bottom if not filtered. Filtering will remove niter and and other substrate that might have gotten into the syrup, like ash from the fire or bugs that flew in. Place a few pieces of cheesecloth over a large bowl and pour the syrup in; you may have to do this a few times to get all the niter out.

Filter the syrup while it's still quite hot, or else it will stick to the cheesecloth.
Special cotton filters made to absorb less syrup are available for sale online.

, Glass mason jars work well, or you could reuse old maple syrup containers that have been boiled. Put the lids on the syrup jars immediately., Do not plug the holes; they will close by themselves."

Keep flower syrups in the refrigerator.,
Use flower syrups in drinks, desserts and other recipes.",How to Make Flower Syrups," To make your own homemade flower syrups, you’ll want to start with flowers that are safe to eat. Some common edible species include roses, hibiscus, lavender, chamomile and tulips, but there are many others to choose from. Each of these will produce a smooth, sweet syrup with its own distinctive undertones.Choose only fresh flowers that are in full bloom and don’t show any signs of wilting or disease.
Never use flowers that have been treated with pesticides or other potentially harmful chemicals.;
, You won’t use the whole flower to make your syrups. Instead, snip the blossom loose from the stem, then pluck the petals individually. Discard the stems, leaves, bulbs and any other green bits. The colorful part of the flower is what you’re really after.Lightly wash the flowers under cool water first to remove any visible dirt or insects.If you’re using a species that produces small buds, like lilac or elderflowers, you can pull off and steep the whole flower., This simple syrup will provide the base for your flower infusions. For a small, concentrated batch of syrup, use about one cup of both sugar and water. If you plan on stockpiling the syrup, you can increase the amount by another cup or two.Save time reducing the simple syrup yourself by blending pure cane juice with water and heating the mixture lightly.
You can also make a thicker, more viscous syrup by using two parts sugar for every one part water., Place the saucepan on the stovetop over medium-high heat. Stir the sugar and water together as the sugar gradually dissolves. Once it has completely melted, you should be left with a thick, lightly-colored liquid.The syrup should just begin to bubble around the edges when it reaches the optimal temperature.
Be careful not to use too intense a heat, or it may cause the sugar to scorch.

, Sprinkle the petals directly into the simple syrup. Depending on the type of flower you’ve selected, you may need to use slightly more or less in order to achieve the desired flavor. In most cases, a couple tablespoons will be be enough—you’ll rarely need to use more than a cup.Crushing dried flowers before adding them to the syrup can release more of their flavor.

, The heat will unlock the essence of the flowers, infusing the syrup with robust flavor and color. The mixture should simmer for no less than thirty minutes, although you can leave it for as long as you like. The longer you allow the flowers to steep, the more potent the finished syrup will be.This will be the best time to incorporate any other ingredients you’d like to include, such as vanilla, cinnamon, rosemary, cardamom, or citrus zest.To give your flower syrup a bolder color, stir in a very small amount of liquid food coloring. Coloration can create more exotic look and help you differentiate between multiple syrups., Remove the saucepan from the heat and have a container ready to hold the syrup. Use a wire colander or piece of cheesecloth to catch the cooked flower pieces so that only the syrup is left. Dispose of the spent flowers.Leave the lid off of the container for a few minutes so that the syrup has a chance to cool.
Don’t worry if a few flower particles are left behind. They are, after all, safe to eat.

, Many people like to store their flower syrups in mason jars because of their rustic look and convenient size. You might also choose to keep the syrup in an empty bottle for ease of pouring. Glass containers tend to be preferable to other materials, as they won’t influence the subtle flavors of the syrup.Stick a pour spout into the mouth of a jar to control the flow of the syrup.
Search your kitchen for improvised containers like unused squirt bottles that will make the syrups easier to enjoy.

, Place the syrup on one of the upper shelves where it will be within reach when you’re ready to use it. Make sure the lid is secure so that air doesn’t get in. Most types of flower syrup will stay fresh for several weeks, though it’s unlikely that they’ll make it that long!A quarter teaspoon of citric acid can help better preserve flower syrups. The slight acidity is also useful for cutting overpowering sweetness.When the syrup goes bad, the floral elements will begin to ferment, resulting in a sour, unpleasant smell., When added to a pitcher of ice cold lemonade, flower syrups help create the perfect refreshing summertime treat. Tangy syrups are known to pair especially well with champagne and other sparkling spirits. You can even use your syrups to top desserts like creme brulee or flavor cake frosting to make them even more irresistible.Drizzle a few ounces into a glass of iced tea for a unique twist on the classic Arnold Palmer, or lend some zest and sweetness to crisp soda water.Come up with some inventive new cocktail recipes that incorporate different flower syrups, like a lavender-mint mojito or rosewater cosmopolitan.

Cool and bottle the syrup.",How to Make Coffee Syrup1," Pour the sugar and water into a small saucepan and stir the two together.The two won’t combine properly until the sugar dissolves in the water, which will happen when you add heat.


To increase your simple syrup yield, increase the amount of sugar and water you use, sticking with the one-to-one ratio.;
, To turn your sugar and water mixture into syrup, heat the mixture over medium-high heat to dissolve the sugar. Bring the mixture to a boil. When the syrup starts to boil, reduce the heat to medium and simmer it for three minutes.While the sugar will eventually dissolve in cold water, this can take hours or days to occur. Moreover, if you don’t add heat to the mixture, none of the water will boil off, so the syrup won’t be as thick.

, After simmering for three minutes, remove the syrup from the heat. Set it aside to cool for 30 minutes to an hour. Transfer the syrup into a sterilized storage jar with a lid and refrigerate it.

To reduce the caloric content of the syrup you can use Splenda instead of sugar. But take note: if you're doing this, do not bake with it -- just use it as a drink mix or topping. Also, you'll have to use it within a couple days of making as it does not store well (when made with Splenda, that is).;

Steep with other flavors (optional).,
Store leftover syrup.",How to Make Homemade Syrup1," Pour in 1 cup (240 mL) cold water. Feel free to double or triple this recipe to make a larger batch.;
, For your first batch, try 1 cup (200 g) granulated white sugar and 1 cup (200 g) brown sugar.Once you've tasted the end result, you can play around with different ratios. The more brown sugar you use, the stronger the molasses flavor will be. For extra strong flavor replace the brown sugar with a raw sugar like demerara or turbinado.


For a thinner syrup, halve the amount of syrup.
Replace some or all of the sugar with maple sugar to get an authentic maple flavor. Maple sugar tends to be expensive, and in some areas may only be available online.

, For an easy imitation of real maple syrup, add ½ tsp (2.5 mL) maple flavor extract, available from baking supply stores or online. Without it, the syrup will taste more like molasses – which is still delicious on pancakes or waffles.


You can substitute vanilla or almond extract for a more unusual pancake syrup.

, Bring the water and sugar mixture to a boil, then reduce to low heat. Stir continuously for 3–5 minutes, or until every sugar grain has dissolved. The longer you boil the syrup, the thicker it will be once cooled.This recipe is plenty thick already, so you should be fine taking it off the heat right away.

, You can use the syrup as-is once it's cooled, or add other ingredients for a more exotic flavor. Drop these in the hot syrup and let steep for at least half an hour, then strain the syrup through a sieve.Here are a few suggestions:


Peeled, sliced ginger root
Lemon or lime zest
Cinnamon or nutmeg (no need to strain)
Vanilla pod, sliced open

, Refrigerate the syrup in a clean container to discourage microorganisms. This will typically last 6 months in the refrigerator. You can add a small spoonful of vodka to preserve it even longer, but most people discover that the syrup has mysteriously vanished long before the expiration date.Storing in a squeeze bottle make the syrup easy to use.

Store extra syrup.,
Use the syrup in cocktail recipes.",How to Make Homemade Syrup2," To sweeten a drink without leaving sugar granules to sink in the glass, bartenders dissolve the sugar in water to make a simple syrup. You'll want to start with granulated sugar (or superfine/caster sugar, which will dissolve faster), but choosing the variety depends on your cocktail:White sugar creates a clear syrup, which won't discolor white spirits such as vodka and gin.
Raw sugar has a rich, molasses flavor, excellent in many drinks based on whiskey, rum, or other dark spirits. Turbinado and demerara are two similar sugars commonly used in cocktails.

, If you're following mixing instructions that call for simple syrup, the author probably means 1 part sugar to 1 part water. Many bartenders prefer a ""rich simple syrup"" of 1.5 or 2 parts sugar to 1 part water. This lets you sweeten a cocktail with less syrup per drink, reducing the amount of water in the cocktail.A rich simple syrup also lasts longer in the fridge, up to several months.""Simple syrup"" may refer to the 2:1 recipe in the UK., For more accuracy, weigh the ingredients on a kitchen scale to get the ratio you chose.If you don't have a kitchen scale, you can use measuring cups instead.


Most cocktails use ⅛ cup (30 mL) simple syrup or less. Most home mixers can safely start with 1 cup (240 mL) water, unless they have party plans.

, Turn the stove to medium heat. Stir constantly until the sugar has completely dissolved, with no granules visible. This usually only takes a few minutes, but a larger or more sugar-saturated batch may take longer.


Don't let the mixture boil, as this will evaporate water and throw off your careful measurements., As soon as all the sugar has dissolved, remove the syrup from the heat. Let cool to room temperature before using.

, The 1:1 syrup lasts about 1 month in the fridge, while the rich 2:1 recipe lasts 3–6 months. To increase the lifespan before it goes moldy, take the following steps:


Sterilize a jar or bottle by pouring boiling water into it and over the lip and lid. Pour out the water and fill the jar with syrup.Add a spoonful of vodka to the syrup for further preservation.This shouldn't noticeably affect the taste in cocktails.

, Simple syrup works wonders in practically any cocktail that calls for a sweetener. Here are a few examples:

Long Island iced tea
Any mojito recipe
Daiquiri

Use light molasses for most baking purposes.,
Go with light molasses for the mildest flavor.,
Add sweetness and reduce sugar with sorghum.",How to Choose a Type of Molasses1," In part because of its high sweetness and mild flavor, light molasses is often the preferred option for baking needs. In particular, use molasses to make cookies softer and breads more crusty.Light molasses is also best when a marinade or sauce recipe calls for molasses.
In general, think of light molasses as a sweetening ingredient.;
, Especially mild molasses, often packaged as “cane syrup” is derived from the first boil of the sugar refining process. This initial boil produces molasses that is both the lightest in color, as well as the sweetest. As such, this is the molasses to use when using molasses as a sugar substitute or sweetener.Other names for light molasses include “Barbados”, “first”, “mild”, or “sweet” molasses.

, Sorghum is a plant similar to sugarcane, from which a syrup similar to molasses is made. This syrup is thick and amber in color. It can be used instead of molasses as an even more mildly flavored sweetener. Use the same amount of sorghum syrup to sub for molasses, but reduce the amount of sugar the recipe calls for, as sorghum is sweeter than molasses.Sorghum syrup is also rich in potassium, protein, calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus.

"
"
Go with dark molasses for gingerbread cookies.,
Try blackstrap molasses for the most robust flavor.,
Use blackstrap only when specifically called for.",How to Choose a Type of Molasses2," Dark molasses will sometimes be labeled as “cane” or “second” molasses. These will have distinct, slightly bitter flavor. They will also be thicker, darker, and less sweet than light molasses. The classic example of the flavor associated with dark molasses is that of a gingerbread cookie, which include lots of dark molasses., Blackstrap molasses is yielded by the third boil during of sugarcane. Molasses from later boils is much more flavorful, especially in terms of bitterness, than that derived from earlier boils. It is often much thicker and darker in color., Though blackstrap molasses retains beneficial vitamins and minerals and is considered to be the healthiest molasses option, it should not be used in all recipes. Its bitter flavor is surprisingly pronounced. Examples of recipes that may call for it include savory baked beans and pulled pork."
"
Opt for an unsulfured option.,
Experiment with pomegranate molasses.,
Try date syrup instead of molasses.",How to Choose a Type of Molasses3," Most molasses that is sold commercially is made from sugarcane that was never treated with sulfur dioxide. This chemical improves the yield of sugarcane crops, but leads to slight chemical taste in the molasses derived from treated plants., Reducing pomegranate juice yields a thick, strongly flavored syrup that can be used similarly to molasses. This “pomegranate molasses,” however, is much less sweet. You’ll get a bit more depth, and even a bit of muskiness by using pomegranate molasses instead of molasses derived from sugarcane or sugar beets.The flavor of pomegranate molasses is somewhere between dry red wine and concentrated meat drippings.
Substitute pomegranate molasses in salad dressings and glazes, and in cocktails.

, Dates have been used to sweeten food for thousands of years. Date syrup is another fine alternative to molasses, and even looks and pours similarly. Note that it has a notably fruity flavor, and is sweeter than molasses. Use it in dressings, marinades, desserts, and homemade bread.Note that including date syrup in baking recipes usually requires other alterations to the recipe as well, such as a reduction in sugar.

",How to Make an Arugula Salad," Before getting started, make sure you have all your necessary ingredients together in one place. For this simple recipe, you only need five essential components: two bunches of fresh arugula leaves, a lemon, a chunk of fresh Parmesan cheese, a bottle of extra virgin olive oil and your trusty salt and pepper grinders. That’s it!


Make sure you buy all your ingredients fresh (except for the Parmesan cheese, which should ideally be aged). This will ensure that the salad turns out as delicious as possible.;
, Find a large salad bowl or mixing bowl that you can put the salad together in. Since none of the ingredients need any special preparation, everything can be done in a single bowl. Make sure the bowl is large enough to comfortably hold both bunches of arugula as you’re mixing the salad.Another thing that makes this recipe great is that you won’t have to do a lot of dishes when you’re done!

, Run each bunch of arugula under a stream of cool water. Don’t wash the leaves too forcefully, or you could damage them and leave them wilted. After you’ve rinsed both bunches, press them gently between layers of paper towels to dry them.Always wash produce to eliminate germs and keep you from getting sick.Make sure there’s no excess water remaining on the arugula, as this might dilute the flavors of the dressing or cause the salad to become soggy.

, Take a small handful of arugula and tear it into bite-sized sections along the stem. The pieces don’t have to be perfectly consistent—as long as they’re small enough to be manageable with a fork, they’ll work just fine. Once you’re done with one handful, grab another. Repeat until both bunches of arugula are prepped and ready for the salad.


Cutting or tearing herbs helps release more of their natural flavors.Arugula is similar to romaine lettuce in that has stalky leaves that give it a nice crunch. This also makes it easier to prepare, since you don’t have to bother removing the stems.

, Open a bottle of extra virgin olive oil and slowly drizzle about ¼ cup over the top of the arugula. After the salad has been tossed, the olive oil will lightly coat the arugula leaves, making its crisp folds velvety soft. Try not to oversaturate the arugula, as too much oil can cause it to become limp and soupy.For best results, use the prescribed amount of olive oil and add more after you toss the salad if you need it.
Extra virgin olive oil should be your first choice, as it has a smoother, more complex taste.

, Take a large lemon and cut it in half. Then, using a manual juice press, squeeze the juice of one half of the lemon over the arugula leaves. The acidity of the fresh citrus will help brighten up the deep, earthy flavor of the arugula.If you don’t have a juice press, simply squeeze the lemon by hand.
Let the lemon sit until it reaches room temperature, then roll it along the counter top with your palm. This will loosen up the peel and membranes inside so that it gives more juice., Run the chunk of Parmesan along the vents of a cheese grater to your desired size. You can also use a veggie peeler to shave thin slices off the Parmesan. Add as much or as little cheese as you want; for a more flavorful salad, it’s recommended that you grate 2–3 tablespoons (29.6–44.4 ml).Asiago or Romano cheese could also be used in place of Parmesan, as they have a similar taste.Avoid pre-grated, packaged cheeses. Since this recipe puts special emphasis on the freshness of its ingredients, it’s best to grate the Parmesan yourself just before you serve the salad.

, Grab your pepper grinder and use a few twists to lightly dust the completed salad. Around one teaspoon of pepper will lend a hint of spice to the salad without overpowering it or clashing with the natural pepper infusion of the arugula.You might use a dash of sea salt as well, but keep in mind that the acidic lemon juice and Parmesan cheese will already provide much of the salad’s saltiness.
As with the rest of the ingredients, it’s more important to season to taste than it is to use a specific amount.

, Now all that’s left is to bring it all together. Toss the salad from the bottom using quick circular motions with your salad spoons or tongs, or just jump in there with both hands. Mix until the ingredients are evenly dispersed throughout the salad. It’s now ready for you to enjoy!This salad can be put together in under 10 minutes, and serves 3-4.

, For a more substantial salad, top the basic ingredients with slices of grilled chicken, shrimp or marinated tofu. This will provide an infusion of healthy protein and complement the flavor of the arugula perfectly. This type of salad is hearty enough to be savored as a meal in itself.Mild forms of protein will work best, as they’ll allow the flavors of the primary ingredients to come through.

, Cut cherry tomatoes into halves and add them to the salad. Cherry tomatoes are sweet and slightly acidic—both flavor profiles go well with the arugula’s bitterness, as well as the sharpness of the fresh Parmesan. They also create a pleasant color contrast that enhances the presentation of the dish.Cherry tomatoes come in reds, yellows, oranges and other heirloom shades. These will stand out brilliantly from the deep green arugula.

, Sprinkle some roasted pine nuts into the salad before tossing it, or use them to top it off as a garnish. Pine nuts are another sweet, earthy additive that can balance out the stronger ingredients like arugula and black pepper. In addition, they contain many nutritious minerals and fatty acids, making them a welcome part of any healthy diet.Many people are allergic to tree nuts such as pine nuts. Be aware of whether you have a possible pine nut allergy before coming into contact with them or using them to cook., If the light, minimalist salad is a little underdressed for your liking, finish it off with a couple teaspoons of balsamic vinegar. Vinegar will up the saltiness, so it should be used modestly so as not to throw off the flavor of the salad when combined with the lemon juice. For a salad that doesn’t quite pop, a little balsamic vinegar may be just what’s missing.If you decide to bring balsamic vinegar into the mix, you have the option of dressing the salad with a more traditional vinaigrette before adding the lemon, Parmesan and black pepper.,"

Toast the English muffin.,
Heat the Canadian bacon.,
Saute the egg.,
Assemble the sandwich.",How to Make an Egg McMuffin1," Split 1 English muffin in half and spread 1 teaspoon of butter over each half of the muffin. Heat a skillet over medium heat and add the English muffin halves with the butter side down. Toast the muffin halves for 3 to 4 minutes, so they become golden and a little crisp. Remove the toasted muffin halves to a sheet of aluminum foil so the buttered sides are facing up.If you want both sides to become crispy, just flip them over and let them toast another minute.;
, Turn the heat up to medium-high and add the last 1 teaspoon of butter to the skillet. Place 1 slice of Canadian bacon to the skillet and fry it for one or two minutes. Use tongs to flip it over several times, so the edges crisp up. Place the Canadian bacon on top of one of the toasted English muffin halves.Watch the Canadian bacon carefully as it cooks, since it could quickly burn.

, Set a large metal egg ring, small clean can, or large metal biscuit cutter into the skillet and spray it with cooking spray. Crack one egg into the circular container and sprinkle a little salt and pepper over it. Cook the egg for about 3 minutes, so the egg sets.For a simple egg ring, just wash out a small tuna can that's empty. You can just unmold the cooked egg by turning the can over.

, Use a spatula to lift the cooked egg onto the Canadian bacon that's on your English muffin. Unwrap a slice of American cheese and lay it on top of the egg. Quickly put the other English muffin half on top of the cheese and wrap the aluminum foil over the sandwich. This will seal in the heat and help to melt the cheese.You can eat the sandwich immediately or place the wrapped sandwich into an airtight container. You can freeze the breakfast sandwich or store it in the refrigerator for up to a day.

Finished.

",How to Make an Egg McMuffin2," While English muffins are a good size for an Egg McMuffin sandwich, you could use another small bread. Split a biscuit in half and replace the muffin. Or toast a few slices of your favorite bread to use. You could also use:


Mini pita bread
Croissants
Small bagels

, Use a different breakfast meat on the sandwich for a little variety. Cook some turkey sausage, pork sausage or bacon in the pan that you use to saute the egg. Set the cooked meat on top of the bottom half of the English muffin or bread.


For a vegetarian version, just leave the meat out.

, Changing the cheese is one of the easiest ways to make the biggest difference in flavor. Instead of using American cheese, add a slice of your favorite cheese. You could use crumbled soft cheeses (like blue cheese, goat cheese, or feta). Or you could add a slice of one of these firmer cheeses:


Cheddar
Jack
Swiss
Gouda

, Although a traditional Egg McMuffin doesn't have any vegetables, you can easily add some. Just slice your favorite vegetables and add them to the sandwich or saute them for a few minutes before placing them on top of the egg. You could add:Sauteed mushrooms
Sliced tomato
Sauteed bell peppers
Sauteed onions
Fresh sprouts

, To add a really unique flavor, squirt a condiment onto the English muffin before you assemble the sandwich. For a spicy sandwich, add a little sriracha sauce. Or for a typical sandwich, spread a little mayonnaise and mustard. You could also add:


Ketchup
Horseradish sauce
Harissa
Relish

Prevent staining.,
Soak and rinse your blossoms.,
Remove the stems and sepals.",How to Fry Dandelions1," Expect dandelions to cause heavy staining when handled, which may be difficult to wash out. Wear an apron and/or clothes that you don’t mind turning yellow. Avoid placing them directly on your countertops if they stain easily. Have paper towels or another protective covering on hand in case you need them., Place them in an appropriately sized bowl. Fill the bowl with lukewarm water, then add 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) of salt. Let them sit for approximately 10 minutes. Then rinse them off under running water. Let them air-dry or, to speed things up, spin them in a salad spinner.Unrinsed blossoms may contain traces of dirt, chemicals, or even insects.

, First, place your dandelions on a cutting board. Slice off each stem. Once you do, use your fingers to gently remove the sepals (the dark green leaves on the back of each blossom). If you’ve never prepped dandelions before, keep in mind that:Any part that’s colored dark green will retain a bitter flavor, so it’s best to get rid of as much of this as possible.
Dandelions can be pretty delicate and fall apart quite easily when removing stems and sepals. You may want to prep more than the recipe calls for until you get the knack for it.

From there, transfer them to your bowl of dry ingredients and toss them around until they’re evenly coated. Then gently toss them from hand to hand over the bowl to shake off any extra flour before placing them on a plate.If desired, pour your egg into an airtight container and refrigerate for future use in the next day or two.

, Set a large skillet on your stovetop, turn the burner to medium heat, and add your butter. Once that melts, fill the skillet with your floured dandelions. Cook them for about five minutes, or until they turn golden brown. While they cook, line a clean plate with paper towels.

Know which to use.,
Go organic.,
Buy directly from source when possible.,
Clean before use.",How to Dress Up a Salad with Edible Flowers1," Be aware that not all flowers are edible. If you have a particular one in mind, always research that specific type first to make sure it’s safe to eat. Otherwise, stick to popular favorites. Edible varieties that go particularly well with salads include:Arugula
Chive
Hibiscus
Marigold.
Pansies.;
, Keep in mind that, even if a specific flower is safe to eat in general, not all flowers are grown with consumption in mind. Avoid consuming any that have been treated with chemicals, like pesticides. Always use organic flowers, which are grown without any added chemicals., If you have a farmer’s market nearby, purchase your flowers there. Inquire about growing methods with the sellers to ensure that they run an organic operation. If not, make sure you shop for flowers in your grocery store’s produce section, and not their florist section. If you’re still in doubt about whether they’re safe to eat, order online from companies that sell flowers specifically for cooking, like:Gourmet Sweet Botanicals
Marx Foods
Melissa’s

, Treat flowers just like any other produce. Always wash them before you start making any foods with them. Give them a shake to get rid of any dirt or insects. Place them in bowl of cold water and gently scrub them with your fingertips. Then place them on a paper towel so they can air-dry.If you don’t use them right way, dampen a fresh sheet of paper towel and use that to line an airtight container. Seal the flowers inside and refrigerate them. Use within a week of purchase.

Pick the sugar.,
Pour one cup (240 mL) sugar into an airtight container.,
Add 2 to 10 tsp (10–50 mL) spices.,
Mix the ingredients thoroughly.,
Let the sugar sit overnight or longer before using.",How to Flavor Sugar1," White sugar usually has a less complex flavor than other sugars, so it's a good base for adding new flavors. Brown sugar or raw sugar will also work, but be prepared for a less predictable flavor due to the higher molasses content., Pour the sugar into a zip locked bag, a tupperware container, a jar, or any other clean, airtight container. Because this method uses dry, powdered spices, there will be no need for a blender or other tool.


You can easily make a larger or smaller batch with these same instructions. Just remember to multiply the amount of spice used as well.

, For this method, use a dry, ground or powdered spice (or grind the spice in a spice grinder or mortar). Different spices have different strengths, so feel free to experiment. The range given is a good starting point, from 2 tsp (10 mL) for a touch of flavor, up to 10 tsp (50 mL) for a strong flavor.



Cinnamon, cardamom, ginger, and nutmeg are all commonly used in desserts, making them an obvious option to pair with sugar. These work well alone or in any combination with each other.

Cayenne sugar is a flavor for the fearless, adding a bold garnish to a plate or cocktail.

Unsweetened cocoa powder, instant coffee, or other flavorful powders can also be added using this method. Try using 1/4 cup (60 mL) instead, since these tend to have a less concentrated flavor than spices.

, Close the airtight container and mix the sugar and spices together by shaking. Alternatively, mix with a fork or other utensil, but make sure the ingredients are evenly distributed before closing the container.

, The sugar will take time to absorb the surrounding flavors, becoming more potent over the course of the next few days. Since all the ingredients used in this method are dry, you may store this sugar in an ordinary shaker or sugar bowl.

Choose a flavor.,
Dry any wet ingredients, then let cool.,
Grind the ingredients.,
Mix the ingredients into one cup (240 mL) sugar.,
Store the sugar in an airtight container.",How to Flavor Sugar2," Any leafy herb or citrus zest can be added using this method. Here are a few ideas, along with estimated amounts to use for every 1 cup (240 mL) sugar:



Rosemary, dried rosebuds, or dried culinary lavender are all aromatic flavors. Lavender will produce an especially strong scent. Set aside about 3 tablespoons (45 mL) per cup (240 mL) sugar.Mint makes a sugar that works well in baking and cocktails. Try using 1/2 cup (120 mL) of loosely packed mint leaves.Basil is a more unusual flavor for sweets, and may pair well with lime. Use about 1.5 tbsp (22 mL).Lemon, lime, orange, or any other citrus fruit can be zest and added to sugar. Zest the fruit's colored outer rind, avoiding the white pith. Use the zest from two fruits for a moderate flavor, or several more for a stronger one.

, Fresh leaves and citrus rind should be dried before adding, to avoid clumping the sugar with moisture. There are several ways to accomplish this:


Lay them out on a layer of paper towels, without overlaps, and microwave in 30 second bursts. Check between each burst, and remove when the herbs are crisp.Turn an oven to the lowest setting, lay the herbs on a baking sheet, and warm for about 20 minutes, or until dry. Using an oven at a higher setting is not recommended, due to the risk of burning the herbs.Leave the herbs in a location with a light breeze, to dry for 8—24 hours. Direct sunlight may reduce the flavor.

, Sugar will infuse much more quickly if the other ingredients are ground in a spice grinder or coffee grinder. This will also produce a more evenly colored and textured end product.


A food processor might work, but it may not turn the ingredients fully into powder.If using dried lavender, you may prefer to leave the flowers in the sugar whole, and strain them out before using the sugar. The lavender flowers (or scoops of the lavender sugar) can then be used to infuse a couple more batches of sugar before they lose their potency., White granulated sugar is less likely to clump than most other sugars, making it a good choice for these moisture-containing ingredients. Feel free to experiment with other options if you prefer.

, The sugar should infuse overnight, and continue to taste stronger over the course of the next few days. Store in a dry, airtight container to protect the sugar from humidity and microorganisms.


Use citrus zest sugar within two weeks."
"
Use flavored extracts.,
Add a vanilla bean.,
Flavor with cocktail bitters.,
Grind freeze-dried fruit.",How to Flavor Sugar3," Almond extract, vanilla extract, and fruit extracts are simple ways to flavor sugar. Start by adding just two to four drops of extract per cup (240 mL) of sugar, since these flavors are concentrated. Stir thoroughly until the color is even, using a spoon to mash apart clumps of moist sugar.

, Slice a vanilla bean pod lengthwise and scoop out as much of the sticky, inner seed material as you can. Stir or blend this sticky material thoroughly with 2–4 cups (480–960 mL) sugar, depending on how strong a flavor you desire.Add the bean pod itself to the sugar and store in an airtight container. Wait at least 48 hours before using, while the flavor infuses.

, You'd never thought of alcoholic sugar before, but now you're interested. Cocktail bitters usually have a strong flavor, so start with two or three teaspoons (10–15 mL) per cup (240 mL) of sugar, and add more if necessary.

, Freeze-dried fruit can be ground in a spice grinder or coffee grinder, then mixed into sugar by hand.This will also add color to the sugar bowl more than most other flavors.

"
"
Add the sugar to beverages.,
Use it in desserts.,
Make sugar cubes or shapes.,
Make rock candy.,
Make cotton candy.",How to Flavor Sugar4," Stir vanilla sugar or cocoa sugar into hot milk. Use mint or citrus sugar in iced tea or mojitos. Almost any flavored sugar can be used as cocktail garnish. Rub the rim of the glass with a lemon wedge, then sprinkle the sugar crystals over it.

, Many spices and extracts used to flavor sugar are already used in desserts. Replace the ordinary sugar in a baking recipe, or make the flavor more obvious by topping muffins, rice pudding, or parfait. Use citrus sugar instead for a complementary sour tinge.

, Granulated sugar can be formed into sugar cubes by adding about 1 tsp (5 mL) water for every 1/2 cup (120 mL) sugar. Add more water or sugar as necessary in tiny amounts, stirring thoroughly, until the sugar is slightly moist and crumbly. Press this into a miniature ice cube tray for a typical sugar cube, or into any silicone mold for more unusual shapes. Leave out at room temperature until hard (one to eight hours), then transfer to an airtight container.If you don't have molds, you can press the wet sugar flat on a wax paper-lined baking pan. Cut it into a grid pattern (or into any shapes), then let dry.You can combine this step with the flavoring by substituting half the water with extract or cocktail bitters.

, Once it's had a couple days to infuse, turn your flavored sugar into a hard candy. Tie a string to a pencil, placed over a clean, glass jar. Heat the flavored sugar in a pot of water to make a simple syrup, then pour it into the jar. If you used any flavoring larger than a powder, you might want to strain the syrup through a mesh as you pour.

, It is possible to make cotton candy even without a machine, although the process is complicated. If you used wet flavor ingredients, give the sugar at least two weeks to dry before using it for cotton candy. You'll also need to strain the sugar through a fine mesh to remove all large ingredients.

, Try to avoid “eyeing it” and pouring based on instinct, if you are doubling the recipe for the first time.

, To rise properly, you need 1/4 tsp. (1.15 g) of baking soda per cup (125 g) of all-purpose flour. If you now need 4 cups (500 g) of all-purpose flour, your baking soda measurement should be 1 tsp. (4.6 g).


Include extra baking soda, approximately 1/4 tsp. to 1/2 tsp. per cup of acidic ingredient. If your recipe calls for yogurt, buttermilk, vinegar or lemon juice, you will need slightly more baking soda to neutralize the acidity.
If both baking powder and baking soda are in the recipe, it usually means there is an acidic ingredient that needs to be neutralized.

, To rise, you need 1.25 tsp. (4.44 g) of baking powder per cup (125 g) of all-purpose flour. If you have 4 cups of flour (500 g), you need 5 tsp. (17.77 g) of baking powder. "

, A ""fresh"" fish should not smell ""fishy"", but should have the odor of the ocean - such as a fresh ocean breeze.

, If the head is on, fresh fish should have clear eyes, no cloudiness should be present. They should bulge a little.

, If whole, they should be bright pink/red and wet, not slimy or dry.

, Fish fillets and steaks should be moist and without change of color

, If the meat separates from itself it's not fresh.

Decide on your recipe.,
Print your recipe.,
Clean your gift jar.,
Measure all the ingredients exactly according to the recipe.,
Decide how to layer the ingredients for best effect.,
Use a funnel.,
Add the lid.,
Decorate the jar.,
Give as a gift.",How to Create a Recipe in a Jar Gift," This is important because it will help to determine the type of gift jar that you will need to use and it will also give you an idea of which ingredients can be placed in the jar. Look for recipes that include a lot of dry ingredient elements, such as beans, lentils, split peas, flour, pasta, etc.;
, The recipe can be typed or handwritten onto a rectangular piece of quality paper that can be attached or glued to the jar. Be guided by the height and width of the jar that you will be using.

, After selecting the appropriate jar, ensure that it is cleaned well and dried thoroughly.

, You are responsible for making sure that the dried ingredients are accurate when your recipient cook begins cooking! Measuring cups will provide the most precise amounts.

, Before filling the jar, take a look at your ingredients to visualise what will appear the most attractive. Alternatively, you might need to consider the order in which the ingredients are to be added as a guide to putting the ingredients into the jar.

, Getting the ingredients into the jar will be easier and neater if you use a funnel to pour them in. If you use measuring cups, you will be able to transfer the ingredients straight from the cup into the funnel.

, Screw a lid on tightly to keep the food sealed and fresh.

, Once you have completed the filling, it is time to make the jar look attractive and to attach the recipe. Ideas for finishing the jar include:


A round of fabric over the lid (jam jar style) tied down with ribbon, string or raffia - attach the recipe to the tie
A painted lid if you are artistic - consider gluing the recipe on one side of the jar.
A simple look - merely glue on or attach the recipe without any embellishments.

, If you make several jars at once, store the others for future gifts; always date them and give away within 6 months of making."

Immerse the sorrel in warm water.,
Pat the sorrel dry with paper towels.,
Fold the sorrel in half.,
Cut the stem out of the bottom of each leaf.,
Store sorrel in the refrigerator.",How to Cook with Sorrel1," Wash the sediment and dirt from your sorrel by immersing it in a tub of water. Run your fingers across the leaves to wash them before removing them from the water., Press down on the sorrel with paper towels and try to absorb as much moisture as you can.

, Folding the sorrel in half makes it easier for you to cut both sides of the stem.

, With the sorrel leaf folded, make an angled cut to take off the hard stem of the sorrel. The cut should run about two-thirds up the stem of each leaf., If you plan on preserving your sorrel for later use, wrap them in a damp paper towel and place them in your refrigerator. Sorrel will become soggy very quickly and will wilt in a day or two. Wrapping them with a damp paper towel will slow the speed at which the leaves turn brown and wilt."

Replace spinach, chard, or arugula with sorrel.,
Accent dishes with a sprig of sorrel.,
Add sorrel to your salad.",How to Cook with Sorrel4," If you are cooking a recipe that calls for spinach or chard, you can use sorrel as a replacement. Consider the bitterness of sorrel and decide how it will alter the dish you are planning on making., The bitter and unique taste of sorrel can be appreciated as a garnish for many different dishes like mashed potatoes, rice, lentils, eggs, and cheese. Try replacing a garnish like parsley with sorrel and see if you enjoy the taste., The bitter taste of sorrel tastes great in different kinds of salads. Be careful not to add too many leaves, or it could overpower the taste of your salad and make it too bitter.

Heat a dry cast iron pan over medium-high heat.,
Melt some butter in a shallow pan.,
Dredge each fish fillet through the melted butter.,
Season the fillets with a Cajun spice mix.,
Set the fish fillets into the cast iron pan.,
Turn the fish fillets after 1 or 2 minutes.,
Remove the fish from the grill.,
Finished.








",How to Blacken Fish," A cast iron pan is a required tool for blackening fish, as other pans aren't capable of delivering the intense heat needed for this preparation. Set the pan onto a charcoal grill or a propane burner set to medium-high heat. Allow the pan to heat for about 10 or 15 minutes, and do not add any oil to the pan.






;
, While the cast iron pan is heating, melt a generous amount of butter on another part of the grill. You will need enough butter to dredge all of the fish through, and more if you want to serve the fish with melted butter for dipping.








, Use a pair of tongs to coat each fillet on both sides with the melted butter, shaking off any excess. Set the fillets onto a large dish for seasoning.








, Season the fillets to taste by sprinkling them with a Cajun blackening spice on both sides; spice mixes like these can be purchased from the grocery store or made from scratch. Blackening spice mixes typically contain a mix of thyme, oregano, paprika, garlic, onion, ground chili peppers, peppercorns, and salt. You can substitute another type of all-purpose seasoning mix if desired.








, Use a pair of tongs to place the fillets into the pan, being careful not to crowd the pan. Do not move the fillets once they have been placed into the pan; by allowing them to sear in place, they will flake away from the pan rather than stick. If the pan has been heated properly, an intense amount of smoke will be generated as the milk solids in the butter char against the fish.








, Once the fillets begin to rise away from the pan, flip them with a spatula. The cooked side should have a thick, blackened crust of butter and spices.








, Let the fish cook for another 1 or 2 minutes on the other side, then remove them from the pan. Serve them as desired—pairing them with lemon and butter is the traditional method.

Cut a protein into cubes.,
Marinate the protein for a few hours.,
Chop the vegetables.,
Choose metal or wooden skewers.,
Soak wooden skewers for a half hour.,
Space the ingredients on the skewers.,
Preheat the grill to medium-high.,
Grill the skewers on the first side for several minutes.,
Flip the kebabs over and cook for another few minutes.,
Preheat your broiler.,
Place a baking rack on top of a baking sheet.,
Arrange the kebabs on the rack.,
Broil the kebabs for a few of minutes.,
Turn the kebabs over and cook for another few minutes.",How to Cook Kabobs," You can use any type of protein that you like for your kabobs, but beef, chicken, pork, lamb, and seafood are the most common options. Use a sharp knife to cut 3 ½ pounds (1.6 kg) of the protein you’re using into approximately 2-inch cubes (5-cm) that you can easily thread on a skewer.When it comes to seafood, choose heartier fish, such as salmon, swordfish, or tuna. Shrimp also work well for kabobs.
If you’re a vegetarian, you can omit the protein or substitute tofu for any type of meat.;
, To ensure the most flavorful kabobs, you should create a marinade for the protein. Choose a marinade that complements the type of protein that you’re using, and allow the meat sit in it for to 2 to 5 hours.A marinade doesn’t really penetrate the meat or protein, so there’s no need to marinate overnight.
If you don’t want to marinate the protein, you can simply season the protein on all sides with salt and freshly ground black pepper.
Make a basic marinade by mixing 1 cup (237 ml) of vegetable oil, ¾ cup (177 ml) of soy sauce, ½ cup (118 ml) of lemon juice, ¼ cup (59 ml) of Worcestershire sauce, ¼ cup (62 g) of mustard, 2 garlic cloves, and freshly ground black pepper.You can also try a pineapple marinade, Jack Daniel’s marinade, Coke marinade, or your personal favorite marinade recipe.

, To ensure that the kabobs cook evenly, pair your protein with veggies that have the same cooking time. Onions, bell peppers, zucchini, grape tomatoes, and yellow squash are good options with most proteins. Use 3 to 4 whole vegetables, depending on their size, and cut them into chunks that are the same size as your protein.You can also use fruit, such as pineapple, peaches, and mangoes, for your kabobs.

, To assemble the kabobs, you’ll need some type of skewer. Metal skewers are reusable, but they can be difficult to clean and are often hot to the touch when they’re done cooking. Wooden skewers are inexpensive so you can throw them away when you’re done and not worry about cleanup. They are prone to charring, though.For a good sized portion, choose skewers that are about 12-inches (30-cm) long.

, Because wooden skewers can burn easily, you should soak them in water before you cook your kabobs. Place the skewers in a shallow dish, and cover them with water. Allow them to sit for about 30 minutes., When your protein is finished marinating, you can assemble the kabobs. Thread the protein and vegetable pieces onto the skewers, pushing the items so they’re close together without actually touching. Make sure there’s some space at the end of the skewer to avoid overcrowding -- 2 -inches (5-cm) is usually enough. You can thread the protein and vegetables on the skewers however you like. Alternating them is usually the most common method.
If you’re not sure if the cooking time of the protein and veggies matches up, you’re better off making separate kabobs for the protein and vegetables.

, It’s best to grill kabobs over direct medium-high heat. Allow it to preheat at medium-high for 10 minutes with a gas grill and 20 to 25 minutes with a charcoal grill.For a gas grill, you can just set the temperature gauge to medium-high for preheating.
With a charcoal grill, you can tell that it’s reached the right temperature by holding your hand 4 to 5 inches (10- to 13-cm) above the cooking grate. When you can only keep your hand there for 4 to 5 seconds before the heat is too much, it’s at medium-high heat.
You can also use a grill pan on your stove to cook the kabobs.

, When the grill is preheated, arrange the kabobs in a single layer on the cooking grate. Let them cook for several minutes on the first side depending on what type of protein you’re using:

Grill steak for 4 to 6 minutes per side.
Grill chicken for 6 to 8 minute per side.
Grill pork for 6 to 8 minutes per side.
Grill lamb for 4 to 6 minutes per side.
Grill shrimp for 2 to 3 minutes per side.
Grill salmon, tuna, or swordfish for 2 to 3 minutes per side.
Grill tofu for 2 to 3 minutes per side.

, When the kabobs are finished grill on the first side, use a pair of tongs to turn them over. Cook them on the second side for the same amount of time that you did the first.The kabobs are done grilling when the veggies are tender and all of the protein and vegetable pieces are browned on all sides.

, Place your oven rack so it’s approximately 4-inches (10-cm) from the broiler element. Turn the broiler up to high, and allow it to preheat for about 10 minutes.Be sure to follow your oven’s instructions for proper use of the broiler.

, To keep the kabobs from steaming in the liquid they release, it’s important to keep them elevated. Set a baking rack on top of a large baking sheet so the liquid can drip below while they broil., With the baking rack on the baking sheet, set the kabobs on top of the rack.Set them in a single layer so they’ll cook evenly., Place the baking sheet under the preheated broiler. Allow the kababs to broil for several minutes depending on what type of protein you’re using:Broil steak for 4 to 6 minutes per side.
Broil chicken for 6 to 8 minute per side.
Broil pork for 6 to 8 minutes per side.
Broil lamb for 4 to 6 minutes per side.
Broil shrimp for 2 to 3 minutes per side.
Broil salmon, tuna, or swordfish for 2 to 3 minutes per side.
Broil tofu for 2 to 3 minutes per side.

, When the kabobs are finished broiling on the first side, use a pair of tongs to turn them over to the other side. Let them broil on the second side for the same amount of time that they broiled on the first side.You can tell that the kabobs are done broiling when all of the sides are browned and the vegetables are tender.

Place the vegetables around the fish and garnish with herbs.,
Serve the fish with melted butter and lemons.",How to Boil Fish," Traditional fish boil recipes use fish local to Wisconsin and Lake Michigan, such as lake trout and whitefish. However, you can use scrod, cod, haddock, or salmon if you don’t have access to local whitefish.For this recipe, you’ll need (4) ½ pound whitefish steaks.If you want to adjust the recipe for a larger group, have approximately a ½ pound to ¾ pound (227 g to 340 g) of fish per person.;
, If you are planning a traditional outdoor fish boil, you’ll boil the fish in a large pot on an open fire. A cast-iron pot typically works best, and you’ll need logs or slab wood, as well as matches or a lighter, for the fire.If you can’t find a cast-iron pot or kettle for the fish boil, you can use a stainless steel or aluminum pot.
It also helps to have a wire basket that you can place the fish in and lower into the pot that you’re using. That makes it easier to remove the fish while it’s finished boiling.
Make sure that you have extra logs or slab wood on hand for the fire in case you to feed it during the fish boil.
Instead of a log fire, you can use a propane torch to heat the pot for the boil.

, You can recreate a fish boil at home without starting an outdoor fire. Instead, use a large stainless steel or aluminum stock pot with on your stovetop. If your pot has a basket or a strainer insert, you’ll have an easier time removing the fish when they’re done cooking.If you don’t have a strainer or basket for the pot, use a slotted spoon to remove the fish from the water when they’ve finished boiling.

, Fill your pot with approximately 1.5 gallons (5.7 L) of water. Stir in ¾ cup (177 g) of kosher salt until it’s thoroughly combined. Next, allow the pot to come to a full, rolling boil.If you’re cooking the fish on an outdoor fire, throw additional logs on the wood to feed the flames if the pot isn’t boiling.
If you’re cooking on the stove, the heat should be set at high.

, Take a piece of cheesecloth, and create a seasoning packet with equal parts bay leaves, whole allspice, and peppercorns in equal proportions that is approximately half the size of golf ball. Add it to the water and allow it to boil for 2 to 3 minutes.You can add any spices or seasonings that you like, such as fresh rosemary or thyme, to the packet.

, Arrange the fish in a wire basket, and submerge it in the pot. Wait for the water to return to a boil, which may take 2 to 3 minutes, and then allow the fish to boil until you can flake it easily with a fork, which should take approximately 10 to 12 minutes., Once the fish flakes easily and is ready to be removed from the pot, take a moment to skim the froth from the surface of the water with a spoon so the fish won’t pass through it when you remove it. Lift the basket from the pot and drain carefully.If you don’t use a wire basket for the fish, remove the individual pieces from the pot with a slotted spoon, shaking carefully to ensure that they’re fully drained.

, While you can boil fish without any vegetables, a traditional fish boil typically includes potatoes and onions, which are partially boiled before you add the fish. Take 1 ½ pounds (680 g) of medium red potatoes, and scrub them with a nylon brush to ensure that they’re clean. Gather 8 small onions, and peel the skins from them, but leave the stem ends in tact.Scrub the potatoes under cold, running water. If you don’t have a brush, you can scrub them with your hands.The easiest way to peel the onions is to slice a half inch (1.3 cm) off the top and peel back the papery skin from the top., In your pot, combine the scrubbed potatoes and peeled onions. Cover the vegetables with approximately 1.5 gallons (5.7 L) of water, or enough that the water level is 2 inches (5 cm) above the potatoes and onions., Stir ¾ cup (177 g) of kosher salt into the water with the potatoes and onions. Allow the pot to come to a full, rolling boil.If you’re cooking on a stove, make sure the burner is set to high.

, Once the pot comes to boil, allow the mixture to cook for approximately 15 minutes. You want the potatoes to be almost tender when you stick a fork in them.It’s important to keep the heat steady while you’re cooking the potatoes and onions, so be sure to maintain your fire or refrain from adjusting the burner., When the potatoes are tender, place the fish directly on top of the vegetables. Complete the boiling process exactly as you would without any vegetables., When the whitefish steaks are well drained, transfer them to a serving platter or plate. Handle the fish carefully when moving them to the plate to ensure that they don’t break.To keep the boiled fish warm, it helps to warm the platter before you place the steaks on it. You can warm an oven- or microwave-safe plate in the respective appliance to warm it, or simply run the platter under hot water to warm it up., Once you’ve set the fish on the platter, transfer the potatoes and onions from the pot to the platter with the slotted spoon. Arrange them so they’re surrounding the fish, and then garnish with 2 tablespoons (30 g) of fresh flat-leaf parsley that’s been finely chopped.You should also season the entire platter with plenty of freshly ground black pepper to taste.

, When you bring the boiled fish to the table, have ¼ pound (113) melted, unsalted butter on hand to pour over it. Make sure to have at least 4 lemon wedges as well for guests to squeeze over the fish."

Buy live crawfish.,
Wash the crawfish.",How to Boil Crawfish1," Plan on ordering enough crawfish so that each person at your party or dinner gets 2 - 3 pounds. Most of the weight will get discarded since crawfish come with their shells on.


Source the crawfish from seafood and grocery stores or crawfish trucks, which sell crawfish when it's in season.
If you don't have a source of crawfish in your area, purchase it online from a vendor such as Louisiana Crawfish co., which will ship the crawfish to you live.
When you take home your crawfish or receive your shipment make sure you keep them cool, away from light and heat, so they're fresh when it's time to cook them.
Boiled crawfish that have been frozen do not taste nearly as good as live boiled crawfish.;
, Since live crawfish are freshly harvested, it's necessary to wash of the silt and debris they have collected before you cook them. Clean your crawfish by taking the following steps:


Wash off the sack. If you bought a sack of crawfish, begin with washing it off so the dirt from the outside of the sack doesn't make its way inside.
Empty the sack of crawfish into a large bin, such as a kiddie pool or storage bin, and fill it with clean water.
Use a paddle to stir the crawfish, then let them sit in the water for 30 minutes.
Discard the dead crawfish, which will float to the top after a few minutes.
Strain the water and rinse the crawfish with clean water. Keep them in a shady spot until you're ready to boil them.

Wait to clean mussels until you are about ready to eat them.,
Get rid of barnacles on wild mussels.,
Clean the outside of the mussels.,
Remove the beards.",How to Buy and Clean Mussels2," As with all seafood, the meat is fresher if you can prepare and eat it right away. If you will be waiting several days to prepare your mussels, store them in the refrigerator and keep them damp either with wet newspaper around them or a damp cloth. Since mussels are living, storing them in a plastic container or plastic bag will suffocate them. Mussels will stay alive longer if you wait to clean them until you are ready to use them.

, Use a small, stiff brush and water to scrub the mussels' shells and remove barnacles and stuck-on seaweed.

, Place your mussels in a colander or on a tray. Rinse the mussels several times with a steady flow of fresh water. This will remove any dirt and sand from the mussels. Do not submerge the mussels in water or soak them as this will kill the mussels.

, Some mussels, mostly the cultivated ones, will have their beards already removed when you purchase them. However, if the beard is still in tact, as will be with wild mussels, you will need to remove the beard. To remove a beard from a mussel, grab hold of the beard, a brown, stringy tuft coming out from between the two shells, and give it a firm pull. The beard may come off during this process. If not, use a sharp knife or scissors to cut the beard away from the shell.

, Once the cod has been cleaned, pat it gently with a clean paper towel to absorb any excess water, especially if the cod has been frozen and was recently defrosted.

, You will repeat this process for each piece of cod fish that you plan to bake. The fish will be wrapped in this foil pouch while it cooks.

, Turn the edges of the foil up slightly so that you still have full access to the fish but so that no juices or ingredients can exit the foil.

, This is a personal choice, but excellent additions to baked cod include salt, pepper, parsley, tarragon, red pepper, thyme, rosemary, and lemon. Cod is relatively mild-flavored, however, so you have a lot of options for experimentation.


There are specific recipes in the ""Variations"" section below.

Inspect the clams.,
Prepare the clams.,
Place cleaned clams into a large kettle, wide pan, or wok.,
Steam the clams.,
Arrange.,
Serve hot with melted butter.",How to Steam Clams1," Place clams on a clean, dry towel, and shuffle through them loosely. Discard any that look abnormal or are open, in the outside trash, otherwise their stench will quickly overpower.;
, Have something like a bucket, tub, or sink in which to soak the clams. The soaking process will clean the clams prior to cooking.


Make a weak brine solution – 1/3 cup of non-iodized salt (iodine will kill clams) to one gallon (3.7 liters) of water should work.
Soak clams in the brine for about fifteen minutes, to remove all grit from inside and outside the clam. Fresh water works decently as well.
Pour the clams into a strainer, and hold under a stream of cold water. Scrub thoroughly with a metal brush.
Place clams back on the towel you had them on earlier. Rub them dry gently to remove any final grit.

, For every pound (453g) of clams, add half a cup of water. Layer the clams into the cooking container with the water (or white wine). Cover the cooking container and place over high heat.


Here, you can choose to add the aromatic ingredients listed above. They are not needed, but if you prefer more flavorful clams, add the extra ingredients, or even just some of them. Keep in mind that the amounts are for three pounds (1.3kg) of clam, so you may need to add or subtract amounts depending on how many clams you have. If you do chose to add them, this is the moment to do so.

, Allow the clams enough time to open their shells - this will be indicated by a burst of steam and popped-open shells, anywhere from 2–3 minutes to 5-10 minutes, depending on the type of clams. If some don't open in this time, discard them as they probably were already dead. Cook Stephanie Alexander even suggests giving the ones that do not open another go at steaming because sometimes the clams have a very tight and vigorous hold on the shell (be sure to remove those that have already opened as they're ready)., Remove the open clams from the kettle or other container and place them in a dish, possibly with a small amount of the broth around them. Lemon halves, or quarters, and a few sprinkles of sea salt are lovely accents to the dish.

, Bread can be added for mopping up any liquid.

Prepare a court bouillon.,
Prepare your fish.,
Cook the fish in the court bouillon.,
Finish poaching the fish.,
Serve the fish with a velouté sauce.",How to Poach a Fish1," Poaching fish is part of traditional French cooking, and the standard liquid used for poaching is court bouillon, a broth made with water, salt, vegetables and aromatic herbs. Court bouillon can be as simple as salted water with some white wine, but adding a few additional fresh ingredients is a great way to enhance the flavor of the fish. To make a simple court bouillon, put the following ingredients in a pot and simmer them for 30 minutes, then allow the mixture to cool:1 gallon (3.8 L) of water
1/4 cup of Kosher salt
1 cup of white wine
1 white onion, peeled and roughly chopped
1 carrot, peeled and roughly chopped
1 sprig of thyme
2 sprigs tarragon
1 lemon, thinly sliced;
, Any type of fish may be poached. Since this cooking method defines and concentrates the flavor of the fish, choose one with a taste you love. It's important to select the freshest fish possible, since an extra hint of fishiness will cause the whole dish to taste off. Purchase fish from a source you trust, and look for fish with bright scales and firm, translucent flesh.


If you're poaching a whole fish, choose one with clear eyes and ask the fishmonger to gut and clean it if necessary. Rinse the fish to remove any impurities before cooking.
If you're poaching fillets, use a knife to make several slash marks into the skin. This will prevent the fillets from curling up as they poach.

, Pour the court bouillon into a stockpot large enough to fit the fish and liquid (or a fish poacher, if you have access to this special equipment). You'll need enough liquid to cover the fish entirely, and a gallon should suffice. From here, the method differs slightly depending on whether you're poaching a whole fish or fillets:


For a whole fish, set the fish in the stockpot and pour the cooled court bouillon over the fish until it's entirely covered. Place it over medium heat to bring it to a simmer.
For fish fillets, first pour the court bouillon into the stockpot and bring it to a simmer. Check its temperature with a thermometer; when it reaches 160 °F (71 °C), place the fish fillets into the heated broth.

, Allow the fish to simmer in the bouillon for about five minutes, or until the flesh is opaque and easily flakes apart. Never let the liquid come to a full boil, since this could cause the fish to get overcooked. Once the fish is ready, use a fish spatula to transfer it to a plate for serving.

, Poached fish is traditionally served with a flavorful sauce called velouté. The sauce is made from the leftover court bouillon mixed with a roux composed of flour and butter. Serve the poached fish with a pour of velouté and some fresh vegetables. To make Velouté, follow these steps:


Cook 2 tablespoons butter and 2 tablespoons (29.6 ml) flour to make a medium roux.
Whisk the roux into 6 cups of heated court bouillon.
Allow the mixture to simmer until it's reduced by 1/3 and thickened to the consistency of a sauce.

Choose a flavorful fish.,
Preheat the oven to 250 degrees.,
Let the fish come to room temperature.,
Prepare the baking dish.,
Poach the fish for one hour.",How to Poach a Fish2," Olive oil poaching is a technique best used with fish that are sturdy and flavorful, such as salmon, halibut or tuna. Choose either steaks or fillets that are about 3/4 to one inch thick for best results.The taste and texture of the final dish is better with thicker, sturdier fish than it is with very delicate fillets.


Season the fish with salt, pepper and other herbs that complement the meal you're serving.
This method also works well with shrimp, prawns and other shellfish.

, Cooking at a low temperature will preserve the integrity of the fish.

, Set it out on the counter for 10 minutes or so before you cook it. Letting the fish come to room temperature will ensure that it cooks evenly and fully once you place it in the oil bath. Putting it straight into the oil from the refrigerator would cause the temperature of the oil to drop, throwing off the cooking time and affecting the taste and texture of the finished dish., Line a glass baking dish with thin slices of lemon, then arrange the fish fillets on top of the lemon slices. Pour enough olive oil over the fish to cover the fillets.

, Place the baking dish in the oven and poach the fish until the fillets are opaque and flake apart easily when forked. Check the fish after an hour, and return it to the oven for an additional 10 to 15 minutes if the fillets need additional time. Serve warm over a bed of rice or steamed vegetables.

Use fresh fish.,
Poach the fish until it's half done.,
Store the fish in a food storage container.",How to Poach a Fish3," Poaching fish is a great way to preserve it for a few extra days so you don't have to eat it the same night you bring it home. If you happen to have access to a lot of fresh fish, and you want to be able to eat some later in the week, this method will allow you to keep it in the refrigerator longer than you otherwise would, then prepare the fish using any method you choose when you're ready.


For example, if you want to have fried fish on Friday night, but you know the fish won't keep until then, poaching it will preserve the texture and flavor and allow you to finish the dish when you're ready.
Of course, freezing or canning are also excellent methods for preserving fish.

, Using either the court bouillon or olive oil poaching method, poach the fish for half the recommended cooking time. Check the fish after half the time has passed; it should be slightly opaque in color, but not cooked enough to easily flake. When the fish is about half cooked, remove it from the poaching liquid.

, Place it in the refrigerator and use the poached fish within a week. Since it's only half cooked, you can sauté, grill, or fry the fish and retain its flavor and texture without overcooking it.


Make sure the fish is cooked completely when you use it in your intended dish. Whether you sauté, grill or fry it, be sure it's opaque and flaky.
Don't keep the fish for longer than a week before using. Even fully-cooked fish doesn't keep forever in the refrigerator.

Nonstick aluminum foil works best since the tilapia will not stick to it.;
, Coat the fish in the melted butter to prevent it from sticking and to help flavor it.


Since the fish will not be exposed to direct heat with this method, it will not brown and you do not necessarily need to use butter. You could substitute the butter for olive oil as a healthier alternative.

, Drizzle the lemon juice over the fillets evenly and sprinkle with pepper.


If desired, you could also use fresh chopped herbs, like basil. Use no more than 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of herbs.

, Layer 3 to 4 slices over the top of each tilapia fillet.


You do not need to add the tomato, but the benefit of cooking tilapia in foil packets is that you cook vegetables with the fish while infusing the fillets with the flavor.
You can also layer chopped green onion, chopped sweet onion, or chopped bell peppers over the fish.

, Loosely wrap the foil around the tilapia and tomatoes and fold together to form packets.


Leave a small gap of air at the top of each packet to prevent too much steam from building up inside.

Season the tilapia.,
Bake the fish.,
Serve warm.",How to Cook Tilapia in the Oven2,"


You could also spray the baking sheet with nonstick cooking spray or line it with nonstick aluminum foil. Use finer quality aluminum foil to minimize the odds of the acidic lemon juice reacting with the foil.

, Run the tilapia fillets under cool water.


Gently dry them by patting the fillets with clean paper towels. Make sure that the fillets are completely dry.
Rinsing the fillets is an optional step, but it comes in handy if the fillets are partially frozen and in need of thawing or if they are fresh and covered in a sticky coating.

, Combine the two ingredients in a ramekin, custard dish, or other small bowl and stir together until they appear mostly combined.


It is best to use butter for this recipe since it will help the fish brown inside the oven.
For a stronger lemon flavor, you could up the amount of lemon juice to 3 or 4 Tbsp (45 or 60 ml).

, Place the tilapia on the sheet in a single layer, spaced apart evenly.

, Pour the butter and lemon juice mixture over the fillets, spreading it evenly. Sprinkle the tilapia with the black pepper.


If desired, you can add other seasonings to the tilapia at this time, as well. Flavors that complement the taste of lemon include onion, garlic, parsley, dill, basil, and oregano. For concentrated powders like garlic powder or onion powder, use no more than 1/4 tsp (1.25 ml). For herbs, use 1 tsp (5 ml) dried or 1 Tbsp (15 ml) fresh.

, At this temperature, tilapia should be done in about 20-30 minutes.When done, the tilapia will be completely white all the way through and should flake apart evenly with a fork.
If desired, you can add the Parmesan cheese to the fish during the last 5 to 10 minutes.

Allow the broiler to preheat for a full 5 to 10 minutes.
Many broilers only have an ""on"" setting, but some have separate ""high"" and ""low"" settings. For this recipe, preheat the broiler to ""high.""
Since tilapia is lower in fat than meat or poultry, it will not produce much melted fat. As a result, the cooking spray is necessary to prevent it from sticking to the broiler rack inside the broiler pan.

, Remove any sticky residue by lightly rinsing the tilapia fillets under cool, running water.


Pat completely dry with clean paper towels.

, Combine the ingredients in a small dish.


You can also add other seasonings, like chopped herbs or onion powder, if desired. Use no more than 1/4 tsp (1.25 ml) concentrated powders, 1 tsp (5 ml) dried herbs, or 1 Tbsp (15 ml) fresh herbs.

, Place the fillets on the broiler pan rack in an even single layer. Coat with the the lemon-butter mixture.

, At the 2 or 3 minute mark, flip the fillets and continue broiling.


Use a fish spatula or other flat, heat-resistant spatula to turn the fish. Do not use tongs since they may cause the fish to break apart.
Turning the fillets is an important step because it ensures even cooking on both sides.

, After sprinkling the fillets with the cheese, broil them for an additional 2 minutes or until the cheese is melted and slightly browned.


The fish must also be done at this point. Tilapia is done once it turns completely white and can be easily flaked apart with a fork.
Note that the Parmesan cheese is only optional. If you do not use it, however, you will still need to cook the fish for the additional 2 minutes.

While cream of mushroom soup works well, you can also experiment by using a different ""cream of"" soup. Other options worth considering include cream of chicken, cream of celery, cream of onion, and cream of potato.
If you'd rather not use the soup, you can create a very thin sauce by pouring 3/4 cup (180 ml) of milk or chicken broth over the fish fillets.

, Place 1 tsp (5 ml) of butter in the center of each halibut fillet, then sprinkle each fillet with ground black pepper.


Leave the butter solid instead of melting it for this method. It should melt and spread evenly throughout the flesh of the fish as it bakes.

, Place the prepared fillets in the preheated oven. Bake the fish for about 15 minutes, or until it flakes evenly when you pierce the center with a fork.


The sauce should keep the halibut moist while it cooks. You shouldn't need to baste, rotate, or flip the fish during the baking process.

, Remove the fish from the oven and immediately transfer it to individual serving dishes. If desired, spoon some of the sauce over each fillet before enjoying.

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit (200 degrees Celsius).,
Center the fillets on the parchment paper.,
Season with salt and pepper.,
Arrange the aromatics on top.,
Fold the parchment paper into packets.,
Bake for 15 minutes.Place the halibut packets in the preheat oven and bake them until the center of the thickest fillet flakes easily when pierced with a fork.,
Serve.",How to Bake Halibut3," Prepare four separate 15-inch (38-cm) squares of parchment paper.You'll also need to grab a standard baking sheet, but you can set it aside temporarily. Do not place the parchment paper on the baking sheet yet.

, Place one halibut fillet on the center of one parchment paper square. Repeat this with the other fillets and other pieces of parchment.


If you don't have enough space on your kitchen counter to spread out all four sheets of parchment, simply create one packet at a time, setting the remaining fillets and parchment aside until you're ready to use them.
When using skin-on fillets, you'll need to arrange the skin-side of each one face-down so the exposed flesh faces up. The placement of the fillets won't matter when using skinless halibut, though.

, Evenly sprinkle each fillet with salt and pepper.

, Lay the slices of citrus fruit over each fillet, followed by the thyme sprigs and sliced onion. Spread these aromatics evenly over the top of the halibut.


While lemon is the most conventional citrus pairing for fish, orange slices also work well for this recipe.
Baked halibut recipes using aromatic ingredients typically do best when you use the parchment baking method. The packets of paper trap the fragrant aromas in the air directly surrounding the fish, concentrating their flavor as a result.

, Fold up the sides of the each piece of parchment over the top of each fillet, sealing the edges.


Begin by folding lengthwise over the fillets. Overlap the folds and crease well to hold them.
Fold and roll each open end of the parchment, then tuck the ends beneath the packet to prevent them from coming undone.
Place each packet onto the prepared baking sheet when finished.

,


Since you'll have to undo the packet to test the fish, it's best to wait until you're relatively certain the fish is done. Only undo and test one packet. If it isn't done, fold the sides again and continue baking as need.

, Remove the finished halibut packets from the oven and enjoy them immediately.


You can either undo the packets and serve the fish on individual serving platters or allow each person to cut open his or her own packet.

Preheat the oven to 450 degrees Fahrenheit (230 degrees Celsius).Prepare a 9-inch by 13-inch (23-cm by 33-cm) baking sheet by lightly coating it with nonstick cooking spray.,
Toss together the flour, salt, and pepper.Place the three ingredients in a medium mixing bowl and thoroughly toss them together using a fork or whisk.,
Beat together the egg and milk.,
Combine the breading ingredients.,
Dredge the halibut in flour.,
Dip the halibut in the egg mixture.,
Coat the halibut with bread crumbs.,
Bake for 15 minutes.,
Serve.",How to Bake Halibut4,"


For an easier cleanup, you could cover the baking sheet with nonstick aluminum foil or parchment paper instead of using cooking spray.

,


You don't need to sift the flour, but if you notice any lumps, break them up with the utensil while mixing the ingredients.
The flour will make it easier for the outer coatings to adhere to the halibut. Adding the salt and pepper to the flour will allow them to flavor the flesh of the halibut more directly.

, Combine the two ingredients together in a second medium bowl. Whisk them together until evenly combined.


The egg and milk will help keep the halibut moist while also making it easier for the final coating to stick to the fish.

, In another separate medium bowl, combine the bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, and garlic powder, tossing them together until evenly combined.


Arrange the three bowls side-by-side. The flour mixture should be first, the egg mixture should be second, and the bread crumb mixture should be third.

, Working one at a time, place each halibut fillet in the flour mixture, turning as needed and lightly coating all sides.


Finish coating each fillet with all three layers before starting on the next one.
After coating the halibut with flour, hold it above the flour dish and give the fillet a gentle tap to dust off any excess flour.

, Dunk the halibut fillet in the egg mixture, turning as needed to coat all sides.


When finished, hold the fillet over the egg bowl for a few seconds to allow the excess egg a chance to drip off.

, Toss the halibut into the bread crumb mixture, turning as needed to coat all sides.


You may need to use your hands to gently press the crumb coating onto the sides of the fish.
As soon as you finish coating the fish with this last layer, place it onto your prepared baking sheet.

, Place the coated halibut in the preheated oven and cook for about 15 minutes, or until the center flakes apart easily when pierced with a fork.


If you'd like the halibut to develop a golden-brown coating, consider spraying the top of each coated fillet with a little oil-based cooking spray before placing the fish in the oven.
Note that you do not need to rotate or flip the fish as it bakes.

, Remove the finished halibut from the oven and enjoy it immediately.

Pick a suitable theme.,
Plan ahead.,
Plan your music.,
Decorate accordingly.,

Keep guests entertained.,
Expect the unexpected!,
Remember the goody bags!",How to Have a Birthday Party," Consider the age, gender, interests and hobbies of the guest of honor! Then choose a theme that suits them perfectly.


You can go ""all out"" and make every aspect of the party theme-related, or you can try a lighter touch by including just a little theme-related decoration or food.;
, Get your guest list made and your invitations out at least 2 weeks prior to the party (more if it's a big event). This way, you'll have an idea of how many people to expect and you can decide on the best location to accommodate your group size.

, Make sure you have a way to play your tunes - whether that be just a set of speakers with a phone or music player, or a whole DJ setup.


Even if you're not planning on having dancing, background music really helps set the atmosphere at the party. Make sure you have a range of fast, slow, soft, and quiet songs on hand to fit the mood at different times of the event and get your guests feeling celebratory.
If you're hosting a kids party, pick out some kid-friendly selections that won't drive the parents crazy. If you're hosting a grown-up celebration, make sure you have a range of genres available to suit everybody's likes, and let your guests play ""DJ"" too.
A good song is ""Birthday"" by Katy Perry, but you can choose other songs.

, Balloons and streamers are fun, but they're at every party! Get creative by tying into your theme. A large box can become a doghouse for a puppy party. Small pebbles spray-painted gold can be the treasure for a pirate party, and haystacks make great seats for a Wild West Party.

, Just remember, finger foods are best, particularly for young guests.


To lend an older mood to your party, prepare some more grown-up snacks, like chips and salsa, cheese and crackers, and range of easy-to-prepare appetizers. Make all your options things you can cook or put together ahead of time, so that you can spend the precious hours of the party enjoying your guests' company, rather than in the kitchen.

, Provide lots of opportunity for social mingling (particularly for grown-ups), as well as ""free play"" for kids. But to really keep the celebration going, games always seem to be the hit of the party! There are some great websites out there where you can find activities that tie into a particular theme.


Depending on your number of guests and their ages, you can even have several games running throughout the event. Balance your levels of activity so that there's plenty going on throughout the party; you can try something active like a three-legged race or Twister, followed by lower-key but social games like Pictionary or charades (or board games, for kids).

, With kids' parties especially, it is almost a certainty that things will not go exactly according to plan. Be prepared by having extra games and activities, extra goody bags, and a rain plan ready.


For older guests, you may not run into those particular issues, but be prepared with some extra food and activities if you end up with more guests than you expected, and be prepared to reign in the party to cater a smaller crowd if some people don't show up.

, Once again, try to keep the goodies relevant to the party theme and the age of your guests. For example the goody bag may contain chocolate bars and toys like grow your own frog etc.


If you're aiming your party at an older crowd, goody bags may not fit the mood, but that doesn't mean you can't send them home with a memento. Take snapshots of your friends being goofy in a make-shift ""photo booth"" and print them out for guests to take home (or send them along later, if you prefer), or make a fun ""grown-up goody bag"" with kazoos and party poppers for when people really want to get the party going.

Hunt for a gift to take to the party.,
Suit up for the party.,
Join in on the fun and games.,
Think of games you played as a kid, simple games that you know the kids will be able to understand and have fun playing.,
Do you have a special talent that the kids might be interested in?,
Join in when it's time to sing ""Happy Birthday"".,
Most importantly, remember to help the kids have fun while you're having fun yourself.",How to Have Fun at Younger Children's Parties," Some great ideas are toys, of course, but you can also be a bit more creative. Put together a ""gift pack"" filled with coloring books, crayons, and small games. Some of the simplest things can bring entertainment to a child. Also, if you're at a complete loss for what to give the child, you can get a card and put ten bucks in it so they can buy something that they know they will enjoy. If the birthday party has a theme, buy something that goes with the theme. That way you know they will like it! It also helps to check with their parent(s) to make sure you're not giving the child something they already have.;
, Parties for children usually aren't fancy at all, so make sure you dress down. A lot of play will go on, and messes will probably be made, so make sure you wear something decent but also make sure it isn't something you mind getting a drink, food, or some dirt on. A nice pair of jeans and a nice t-shirt will usually do the trick. Just make sure it's something that's not too dressy and easy to get clean.

, If they're having a game of tag out in the yard, go ahead and play! Don't let your ""adulthood"" get in the way of having fun. Make the best of it!

, When/if the party starts to get a little dull, start up one of those games.

, Are you an artist? If so, bring some finger-paint and some paper and let the kids make their own art. If you play guitar, learn a few children's songs and take your guitar along with you. Have a sing-along! You don't just have to be a guest, you can be part of the entertainment too.

, Don't sit there and act bored. Smile and sing!

, At the end of the day when you go home, you will probably look back and think about how much you enjoyed yourself!

Overcome the fear of going to the swim party.,
Simply sit on the side of the pool.,
Show up an hour early to the party.,

Immediately head to the side of the pool and clutch the wall.,
Success!",How to Go to a Pool Party When You Don't Know How to Swim," There are plenty of good swim classes at a good price.;
, Make sure that you trust them and don't be shy.

, While not being able to swim at a pool party sounds scary, you are a strong individual who can enjoy a party without the water part. Have faith in yourself. Moreover, be aware that other people, even those who can swim, may choose to not swim but still go to the party. It's not essential to get into the water.

, Who says you have to go in? Always stay at the shallow end, with your feet dangling into the water. You might even sit on a step. This can be sufficient to convince others you're participating.


Ask a friend who can swim to sit with you. He or she can rescue you if someone drags you in and takes you into deeper water.
Be honest. Tell people you can't swim but that you're happy to sit poolside or simply wade.

, This can give you the opportunity to practice swimming different ways if you've started learning. If you haven't learned yet, do not do this unless someone is there to supervise at all times.

, For people who swim regularly, this is a custom. What does it accomplish? Theoretically you'll know how cold the water is, in reality it is a symbolic gesture.

, The best way to do this is to go slowly. With each step, there may be a rush of fear as you submerge yourself in your nemesis, the water.

, Do not let go unless you're sure you're safe and confident. If you want to move around the pool, scale the side wall horizontally.


Think of it like climbing a mountain sideways.
If you're afraid of heights, think of something else.

, You can now enjoy the party from inside the pool instead of at the snack bar.


Hang around the pool wall and socialize.
You don't even have to swim, just hang out with friends and socialize.

For young girls, a princess theme or fairy theme might appeal to them. For older children, you could throw a more sophisticated Victorian tea party.


Other possible themes are Alice in Wonderland, Strawberry Shortcake, flowers and herbs, or your child’s favorite color.;
, The number of children you invite will depend upon your space. If you have tons of room (and patience) you can invite your child’s entire class. But if you want to stick to a budget and not have to invest in extra chairs or tables, help your child edit the list of invitees to as many people as you can fit around the table.Another guideline is to use your child’s age as the magic number. So if your child is six, stick to a maximum of about six guests., Weekend parties held during the day are often easiest for parents and children alike. Choose whether a morning tea party or an afternoon tea party best fits the ages and schedules of the children attending. Avoid 1-3 pm since this tends to be nap time for young kids.Be sure to include an end time on the invitation so that parents know they need to pick up their child at a specific time.

, For children, the cuter and more colorful, the better. Make your invitations to match the theme. For example, if you’re modeling your party after the tea party in Alice in Wonderland, you could cut your invitations in the shape of the Mad Hatter’s hat. For a princess party, use an old-looking font and language like “Hear ye! Hear ye!”Include a note encouraging children to dress up to match the theme, or just wear their fanciest clothes.

, If you’re mailing your invitations, send them 3-4 weeks in advance. If you’re hand delivering them to the children’s parents or sending out an evite, two weeks is enough time., If the children are old enough to sit at a normal kitchen or dining room table, you can use that. Just be sure it’s large enough to seat everyone you’re inviting. You may need to push a couple tables together if it’s a large group. Rent or buy extra folding chairs if you don’t have enough.For little kids who aren’t quite tall enough to sit at a standard table, try to find child-sized tables and chairs to make it more enjoyable for them. If you don’t want to purchase one of these sets, you could push several sturdy boxes or crates together and have everyone sit on cushions on the floor.

, Put a nice tablecloth over the table you’ll be using to serve the tea. Find fun and frilly cake stands or three-tiered dessert stands to display the food on. Give each place setting its own teacup, saucer, cloth napkin, and silver spoon.If you’re concerned about small children breaking nice china, either purchase these items from a thrift store or find plastic teacups.

, If it’s a fairy-themed party, hang string lights across the walls and around banisters or bookcases. If it’s a princess-themed party, use large rolls of brown craft paper to create a castle facade on the wall. Top it off with a construction paper dragon or knight.

Place extra teapots around the room and put flowers in them for a garden-themed party.
For an Alice in Wonderland party, hang lots of clocks on the walls and create over-sized playing cards out of construction paper.

, Buy costume pieces that the children can wear during the party, like feather boas, tiaras, fancy gloves, hats with fascinators, or fairy wings. You can stick to the theme or just be silly with it. You can buy cheap strands of beads at a dollar store and use them as costume jewelry or decorate the table with them.You could include a couple items at each place setting so children know to put them on when they sit down. Or keep them in a box near the door and have each child pick one as they arrive.

, If you want to provide party favors, you can keep it simple by wrapping up little cookies in cellophane and tying it with a nice ribbon. Or buy cheap novelty items like plastic teacups, stickers, or giant jeweled rings.For an Alice in Wonderland party, fill their favor bags with bottles of bubbles, playing cards, or black headbands that look like Alice's.
For a princess party, send them home with plastic tiaras, fun sunglasses, or little stuffed unicorns.

, Be prepared for very small children to not like the taste of tea. Offer a few decaffeinated teas, like a black tea and a fruit tea, but also have some backup options, like lemonade or juice.If you’re throwing a summertime tea party, serve flavored iced teas like mango or raspberry iced tea.
Make sure any tea you serve isn’t so hot that it will burn the kid’s mouths. Brew it early in the party and then allow it to cool to a safe warm temperature before serving.

, If your child is old enough and confident enough to pour tea, allow them to be the one to serve it after everyone is seated. That way they truly feel like they're the host of the party. If you're concerned about splashes or broken dishes, you can pour the tea and then let them distribute the food., Make cucumber, chicken salad, or even peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. Cut them in half or into quarters and remove any crust to accommodate picky eaters. These can be made a few hours in advance and stored in the refrigerator until you’re ready to serve them.Place the food onto doilies, cake stands, and tiered dessert stands to create a pretty display. Position them in the center of the table and allow the children to help themselves once they're seated. Or let your child go around and serve each of their friends once the tea is ready.

, Tea is frequently served with scones, cakes, and cookies. Make or buy a variety of sweets for them to indulge in, like chocolate cupcakes, carrot cake, cranberry scones, or sugar cookies. If you’re not a baker, buy frozen macarons or petits fours and thaw them a few hours before the party.Use cookie cutters to make the treats match the theme. For a fairy party, use a butterfly cookie cutter or try to find one made by Disney that’s in the shape of Tinkerbell.
Try to accommodate any food allergies so no one feels left out. For example, if you know one of your child’s friends has an egg allergy, find an egg-free cookie recipe to make.

, Look up etiquette guides for drinking tea and then give a lesson as you serve it. Explain how you hold the saucer close to your chest as you lift the cup to your mouth. Show them how you can hold your pinky out as you sip. Just keep this part short since the party should also be about having fun., Plan a craft around the theme of the party. For a princess party, set out construction paper, glitter, sequins, and tulle, and have them make their own princess hats. For a Victorian tea party, put out cheap headbands and let the kids wrap silk or ribbon around them and decorate them with fake flowers.For an Alice in Wonderland party, buy real or fake roses and let them paint them different colors. Hang them up to dry and then send the children home with their bouquets.
For a fairy party, buy lots of cheap costume wings and let the kids decorate them with sequins and glue. Then they can wear them once they're dry.

, It’s hard for kids to sit still at a table for long periods of time, so let them do something physical, like playing musical chairs, dancing to upbeat music, or playing lawn games if the weather is nice. Croquet is a fun and on-theme game for a Victorian party if you own a set or can borrow one.For a princess party, get a dragon piñata and let them take turns trying to break it open with a “princess scepter.”
For a general tea party theme, invent little games involving teacups, like trying to toss sugar cubes across the room into cups worth different amounts of points.

If you’re hosting this for a group of children you know, you probably already have the particular individuals in mind. However, it’s still helpful to create a guest list to solidify everything.


Include their parents' name and contact phone number, as well.
If you are considering asking another adult to the party to help you supervise the children, write their name down on the list, too.;
, Choose a room in your home that can accommodate the number of children attending the party and their crafting supplies. There needs to be plenty of flat work space for the kids. Several tables and chairs will be needed. Make sure there is plenty of light, natural or otherwise, in the party room. The atmosphere should be comfortable and well-ventilated.


If your garage is comfortable, you might want to consider holding the party there, or perhaps in your basement. These locations will likely be large enough to fit everyone.
Avoid using a room with nice carpeting and furniture, since the crafts party will probably get pretty messy. Choose a place where you don’t have to worry about accidental spills or messes.

, With a venue and guest list solidified, you can now nail down the date and time for the party. Since it’s for children, you’ll need to choose a day when they don’t have school and will have the entire afternoon free. If it’s during the school year, choose a Saturday or Sunday. If it’s summer or during a holiday break, you have a little more freedom.


Speak to the parents of the children you’re inviting to find out their schedules and availability.

, If your child is part of the party, you could enlist their help creating crafty-looking hand drawn invitations. If you’re making the invitations yourself, consider printing something cute up on card stock and handing those out. Be sure to announce that it’s a crafting party and that you will be providing all of the necessary supplies. You could even give the party a fun name, like “Craft-stravaganza!” or something else silly like that.Make sure you include the date, location, start time and end time. Ask for an RSVP so that you can properly prepare for the party.
You may want to ask the children to bring an old t-shirt or garbage bag to use as a smock during the party, depending on how messy the crafts are. You could provide these yourself, if you prefer.

, While a theme isn’t required for the party, it might be fun for the kids and it will also help you choose the activities and crafts for them. If there’s a holiday coming up, consider using that as a theme. If the party is being held for someone’s birthday, you can tailor everything around that. You can also come up with something more specific for a theme.


For example, you could choose a theme like “outer space” or “dinosaurs” and the activities you select can reflect those concepts. Other simple themes to consider: vehicles, inventions, princesses, fantasy creatures, circus, aliens, robots and trains.You can always forego having a theme and simply provide the children with supplies and space and let them create what they want.

, This will depend a lot on the ages of the children. Very young children shouldn’t be making any crafts that require using sharp scissors or small pieces that can be swallowed. Finger-painting activities and using glue sticks are good places to start with them. If the children are a little older, age eight and up, your options are a little wider.


For instance, if Halloween is coming up, the kids could work on making treat bags and masks.You could have them make theme-inspired collages with the supplies you provide for them. Simpler ideas could be coloring activities and drawing activities. Get creative!

, Make sure you have plenty of everything to go around to avoid fighting. For example, if the kids are working on coloring or drawing activities, multiple washable marker and crayon sets should be set out for them, as well as a variety of colored pencils and regular pencils. If the kids are working on something very particular, like making Halloween masks, make sure you provide a wide variety of colored paper, markers, stencils, glitter and so on.Some typical craft party supplies are colorful cardstocks in an array of sizes, construction paper, washable markers, crayons, pencils, glue sticks, colored pencils, tape, scissors, glitter, stickers, rubber stamps and ink, finger paint, paint brushes and paper plates.
For collage crafts, provide a random assortment of items like egg cartons, feathers, faux gems, lids, jars, containers, beads, packing peanuts, buttons, yarn, craft pom-poms, foil, clay and anything else you can think of.

, Ideally, each child should have a mini station set up for them, with all of the needed supplies laid out. If you can’t create individual workspaces, make sure the work surface you’re using is very large and spread the supplies out evenly from one end to the other.The children can pick their supplies from the “community” pile on the table. Make sure they have room to spread out and move around easily.

, Regardless of the age range, a crafting party with children is going to get messy! Cover all the surfaces with newspaper and keep a large trash can and plenty of paper towels nearby. Anything in the area that you want to protect should be wrapped with plastic and moved out of the way. You could also cover the work surfaces with old sheets, table cloths or shower curtains (as long as they aren’t dirty).You could also cover the tables with white craft paper and encourage the children to draw and color on them at the party.

, Welcome the children to the party as they arrive. Let them explore the room for a minute, and then bring them to their work stations. You could even create individual name cards for work stations, if you like. Once everyone has arrived, go over all of the supplies you’ve laid out and remind them that, if necessary, to share the items.


If you’re providing them, go ahead and hand out the old t-shirts or garbage bags to protect their clothing.

, If there’s a theme, announce it. Explain the planned activities and make sure everyone understands. You may want to do a simple demonstration yourself, just to provide the children with a visual of what they’ll be doing at their work stations. Encourage them to have fun and let them begin!


If you can set up music in the room, definitely put on some fun tunes for the kids to listen to as they work. If the party has a theme, try to find music that reinforces it. Otherwise, just put on something fun and high energy.

, You could serve treats that match the party’s theme – for example, for a zoo theme you could serve them animal crackers, fudge striped cookies, fish crackers, etc.You could also simply provide them with some finger sandwiches, pizza, veggies and fruit, or cookies and other treats. Have a few different options available for beverages, including water.


Talk to each child’s parent before the party and find out if any of them have food allergies, dietary restrictions, etc.

, At the end of the party, go around the room and praise everyone’s creations. Hold the completed crafts up for everyone to see and commend the children on jobs well-done. As the children leave, allow them to take their crafts with them and, if you get the opportunity to speak to the parents when they pick up their kids, openly praise their children's work to them.


If you like, send the children home with any leftover treats you may have, like cookies or candies.
You could also send them home with extra activities as party favors, like coloring activities and a small set of crayons or markers."

You will also need to consider their skill level. This will help guide your craft choices.Consider multiple crafts for groups of mixed-age children.
Avoid crafts that require sharp tools if your crafters are under the age of five.;
, You will want the kids to be able to complete the crafts on their own, with only a little bit of help from the adults. For example, if you are hosting a group of five-year-olds, try making DIY bunny ears or small sheep made of cotton balls., If you are hosting a craft party for your child, or if you will be making crafts as part of a child’s birthday party, think about what your child enjoys the most. If they like fabric arts, consider a tie-dye craft party. If they love sending mail, try making themed greeting cards with the children., When deciding where you will host a kids’ craft party, think about the crafts you will be making and the space needed for supplies, guests, and crafting. For example, if you are inviting a total of four children to the party, your kitchen table might be the perfect place for crafting. If you are hosting ten children, however, you might need to rent a larger space."

Enjoy the occasion.",How to Hire an Entertainer for a Children's Party," If you're calling an entertainer you've found on the Internet, ask them where they're located. If they're hundreds of miles away, if they even agree to help, they'll probably be a ""talent agency"" middleman company that will subcontract the job to some unknown person who is local to you and this will end up costing you more. Avoid this kind of third party contract; it's not only cheaper to find the local person yourself but it is also better because you can meet them in person and ask around about their reputation.


Word-of-mouth is a very important means for finding good entertainers. Ask around other moms and dads, teachers, carers, etc., to get their feedback on entertainers they've used in the past.;
, Event planners get dozens of contacts from professional companies and entertainers of all different types and prices ranges.


Call earlier than you think you should! Many good entertainers will be booked out well in advance and finding a time that suits you might be hard, especially during holiday seasons.

, Remember you are going to be making a contract with the entertainer. To have a valid contract you need to know the name of the entertainer or the company you are contracting with. Many companies, especially those who send out people in costumes of Trade Mark characters popular with children are not licensed to use the costume and are not legal companies. Therefore they are doing counterfeit characters. A contract with one of them is not valid and you have no legal protection should a problem arise. Be sure you know the name, address, phone number and legal contact person for the company you are dealing with for your protection and the safety of your child. Be very careful of dealing with companies on the Internet that do not provide this information. Have the following information ready to tell them:


The exact date and time. It can also be handy to ask about cancellation fees or reschedule dates in case something goes amiss.
Exactly how many kids you're expecting to be at the party and their age range.
How many kids the entertainment package will cover.
The amount of time you want the kids to be entertained for, and whether or not this includes eating time.
Ask about the level of variety (for example, face painting, balloons, tricks, stories, etc.) the entertainer can provide; this can be very important for a party of longer duration where the kids can easily grow bored.
Any particular preferences for performance ideas, tricks, and so on, that you have in mind.
If you don't have a venue in mind, this is a good opportunity to ask if the entertainer has their own premises or good suggestions.

, Price is not the only indicator to keep in mind when making your selection. While you may be tempted to take the cheapest price, only do so if you're also guaranteed a high level of professionalism and the entertainer has a good reputation.Does the manner in which they present their company or activities appear professional and polished? Does their advertising material (website, pamphlets, etc.) reveal that they have taken care in putting together what they have to offer? Have they taken the time to add photos or videos of their work and talents? Who is doing the job? Are they sending in an employee?
Does the entertainer provide the range of activities and talents you're after?
Does the entertainer provide more than one person where he or she is offering one-to-one activities such as face-painting? If not, how can they keep the remaining children entertained while one child is the focus of their attention?
Does the entertainer have any memberships or qualifications that they can show you? For example, does the entertainer belong to a guild of magicians, a club of children's entertainers, etc., that you can look up online or phone to check further? What about references from other parents or schools? And an entertainer who has received specific education in their field of entertainment will have been trained in safety issues and proper care of children as well as in performing.
Ask whether the entertainer has been checked with police and if they are covered by liability insurance.
Do the two of you ""click""? The entertainer's enthusiasm and willingness to be a successful part of your child's party should be evident to you through their tone of voice, the information they've provided you, their flexibility to accommodate your wishes, and the extent of agreement to the things you'd like to happen.

, Once you've agreed to the date, duration, and cost, be sure to get an email or written confirmation from the entertainer that you will be able to hold them to.


With respect to payment, do not give out your credit card information to companies you've hired off the net. If you must pay a deposit, use PayPal instead. For local performers, either turn up in person to make a deposit, or send a check. The best arrangement is the one where you pay in full at the door when the entertainer arrives. They have your address, so the arrangement is trustworthy.

, If the entertainer needs to arrive beforehand to set up props, tricks, etc., be sure to know this in advance and make arrangements so that it won't interfere with the rest of your party preparations. If you need to supply anything, be sure to have confirmed this well in advance of the party.


Know in advance if there are specific space, height, or safety requirements to ensure, such as room for juggling, no cords to trip over, etc.
Ask the entertainer about preferred seating arrangements for the children.

, Do the following checks:


Ask for the entertainer’s identity. Use the entertainer's business license or driver's license for proof of identity. You do not want strangers in the house with your children. You will be able to call the registering authority to check a business license holder's credentials.
Ask to see the entertainer's certificate of liability insurance. It must have the entertainer's name on it. Professional entertainers in the USA and Britain have liability insurance and this will protect you from personal liability if an accident happens. For other jurisdictions, check the local requirements, or check your own insurance coverage.
Make a written contract at the door if you haven't already done so in advance.

, You've put in the hard work to hire the right professional for your children's party, so sit back, relax and enjoy watching your children have a lot of fun!


Another reason for doing all the checks and being certain about the entertainer is that this frees you up to deal with catering, other parents, and any wayward upset kids at the party.

",How to Create a Surprise Hogwarts Party," You will need some friends that are in on the surprise, so e-mail them or give them a special invite out of school. Here's an example:


Dear ______,
Come to my surprise party!
We'll have lots of fun! I hope you can come! The date is ________. Please meet me at (venue) ______. It would be nice if you could please wear black robes or clothes, and maybe green, red, blue or yellow ties. Please bring a stick or a wand too, and maybe a pocket watch! See you!
Love, ______

, If you are a girl, you need 2 boys. If you are a boy, you need a boy and a girl. This will be so you can make the Harry Potter trio, but this is optional. Some other choices are below.


3 girls - Hermione, Luna and Ginny
3 boys - Harry, Ron and Malfoy
2 girls, one boy - Hermione, Ginny, Ron/Harry

,,,, Make them be teachers. Grandparents and siblings can help as well! Older siblings can be prefects (make sure they choose their house), younger siblings can be the first years/ teachers' kids, Mom can be Professor Sprout (especially if she's a little bit chubby), Dad can be Snape, Granddad could be Dumbledore and Grandma can be McGonagall.

, Like for Dumbledore, ""I have great pleasure in welcoming you to Hogwarts."" Or for Professor Sprout, ""Careful with those Mandrakes!"" Prefects can stand outside the venue, guiding people in small groups to go up.

, Put maroon, green, blue and yellow balloons outside.

,), a room filled with plants can be Herbology, and if you have a basement with lots of little bottles and collections, there's your Potions room.

, ""Hallo!"", they say, and off you go.

, Explain to them that the prefects and teachers will give out points, and the house with the most points wins. Tell them that they're going to get sorted.

, Put a magician's/witch's hat on their heads, and from behind somewhere, have someone secretly shout their house. Have siblings sorted too. For example:


Brown, Zoe? (a parent or grandparent)
""HUFFLEPUFF! (backstage person)

, Guide people around and then, sit down where you're going to have your party. Some cool things to try:


Hogwarts Disco Night!
Pin the Wand on the Wizard
Reading HP books or watching the movies
A Harry Potter trivia quiz (have a representative from each house, and award points/take away points for every answer.

, A little bit through the feast, have a professor or prefect come in screaming ""TROLL! IN THE DUNGEON! TROLL! Uh, I thought you wanted to know. *faints*"" A professor (preferably Dumbledore) will tell everyone to not panic and evacuate to the basement, while they stay upstairs and banish the ""troll.""

, Some people will get panicky, but if they want to go home, whisper to them ""Snape and Dumbledore will get this sorted out in a few moments. Now ssh."" Give prefects the signal, and have a professor come out and say ""All clear.""

, Have people go in threes, and the people who find it get 60 points for their house. But remember to include 1 challenge, that the people who find the stone have to defeat a monster (you dressed up in a dragon suit).

, Have Dumbledore go announce it. ""Hmm... may I have your attention, please? Thank you. In last place, with __ points, (house)______. In third place, with ___ points, _____. In second place, with a close to first finish with __ points, ____. And the winner, with an astounding ___ points, is.... _______!""

, Be a good host. Make sure everyone got one! And for the house cup winners, have a special little treat. Maybe a little chocolate.

, Normal shop-bought invites may be convenient but they don’t really have that Hogwarts feel. Instead, make your own invites by hand. Write out your invites by hand on some parchment, tie the envelope with a red ribbon and give the invites out. Don’t forget to print the Hogwarts crest on the envelope! Also, it might be fun to address people by their Harry Potter character names.


If you want your invites to look perfect, you can make the paper look old by scrunching it up and staining it with a tea bag. This will make the invites super cool!;
, That’s not a bedroom, it’s Albus Dumbledore’s office! Your house is literally waiting for you to turn it into Hogwarts. You garden could easily be the greenhouse or Hagrid’s monsters and mythical animals lesson. Your dining room would make a nice grand hall, don’t you think? Oh, and don’t forget Snape’s potion mixing class, along with all the common rooms!

, Add some sound effects from the movie like the sound of moaning myrtle in the bathroom or the mandrakes crying loudly in the greenhouse. You can even include Ron's car being crashed by the whomping willow. Most of these sounds can be found cheaply and sometimes freely online.

, It can’t be a real Harry Potter party if you don’t go searching for the Basilisk in your basement (which, of course, looks a lot like the Chamber of Secrets). You don’t need to use a real snake for this, just use your imagination. Somebody could dress up like Lord Voldemort while the others try to defeat him. There’s lots to be done so be sure to try everything.


It doesn’t all need to be fighting though. You can try having some potion mixing classes, joining a wizard chess club or even having a magic duel. Remember that no physical fighting or deadly spells are allowed though!

Send out invitations.,
Gather your supplies.,
Create the craft on your own before the party.,
Set up craft stations the day of the party.,
Prepare snacks for the party.",How to Arrange a Kid's Craft Party2," Once you decide on the date and location of your kids’ craft party, you will want to send out invitations. You can send traditional paper invitations in the mail. You can also invite guests via social media, email, or telephone. Make sure you ask guests to RSVP by a certain date so that you will know how many crafters to plan on.Send out the invitations 2-4 weeks before the party.

, Make a list of all the tools and supplies you will need for the craft party. Buy what you need, but also plan on purchasing extra. Having extra supplies and tools on hand can be helpful if you end up with an unexpected guests or accidents that ruin supplies., A children’s craft party will go more smoothly if you test the crafts ahead of time. Before the party, make each craft and resolve any issues before the guests arrive. For example, if the paint takes too long to dry between steps of the craft, children might not be able to take their completed craft home with them at the end of the party., Before your guests arrive, set up individual craft stations for each of the children. The stations should each have their own set of supplies and the tools necessary for completing the crafts. For example, you can set up individual stations along your dining room table., Most crafters will be hard at work on their creations, so an elaborate meal is probably not the best choice. Instead, stick to finger foods and easy-to-eat snacks. For example, try a fruit and veggie tray, cookies, or crackers and cheese. Keep it simple so your guests can focus on the crafts."
"
Supervise the kids.,
Ask other adults to help.,
Incorporate some games.,
Set a time limit for the party.",How to Arrange a Kid's Craft Party3," As the kids are making their crafts, walk around the room and ask everyone how they are doing. This will let the kids know you are there to help them if necessary. You can also let the kids know you are ready to refill supplies if they run out., If your guests’ parents are staying for the craft party, ask them to help out. You can assign them different roles, like refilling supply stations or checking in with individual kids to make sure their crafting is going smoothly., You can have even more fun at a kids’ craft party by playing games. This is a great way to spend time in between craft steps, like while the kids are waiting for the glue to dry. Try a game like musical chairs or duck, duck, goose. For older kids, try a game like pin the tail on the donkey., You don’t want the party to go on too long, so it’s important that there is an end time. For example, if you are hosting a group of 3-year-olds, an hour will generally be long enough for the craft party. A group of 4-6 years olds, on the other hand, can enjoy a party that lasts a couple of hours."

, The park, or outside in the front lawn works out just fine. Be sure to listen to any suggestions that your family might have about picking out a decent place.

, Some ideas for a good invitation is to make them out of green, black, and red construction paper for a watermelon shape, or just be creative and make up your own. The watermelon shape may be extremely popular with kids.

, It should be medium to large sized, depending on how many food items you plan to bring. If you have items that can spoil in the heat, you should have a cooler to bring with you too. If you don't have your own, you can get one at public grocery stores like Safeway, Walmart, or King Soopers.

Serve immediately or refrigerate.",How to Make Scotch Eggs," Bring a pan of water to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. Lower in six eggs and cook for six minutes. Starting the eggs in hot water instead of a cold pan makes them much easier to peel.Cooking this many eggs in one pan can throw off the timing. Cook them in two batches for more consistent results.Use eggs from a trusted, high-quality source. Soft-boiling does not kill salmonella, so an egg from an infected source could cause serious illness in young or elderly people.;
, Drop the eggs in an ice bath or in a bowl of cold water in the fridge to stop them cooking. Chilled eggs are usually easier to peel., The easiest option is to buy 600g (about 1⅓ lb) of sausage meat and call it a day. This can be on the greasy side, though, so some chefs prefer a 50/50 mix of sausage meat and leaner pork mince. You can either piggyback off the flavors in an herb-heavy sausage, or choose a plain sausage and mix in your own herbs and spices. (See the ingredients list above for suggestions.)


You can use raw sausages instead — just cut the casings open and drop the meat into a bowl.
Sausage meat usually has enough salt and pepper, but you may want to add some if you used minced meat.

, Tap all around the eggs with the back of a spoon, then peel off the shells.

, Arrange a line of ingredients on the counter, in separate bowls:


Soft-boiled eggs
Meat
60g (½ cup) Flour
Two additional raw eggs, beaten until smooth
120g (2 cups) panko breadcrumbs

, Divide your meat into six equal portions, and shape each one into a ball. Dip your egg into the flour to help the meat stick.Poke a hole into each ball with your thumb, insert an egg, and close the meat around it., Use your line of ingredients to add a crispy outer layer to your eggs:


Roll the meat-wrapped egg in flour
Dip it in the beaten eggs
Roll in panko breadcrumbs
Dip in the beaten egg again
Roll in the breadcrumbs again

, This is easiest in a deep fryer, but you can fill a deep frying pan ⅓ to ½ full of vegetable oil instead. Heat the oil to 170ºC (340ºF), then cook the eggs about ten minutes. If using a pan, cook the eggs two or three a a time and rotate frequently so they turn crisp and golden on all sides. Transfer the eggs to a bowl lined with paper towels to drain off excess oil.


If you don't have a cooking thermometer, drop a small piece of bread onto the oil to test the temperature. Your oil is the right temperature if the bread sizzles and browns, but does not burn.The cooking time varies depending on the amount of sausage meat on each egg, and how evenly the egg is wrapped. If you're worried about cooking the pork all the way, move the cooked egg to a preheated 190ºC (375ºF) oven for a couple minutes., You can eat Scotch eggs hot, or refrigerate them for later. For food safety reasons, don't leave Scotch eggs out of the fridge for more than two hours (one hour in hot weather). If you bring the eggs to a picnic, store them in a cooler."

Understand what makes something patentable.,
Determine if your recipe is novel.,
Determine if your recipe is non-obvious.,
Decide what kind of patent you need.,
Figure out where you need patent protection.,
Work with an attorney to file your paperwork.,
Wait for your application to be approved or rejected.",How to Patent a Recipe," Section 35 USC § 101 on patent law states that ""Whoever invents or discovers any new and useful process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter, or any new and useful improvement thereof, may obtain a patent therefor, subject to the conditions and requirements of this title.""Recipes can fall into this category in two different ways, since they are always useful, they may involve a new process or technique, and they include a composition of matter. All of this is to say that recipes are indeed possible to patent as long as they meet the other requirements., In legal terminology, ""novel"" refers to something that did not previous exist.This is where things get tricky when it comes to patenting recipes. It's very difficult to determine whether a particular mix of ingredients has been whipped up in someone's kitchen before. There are a few forms of research you should undertake in order to see if your recipe is novel enough to patent.


Search the United States Patent and Trademark Office database to see if your recipe has already been patented.
Search cookbooks and the Internet for your recipe. If you find the recipe in either location you may be ineligible for a patent because of an existing patent or the recipe will be considered already ""disclosed"" if it has been published elsewhere.
If you cannot find an exact replication of the recipe, you can proceed to determining whether your recipe meets the other qualifications.

, If your recipe involves a technique or combination of ingredients that leads to unique, non-obvious results, it may be patentable. However, if your recipe is something that could easily be thought up by someone else, or involves techniques that lead to predictable results, it's probably not patentable. Since most recipes invented by home cooks don't lead to results that would surprise a seasoned cook, they usually aren't patentable.


Food companies are more likely to create recipes that are patentable, because they are able to use experimental processes and ingredients that lead to non-obvious results. For example, a patentable recipe might be one that uses a new technique to give it a surprisingly long shelf life.
Simply adding a unique ingredient to a recipe isn't non-obvious enough to make it patentable. For example, an experimental home cook might decide to add cinnamon to a meatloaf recipe. Though the results might be surprisingly delicious, most home chefs could predict the flavor change that the addition of cinnamon would bring about., There are several different kinds of patents available and a recipe could fall into several categories of patents. The Utility Patent protects new inventions that have a useful application. This covers new methods, processes, machines, manufactured items, devices or chemical compounds or any new improvements to any of these items or processes. Most recipes would fall under the Utility Patent category unless you plan on packaging your final product in a unique package that also requires a patent. In this case you'd also apply for a Design Patent.

, Patents can be filed either in the United States or globally. If you feel that your recipe requires international protection, then you should apply for a global patent.

, There are patent lawyers who specialize in filing the necessary paperwork with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. While you're certainly allowed to submit your own paperwork, the patent office recommends you hire a lawyer at this point to handle the flow of paperwork and make sure you submit all the required materials. Regardless of who does the actual filing, the papers are then submitted electronically to the patent office.


The application can be obtained from the United States Patent and Trademark Office website, at uspto.gov.The patent application should be filed either online or via regular mail (note that filing online will allow you to avoid the $400 filing fee)., The US patent office will consider your paperwork and make a determination if your recipe is eligible for a patent. If you're approved, the patent office will contact you. After you pay an issue and publication fee, your patent will be granted.


If your application is rejected you have an opportunity to appeal the decision or make any amendments that the patent office may have suggested. You then resubmit your application for review once again.
If your application is rejected and you still want to protect your recipe, you can do so by declaring it a trade secret.Those who know the secret will be required to sign a non-disclosure agreement, and in this way you can prevent your recipe from getting leaked.

, Photos are a great decoration and they add extra dimension to a photo project. If you are making a family recipe scrapbook, take photos of everyone in your family in the kitchen.

, The following are choices you can make in printing your book:


Create an account on Snapfish.com, Shutterfly.com or Blurb.com. Use their software to upload your text and photos. Review your book and then send it to be printed.

The plastic covers will protect your recipes when there are spills in the kitchen.

, Write the recipes and shopping list directly onto the pages or print onto the scrapbook paper using your printer.

, By cutting slits in the pages and attaching the envelopes to the back of the page, you can hold your cards and take them out when you need them.

Place a mat or large straight edge beneath a page. Measure out several horizontal lines that are just slightly wider than your recipe cards. Use a utility knife to cut 1 to 5 slits into each page. Align the slits on the page.
Cut as many glassine envelopes as you have recipe cards. Measure them so that they are slightly smaller in height than your cards, approximately 2 inches (5 cm). This way, when the cards are inserted you will still be able to see the title of the recipe. Affix an envelope to the back of each page, just above the slot, with adhesive tape. One horizontal strip of tape on the back of the envelope and just above the slot will work well.
Repeat the process on each page that you want to have recipe cards. Check that each card slides into the slot and is easily removable.

, Frame photos on paper and glue them onto each page.

, For example, desserts, appetizers, main courses, soups and salads may all be in different sections. Decorate the divider page with photos and illustrations.

, Open the rings on the binder and place the pages in order.

Use creativity to plan a budget-conscious picnic that is fun for everyone without appearing to be done on a shoestring.,
Select an unusual location not normally associated with company picnics, especially if you aren't too concerned about budget.,
Make arrangements for employees who don't live near the picnic location.,
Combine the company picnic with a teamwork retreat by planning a weekend getaway.",How to Arrange a Company Picnic,"


Contact your city parks and recreation department about rental of park facilities. Reserve a party pavilion as these usually include grills and picnic tables for serving meals. City parks are usually lower-cost options with more free or inexpensive amenities including splash pads and playgrounds for employees with young children, horseshoes or disc golf courses, or baseball diamonds or large field for playing ball. Larger parks with ponds or small lakes also may offer paddle boats or fishing.
Buy picnic food in bulk at a warehouse store and assign a team of employees to serve as cooks. Ask company managers to make a real impact and give a special ""thank you"" to employees by doing the cooking themselves.
Arrange for catering with a local restaurant that might be willing to cut you a special deal if you pick it up and serve the food yourselves, or if you hold your company picnic at a time that is usually slow for them. They'll appreciate the business and might be willing to give you a discounted rate.;
, Look to an area theme park, sculpture garden, arboretum, zoo or dude ranch for a special company picnic your employees won't soon forget.


Each of these types of venues will have a group sales staff who can assist you with all the details based on your budget. Their packages will usually include admission to the park, a meal and snacks, a reserved area to which only your employees will have access, signage at the park announcing your group, and any promotional materials you might need to inform your employees of the picnic.
Such venues usually have specific times when they'll allow company picnics or require reservations of a set block of hours. Such a requirement may make your decision for you, as you might not want to pay for an eight-hour block of time if you only plan to have a four-hour picnic. Keep set-up and break-down time in mind when making your reservation.

, Perhaps your company has employees who work from home, in satellite offices or at retail outlets in other cities. Consider these employees' needs if you plan to invite them to the festivities.


Arrange for room blocks at an area hotel. You can work directly with the hotel or contact your local convention and visitor's bureau for assistance in negotiating between a couple lodging options. You are not charged for the blocks; the hotels will simply hold the discounted rooms for your employees for a set time.
Determine whether the company will cover transportation costs. If employees are coming from satellite locations, encourage them to ride-share or use company vehicles to transport them to the picnic location. Arrange shuttle service for the employees from their hotels to the picnic location, either via a company vehicle, hotel shuttle or rented bus or vans.

, Select a location away from your office such as a nearby lake with cabins or a ranch with bunkhouses and cabins on-site.


If including families in a retreat weekend, you may need to provide entertainment options for spouses and children or let them know that entertainment is each family's responsibility. Again, work with your local convention and visitor's bureau to come up with entertainment choices, discount tickets or group tours.

Do you need to have a cooler for chilled items? Do you need extra napkins or paper towels for clean up? Decide what your menu is and what food prep items you'll need to enjoy your outdoor meal safely.


You may need to plan to bring a jug of water, hand washing soap or hand sanitizer with you. If the area you're going to doesn't have a bathroom or washroom, you'll need to have these supplies with you. This way you are practicing safe food handling at all times.
Will you need extra plates and utensils for serving? Consider what raw items you'll have and how many plates or utensils you'll use preparing these foods. For example, you cannot use the same platter raw chicken was held on to serve the cooked chicken.
Think about what supplies you have at home for transportation. Do you have a cooler bag? Do you have enough freezer bags or ice? Buy what items you don't have.;
, Probably one of the most important aspects of food safety when it comes to outdoor eating is keeping foods cold. If you let foods get above 40F, you're allowing harmful bacteria (like Listeria) to grow. You need to keep foods very cold until ready to eat or cook.You need to have a cooler bag, freezer packs or ice to keep foods cold. Chilled foods need to be stored at 40F or cooler. If foods reach a temperature above this, especially for more than 2 hours, these foods should be thrown away and not eaten.
Foods like meat, poultry or seafood can be put into freezer bags frozen (which can help the bag stay cooler overall). They will slowly and safely thaw in the freezer bag.
You may also consider freezing water bottles and putting them into resealable plastic bags. These can serve as ice to keep the cooler cold and when they're thawed, they'll be a nice cold beverage for everyone.

, In addition to keeping your cooler nice and cold, you need to make sure you organize it appropriately. There are some tricks that can keep cold foods cold and prevent cross contamination of foods during transportation.If you're storing chilled items with shelf-stable items, make sure you separate them into specific groups. This will help you keep foods at the right temperature for longer as people continuously open and close the cooler.
Start by putting some freezer packs or ice at the bottom of the cooler and then put all your chilled items in. Top with more freezer packs or ice.
On top of the chilled items should go all shelf stable food or items that will be taken out, cooked and then eaten immediately.

, When you're organizing your cooler, it's important to think of how to separate foods. It might be best to use 1 or 2 coolers instead of trying to fit all your foods into one cooler bag.


Keep beverages separate. People will continuously go back into coolers for drinks. The more you open and close a cooler, the quicker it'll heat up. Beverages are shelf stable even though we prefer to drink them cold. Keep those separate from perishable foods.
Also keep meat and poultry items in separate resealable plastic bags. In case of leakage, these items will be contained and any juices will not be able to cross contaminate other foods.
Separate all utensils and serving dishes from foods as well. You might want to bring this in a paper or plastic bag away from foods.

, Food safety experts have a ""danger zone"" temperature range that you need to keep note of. As mentioned, if foods get over 40F this puts them into the danger zone. Monitor the temperature of your picnic foods to make sure they stay at the proper temperature.You can use an instant read thermometer left in your color bag to keep an eye on the overall temperature inside your cooler.
When transporting foods, do not put your cooler in your hot trunk. Keep it on the back seat in the shade of an air conditioned car.
Also, do not leave coolers outside in the sun. If the outside temperature is 90F or above, your cooler shouldn't be left outside for more than 1 hour.
If any foods are kept at over 40F more than two hours, do not eat them. Discard them immediately.

, When you're packing up your cooler, it's important to make sure you prevent any cross contamination - where bacteria from one food gets into or onto another food. Washing and cleaning all your fresh fruits and vegetables can keep your overall picnic safer.Make sure to take the time to wash all your ready to eat fruits and vegetables. These would be apples, pears, carrot sticks, celery sticks, etc. You'll be eating the skin so you need to run them under warm water to rinse away any visible dirt.
Also wash fruits and vegetables where the rind or skin is inedible. You can still contaminate other foods and contaminate the inside of those fruits and vegetables as you slice through the outer skin.
Once you've washed all your produce, keep them in a separate plastic bag or container. This keeps them clean and ready to eat.

, Just like you would at home, it's still important to wash and sanitize your hands when you're preparing your picnic or tailgating food. It may even be more important as you're most likely serving other people. Follow these hand washing techniques:


Wet your hands under running water. You may want a friend or family member to pour water over your hands if there isn't a sink.Squirt a little bit of soap onto your hands. Rub your hands together to get a full lather. Scrub your hands, wrists and under your fingernails for at least 20 seconds.
Again, rinse your hands under running water. Grab a friend to help you if there isn't a sink. Rinse until all the soap is gone.
Dry with a paper towel or dish towel. Do not touch a door handle or faucet after this stage.
If you are using sanitizer, rub a quarter size drop of sanitizer all over your hands and wrists until it evaporates and your hands are dry.

, Whether it's hamburgers, hot dogs or barbecue chicken, you need to make sure you cook each type of protein properly. When you ingest undercooked poultry or meat you take the risk of getting sick.To get the most accurate temperature reading and to make sure you're safe, bring an instant read or infrared thermometer with you to your picnic or tailgating party. These tools can help ensure you get the exact temperature needed to make sure the foods are safe.
Ground beef, pork or lamb needs to be cooked until it reaches an internal temperature of 160F.
Steaks, pork chops, pork loin or other whole cuts of meat should be cooked until they reach an internal temperature of 145F.
Ground poultry or whole poultry (like drumsticks) should be cooked until it reaches an internal temperature of 165F.
If you're bringing leftovers or you've made a casserole to reheat on the grill, these also need to be cooked until they reach an internal temperature of 165F as well.

, Many picnics and tailgating parties involve a few hours of eating. People will continuously go back for seconds during the game or as you enjoy your afternoon. Like cold foods, you need to make sure hot foods stay at the correct temperature as well.Hot foods, even if cooked to the proper temperature, can end up causing people to get sick. As food cools, they can get back down into the danger zone temperature range.
Use your instant read or infrared thermometer to track the temperature of hot dishes you're serving. They should stay at 140F or higher.
You can leave these hot foods out for about 1-2 hours. After two hours of sitting out, they should be discarded.
Allow foods to sit for a little while everyone serves themselves and then put them back on the grill to stay hot and above the 140F temperature range. To prevent them from drying out, put these hot foods on an elevated grill rack or side of the grill that's on low or off.

, Even if you do all the right things when it comes to packing and cooking foods to the right temperature, you can contaminate all your foods if you accidentally reuse utensils and serving platters.Plates, bowels, trays or forks that were used to hold, prep and cook raw foods should be discarded afterwards or put away until you get home to wash them.
If you accidentally reuse these items, it's recommended to throw away the cooked food. You have possibly reintroduced harmful bacteria from the raw food's juices to the cooked food.
Once you've put food on the grill, have a new and clean platter and utensil set ready to go. This helps eliminate the possibility of you forgetting to switch to clean items.
Also do not reuse a marinade or sauce leftover from raw meat or poultry. Even if it's a tasty sauce, the marinade needs to be cooked until it reaches 165F for it to be safe for consumption. However, it's best to throw out unused marinades or sauces that were used with raw meat and poultry.

, It's not only important to keep cold foods at the proper temperature during transportation. It's also important to keep an eye on them when you're serving them as well.Consider bringing big food trays to keep filled with ice for your picnic or tailgating party. You can set bowls or platters on top of the ice to help keep chilled foods at a cooler temperature.
Continuously use your instant read thermometer to track how cold your foods are. Make sure this is a separate thermometer from the one you used to check the temperature of meat and poultry on the grill. If they start to get warm, you need to either place them back in the cooler or time how long they can sit out.
Set a timer if you do not have a way to keep chilled foods cold. Set it for two hours. Once your timer goes off, it's time to get rid of the cold items.

, There are a lot of things to consider when it comes to food safety during picnics and tailgating parties. However, there are plenty of foods, like fresh fruits and vegetables, that you do not need to worry about keeping at a safe temperature.Many fruits and vegetables are great shelf-stable items. They don't need to be chilled, they don't need to be cooked and can sit out at room or outside temperature without you needing to worry about them going bad.
You may want to consider packing some fruit for sides. You can pack quick items like whole apples, pears, bananas or even grapes. Once cut or sliced, these foods need to be refrigerated.
Vegetables are another great side dish or appetizer you can serve. Wash carrots and celery sticks to be served with a ranch dip. Bring whole corn on the cob or sweet potatoes to slice and grill. Also bring whole tomatoes or onions to slice at your picnic for hamburger toppings.
Although temperature isn't a concern, you still need to make sure you use safe food handling techniques like washing fruits and vegetables prior to consumption.

, Another easy snack and side dish to bring to a picnic or tailgating party are chips or crackers. They're all shelf stable and you don't have to worry about watching what temperature they're stored at.You can make your prep really easy and just purchase a few bags of your favorite chips or crackers to bring with you.
You may also want to consider making some homemade salsa, guacamole or even cheese dip (to be stored at the correct temperature) that you can serve with corn chips.
To get a little creative, you can make your own blends. You can toss together your favorite nuts and dried fruit for a trail mix, toss together a few of your favorite chips to make a party blend or even bring a variety of crackers to serve with sliced cheese.

, There's nothing more shelf stable and easy to transport than canned items. Many of these items are already cooked or prepared so all you have to do is open them up and serve them.


Canned baked beans are a great item to bring to picnics or tailgating parties. All the work is done by manufacturer. All you need to do is open up the can and reheat them in a grill-safe dish for a few minutes.
You can also use a variety of canned vegetables as well. Canned corn can be a great side dish to serve. You can also make your own three bean salad using canned green beans, chick peas and kidney beans.
If you don't want to carry whole, fresh fruit, consider bringing a canned fruit salad or individual fruit cups for your guests.
Don't forget to pack a can opener if you're bringing canned items.

, Ice cream, cakes or popsicles are a tasty treat for picnics and tailgating parties. However, they may melt or require you to keep them at a cold temperature. Instead of worrying about that, bring all the ingredients for s'mores. They're shelf stable and are the perfect outside dessert.


Purchase all the ingredients you need for s'mores. Grab a box of graham crackers, a few plain chocolate bars and a bag of the big marshmallows.
Using a skewer, hold a marshmallow or two over the grill or fire until they get golden brown or slightly black.
Squash the marshmallow onto a half of a graham cracker. Place a chunk of 4 squares of chocolate on top of the marshmallow. Finish this dessert sandwich by topping the chocolate with the other half of the graham cracker.
If you have any leftover s'mores ingredients, they also do not need to be refrigerated to be transported home safely.

Keep the binder in your kitchen, or give it away as a gift.",How to Make a Recipe Binder," You can buy a plain one that is all one color. You can also buy a fancy one with a pattern on the cover.


You can also use a 2-ring binder if you can't find a 3-ring binder.;
, Paper stains easily in the kitchen. A plastic page protector will keep your recipes clean. The smooth surface is also easy to wipe clean. They are transparent plastic sleeves, about same size as a sheet of printer paper. Most will already have holes punched in the sides for the binder rings to go through. You can find them at office supply stores, and well-stocked arts and crafts stores., You might already have some in your home. You can also find plenty of recipes online and in magazines. Lastly, you can also ask your friends and family members if they have any recipes they would like to share with you.

, This will keep everything looking consistent. If you have beautiful handwriting, you can write the recipes out by hand instead. You can also use the original recipes if you don't care about consistency.

Avoid adding page numbers if you plan on adding more recipes to the binder later.
Use page numbers if you already have all the recipes you want and don't plan on adding anymore.
If the recipe is a long one, print it out on a single page. If you have a few recipes that are short and very similar, try putting them on the same page. You can divide them into paragraphs or columns., If you cannot find any page protectors, try to order some online. You can also get the pages laminated at a photocopying shop. Once they are laminated, punch holes in them using a hole puncher., Having sections will make your recipe binder less overwhelming. They will also make your binder more organized and easier to browse. Here are some ideas for the different sections you could have in your binder:


Appetizers
Baked goods
Desserts
Drinks
Entrees
Favorites
Salads
Soups
Treats

, You can design the title page using an image or word processing program. You can also design it right onto a sheet of paper. The title page should include the name of the section in large letters. You can also include a border and a table of contents that lists all the recipes in that section., Again, if you don't have any page protectors, try to get the pages laminated. Be sure to punch holes in the sides., The tabs should match the section title pages. For example, if you have a section title page for desserts, write ""Desserts"" on the tab., Stagger the tabs when you stick them down onto the pages. Each tab should be positioned a little bit lower than the previous tab. That way, you will be able to see all the tabs at once when you open the binder and look down at it., You can put them in any order you want, but make sure that they are under the right sections.

, Recipe binders make great gifts, especially if they are filled with treasured family recipes that have been passed down for generations. They can also make an ideal going-away-to-college gift.

, You can arrange your binder however you think would be the most helpful for you. This section will give you a few ideas on how to do this. You don't have to use all the ideas from this section., If you have a lot of recipes, you could divide them up further between several binders. For example, you can have a binder for baked goods and another one for salads. You could even have a special one just for family recipes., This means that if you have a section for pies, you might arrange your recipes like this: apple pie, blueberry pie, pecan pie, pumpkin pie, rhubarb pie, etc., This can help make your binder look more orderly. It can also help you find recipes quicker. Here are some ideas for you:

Alphabetize the sections. For example: appetizers, beverages, cakes and cookies, desserts, pasta, poultry, salads, etc.
Arrange the sections in the order you might eat a meal. For example: breakfast, lunch, appetizers, salad, main course, dessert, etc.

, This will make finding recipes a lot easier.


Start by writing down the name of your recipe book in the top center of the page. Use a large, fancy font.
Next, write down the names of the sections in a slightly smaller font. You can still use a fancy font. The section names should be on the left side of the page.
Lastly, write down the names of the recipes in a smaller, but plain, font. Make sure that the recipes are under the right section. The recipes should also be on the left.
If your binder has page numbers, write them down on the right side. The font should be the same as the one you used for the recipe names.

, If you think you might want to keep adding to your binder, it might be a good idea to include two or three extra pages at the end of each section. This way, if you come across a recipe you like, all you have to do it print it out or write it down. If you are using stationary paper, you won't have to worry about trying to find the same design again., These sections aren't based off of any regular food group, such as soups, salads, cakes, and so forth. They are unique and include dishes from multiple food groups. Here are some examples:

Include some categories inspired by foods from different countries, such as: Chinese, French, Indian, Italian, Mexican, Thai, etc.Add a section for your favorite recipes.
Put all of the recipes you are interested in trying out in their own section.
Have a special section for holiday recipes. This will make finding all of those recipes for Thanksgiving a lot easier., Sometimes, you run out of a certain ingredient and don't have the time to run to the store. Research some common substitutions, and print them out onto a sheet of paper. Add this to the back of your binder.Some common cooking substitutions include margarine for butter and white vinegar for lemon juice.

You can also include a section for healthy substitutions, such as wheat flour for white flour, or apple sauce instead of oil/butter., This will come in handy if you are living in the UK and are working with a US recipe, and vice versa. It will also come in handy when you need to measure out liters using cups instead., You can also just use an empty page protector. This is great for those recipes you are not sure about and don't want to put the effort into printing them out just yet., You can tape it to the back of your binder. You can also keep it in its own page protector. This will allow you to keep track of what recipes you have tried and didn't like, so you can avoid using them in the future., You can leave your binder as is, or you can add some special touches to it. This section will give you some ideas. You don't have to use all of the ideas from this section, however. Use the ones you like the most., Stationary paper usually has a pretty boarder. This can make your recipes more interesting to look at.

Stationary paper also tends to come in different themes. Choose a theme you like. You can also match the theme to your binder.
If you have a special section for holiday recipes, such as Thanksgiving or Christmas, try matching the paper to the holiday. For example, use paper that has pumpkins or autumn leaves for Thanksgiving recipes, and paper that has snowflakes or Christmas trees for Christmas recipes.

, You can add step-by-step pictures to your recipes. You could also add a picture of the final dish instead. This will make the recipes more colorful. The photos will also give you an idea of what the final dish is supposed to look like in the end., You can make a plain binder more interesting by decorating a sheet of paper, and slipping it behind the clear, protective cover. Here are some ideas to get you started:

If you just want a fancy cover, use a sheet of scrapbook paper. You may have to trim it down a little in order to get it to fit.
Give your binder a title. Write the title down on some paper and slip it behind the protective sheet on the cover. You call it anything you want, such as: You Name's Cookbook.
Use an opaque fabric marker to draw designs on a fabric-covered binder. Most fabric markers come in opaque and transparent colors. Don't use a transparent fabric marker. The colors will blend right into the fabric and won't show up well.
If your binder already has a pattern on it, you could use letter stickers to give it a title.

, This can be a nice way to introduce each section. Here are some ideas""

If you have a salad section, add a picture of your favorite salad onto the title page.
If you have a section for desserts or pastries, add a picture of a fancy cake or pie.
If you have all of the recipes you want in that section, consider adding a mini table of contents. Right beneath the title, write down the names of all the recipes that are in that section. This will help remind you of what is in there.

, This will allow you to get a bit more creative, and match the design of the tab to the rest of your binder. Here's how to make one:

Cut some colored paper into a ½ by 1 inch (1.27 by 2.54 centimeter) rectangle.
Label the tab.
Cut some clear packaging tape into a 1½ by 1½ inch (3.81 centimeter) square
Place the ½ inch (1.27 centimeter) of the tape onto the side of the page protector.
Place the tab under the tape. The long side of the rectangle should flush with the edge of the page protector. It should also be centered on the tape.
Fold the tape over and press it down onto the back of the page protector.

, Using just a few items, you can make your own rustic recipe binder. Here's what you will need:2 sheets thin cardboard or illustration board
Printer paper
2 – 3 binder rings
Markers or letter stickers

, Make sure that they are the same size. These will be the front and back cover of your binder., The paper you are using should be a little bit smaller than the covers., You will need two to three holes. The top and bottom hole should be about 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) away from the top and bottom of the covers., Place the back cover down on a table in front of you, then stack the recipe pages on top of it. Place the front cover on top. Align the holes as best you can., Close the binder rings once all the pages, including the covers, are on them. You can buy binder rings from an office supply store or an arts and crafts store., Write a title using marker or letter stickers. You can also draw on a border using markers or glitter paint., Because the binder is made from paper, you will have to take extra care of it. If you are worried about it getting dirty, consider keeping it in a box or in a cupboard."

Plan your meal in advance.,
Prepare foods that you all like.,
Get a basket.,
Furnish based on the setting


If your picnic is at the beach, make sure your blanket is big enough to keep the sand at bay, and that any chairs or cushions are sand- and water-proof.,
Bring the romance.,
Think about ""just in case."",
Dress nicely.",How to Create a Picnic Check List2," Have all the ingredients ready in advance, so you don't waste time at the grocery store

, Think of things that are easily manageable, and don't require a lot of setup at the picnic grounds. You may all like fondue, but trying to get a fire going at the park may not be such a great idea.

, There are wonderful ones to be found at craft stores, gift stores (especially those that sell wine packages), even some specialty grocery stores carry them. Showing up with a nice bottle of wine and food wrapped in plastic bags from the grocery store is just not romantic!

,
If you're going to a park, you might have a nice soft blanket, but also consider adding a waterproof tarp underneath. The grass may have been watered or damp.
Cushions are nice to relax on if you have them. Some people like low chairs for comfort.

, Flowers, candles, even a pair of battery-powered speakers with nice music on your iPod can all set a wonderfully romantic mood. No boom-boxes, please. The idea is to keep it intimate, not start a block party.

, As poet Robert Burns said so famously back in 1785, ""The best-laid schemes o' mice an' men gang aft agley,"" and it is just as true now as it was then. Plan ahead, and you'll not be scurrying for shelter.


Just in case it gets cool, have a couple sweaters nearby.
Just in case it rains, have an umbrella.
Just in case the weather gets bad before you get there, have a backup plan.

, This is romance we're talking about here—showing up in cutoffs and a t-shirt may be great for an impromptu day at the beach, but if you're putting effort into building a special afternoon or evening, make it something to remember.

Plan ahead.,
Think comfort as much as food.,
Shop ahead of time.,
Play!,
Keep it safe.,
Check out the list below.",How to Create a Picnic Check List3," Much like the romantic picnic, the family picnic is made much more festive when a little forethought is used. Nothing spoils the fun more than not having a corkscrew or a fork when you need one!


Keep a ""picnic"" box. Load it with plates and napkins, plastic utensils, a spare bottle opener and corkscrew, plastic food containers, wraps, bags, and other non-perishables.
Keep a copy of your favorite picnic recipes in the box, too.

, Picnics are fun, unless you are sitting on soggy or rocky ground, on a blanket that's too small, in the rain, with soggy paper plates.


If you are on the ground, make sure you pack pillows or chairs.
If the weather is iffy, have umbrellas in the car.
Make sure your blanket is big enough for your crew. If not, have enough for everybody to be able to spread out a bit. Lots of space is good, and it makes the ants work harder for their share.

, Have all your ingredients ready before the day of the big event. But prepare the food as late as possible, so that everything is fresh and delicious. If you're preparing things like macaroni or potato salad, make sure you keep them refrigerated so they don't spoil.

, Bring a softball, or a board game. Frisbees are fun, always. Have activities that everybody can be involved in.

, A family picnic has lots of opportunity for fun: running, playing ball, kicking your feet in the creek, or tossing the frisbee. In case that frisbee happens to whack Billy in the lip, though, bring along a little first aid kit. Some sun screen, bug spray, antiseptic wash, bandaids and gauze—nothing too complex.

, We've gathered a list of things you need for a picnic set out below.


Copy this list to a word processor document and alter it to fit your needs. Keep it in your picnic box.

Give a family cooking scrapbook to friends and family for gifts.",How to Make a Cookbook Scrapbook," This usually depends upon the purpose it will have: functional, keepsake or gift for the family. The following are common formatting options that you can choose:


Purchase a binder or bound notebook with clear pockets and pages. This is the best format for a functional cookbook. You can gather recipes and place them in the clear pockets where they are protected from kitchen splatter. You can also lay a spiral notebook or a three ring binder flat on a counter surface for easy reference.
Buy a scrapbook from a scrap booking store that allows you to add pages to it as you continue to scrapbook recipes. This is best for a keepsake of family recipes. You may want to add the originally written recipes in pockets or glue them directly on the page. A keepsake scrapbook is less for kitchen use and more for keeping track of family history. You can use scrap booking materials, such as stamps, stickers, ribbons and papers to artistically show your family's cooking traditions.
Go online to a book creation website, such as Blurb.com, TheSecretIngredients.com or Shutterfly.com. These sites can help you to create a printed, professional book that can be a keepsake for all family members. Add recipes, photos, textured backgrounds and more to create a bound book. You will probably need to download a book creation software program in order to layout your book.;
, Organize them in a way that makes sense to you. For example, you can organize them by date, by type of cuisine, or by the author of the recipe.

, Some good themes include a holiday recipe book, a summer recipe book, a baking recipe book, a simple recipe book or a family recipe book.

, No matter which option you chose for your scrapbook, it is likely to be used occasionally for cooking. If possible, choose a glossy paper that is easy to wipe off, in case of splattering.

, You should consider any cards that have passed down from generation to generation as priceless historical artifacts. Create a protective pocket or sheet from a plastic pocket or plastic page covers, and then rewrite the recipe on a new piece of scrap booking paper.


When you rewrite your recipes, you can use a computer, if your handwriting is not very good. The more beautiful the script, the more it will look like an heirloom book, even if you are just using a handwriting font on the computer.

,, Use decorations that have to do with the recipe, such as pictures of food, or elements that remind you of the person who wrote it. Use a three-hole punch and hole protectors and then place them in your binder.


If you are using book creation software, you will need to send it to the book creation website by uploading it. They will usually send a proof, which you should go over very carefully. Once they get your final approval, they will send it to be printed. Order as many copies as you want for yourself and your family. There are usually discounts for buying a number of books at once.

, Label the tabs and place them slightly apart, moving down the length of the book. This will give people easy access to different types of recipes.

, It is a good reminder for young or old of the recipes that have stood for generations. Leave blank pages at the end where they can add their own favorite recipes.

Make your recipe.",How to Adjust Recipe Amounts1,"


Before shopping for the ingredients, read through the recipe. Most main dish recipes will double or triple easily, but baking generally doesn't scale well due to the precise ingredient measurements needed to create the chemical reaction required for baking to turn out properly. Determine how many times you'll need to multiple the recipe in order to gain your required serving amount.;
,


If possible, make your recipe amount conversions in pencil beside the actual recipe. If a recipe calls for 1 cup (240 ml) of flour, then you should write in 2 cups (480 ml) flour. Continue this through the whole list of ingredients and amounts, except for spices. You can round an item up. If the recipe calls for 1 egg and you're multiplying your recipe by 1.5 then you'd end up with 1 1/2 eggs; round this up to 2 eggs.
When doubling a recipe that includes spices and alcohol, only multiple these ingredients by 1.5 or you risk overpowering the recipe with their assertive flavors.

,


Scaling a recipe up means that you need extra ingredients. This holds true for the main ingredients such as proteins, vegetables and starches. Make a list of the amounts of each ingredient you need after scaling the recipe. Don't worry about buying exact amounts of spices; dried spices will keep quiet well in a kitchen pantry for months.

,,


Prepare the recipe. The directions will remain the same but cooking times may need to be adjusted to allow for a larger batch. Anything prepared for the oven will take additional time. Check frequently to ensure you're not overcooking the recipe.

Make sure that the instructions are easy to understand.",How to Choose Volumetrics Cookbooks," Look for a comprehensive section on preparing fruit and vegetable dishes that doesn’t involve using a lot of fat or sugar for flavor. Many vegetarian cookbooks make good choices for the Volumetrics diet.;
, Look for broth-based soups and high water content foods like lettuce, watermelon, broccoli and grapefruit.

, Whole grains like brown rice, barley, quinoa, couscous and spelt, in addition to fruits and vegetables, contain a great deal of fiber. Fiber is filling, and you can eat fiber-rich foods in larger quantities.

, In addition to dishes for lean meat, poultry and fish, the cookbook should contain options for legumes as well as for vegetarian proteins like tofu and tempeh. Asian cookbooks have many wonderful recipes that are vegetable centered while containing small amounts of lean protein.

, Heart-healthy cookbooks or diabetic cookbooks will show you how to prepare many recipes that are both delicious and nutritious without too much added fat. Also, look for recipes that feature small amounts of healthy fats like nuts and seeds, olive oil and canola oil.

, Desserts that contain a lot of fruit or that use pureed vegetables for moisture make good choices. You can also make use of cookbooks that teach you how to cook healthy recipes with sugar substitutes.

, For example, if you can substitute reduced-fat dairy products or healthy fats in place of butter or margarine, then you can purchase a cookbook and alter the recipes.

, While calorie density may be challenging to determine without a food scale, you can ensure that you have recipes that are low in calories so that you can eat more food.

, If the cookbook doesn’t appeal to you, then don’t purchase it. You will be unlikely to prepare the recipes if you don’t like the ingredients.

, Don’t purchase a cookbook that is far above your skill level or that contains hard-to-follow instructions.

Make your recipe.",How to Adjust Recipe Amounts2,"


Reducing the amount produced by a recipe is handled in much the same way as increasing it, only you're working with lesser amounts of each ingredient. First read the recipe through and figure out by how much you need to reduce the recipe. If the recipe produces enough for 4 and you only want sufficient for 2, then you'd cut it in half, and so on.

,


If possible, make your recipe amount conversions in pencil beside the actual recipe. If a recipe calls for 1 cup (240 ml) of flour, then you should write in 1/2 cup (120 ml) flour. Continue this through the whole list of ingredients and amounts including spices. If the recipe calls for 1 egg and you're dividing your recipe in half, still use 1 egg. Lower the amount of other liquid in the recipe by 2 tbsp. (30 ml) for each half egg that you're rounding up.

,


Scaling a recipe down means that you will need fewer ingredients. This holds true for the main ingredients such as proteins, vegetables and starches. Make a list of the amounts of each ingredient you need after scaling the recipe.

,,


Prepare the recipe. The directions will remain the same but cooking times may need to be adjusted to allow for a smaller batch. Anything prepared for the oven will take less time. If dividing your recipe in half, also cut the cooking time in half. Check frequently to ensure you're not overcooking the recipe.

Don't forget family.",How to Collect Vintage Cookbooks," The following terms are used by booksellers when selling any used book, including cookbooks, to let the buyer know the book's condition. The following information is quoted from Wikipedia:


As New is self-explanatory. It means that the book is in the state that it should have been in when it left the publisher. The is the equivalent of Mint condition in numismatics.
Fine (F or FN) is As New but allowing for the normal effects of time on an unused book that has been protected. A fine book shows no damage.
Very Good (VG) describes a book that is worn but intact. For many collectors this is the minimum acceptable condition for all but the rarest items.
Good (G) is not very good. It is used to describes the condition of an average used worn book that is complete.
Fair shows wear and tear but all the text pages and illustrations or maps are present. It may lack endpapers, half-title, and even the title page. This is a reading copy.;
, A single collection could feature books about Jello or Pillsbury Bake-Off Cookbooks. Start collecting Betty Crocker, cookbooks or perhaps Better Homes and Gardens cookbooks. Collect vintage British, French or Australian cookbooks if you wish. You don't have to focus on any one country, especially if the typical daily cuisine where you live is lacking in history or cultural context. You might want to collect the Fanny Merritt Farmer Boston Cooking School Cookbook, published in the late 1800s, as this was the first cookbook that offered standardized measurements.

, Whatever your niche, find it. It makes finding what you're looking for so much easier.

, Cookbooks from that time period reflected how women wanted more recognition. Cookbooks reflected a more scientific approach to cooking. That's when exact measurements came out. Sanitation and cleanliness facts were made available to home cooks in a way it hadn't before. How did they do that exactly? How did they get the information to the masses? In cookbooks of course! The majority of books that were published were authored by women for women readers. They were really the only type books that were semi controlled by women. They were the decision makers of the home and cookbooks were a great way to change how society as a whole thought.

, Cookbooks from the 1920's are known for their amazing illustrations and if you are lucky enough to find any with information regarding World War I they always desirable.


Cookbooks from the 1930's are gems for the obvious reasons. These women had to do it all, maintaining life as normally as possible, but with the drastic change in income. These are where some amazing stories and recipes can be found. Reading those cookbooks makes you humble and grateful!
Cookbooks from the 1940s are great! There are great dinner party and hostessing ones about from this time. If you can find some of the World War II related ones they're super fascinating to read. The rationing chapters that are usually added to the bigger name cookbooks can sneak through a dealers eyesight and can be picked up for a steal if you know what you're looking for. Usually very patriotic in illustrations and general theme. They're also valuable because of cross-collectability.
Cookbooks from the 1950s are great for retro lovers. With pictures of women in pearls standing over stoves and happy families around the breakfast table, they make you happy and smile just looking at them. Be prepared to read recipes for gelatin salads and Americanized chop suey.

, You also might decide to collect what you think is going to be popular in 20 to 30 years. That's a great way to ensure long term success and view your collection as more of an investment versus a hobby. They're a a lot of people who decide to sell an entire collection once it's complete. Some collections could be books collected over a 40 to 50 year time frame. Both ways are very profitable.

, There are so many informative articles that go into the history of what makes a book so valuable. Maybe it's the illustrations and cover art or it's the first printing of a recipe classic. Condition is a huge deal and always buy the best you can afford. Mistake printings can also contribute to a book's value just like baseball cards. There's always a reason to a books value and most of the time vendors don't do the research on all the books they have for sale, but you can walk in and know exactly what you're looking for and a know that your paying for something that is way under priced! It's a good feeling and oh so addicting!

, Just because a price guide said it was worth a certain price doesn't mean that's what it's going for. A book is worth only what someone is willing to pay for it, just remember that if you're thinking of selling later. Just because it's old doesn't mean it's valuable or rare.

, The same word of caution goes for looking up a books price online. There are scams going on on a certain search shopping site where the seller lists the book way overpriced and then lists it again at a more normal price to make theirs look like a steal. Find someone knowledgeable and transparent in prices and ask them questions., Sometimes you find books in the weirdest places. Estate sales are goldmines but get there early as the cookbooks could sell out fast.

,, The Cookbook Collectors Newsletter and the Cookbook Collector are just two of the newsletter available. Search the web for more ideas., Grandma or other older relatives may have the vintage cookbook you desire.

Decide on who the memory cookbook will focus.,
Set about gathering together the memorabilia.,
Find photographs, anecdotes, quotes, and other relevant snippets to place into the memory cookbook.,
Consider asking other members of your family or circle of friends for recipes and ideas.,
Decide on the need for illustrations.,
Choose your method of preparing and printing the cookbook.,
Distribute the memory cookbook.",How to Create a Memory Cookbook," Is it to be one person or do you want to focus on a couple, or even a group of people? For example, you might want to remember grandma's cooking, or grandma and grandpa's cooking and dinner parties, or perhaps all of your grandma and grandpa's brothers and sisters cooking experiences as well!;
, Go through the person's cookbooks, handmade recipe folders, and any other relevant item. Look for handwritten notes especially, as these will tell you a lot about how the person cooking felt about the recipes; often there will be little annotations describing how the recipe should be changed slightly, whether it was good or bad, and even when it was used for a special occasion.


Also check visitor's books, if any. Once very popular, and still popular with some people, these recorded guests attending dinner parties and even recorded the meal sometimes. You can get a lot of ideas about the person's dining flair from these sorts of resources.

, Can you remember specific kitchen and entertaining wisdom from the person in question? If so, be sure to quote it so that it doesn't get lost over the generations!


You should also consider writing down your own impressions of this person's cooking, dining, and entertaining style. This can serve as a preface or introduction to the cookbook and will truly personalize it and bring the person back to life for readers. You might also like to get personal stories from other people who knew the person in question; if you get a lot, create a whole chapter.

, They might know of particular recipes, tips, and stories that you're unaware of. Also consider adding recipes in from other people as a way of honoring the person the cookbook is dedicated to. Be sure to put their name and relationship to the person along with the recipe.

, As well as the photos and other bits and pieces you've gathered, you might want to add illustrations to draw the entire book together. If you're good with artwork yourself, you might do it. If not, there are plenty of copyright free printed illustrations you can use; just do a search online.


When selecting images, be careful of the license. Some images are copyright free no matter what purpose of the book, while others are only copyright free while you make no profits from them. If you're planning on recouping costs, that's usually fine but if you're going to sell the book for a profit, be super careful.
Some images may be as simple as photographing the originally handwritten recipe of the person in question (see introduction image), so that people can see really personal elements to the recipes alongside the neat print and layout of the whole cookbook.

, There are many programs available for producing a cookbook online or on your personal computer. Shop around to see what suits your needs best. If you're only producing one memory cookbook for yourself, it'll be fairly straightforward and you can probably do it all in-house. However, if you plan on distributing the memory cookbook throughout family and friends, you'll need to hunt around for the best prices for bulk cookbook creation.


In terms of printing, it is a good idea to ask around at several local printers for their prices and to check online book printing costs. Ask lots of questions about things such as their ability to print in color, matte or gloss, amount of cookbooks expected to be printed, etc.

, If it's just a one copy for you, this step won't apply. If you have created a number of memory cookbooks for family and friends though, you'll need to get the cookbooks to everyone. There are several possibilities:


Post or courier the memory cookbooks (ask for the best price).
Hold a family reunion and distribute the cookbooks as part of remembering the person in question and having speeches etc., in this person's honor. This is a lot of effort but can be a fantastic opportunity to bring everyone together.
Keep copies in your house and remember to give them to people whenever they call.
Send extra copies to some family members and ask them to help distribute them.

Gather the ingredients for both parts of the recipe.,
Combine the warm water with the active dry yeast.,
Mix the flour and salt together in a food processor.While the yeast is dissolving, blend 2 cups (240 grams) of flour and 1 teaspoon (5 grams) of salt in a food processor.,
Add the oil and then the yeast mixture.,
Knead the dough ball on a lightly floured surface.Sprinkle a flat workspace with flour and place the dough on it.,
Pour several tablespoons of oil into a large bowl.,
Use a rolling pin to flatten the dough to a 9-inch-diameter round.,
Bake the crust for 20 minutes.,
Spread the chocolate-hazelnut spread onto the warm dough.",How to Make Dessert Pizza1," This recipe has two main parts – creating the pizza dough crust and preparing the toppings. You can substitute purchased pizza dough for the homemade dough if you want to save some time.If you use purchased dough, the recipe will take about 40 minutes to complete.
If you make the homemade dough, it will take an additional hour and 15 minutes.
The ingredients will make 1 pound (450 grams) of pizza dough for the Chocolate Pizza.;
, Put these two ingredients in a small bowl and blend them together. The water needs to be at a temperature between 105°F to 110°F (40.5°C to 43°C). Depending on how hot your tap gets, you may be able to use water straight from it. Run the tap until it gets warm and fill a measuring cup. Use a kitchen thermometer to test the temperature before adding the yeast.If the water is not warm enough, put it in the microwave for a few seconds or heat it up slightly on your stove.
If it’s too warm, let it sit for a minute or so and then use the thermometer to check the temperature again.
After you’ve combined the yeast and water, allow the mixture to stand for about 5 minutes while the yeast dissolves.

, A food processor isn’t required, but the results are usually more consistent and it’s much easier to work with. If you don’t have a food processor, you will need to stir the ingredients vigorously at every stage., Once the flour and salt are mixed, blend 3 tablespoons (45 milliliters) of olive oil in. After the oil is well-mixed, keep the food processor running and add in the yeast mixture (make sure the yeast is dissolved first). Continue blending until the ingredients are mixed together and a ball of dough forms.

Carefully remove the dough from the machine., Knead the dough until the texture is smooth, which should take about 1 minute. To knead, push the dough down and then stretch it out with the heels of your hands. Then fold over the top half of the dough and press down into it. Push out again with the heels of your hands.Repeat these same gestures to knead the dough.
Continue the kneading process for 1 minute.

, Turn the bowl so that the sides are coated. Place your dough ball into the oiled bowl. Turn the dough over several times so that it’s coated in the oil. Cover the bowl (plastic wrap will work fine) and place it in a warm area, away from any drafts. Let the dough set until it doubles in size, which will take about an hour. Once it has doubled, punch down into the dough one time and then form it back into a ball shape.The pizza dough is now ready to use.
You can use it right away or store it in your refrigerator for up to 24 hours in an airtight container.

, Sprinkle a flat work surface lightly with flour and use a rolling pin to flatten the dough into a round shape that is about 9 inches in diameter. If the dough sticks to your rolling pin, rub a little flour all over the pin and then roll the dough out again.Preheat your oven to 450°F (232°C) and place the oven rack on the bottom of the oven.

, Use parchment paper to line a large baking sheet. Once you’ve rolled the dough into a 9-inch round, carefully place it on the parchment paper. Make small indentions all over the dough – you can use your fingers for this. Warm up about a tablespoon of butter and brush it evenly onto the surface of the dough.

Put it into the preheated oven and bake it for about 20 minutes.
The crust is ready to be taken out when it looks golden brown and lightly crisp., Use about ¼ cup (60 grams) of the spread and apply it to the crust immediately upon removing it from the oven. Sprinkle the 3 different kinds of chocolate chips all over the top. Place the pizza back into the oven for about 1 minute, or until you see the chocolate starting to melt.Feel free to add peanut butter chips, shredded sweetened coconut, chopped nuts or any other toppings of your choice.Remove the pizza from the oven carefully and then sprinkle the toasted hazelnuts on top.
Cut it into wedges using a pizza cutter and serve the dessert immediately.

Control your portion sizes.,
Swap ice cream with yogurt or frozen yogurt.,
Go for fresh and dried fruits, nuts, and other healthy toppings.,
Turn your healthy banana split into a fun activity.,
Put together a beautiful banana split.",How to Make a Healthy Banana Split1," The first step to turning a banana split into a healthy snack is to use smaller portions. Instead of piling on three or four giant scoops of ice cream, limit yourself to a small scoop of lower-fat options. Use parfait glasses or mason jars instead of big bowls to help you keep your portion sizes in check., For the healthiest option, use low-fat Greek style yogurt or whole milk yogurt. These offer more nutrients and less fat than ice cream, and contain healthy probiotics. Their thick and creamy textures are great substitutes for ice cream, so you won’t be missing out on richness.You can also substitute ice cream with a low-fat or high-protein brand, or use low-fat frozen yogurt.

, Drowning your banana split in whipped cream, butterscotch, chocolate syrup, and other not so healthy toppings will send your calorie count soaring. Instead, you can splurge with a small amount of melted dark chocolate, and use nutritious, low-calorie fruits and nuts.Try sliced almonds, chopped peanuts, or a tablespoon of peanut butter.
Top your split with raisins, blueberries, diced pineapple, or sliced strawberries.

, A healthy banana split can be a fun, interactive activity for your kids, whether for dessert or an afterschool snack. Put out bowls of each topping, and try letting your younger kids serve themselves to practice using utensils and taking turns.If you’re an adult making a healthy snack for yourself, layering your banana split in a parfait glass or mason jar will add a touch of refinement to your dessert. In addition to keeping your portions in check, you’ll feel a little more fun and fancy.

, Cut a banana in half then slice each half lengthwise, so you have four long slices. Place them at the bottom of a bowl or jar, and add a scoop of yogurt, frozen yogurt, or low-fat ice cream. Top it with sliced strawberries, fresh blueberries, diced pineapple, or chopped nuts.You might be cutting down on calories, but there's no need to deprive yourself of a gorgeous, simple dessert!

What about making passion fruit margaritas or a passion fruit martini?,
Make passion fruit jam.,
Or make passion fruit cordial.,
Try adding passion fruit to your yogurt.",How to Eat Passionfruit," You want to pick ones that are slightly wrinkled and a deep purple color--these are the ones that have ripened the most and will be the sweetest. It is good to remember that while you may want to buy clean passion fruits, it really doesn’t matter as you only eat the flesh (or inside) of the fruit. The softer the shell, the more ripe the fruit will be., You should grab a passion fruit and shake it. If you feel a lot of liquid or pressure in there, that means there are a lot of seeds and liquid (meaning a lot of deliciousness to eat.) Compare them with the others to see which one has the most flesh., You can also determine the flavor if you smell the fruit. If you can smell a lot of tropical aromas then it will taste good. If you can't smell anything, it'll probably either be too sour and or tasteless.

, Once you have purchased the passion fruit, ensure that you wash them. Even though you are not going to eat the skin, it is important to wash them so any harmful chemicals, bacteria or bugs won't accidentally make their way into your mouth. This happens when an unwashed passion fruit is cut and the knife carries the bacteria from the skin through the flesh of the fruit., When washed, place the passion fruit on a cutting board. Gently cut the fruit in half with a knife. Serrated knives work best when cutting through the tough skin of the passion fruit. Try to let as little of the juice as possible run out of the fruit (because it's delicious.), You will see that the orange flesh is separated from the white skin. Scoop the contents out with a spoon or fork into any container (or directly into your mouth.) Don't scrape the skin too hard because the white layer is bitter and tastes bad. Do not eat the skin., Try using the skin as a fertilizer. If you haven't finished your passion fruit, pour the contents in a small bowl and wrap cling wrap around the bowl to ensure it stays fresh. You can also wrap plastic wrap around the unfinished half and place it in the fridge.

, Passion fruit juice may be what the ancient civilizations referred to when they mentioned ‘the nectar of the gods.’

, Instead of stopping at passion fruit juice, why not go all out and make cocktails so delicious, it may be dangerous?

, Wake up, spread some passion fruit jam on your toast, and it is guaranteed that you will have a great day. Starting your day off with passion fruit can really only mean good things are in store for you.

, Skip the old world raspberry cordial for a drink that is sure to make you feel like you’re sitting on a warm, sandy beach--even in the middle of winter.

, Why not get wild and splash some of the passion fruit flesh onto your Greek yogurt? Not only will it give the yogurt a sweet boost, it will also make you dance around in joy.

The graham cracker crust is prepared from scratch, but you will be using a store-bought brownie mix (18-20 ounces/510-567 grams).
It only takes about 20 minutes to prepare, but it won’t be complete for about 2 hours.

, You will use a 12-inch round pizza pan for this dessert. Spray or grease the pan generously before moving forward with creating the graham cracker crust., Mix the butter, graham cracker crumbs and sugar in a bowl. If you are making your own graham cracker crumbs, go ahead and mash about 24 squares until they are reduced to granular crumbs. Melt 1/3 cup (76 grams) of butter by placing it in the microwave for a few seconds until it becomes liquid. Mix the melted butter with the graham cracker crumbs and 3 tablespoons (45 grams) of sugar in a medium bowl until well-blended. This is your crust.Press the crust mixture out flat onto the pizza pan.
Bake it for about 8 to 10 minutes.

Melt the chocolate.,
Toss the banana slices with the walnuts.,
Assemble your parfaits in layers.",How to Make a Healthy Banana Split2," Place the chocolate in a microwave-safe bowl. Microwave it for 30 seconds, then give it a stir. Continue to microwave it in 30 second intervals, stirring after each, until the chocolate is smooth and pourable.You can also melt the chocolate over low heat on the stovetop if you don’t want to use the microwave.

, Place the bananas and about 3/4 of the walnuts in a medium-sized bowl. Mix them together with your clean hands or rubber spatula. You can use a metal spoon, but be careful not to break the bananas.Your bananas should be about 1/4 inch (or about 1/2 centimeter) in thickness.

, Grab four small bowls or parfait glasses. First, place 1/4 cup (60 mL) of pineapple at the bottom of each bowl. Then divide the walnut-coated bananas evenly between them.

Melt the chocolate and coconut oil.,
Dip the fruit popsicles in the chocolate.,
Freeze your banana split bites overnight.",How to Make a Healthy Banana Split3," Make stacks with one piece each of cut pineapple, banana, and strawberry. Press a popsicle stick through each stack. Place the fruit popsicles in an airtight container or freezer bag, and freeze them for one or two hours, or until they’re solid.For best results, use a banana that’s slightly unripe or just turning ripe. Your bites will eventually turn out mushy if your fruit, especially the banana, is too ripe.

, Place the coconut oil and chocolate in a microwave-safe bowl. Microwave for 30 seconds, stir, then repeat until the chocolate is completely melted. If you prefer to use a stovetop, heat the chocolate and oil over low heat and stir constantly.Start melting the chocolate when the fruit becomes solid. Remove the chocolate from heat once it’s melted.

, Cover a baking sheet with parchment paper, so you’ll have somewhere to put your chocolate-dipped popsicles. Dip one side of each fruit stack into the melted chocolate, then let the excess drip. If you’re using chopped nuts or shredded coconut, immediately dip the chocolate-covered fruit popsicle into a bowl of the nut topping.After dipping, place each popsicle onto the parchment paper and let them rest until the chocolate hardens.

, After the chocolate is completely hard, transfer the bites into an airtight container or freezer bag. Place them in the freezer overnight, and store them there until you’re ready to serve.If you pack a lunch with them or want to serve them at an outing, it’s a good idea to transport them with an ice pack to prevent a melted chocolate mess.

Choose thick or thin spears.,
Wash fresh asparagus under cool running water.,
Break off the ends.",How to Cook Asparagus1," Thin asparagus cook quickly and tend to have a crisp exterior and soft center, while thick asparagus take a bit longer to cook and have a bulkier texture. Either type of asparagus is excellent no matter how you cook it, with the main difference being the final texture. Just be sure to choose asparagus that's fresh, green and firm - not floppy or discolored - when you're picking it out at the market.


Thick asparagus often has a slightly woodier stem, which you may want to peel before cooking. To peel an asparagus, just take a vegetable peeler and lightly stroke it from the middle of the asparagus to the base.
Thin asparagus is a good choice for use in salads or stir fries.;
, Asparagus is grown in sand, so it might have some sandy residue left in the cracks and crevices. Hold it under running water for a few moments. If sand is hiding in the tips, fill a large bowl with cool water, then dunk the asparagus in the water until the sand is removed.

, The base of the asparagus is tough and woody, and not very tasty when it's cooked. The easiest way to figure out how much to take off is to feel it by hand. Hold each asparagus spear with two hands and gently bend it until you feel the spot where it gives, then break the spear. Discard the tough, white end.


If you don't have the time to break each spear, place the bunch of asparagus on a cutting board and chop off about 2 inches (5.1 cm) from the bottom of the spears.
If you choose to peel the asparagus, just chop about 1 inch (2.5 cm) off of the ends.

Preheat the grill.,
Brush the peppers with oil.,
Grill the peppers, charring on all sides.,
Let stand before serving.",How to Cook Peppers2," The grill should be set to medium heat, whether that grill is a charcoal type or a gas type.


Spread a moderate amount of coals into a charcoal grill, light, and wait until the fire dies down and white ash forms on the coals. The peppers will be placed directly over the heat.
For a gas grill, preheat the grill completely before reducing the heat to medium. Again, the peppers will be placed directly over the heat.

, Coat all sides of each pepper with olive oil or cooking spray. Again, this helps to keep the peppers from becoming stuck. Olive oil also imparts a nice flavor. Note that peppers should be grilled whole instead of cut.

, Place the prepared peppers on the grill, turning them as they cook so that all sides get evenly charred. Large peppers, like bell peppers, will need about 25 to 30 minutes total.Smaller peppers usually need about 8 to 12 minutes.


Leave the grill uncovered if you have a charcoal grill. Cover the grill if you have a gas grill, though.

, Remove the peppers from the grill and wrap them in aluminum foil. Let them slowly drop in temperature for about 15 minutes, until they are just barely cool enough to handle with your hands.


If you steamed the peppers by wrapping them in aluminum foil as they cooled, you should be able to peel off the charred skins with your fingers, making it easier to serve the fire-roasted flesh beneath.

Heat a little oil in a skillet.,
Cut the peppers into smaller pieces.,
Cook the peppers in the hot oil.,
Use as desired.",How to Cook Peppers3," Pour 1 to 2 Tbsp (15 to 30 ml) of cooking into a large skillet. Heat it over medium-high for a couple of minutes.

, Peppers should be cut into rings, strips, or small bite-sized pieces before you stir-fry them. Generally, hot peppers are cut into rings, while sweet bell peppers are cut into strips or bite-sized pieces.


Keep in mind that the size will determine how long the pieces will need to cook for. Strips, large bell pepper rings, and pieces that are over 1 inch (2.5 cm) in size may need a minute or two more than small pepper rings and small chunks under 1 inch (2.5 cm).

, Add the peppers to the hot oil and cook, stirring frequently, for about 4 to 7 minutes, or until the peppers are crisp-tender.


Frequent stirring is very important in this method. You do not want to burn the pepper skins or the pepper flesh, but if you let the pieces stay still for too long, the sections touching the pan are more likely to become charred.

, Stir-fried peppers are usually prepared with other ingredients, but you can enjoy them on their own or use them in any recipe calling for some variety of cooked pepper.


For a quick side dish or a light lunch, you could toss the peppers with cooked rice and a drizzle of your favorite dressing—soy sauce, Italian dressing, and so on.

Boil a small amount of water.,
Cut the peppers into rings or strips.,
Cook the peppers in the boiling water.,
Serve while warm.",How to Cook Peppers4," Pour 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) of water into a large skillet with high sides. Heat this over medium-high on the stove. After the water begins to boil, add about 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of salt.


The salt helps to draw out the flavor of the pepper, but adding the salt before the water boils will increase the amount of time you have to wait before the water reaches a steady boil.

, If working with small hot peppers, cut them into rings. For larger bell peppers, cut them into rings or strips.


Keep in mind that larger pieces will take longer to cook than smaller pieces. No matter what size you use, you should at least try to keep the pieces consistent in size.

, Place the peppers in the boiling water and cook, stirring frequently, for 5 to 7 minutes, or until they feel crisp-tender.


The peppers will ideally still have a little “crunch” to them, but the flesh should be notably softer than when the peppers were raw.

, You can enjoy the peppers on their own or you could add them to any recipe calling for pre-cooked peppers.

"
"
Boil water in a steamer.,
Cut the peppers into smaller pieces.,
Steam the peppers until crisp-tender.,
Serve warm.",How to Cook Peppers5," Fill the bottom of a steamer with about 1 inch (2.5 cm) of water. Sit the steaming basket on top, making sure that the bottom does not come into contact with the water, and boil the water over high heat.


If you do not have a steamer, you could use a large stockpot and a metal/wire mesh colander. Just make sure that the colander fits onto the rim of the pot but that the bottom of the colander does not touch the bottom of the pot. Also make sure that the lid of the stockpot will still fit on the stockpot with the colander inside.

, Cut small peppers into rings and large peppers into rings or strips.


Keep the pieces consistent in size and shape to ensure even cooking.

, Add the peppers to the steamer basket. Cover and cook for 10 to 15 minutes.


The cover must stay on the pot during the cooking process so that the steam will remain trapped inside. If you lift the lid off too often, you will release too much steam, thereby increasing the amount of time the peppers will need to cook for.

, Remove the peppers from the steamer and enjoy them on their own or in any recipe calling for pre-cooked peppers.

"
"
Cut the peppers into smaller pieces.,
Place the pieces in a microwave-safe dish with a little water.,
Microwave until crisp-tender.,
Serve warm.",How to Cook Peppers6," Cut the peppers into rings, slices, or bite-sized pieces. Small hot peppers are usually cut into rings, but larger sweet peppers can be cut into any of those three forms.


Make sure that the pieces are even in size. Otherwise, if some pieces are larger than others, they may take longer to cook while other pieces will already be done or overcooked.

, Transfer the pieces into a microwave-safe casserole dish and add 2 Tbsp (30 ml) of water, just enough to cover the bottom without completely covering the peppers.

, Cover the dish and microwave on high power for 90 seconds to 2 minutes per 1 cup (250 ml) of peppers. Stir once in the middle of the process.


Most of the cooking action taking place results from the steam building up inside of the dish, so keeping the lid on is important in order to keep that steam trapped.

, Drain out any remaining water and enjoy the peppers alone or serve them with another dish.

Excess fat prevents the meat from completely absorbing all of the flavoring. After trimming the fat from the roast, season the entire roast with pepper., The Dutch oven should generally be able to hold five quarts.

, Heat it to a medium-high temperature.

, Once the meat has browned, add 2 1/2 cups (567ml) of water, two beef bouillon cubes and a bay leaf to the Dutch oven until it boils. When the pot reaches a boil, cover the Dutch oven with a lid and simmer the eye round roast for 50 minutes over a low flame.

, Slice one onion and use it to line the bottom of your slow cooker. Add the seasoned roast to the pot with 1 cup (237ml) of water, 2 tbsp. (28ml) soy sauce (optional) and two bay leaves for flavoring.


Other recipes call for garlic, thyme and wine to season the slow cooker. You can also slice up carrots and celery.

, Remove the roast after 8 hours. Allow the roast to marinate in the juices.

, The onion, seasonings and juices from the roast will create gravy when it is cooked slowly for a long period of time. For a thicker gravy, after removing the roast, mix 2 tbsp. (28g) cornstarch and 2 tbsp. (28ml) water together in a bowl, then pour the solution into the slow cooker gravy. Stir the ingredients together until they begin to boil and thicken.

, Use a sharp knife to cut the carrots into 1-inch (2.5-cm) pieces and to slice the onions into thin rings.


To save time, you may use baby carrots or carrots pre-cut into ""coins"" instead of whole carrots. Substitute roughly 5 to 8 baby carrots or 1/2 cup (125 ml) pre-cut coins per regular whole carrot.
The onion can also be cut into quarters or minced. The flavor of the gravy will not be dramatically affected either way, so how you cut the onions is mainly a matter of aesthetic taste.
Substitute dried onion flakes or onion powder for the fresh onion, if desired. This step saves time and also makes it possible to get the onion flavor while hiding the actual onion from picky eaters. Use 1/4 cup (60 ml) dried onion flakes or 1 tsp (5 ml) onion powder.

, Mix the two ingredients together in a small bowl using a whisk or fork.

, Use a medium-high heat, and allow the oil to warm for a full minute or so.

, Place the roast in the skillet and sear in 30 to 60 second intervals, flipping it over with tongs after each interval until all sides are browned.


This step is only optional. You do not have to pre-brown the roast in order to cook it in the slow cooker, but pre-browning adds more flavor to the roast and the gravy., Place the carrots into the slow cooker first, followed by the onions.


Use a 4-quart (4-liter) crock pot, at minimum. A 5- to 6-quart (5- to 6-liter) slow cooker would be even better. You need enough space for the lid to sit securely on the cooker, but the crock pot must be at least halfway filled.

Let the meat ‘rest’.,
Estimate the time it will take your roast to cook.,
Preheat your oven to the right temperature.,
Season your roast.,
Place a rack inside your roasting pan.,
Cook your roast.,
Check the internal temperature of the roast.,
Remove the roast from the oven.,
Slice the meat and serve.",How to Cook a Roast1," Whether you are roasting lamb, pork, beef, bison, or some other game, you will want to let your roast rest. This means taking it out of the refrigerator, placing it in a pan (to catch any drippings), and letting it sit at room temperature. If you are cooking a small roast, you should let it sit for roughly 30 to 60 minutes, while large roasts can sit for up to an hour and a half. Resting the roast allows the meat to become moist again--when it is in the refrigerator, the meat tends to become tougher.;
, Generally, roasting time can be estimated by how many pounds of meat you will be cooking. The length of time you cook your roast for will depend on whether you want your meat rare, medium rare, or medium. However, please note that every oven is different so while this offers an estimate of the cooking time, you should still monitor the internal temperature of the meat to determine when it is done.



For a rare roast: Allow 15 minutes of cooking time for every pound of roast. For example, if you had a 5 pound roast, you would cook your roast for 75 minutes if you wanted it rare.

For a medium rare roast: Cook the roast for 20 minutes for every pound. If you were cooking a 5 pound roast, you would cook it for 100 minutes.

For a medium roast: Allow 22 minutes of cooking time for every pound. If you were cooking a 5 pound roast, you would cook the meat for 110 minutes.
If you are cooking a pork roast, you should allow 20 minutes per pound of meat.

, This will be determined by the kind of meat you will be roasting. Here are the roasting temperatures for all of the basic meat roasts:



Roast at 325ºF: Lamb leg or shoulder roast; pork loin, shoulder, crown, or rib roast; full ham (with bone or boneless); veal loin or rib roast; beef round-tip, rump, bottom round, eye round, and fresh or corned brisket roast.

Roast at 350ºF: Beef rib-eye (boneless) or rib roast (bone-in); pork rib roast.

Roast at 425ºF: Beef tenderloin and tri-tip roast; pork tenderloin roast.

, Traditionally, roasts were simply seasoned with salt and pepper. However, you can also season it with garlic, or any herbs that you enjoy. If you want to marinate your roast, you will have to do so a couple of days before you plan on roasting the meat, as marinade takes a relatively long time to get absorbed by the meat.


If your roast has a layer of larding fat on top of it (as most roasts do) you can either sprinkle seasonings on top of the fat or remove the layer of fat (which will probably be held down by strings, which you should remove), season the meat underneath, and then lay the fat back on top again. The fat will add flavor to the roasting meat.

, Your roasting pan should be large and shallow. Place a rack in the pan and then place the meat on the rack. The rack is important because it will keep the meat separate from its juices. If the meat were to sit in its juices, it would steam rather than roast.

, You do not have to monitor it until you get closer to the end of the estimated cooking time. You will need a meat thermometer to make a good roast--the key to roasting is to be able to monitor the internal temperature of the meat.

, When the estimated cooking time is coming to an end, you will need to check the internal temperature of the roast to make sure that it is cooked properly. Use a meat thermometer to check the internal temperature. Remove the items listed below when they reach the designated temperature:



135ºF: Remove beef rump, eye round, bottom round roast.

135ºF to 150ºF: Remove beef ribeye, rib, tenderloin, and tri-tip roast.

140ºF: Remove full ham.

140ºF to 155ºF: Remove beef round tip; lamb leg, shoulder, and shank leg roast.

145ºF: Remove pork loin, crown, and shoulder roast.

155ºF : Remove veal loin and rib roast.

, Let the roast rest on a platter or cutting board that has grooves that the drippings can run into. Cover the roast with parchment or foil. Roasts will continue to cook even after they have been removed from the oven. Let small roasts rest for 10 minutes; larger roasts should rest for 15 to 30 minutes. Allowing the meat to rest will help the meat retain its moisture, creating a juicier roast.


A good way to tell when your roast is done resting is to check the internal temperature again. The meat can be sliced and served when the internal temperature begins to decrease.

, Enjoy!

Make sure the bag you use is sealable. Once your meat is in the bag, add two tablespoons of flour, one teaspoon kosher salt (or regular salt), one-half teaspoon of black pepper, and two teaspoons of garlic powder. Seal the bag and shake well until the meat is thoroughly coated in the seasoning.


If you are following a specific roast recipe, such as wikiHow’s recipe for cranberry pork roast, you should follow the seasoning directions listed in the recipe.

, In order to do this, place a tablespoon of olive oil in a large skillet. Bring it to a high heat, place the meat in the skillet and simply sear all sides of the meat so that they turn a golden brown color. Browning meat adds flavor to the roast.

, Slow cooker are great because they are the epitome of the ‘one-pot meal’. Simply through in your meat and vegetables and your dinner will cook itself. Place the vegetables in the cooker before the meat so that they absorb some of the meat’s delicious flavors. Traditional slower cooker roast is made with carrots, potatoes, and onions but you can really cook whatever vegetables you want. Get creative! Just make sure to cut up whatever veggies you use into small chunks so that they cook more thoroughly.


You can also cover the meat with the vegetables, or surround the meat with the veggies--it really is up to whatever you prefer.

, Many people choose to use a half cup of beef broth to slow cook their roasts in, as it adds to the natural flavor of the roast. Others use wine, cream of mushroom soup, water, or a variety of other ingredients like Worcestershire or soy sauce.

, The secret to a roast is cooking slowly, letting it absorb as much juice as possible. Use your cooker’s low setting and let it do the rest of the work. Beef roasts should generally be left in the slow cooker for 8 to 10 hours, while pork roasts will generally be done after 6 or 7 hours., It should be tender and easy to cut. If you find that your roast isn’t as moist as you want it to be when the cooking time is up, take it out of the cooker, cut it into smaller pieces, and return it to the cooker to absorb some more of the moisture. When it is done, slice it up and serve alongside the vegetables. Enjoy!

Simmer the sauce for 5 minutes.,
Transfer the brisket and sauce to the roasting pan.,
Bake until tender.,
Let rest before serving.",How to Cook a Brisket in the Oven1," Prepare a roasting pan by lining it with a large sheet of aluminum foil.


The foil needs to be at least three times as large as the bottom of your roasting pan. You will need enough foil to wrap completely and securely around the brisket, so if necessary, you can test the amount by wrapping it around your brisket before you use it the line the pan.;
, In a small saucepan, whisk together the ketchup, vinegar, brown sugar, soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, mustard, ginger, garlic, oil, and water until combined.


Alternatively, you could use your favorite prepared barbecue sauce instead of this sauce recipe. Use roughly 3/4 cup (185 ml) of prepared sauce and mix it with 1 cup (250 ml) of water. No simmering is necessary if using prepared sauce.

, Heat the sauce on your stove over medium-high heat until it reaches a simmer. Let cook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, so the flavors blend.Pre-heating the barbecue sauce separately allows the flavors of the sauce to blend more thoroughly before you add it to the beef brisket. If you do not pre-cook the sauce, you may end with a brisket that is unevenly flavored, with some tastes being stronger on one side of the meat than they are on another.

, Place the beef brisket on the aluminum foil and spread the sauce over it, covering as much of the meat as possible. Wrap the foil around the brisket when done.


By wrapping the brisket, you seal the liquid in and keep that liquid in full contact with the meat. This leads to a more even, more rapid, and more flavorful cooking process.
Make sure the foil is wrapped around the brisket tightly so no liquid can leak out through the corners of the foil packet.

, The beef brisket should be roasted for roughly 1 hour per l lb (450 g) of meat. In this case, the brisket should cook for 3 to 4 hours.Do not unwrap the brisket during the cooking process unless you are checking for doneness. Unwrapping the meat can cause some liquid to be lost, which can upset the cooking time and lead to a brisket that is drier than ideal.
You should also watch the brisket to make sure that liquid is not leaking out from the corners of the foil. If liquid does seep out, carefully refold the corners of the foil down using oven mitts to prevent additional liquid loss.
Check the internal temperature of the brisket with a meat thermometer. The temperature should be between 190 and 200 degrees Fahrenheit (88 to 93 degrees Celsius) when safe and tender enough to eat, and the meat should be easy to pull apart., Remove the beef brisket from the oven and let it rest for 30 minutes before you carve and serve it.


Slice the brisket across the grain to produce more tender slices of beef.
You can also serve the brisket with its cooking juices for a more intense flavor. Skin the fat from the surface of the cooking liquid using a spoon before ladling the liquid over carved slices of meat.

, Great options for beef include whole chuck or round, beef tenderloins, and sirloin. Healthier poultry selections are always skinless white meat, and low-fat pork choices include loin chops, leg pieces, and pork tenderloins.

, Most manufacturers include portions of meat from fattier sections of the animal because they are less expensive, which can quickly add more fat to your diet than you intended. If you require ground meat, choose a whole piece of lean beef, chicken, or pork, and ask the butcher to grind it on the spot for you.

, These lower fat meats can make an ideal meal at a fraction of the cholesterol or fat content.

, While slightly gamier in flavor, it contains less fat, which makes it a viable option for healthier eating.

, The ""prime"" grade indicates that the meat is more marbled with fat.

, Even the leanest cuts from a butcher can be hand trimmed further.

, It is considered acceptable to cook these meats with the skin on for flavoring, but it should be removed before eating.

, The proper serving of protein at any meal should equal 3 ounces (85 g) or roughly the equivalent to the size of a deck of cards. Keeping to this measurement insures that you are not overeating.

, Strain the meat through a colander, and run it under hot water before mixing with other ingredients or stirring.

, Place the meat on a rack inside a baking dish before roasting, which allows unhealthy fats to drip away from your meat.

If you do not have beef broth, you could use venison stock, beef stock, chicken stock, or vegetable broth. In a pinch, you could even use water.;
, Cut the butter into small chunks and distribute it evenly over the surface of the roast.


If the butter has been softened, smear it over the top and sides of the meat. If the butter is still hard, however, simply distribute the chunks of butter over the surface as evenly as possible to distribute the flavor.

, Combine the garlic, salt, pepper, paprika, thyme, and rosemary in a small bowl. Sprinkle this blend of spices and herbs evenly over the top and sides of the roast.


If you want the seasonings to penetrate the meat even further, consider using your hands to rub the seasoning blend into the meat. This works best if you are also using softened butter since you can spread both the butter and the seasonings over the surface at the same time.

, Spread the diced onion over the top of the roast. Layer the cubed potatoes and chopped carrots on top, as well.


Even if you choose not to prepare the roast with vegetables, you should still add the onion. Many people claim that the pungent onion flavor masks the ""gamey"" taste of a deer roast.
If you prefer crisp, firm vegetables, you can wait until the final 2 hours of cooking time before adding the cubed potatoes and chopped carrots. The onion should always be added at this time, however.

, A thawed roast should take about 8 hours, but a frozen or partially frozen roast will need a full 10 hours.


Alternatively, you could switch the slow cooker on high and leave it for 6 hours.

Use a meat thermometer specially designed for microwave use if you cook meat in the microwave.

",How to Check an Internal Meat Temperature1," If you think you may have difficulty operating a digital thermometer, buy one with a needle gauge. However, digital thermometers do have a distinct advantage. They provide a more precise temperature reading in a matter of seconds. This will keep less heat from escaping your oven or outdoor grill while your are checking the meat's temperature.;
, An instant read thermometer is inserted into the meat at the end of cooking time to check the internal temperature.

, A probe is designed to be inserted in the meat before the meat is placed in the oven, and allows you to monitor the temperature and know when the meat has finished cooking.

Prepare a mixture of three parts salt and one part sugar.,
Dissolve the sugar/salt mixture in water.,
Add any flavorings you wish.,
Submerge the meat in brine.

,
Store it in a refrigerator or other cooler space.",How to Brine Meat," The salt may be kosher or sea salt. The sugar can be any white crystal sugar, but not 10X or confectioner's sugar.;
, The salt to water ratio should be 1:16—for every gallon of water you should have a cup of salt. . Make enough of the mixture to comfortable cover the meat you wish to brine.

, Sharp liquids (vinegars and citrus juices), whole seeds, and dried herbs and spices work especially well. Thicker liquids such as honey, oil and some sauces will impart fewer flavors unless boiled (see step 4, substep 1). This is also the case with fresh herbs.

,, Cuts of pork, wild game, and larger poultry, such as turkey, can be brined anywhere from 4-12 hours; smaller cuts and birds should be brined for 30 minutes to 2 hours.


If your brine is extensively flavored, or if you do not plan to brine the meat for long, consider bringing the mixture to a fast boil and cooling before starting the brine. This is especially effective for chicken and smaller poultry because brining them for too long will cause the meat to break down.

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (180 degrees Celsius).,
Heat oil in a large Dutch oven.,
Sear the brisket on all sides.,
Briefly cook the onions, carrots, and garlic.,
Add the seasonings and white wine.,
Return the brisket to the Dutch oven with the tomatoes.,
Roast until tender.,
Let rest before serving.",How to Cook a Brisket in the Oven2," Meanwhile, season the veal brisket with salt and pepper on all sides.

, Add the oil to an oven-safe Dutch oven and heat over medium-high for a couple of minutes, letting it become thinner and easier to spread across the bottom of the Dutch oven.


Veal brisket is usually browned while beef brisket is often prepared without being browned. The flavor of veal is improved more dramatically on browning than the flavor of beef, at least as far as oven-cooked brisket is concerned.

, Add the veal brisket to the hot oil and sear on each side, turning with tongs as needed, until all sides are lightly browned. This should take about 3 to 5 minutes per side.


When done, remove the brisket from the Dutch oven and keep warm.

, Add these ingredients to the remaining oil in the Dutch oil and cook, stirring frequently, until the onions begin to wilt and turn golden and translucent. This should take another 4 minutes or so.


If there is little to no oil left in the Dutch oven when you add the vegetables, add another splash of oil so these ingredients can be sautéed in fat.

, Add the bay leaf, thyme, rosemary, parsley, and white wine to the Dutch oven. Simmer over medium-high heat for 2 to 3 minutes.


Stir the bottom of the Dutch oven, scraping up any stuck bits of veal or vegetables in the process. These small bits are packed with flavor, so you do not want to lose them.
If you want to remove the herbs before serving the veal brisket, place them inside a small satchel made of cheesecloth. This is not strictly necessary, though, since the bay leaf is the only one that really needs to be removed and it is usually easy enough to spot and remove on its own.

, Return the veal brisket to the Dutch oven and add the crushed tomatoes. Cover the pot.


Use the lid to your Dutch oven. If it does not have a lid, cover tightly with aluminum foil.

, This should take about 2 1/2 to 3 hours.Keep the Dutch oven covered for the duration of the cooking process, only removing the lid to check for doneness.


Check the internal temperature of the brisket with a meat thermometer. The temperature should be between 190 and 200 degrees Fahrenheit (88 to 93 degrees Celsius) when safe and tender enough to eat, and the meat should be easy to pull apart.

, Remove the veal brisket from the oven and let it rest for 20 minutes before carving and serving it.


Slice the brisket across the grain to produce more tender slices of veal.
You can also serve the brisket with its cooking juices for a more intense flavor. Skin the fat from the surface of the cooking liquid using a spoon before ladling the liquid over carved slices of meat.

Preheat the oven to 200 degrees Fahrenheit (90 degrees Celsius).,
Place the brisket in your roasting pan.,
Add water to the pan.,
Sprinkle the seasoning packet onto the meat.,
Wrap the brisket.,
Cook until tender.This can take anywhere from 3 to 6 hours.,
Let rest before serving.,
Finished.

",How to Cook a Brisket in the Oven3," Prepare a roasting pan by lining it with a large sheet of aluminum foil.


The foil needs to be at least three times as large as the bottom of your roasting pan. You will need enough foil to wrap completely and securely around the brisket, so if necessary, you can test the amount by wrapping it around your brisket before you use it the line the pan.

, Sit the beef brisket directly in the center of the foil lining your roasting pan.


Do not open the seasoning packet yet. This packet will be used a little later in the process.

, Pour enough water into the roasting pan to reach the top edge of the brisket.


You only need enough water to help braise the meat. It does not need to cover the brisket completely.

, Distribute the seasoning packet over the top surface of the brisket and into the surrounding water.


By getting some seasoning packet into the water and on top of the beef brisket itself, you can distribute the flavor more evenly throughout the cut of meat. Otherwise, the majority of the flavor would be concentrated on the top of the brisket alone.

, Tightly wrap the aluminum foil around the brisket, creating a seal so none of the liquid can escape as the corned beef brisket cooks.


By wrapping the brisket, you seal the liquid in and keep that liquid in full contact with the meat. This leads to a more even, more rapid, and more flavorful cooking process.

, After the 3-hour mark, check the brisket every 30 to 40 minutes to check its internal temperature and tenderness.


Do not unwrap the brisket during the cooking process unless you are checking for doneness. Unwrapping the meat can cause some liquid to be lost, which can upset the cooking time and lead to a brisket that is drier than ideal.
You should also watch the brisket to make sure that liquid is not leaking out from the corners of the foil. If liquid does seep out, carefully refold the corners of the foil down using oven mitts to prevent additional liquid loss.
Check the internal temperature of the brisket with a meat thermometer. The temperature should be between 190 and 200 degrees Fahrenheit (88 to 93 degrees Celsius) when safe and tender enough to eat, and the meat should be easy to pull apart.

, Remove the corned beef brisket from the oven and let rest 20 to 30 minutes before carving and serving it.


Slice the brisket across the grain to produce more tender slices of corned beef.
You can also serve the brisket with its cooking juices for a more intense flavor. Skin the fat from the surface of the cooking liquid using a spoon before ladling the liquid over carved slices of meat.

Shred the roast.,
Return the meat to the slow cooker.,
Serve warm.",How to Cook a Deer Roast in a Slow Cooker2," Use a sharp knife to cut the venison roast into slices that are roughly 2 inches (5 cm) thick.


Cutting the roast into slices will make it easier to keep the meat submerged under the sauce as it cooks.
You should also remove any visible fat and connective tissue as you cut the roast into slices.

, Spread the slices of onion evenly over the bottom of the slow cooker. Place the slices of deer roast on top of the onions.


The pungent onion flavor helps mask the ""gamey"" taste of the venison.
If possible, avoid overlapping the slices of venison roast. Keep the slices in as even and flat a layer as possible.

, In a separate medium mixing bowl, whisk together the apple cider vinegar and the brown sugar until the sugar is fully dissolved.


This will form the base of your barbecue sauce.

, Add the beef broth, ketchup, Worcestershire sauce, tomato paste, butter, chili powder, salt, ground mustard, garlic powder, red pepper flakes, and black pepper to the vinegar-sugar sauce base. Whisk these ingredient in, blending everything evenly.Margarine, lard, or vegetable shortening can be used instead of butter, if desired, but you must include some sort of fat if you want the naturally lean deer meat to become tender and moist as it cooks.

, Pour the barbecue sauce over the venison slices, covering the meat completely and evenly.


If desired, you can reserve 1/2 cup (125 ml) of the sauce to serve on the side when the shredded roast is finished cooking.

, Pour the liquid over the contents of the slow cooker, covering the roast in the process.


You may need to add more cola if 1 cup (250 ml) fails to cover the roast. Make sure that the roast is just barely covered.
If you don't want to use cola, you can use beer, chicken stock, beef broth, or water. Regardless of what you use, though, the meat should be covered in liquid as it cooks.

, Cover the slow cooker and set it on low. Cook until the meat is tender enough to pull apart with a fork.


If you don't have that much time, you can opt to cook the roast on high for 6 hours, instead.

, Remove the meat from the slow cooker and place it in a large bowl or on a large platter. Use two forks to shred the roast into pieces.

, Place the shredded venison roast back in your slow cooker, cover, and let it cook for another hour on low or another 30 minutes on high.


While the roast is technically safe and ready to eat without returning it to the slow cooker, allowing it to cook for additional time allows the flavor of the barbecue sauce to penetrate the meat more thoroughly.

, When done, switch the slow cooker to warm and serve the shredded venison directly from the appliance.


Enjoy the shredded venison on sandwich buns, on top of mashed potatoes or noodles, or in any way you would usually serve shredded barbecue meat.

Serve warm.",How to Cook a Deer Roast in a Slow Cooker3," Use a sharp knife to cut the venison roast into 1-inch (2.5-cm) cubes.During this time, you should also trim any visible fat or connective tissue you see.

, Place the flour in a shallow bowl. Toss the venison cubes in the flour, rolling and turning them as needed until all sides are coated.


You could also do this by placing the flour and venison in a large resealable plastic bag. Seal the bag and shake it vigorously to coat all the pieces.

, Pour the oil into a large skillet and heat it on medium-high for a minute or so.


The oil should become visibly thinner. Do not allow it to become hot enough to smoke, though.
For a richer flavor, replace the oil with butter.

, Place the coated cubes of venison roast in the skillet of hot oil. Cook, turning frequently, until lightly browned on most sides.


Browning the cubes of meat before adding them to your slow cooker deepens the flavor.
The oil or butter also adds fat to the otherwise lean meat, which will help the meat stay tender and moist during the cooking process.

, Dump the contents of the skillet into your slow cooker, dispersing the venison evenly over the bottom of the appliance.


Do not drain the excess oil. Pour it into the slow cooker along with the meat.

, Layer the cubed potatoes, diced carrots, chopped celery, and chopped onion on top of the meat.


You can alter or omit the vegetables you use, but you should always include onion since the pungent onion flavor helps mask the ""gamey"" taste of venison.

, Pour enough broth over the contents of the slow cooker to completely cover the venison.


You do not need to keep all of the vegetables submerged, but the meat itself needs to be submerged if you want it to remain moist.
If you do not have beef broth, chicken broth, vegetable broth, venison stock, or water can be used, instead.

, Cover the slow cooker and cook it on high for 6 hours, or until the vegetables and cubes of meat are tender enough to fall apart.


If you want to prolong the cooking time, switch the slow cooker on low and cook the stew for 8 to 10 hours.

, Switch the slow cooker to warm and serve the venison roast stew directly from the appliance.

Medium rare (bright pink center): 145 degrees Fahrenheit (63 Celsius)
Medium (light pink center): 160 degrees Fahrenheit (71 Celsius)
Well done (no pink): 170 degrees Fahrenheit (77 Celsius)

, Because the meat is ground, contaminating bacteria might be present throughout the meat. It's therefore never safe to serve ground meat that's less than well done.

Look for a pasture-raised label.,
Make sure the label specifies grass-fed.,
Find an organic label.,
Opt for antibiotic-free meat.,
Skip labels altogether.",How to Choose Grass Fed and Organic Meat1," You want to make sure any grass-fed meat you buy was pasture-raised. Labels can be deceiving because organic and grass-fed meat does not always mean the animals were raised on a pasture. In general, raising animals on a pasture is more ethical, as animals were allowed to roam freely. Also, pasture-raised animals may have a healthier diet.Grass-fed beef is higher in omega-3s than conventionally raised beef, so it is healthier for your heart.However, you should always look for multiple labels. Pasture-raised does not mean the farm grew crops without pesticides or that the animals were never fed artificial grains or given antibiotics. Pasture-raised is only one of many labels you should look for when choosing meats.;
, Grass-fed animals were probably not fed artificial products, or these products were at least not their primary food source. However, not all grass-fed animals were fed grass year round. Some labels are more authentic than others.Try to find a grass-fed label from the American Grassfed Association. In addition to assuring animals were grass-fed year-round, this also indicates the animals were raised humanely prior to slaughter.
When possible, select grass-fed labels from local farmers. You can ask specific questions that may not be answered by a label.

, An organic label does not give a lot of information about your meat, but it's good for meat labeled organic that also contains labels like pasture-raised and grass-fed. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) requires certain standards be met for meat to be labeled as organic.Organic meat must be raised using organic food sources that minimize use of antibiotics and chemicals. Animals are also generally hormone free.
However, like all labels, you should not rely on an organic label alone. Native fish may be less regulated than other meats, and the USDA does not have specific requirements regarding controlling methane emissions from cattle. Opt for meat that comes with the organic label alongside other labels, like grass-fed and pasture-raised.

, Animals are often fed antibiotics to promote growth. Products labeled ""antibiotic-free"" are not necessarily 100% free of antibiotics. However, the use of antibiotics was likely minimized in such products.The label ""USDA Process Verified"" can be particularly deceiving, as such animals likely spent some time on a factory farm when being raised. Similarly, the label ""antibiotic free"" does not mean the animals were never fed antibiotics.
In general, smaller independent farms are less likely to use antibiotics. When possible, seek out meat locally from a farmer you can talk to face-to-face.

, Labels can only tell you so much about how animals were fed and raised before slaughter. If you want to make sure your meat really was grass-fed and organic, consult a local farmer. You can reach out to a local farmer you find through the yellow pages or online. You can also find farmers at a local farmer's market. Buying meat directly from a farmer will allow you to have any questions you have about the quality of the meat answered directly."

Get a pressure canner.,
Use canning jars and lids.,
Set up your workspace.,
Take safety precautions.",How to Can Meat1," This type of canner heats the jars of food to 240 °F (116 °C), which is necessary in order to ensure that all the bacteria and other contaminants are killed. Since meat is a low acid food, and does not contain natural preservatives, using a pressure canner is the only safe way to can it.Pressure canners are available new at kitchen supply stores, but you may be able to borrow one or find a used one online.
Consider getting a jar lifter to use with the canner. This tool is used for moving the jars out of the steaming water when the canning process is complete.
Do not use a simple bath canner to can meat. Bath canners do not raise the internal temperature of the meat to a high enough level to kill the contaminants.;
, Canning jars are made of glass and come in convenient sizes. You can buy new jars or reuse old ones, but make sure the lids are new. Reusing old lids isn't safe, since they won't properly seal the second time around.


Jars come in quarts, pints and half pints. Choose the size that fits the needs of your family. It makes sense to can a meal's worth of meat in one jar., Before you start canning, take the time to set up your work area in the kitchen. Be sure the surfaces you'll be using are clean. Lay out your cutting board and knife, paper towels and some vinegar for wiping the rims of the jars. Place your jars within reach of the cutting board so you'll be able to transfer the meat to them right away. Keep the lids and rings away from the meat area to prevent them from getting bits of fat or grease on them.

, When used correctly, modern pressure canners rarely cause the types of accidents that older models used to cause. They have safety features in place to prevent them from exploding with pressure buildup. That said, it's important to handle the machine with care. Take the following precautions before you start canning:


Keep children and pets away from the kitchen. The machine gets very hot, and a small child could pull it down from the counter. Kids and pets underfoot could cause you to trip and break a glass jar. It's best to keep them out of the kitchen while you're concentrating on canning.
Check the vents in your pressure canner. Each time you use it, check to make sure the vents aren't clogged. If they are, dangerous pressure could build up in the machine.
Make sure the pressure gauge is accurate. If it's not, too much pressure could build up without you realizing there's a problem.
Be ready to stay close by at all times. Don't leave the kitchen while you're using the pressure canner."

Pour enough water into an appropriate container to cover the meat you want to brine.,
Mix the brine well with a spoon to dissolve the salt and sugar crystals.,
If you want to cook your brine before soaking your meat in it, pour it into a saucepan or pot and place it on the stove over medium-high heat.,
Pour cooked brine back into your soaking pot where your meat will sit overnight.

,
Immerse your pork, beef, poultry or other meat in the brine.

,
Chill overnight, turning the meat occasionally and ensuring that the meat is entirely covered with the brine at all times.

",How to Brine Meat Overnight," This should be done 24 hours before you begin cooking the meat.


For large cuts of meat, such as pork roasts or whole turkeys, start with 1 gallon (3.78 l) of water, season to taste according to your brine-seasoning recipe and then repeat until you have enough brine to cover the meat.
Don’t’ taste the liquid if the raw meat has touched it.;
,


A simple brine can be uncooked as long as you ensure that all the ingredients are well mixed and have totally dissolved into the water.
You can also cook your brining liquid before soaking your meat in it. Cooking a brine with many flavors releases essential oils and allows flavors to meld and intensify.

,


Do not boil the brine, as boiling temps break down the essential oils and flavors that you are trying to release. Let cool completely before using with meat for food safety - ideally to below 40 degrees.

Identify a good cut of beef.,
Pick the right poultry.,
Select sustainable, wild-caught seafood.,
Choose other meats carefully.",How to Choose Grass Fed and Organic Meat2," You want to make sure you choose quality meat when selecting organic meats. When choosing beef, look for physical indications the beef is high quality.Higher quality beef will have brown edges. It will also have visible fat that is yellow-colored.
Beef can come in a variety of colors, from mahogany to deep brown. Color is not necessarily an indication of freshness.
When the meat is labeled in terms of fat percentages, look for beef that is 90% lean.
Quality beef will not have an unusual smell. It should smell like you would expect meat to smell and should not give off a rancid or unpleasant odor., If you're buying poultry, like chicken or turkey, look for indicators the meat is high quality. Keep in mind that poultry cannot be grass-fed because this is not what they like to eat. Look for poultry that is labeled as organic and free range. Once you've found a brand of poultry with all the right labels, identify markers of quality.Poultry should be plump in appearance. The skin should be free of any cuts and bruises.
Packages should be free of cuts and tears, as this keeps poultry fresh. You should also only buy poultry from a store that stocks meat daily.
Frozen poultry should be completely frozen through. There should be no ice crystals on the packaging or the poultry.

, Most seafood will not be labeled as organic. Instead, choose wild-caught seafood that is labeled as “certified sustainable.” These are the greenest options available when choosing seafood.Check the seafood for quality and freshness as well.


Whole fish should have bright pink eyes and gills. Avoid fish that has a graying or dusty appearance. Fillets should be somewhat translucent in appearance with no brown edges.
Shellfish such as oysters should have completely closed shells with no signs of outside damage. Shellfish sold without the shell in place, such as shrimp, should be firm with a slight odor and a bright appearance. Fresher fish will lack a strong, fishy odor.

, You can also find other types of organic meats, such as pork and lamb. Lamb may be grass-fed also, but pigs do not eat grass so you will not be able to get grass-fed pork. When selecting meat, make sure the meat is prepared carefully. In addition to being organic, look for general signs of quality.While color varies depending on the type of meat, color should generally be fairly uniform.
The texture should be fairly tight and uniform. Loose or broken fibers can be an indication of poor quality meat.
The meat should be cut properly. Cuts of meat should be roughly the same size and shape and there should be no uneven edges.

Wait for a sale.,
Seek out a farmer's market or buy directly from a farm.,
Find alternatives when necessary.",How to Choose Grass Fed and Organic Meat3," Unfortunately, grass-fed and organic meats are often more expensive than other meats. If you're on a budget, keep your eye out for a sale at your local supermarket.Be on the lookout in the local paper for sales. You should also check receipts for coupons and save any coupons for meat you receive when checking out.
Keep in mind that organic meats will always be higher in price, even when at discounted prices.
If there's a big sale, stock up on organic meats now and freeze them for use later on.

, In addition to saving you some money, buying directly from a farmer has other benefits. You are able to ask questions about how the animals were raised and whether things like antibiotics were used directly.If you have a local farmer's market, make this your source of organic meat.
You can also look into local farms. Many local farms are willing to sell meat directly to the consumer. If you have a relationship with a local farmer, they may give you a discount.

, You may not always be able to find organic meat in your price range. Strive for alternatives in these situations.If you hunt, or know someone who does, wild game can be a good option.
If health is an issue, you can opt for lean meats or organ meats, which may be more nutrient dense.
If you want to buy organic grass-fed meat for ethical reasons, try making vegetarian meals if you can't find ethically ranged meat.

Trim the fat from the meat.,
Cut the meat into cubes or strips.,
Brown the meat.,
Get the canner ready.,
Fill the jars.,
Wipe and close the jars.",How to Can Meat2," Removing the fat from the meat, whether it be chicken, pork, beef, venison, or another type of meat, allows you to can prime cuts rather than wasting space with fat. It also prevents fat from getting on the rim of the jar. Fat that creeps into the lid area can prevent the jar from sealing correctly.

, Rather than canning an entire wedge of meat, it's a good idea to cut it into cubes or strips, so each individual piece gets hot enough during the canning process. As you cut the meat, remove any pieces of bone or gristle.


If you're canning ground meat, you can skip the cubing step. Form the meat into patties or can it loose.
It's easier to cut the meat while it's cold, rather than cutting warm meat., Heat some oil in a cast iron skillet and brown the meat for several minutes on each side. This shrinks the meat, allowing you to pack more in each jar. Browning meat also brings out a good flavor that will improve over time as the meat sits in the jar after canning.


It is not necessary to cook the meat; you can can it raw instead, unless you're canning ground meat.
Season the meat with spices before cooking it if you'd like. You could also wait until you're ready to use the meat to season it.

, Fill it with a few inches of water and place it on the stove. Turn on the heat and let it simmer. Place the lids in the hot water and let them stay there until you're ready to use them., Scoop meat into the jars, stopping two inches below the top of the jar. Pour either water or broth into the jar and fill it to within an inch of the top. You need the extra headspace, so don't fill the jars all the way to the top.

, Use a paper towel soaked in vinegar to wipe the rim of the jars, making sure to remove any traces of fat or oil. Use tongs to lift lids and place them on the jars one at a time. Screw the rings onto the jars so that they are firmly in place.

Place the jars in the canner.,
Turn up the heat and watch the steam and pressure.,
Process the jars for the duration of time needed for the type of meat you are canning.,
Turn off the heat and let the jars cool.,
Move the jars from the canner to the counter.,
Store the jars.",How to Can Meat3," Use the jar lifter to set them into the canner. Fit as many as you can in the canner at once. Close the lid on the canner and lock it in place. Depending on the type of canner you are using, either leave the pressure weight off or leave the petcock open.Be sure to read the instructions on the canner to make sure you complete the process correctly.
Don't stack jars on top of one another.

, The canner is working effectively when it begins producing large amounts of steam. Once the jars are inside and the heat is turned up, it should begin producing the appropriate amount of steam within 10 to 15 minutes. The pressure should hold steady at between 10 and 12 pounds, depending on your pressure canner model and altitude. If it rises above that, turn the heat down a little.

, This may be anywhere from 65 to 90 minutes, and it changes depending on whether the meat is raw or cooked.It's important to process the jars for exactly as long as is recommended for safety purposes.


Stay in the kitchen while the pressure canner is working, and monitor the pressure gauge. If it drops too low or high, adjust the heat on the stove as necessary.

, When the correct amount of time has elapsed, let the pressure return to zero and the jars cool a bit before you remove them from the pressure canner.

, Open the lid of the canner and remove the jars with the jar lifter, then set them on a dishtowel. Make sure your workspace isn't too drafty or cold; the cool air could cause the hot jars to crack. Set the jars a few inches apart so they cool properly. You'll hear popping noises as the lids seal.


Don't touch the jars as they cool, or they may not seal properly.
Check the seals after the cooling process is finished. They should be slightly indented.

, Jars that have been properly sealed can be stores on shelves in the pantry or another cool, dark area. Label the jars with their contents and the date before storing them.


Don't store jars of meat in the sunlight or in a warm area.
Jars that did not seal should be refrigerated or put through the canning process again.

Finish the dish.",How to Braise Meat," Braising is a great technique for tough and inexpensive meat. When selecting a meat, don't choose tender or quality cuts. Cuts of meat with the bone in also work well for braising.Braising beef works well with: chuck pot roast, shoulder steak, short ribs, rump roast, round steak, and brisket.
Braising pork works well with: chops, cutlets, cubes, pork shoulder, Boston butt, sirloin roast, and ribs.
Lamb shanks and shoulder are great for braising.For chicken, try legs and thighs. Keep the bone in to get the fat and tissue; don't braise boneless chicken breasts.
Try braising large, firm fish fillets, like shark, swordfish, or tuna. Don't braise tender fish like tilapia and cod. It'll fall apart.
Don't limit yourself to meat. You can also braise fruits and vegetables. Go for firmer vegetables, like squash, sweet potatoes, leeks, carrots, beets, and cabbage.;
, Part of the braising process is cooking the meat for a long time in a liquid. Be creative with the liquids you choose. There is no right or wrong liquid to use. Think about the flavor palette you want to create, what flavors will go well with your meat, and what flavors will go well with the seasonings and vegetables.


Try beef, chicken, or vegetable broth. You can also use stock. Try to match the meat with the broth or stock.
Use wine or beer. For pork, try lighter lagers, which will give the meat a nice sour taste.Try imported stouts or dark lagers for beef. Wine gives the dish a bit of an acidic taste. Stick with a dry wine, and one that you would drink.For a variation of flavor, mix your wine with your broth. You can also try balsamic vinaigrette.For something a little sweeter, try apple juice, cranberry juice, orange juice, or pineapple juice. Use tomato juice for something a little more tart.Ciders, fresh or fermented, go really well with poultry and pork for a bit of sweetness.Use water for the liquid if your meat, seasonings, and vegetables have strong flavors.
You can even braise with milk., Like liquids, the seasonings you choose can be creative and exciting. Match the herbs and spices to the liquid to make a complimentary flavor palette. You can use dried or fresh herbs when braising.


Try basil, Italian seasoning, oregano, mint, or thyme. Sage, rosemary, dill, bay leaves, and cilantro can also be used. Salt and pepper can also be added.
Garlic and onions are great flavorful additions to your braising liquid.
Try capers, lemon zest, lime zest, or orange zest.For something a bit sweet yet spicy, go for ginger. Lemongrass also adds a nice citrus sweetness to the dish.For something spicier, try chili powder, peppers, cayenne pepper, or any other spice. Throw in some cumin and turmeric for an Indian flavor.You can also try liquid seasonings, like barbecue sauce, Dijon mustard, soy sauce, steak sauce, Worcestershire sauce, duck sauce, or sweet chili sauce.

, No matter what meat you are braising, you need a large, deep heavy pot with a tight lid.This keeps the moisture in, which is required to braise properly.


Use a Dutch oven if you have one.You can also use an ovenproof skillet for smaller cuts of meat, like pork chops or chicken., When you braise meat, you don't just add meat, but vegetables, too. Classic choices are onion, carrots, and celery. However, you can add just about any vegetables you want. Just remember to match with your flavor palette.


Try mushrooms. They give your dish a woodsy flavor.Potatoes and sweet potatoes make a great addition that will turn the braised meat into a full meal.
Try different variations of squashes, parsnips, turnips, rutabaga, or other root vegetables.
Any kind of onion is a great addition to a braise., Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. While the oven is heating, season the meat with salt and pepper and any other seasonings you desire. Trim any excess fat from the meat.Keep the chunks of meat large. Try to keep the edges smooth instead of ragged, and don't pierce the edges. Smooth edges with no pierced places helps to absorb and keep the juices in.If the cut of meat you're using has a bone, then there may be tiny bone chips left behind. To remove, carefully run the meat under warm running water, rubbing it gently to dislodge any bone chips. Then, dry the meat with a paper towel and season it .

, Place 2 tablespoons of oil in a pot over medium-high heat. When the oil is hot and rippling, add the meat allowing it to brown in the oil. Then turn it to an unbrowned side. Continue in this fashion until the meat is browned all over. Set the meat aside when it's finished browning.


Make sure your pan is very hot. If the pan is smoking, that is a good thing. It should also be uncovered. Just make sure you open a window or use your exhaust fan.As you are browning, look for the outside to get caramelized and crispy.Remember, you aren't cooking the meat, just searing the outside.
Don't crowd your pot. Make sure there is enough room for the meat so it can properly sear., Add any combination of vegetables to the hot pan. Allow the vegetables to cook quickly until they're browned on the outside and fragrant. This should take 3 or 4 minutes.


Sauté the vegetables until they are a caramel brown color. Stir them often to keep them from searing., Caramelized brown bits should be left on the bottom of the pan. Pour in a splash of your liquid while still on medium heat. Then, use a wooden spoon to remove the caramelized bits from the bottom of the pan. You want to keep these brown bits because they add to the flavor., Place the meat back in the pot with the vegetables. Add the braising liquid so that it comes up to about halfway up the meat. Bring to a boil, then decrease the temperature so the dish can simmer.Once the dish is simmering, add the seasonings.
Don't add too much liquid. The meat shouldn't be completely covered by the liquid. Instead, only fill it so the meat is halfway covered. If you add too much liquid, it can decrease the flavor.If the pan you seared your meat and vegetables in isn't suitable for the oven, place the ingredients in another dish, such as a crock pot or oven safe casserole dish. Add the vegetables and deglazing liquid.

, Tightly cover the pot with the lid. Place the pot in the oven at 350 degrees. Cook for 1.5-6 hours. You want to cook the meat until it is tender and falls apart with a fork. Don't overcook, because then the meat will become dry.You can cook anywhere between 250-350 degrees.
If cooking on the stove top, set the heat to low. A crockpot should be set to high.

, If you want to add more vegetables, add them 45 minutes before the meat is done. Add a bit more liquid if it's lower than an inch.


If you want to make a sauce or gravy, remove the meat and vegetables when the meat is fork tender. Skim off the surface fat. Allow the sauce to simmer so it can reduce down until it coats the back of your spoon. Return the meat and vegetables to the pot and heat.To make a thicker sauce, try adding flour or cornstarch.
Let the meat sit in the sauce for 10-20 minutes after you take it out of the oven. This helps the juices absorb into the meat."

Understand the safety implications before commencing.,
Mix together all ingredients for the marinade.,
Pour the marinade over the meat.,
Remove the venison pieces from the fridge.,
Preheat the oven at a very low setting of around 200ºF (95C).,
Remove from the oven once dehydrated.,
Use the microwave rather than the oven if preferred.,
Store as outlined above.

",How to Make Venison Jerky," Drying meat at home carries risks if the bacteria are not adequately destroyed. As such, it is important to take all safety precautions during the preparation of venison jerky.When raw meat or poultry is dehydrated at home — either in a warm oven or a food dehydrator — to make jerky which will be stored on the shelf, pathogenic bacteria are likely to survive the dry heat of a warm oven and especially the 130 to 140 °F (54 to 60 °C) of a food dehydrator.Wash your hands with soap and warm water before commencing. Repeat hand washing throughout the process. Wash all implements and items used thoroughly as well.
Ensure that the venison has been kept refrigerated at 40 °F (4 °C) or slightly below.

, Place in an easily poured container.

, Leave to marinate overnight in the refrigerator. Either place it into a container with a lid, or Ziploc bags work just as well.


The venison pieces should all be cut the same thickness, with the standard being a 1/4 inch (6.35mm).This ensures that the venison jerky pieces will all cook evenly at the same time.
In line with USDA advice, consider steaming or cooking the venison to 160ºF (70C) before dehydrating it.

, Drain well.

,


Place the meat strips either directly onto the oven racks (line the base of the oven with foil to catch splatters), or placed on a cooling rack sitting on a cookie sheet brushed lightly with vegetable oil. Another neat alternative is to pierce each piece of venison with a toothpick and hang it from the upper rack of the oven.Place in the oven and leave to dry. This will take about 4 to 6 hours. If you've laid the jerky flat on a cookie sheet, it's important to turn the jerky about halfway, to ensure that it dries evenly. Otherwise, if it's hanging or sitting over the rack, it's good to stay.
It's a good idea to leave the door open just a few inches or centimetres to allow the moisture to escape., Leave to cool completely before placing into airtight storage; there should be no moisture present at all. Consume within 1–2 months., After marinating the strips, hang over a microwave roasting rack. Set the microwave oven to high. Cook for 4–6 minutes. For every half a minute after 4 minutes, stop the oven and check the consistency and color of the jerky. When it changes from brown to dark brown and looks like jerky (leathery), it's ready.;

Melt it on the stove. Put your butter in a skillet and turn the heat on low. Butter melts between 82 and 97ºF (28–36ºC), which can be about room temperature on a hot day. Keep an eye on your butter and remove it from heat when about 3/4 of the butter has melted. Use a spoon or spatula to spread the butter over the bottom of the pan as it melts.
Melt it in the microwave. Chop the butter into small pieces (if cold) and place it in a microwave-safe container for about 10 seconds at a time until melted.;
, In a medium bowl, mix together 1/3 cup (75 grams) butter (melted) and 3/4 cup (180 milliliters) whole milk. Make sure you have let your butter cool before pouring it into the milk


If you prefer to use milk with a lower fat content you'll need to add 1 tbsp of flour to help your cream thicken., Whisk together with an electric mixer, handheld whisker, fork, or spoon. Mix for several minutes until the cream is thick and frothy.


Be aware that this homemade heavy cream will not whip into whipping cream like store-bought heavy cream will.

, Place your heavy cream into a covered container in the refrigerator and store for 1 to 2 days.

, You can substitute this 1 cup (236ml) of homemade heavy cream in baked goods, soups, and savory sauces immediately.

Boil your eggs.,
Poach an egg.,
Bake your eggs.,
Fry your eggs in healthy oils.",How to Make Healthier Egg Dishes1," Boiling an egg protects the nutrients contained in the yolk from oxidation and is an easy, healthy option for preparing a meal or snack. Simply place the egg in a pot of boiling water and remove it once the egg has hardened to your preference. Depending on your stovetop, a soft-boiled egg usually takes between 3 and 6 minutes. A hard-boiled egg typically takes 10 to 15 minutes.Boiled eggs are a great breakfast option and make a tasty addition to many types of salads.
Hard-boiled eggs are a great option for egg and potato salads.You can also add hard-boiled eggs to a nutritious cobb salad.;
, Poaching is another healthy option for cooking your eggs. Simply crack your eggs into a shallow pan of water and simmer the eggs for 3 to 5 minutes. You may also choose to add 1 to 2 tablespoons (15 to 30 milliliters) of vinegar to the simmering water to help the eggs set properly.To avoid Salmonella, you should always choose fresh eggs when poaching. To test for freshness, place your eggs in a bowl of water. If it is fresh, the egg will sink. If it is past its prime, the egg will bob or float.
Poached eggs are a great breakfast option. They are particularly popular in eggs benedict., If you want to cut down on the amount of oil that you use to cook your eggs, consider baking them. Simply place the eggs in a greased or non-stick pan, add healthy toppings, and bake the eggs for about 10 to 15 minutes at 325 degrees Fahrenheit (165 degrees Celsius). This method limits the amount of unhealthy fats that you will eat from cooking oils.To promote your overall health, consider using a non-stick pan. Otherwise, you may need to add calories by using cooking spray, butter, or ghee to grease the pan.
Shakshuka is a healthy baked egg breakfast common throughout North Africa and the Middle East., If you really enjoy fried eggs, consider using healthy cooking oils and butters. Ghee and clarified butter may be healthier alternatives to regular butter or margarine. If you like the taste, a small amount of coconut oil is also a good frying option because it does not oxidize at high heat.Consider using a non-stick pan to limit the amount of oil that you need to fry your eggs."

Try using skim milk and cornstarch.,
Try tofu and soy milk.,
Try cottage cheese and milk.,
Try evaporated milk and vanilla extract.,
Try Greek yogurt and milk.,
Try Half-and-half and butter.,
Try low-fat cream cheese.",How to Make Heavy Cream2," If you only drink skim milk, you can still use this as a basis for your heavy cream substitute. In this case, use one cup of milk and add 2 tablespoons of cornstarch or unflavored gelatin to allow the mixture to thicken. Using a whisk, mix the ingredients for 3-4 minutes until the mixture begins to thicken.

, If you are looking for a low-fat or vegetarian heavy cream substitute, try blending tofu with unflavored soy milk until the mixture is smooth.


This substitute is a healthy alternative for heavy cream.

, Cottage cheese and non-fat milk powder can be mixed in equal amounts to create a low-calorie heavy cream substitute. Mix the ingredients until there are no lumps in the mixture.


If you don't have powdered milk for this recipe, you can use skim milk instead.

, Chill the evaporated milk and add vanilla extract to taste.


This mixture is a good one for soup recipes that call for heavy cream.

, Greek yogurt is much thicker than regular yogurt and can be used as a substitute for heavy cream while reducing the fat in the recipe. Be aware that if you are baking cookies or bread recipes that call for heavy cream, you may want to use half yogurt and half whole milk to preserve some of the taste of the fat.


In recipes such as cheesecake where the texture is critical, you may want to use half heavy cream and half Greek yogurt to reduce the fat in your recipe.
Yogurt will curdle when heated too fast. Use low heat if you are making a sauce with Greek yogurt.
You can even make your own Greek yogurt by wrapping 2 cups of plain milk yogurt in a cheesecloth. Let the liquid drain off for several hours and you will be left with 1 cup of thick yogurt.

, For each 1 cup of heavy cream in a recipe, you can use a substitute of butter and half-and-half. Melt 1/6 cup of butter and allow it to cool. Be sure it does not solidify during the cooling process. Put 7/8 cup of half-and-half into a bowl and stir in the cool melted butter until they are well blended.

, Substituting low-fat cream cheese will provide the same consistency while reducing the calories and fat in the recipe.


If the recipe calls for 1 cup of heavy cream, use only 1/2 cup of cream cheese.
The taste of the cream cheese is a little sour. Don’t use it in recipes that need the sweetness of heavy cream.

Add more vegetables.,
Choose lean meats.,
Eat whole grains.",How to Make Healthier Egg Dishes2," If you want to spruce up your egg dishes, consider adding more vegetables. Onions, tomatoes, mushrooms, spinach, peppers, and avocados will add flavor and healthy vitamins and nutrients to your egg dishes. You can add raw vegetables to an omelette or eat them as a side with your eggs.Salsa is a healthy option that can add a lot of flavor to your eggs.Make a simple, veggie-packed scramble by adding some spinach, sweet peppers, and diced onions to your eggs as you scramble them. The dish will cook together and create a delicious and nutritious meal.

, Instead of serving your eggs with meats that are high in saturated fat, pick lean meats that are healthy sources of protein. Turkey, bacon, or chicken sausages can be a healthy alternative to pork sausage and bacon. However, they can be higher in sodium.You can also trim the excess fat from your meats to make them healthier.For example, if you make a Cobb salad, consider using turkey bacon instead of traditional pork bacon.As a rule of thumb, try to limit the amount of cured meats you eat. Try not to eat more than two slices of bacon or two sausage links with your breakfast.

, If you are looking for a healthy carbohydrate to add to your egg dish, look for whole grains. Grains like rice and quinoa will help you stay full and are a healthy source of energy to fuel your day.You might also want to consider sprouted grain breads made from wheat, barley, rye, oats, millet, or brown rice. These breads may provide some protein and often have a low caloric content.

",How to Make Healthier Egg Dishes3," The longer that you cook your eggs at a high temperature, the more likely you are to lose important nutrients. Depending on the preparation method, the amount of time needed to cook the egg properly will vary.Depending on how runny your like your yolks, frying an egg can take 2 to 5 minutes.
Poaching an egg should take about 3 minutes.
Baking an egg can take 10 to 15 minutes.
Boiled eggs can take anywhere from 5 to 15 minutes depending on your preference.

, In order to avoid unhealthy saturated fats, you might want to skip egg dishes that contain a lot of cheese. Instead, look for cheese substitutes, like nutritional yeast or avocados, to add flavor to your eggs.If you are adding cheese to your eggs, try to limit the cheese to 2 tablespoons (30 grams) per serving.

, If you are looking to limit the amount of fat and calories that you ingest, you might want to skip the yolk, which contains the majority of an eggs caloric content. Instead, separate the yolks and cook the egg whites. However, by skipping the yolk, you miss many of the important vitamins and minerals contained in eggs. In fact, there is some evidence that egg yolk contains nutrients that can help control your weight.You can also buy already-separated egg whites at your local grocery store.

, Eating eggs raw can lead to a Salmonella infection. Keep your eggs refrigerated at 40 degrees Fahrenheit (4 degrees Celsius) and only buy eggs from stores and suppliers that refrigerate them.When cooking eggs, heat until both the yolk and white are firm and they reach an internal temperature of 160 degrees Fahrenheit (71 degrees Celsius).
Do not keep eggs or dishes made from eggs warm or at room temperature for more than an hour.

",How to Make Pastrami," Combine the three spices in a small, dry pan and heat over medium heat.Stir continuously with a heat-resistant spatula. The more frequently you stir the seeds, the less likely you are to burn them.
Keep the lid nearby. If the seeds begin to pop as they heat up, quickly cover the pan with the lid and remove from the heat.;
, Transfer the peppercorns, mustard seeds, and coriander seeds to a mortar and crush into a powder using a pestle.


If you do not have a mortar and pestle, you could also grind the spices with a coffee grinder or the side of a knife.
If using a coffee grinder, make sure to clean the machine well before using it for coffee.
If using a knife, crush the seeds and peppercorns into powder by smashing them on a cutting board with the side of your knife, using the heel of your hand to apply pressure to flat side of the blade from the other side.

, Toss the ground peppercorns, mustard seeds, and coriander seeds together with the red pepper flakes, allspice berries, mace, crushed cinnamon sticks, crushed bay leaves, cloves, and ground ginger in a small bowl.


Make sure that the spices all appear evenly distributed throughout the entire mixture.

, Set aside for the pastrami brine. Place the rest of the pickling spice in a resealable plastic container and store until needed for another recipe.


The spices can be stored at room temperature.

, Pour the water, salt, liquid smoke, garlic, and pickling spice into a large stockpot.


Make sure that the stockpot you use can fit inside of your refrigerator. You will need to store it there in a later step.
Place the stockpot on the stove.
Give the ingredients a quick stir with a large mixing spoon to combine well.

, Turn the burner onto high heat and cook the brine ingredients until they just begin to boil. At that point, the brine should be removed from the heat and cooled to room temperature.Most of the spices in the pickling mix should have had the chance to dissolve, and the same goes for the salt. Essentially, boiling the ingredients together blends the flavors more effectively.

, Place the brisket in the brine, cover, and refrigerate overnight.


Cover loosely with the stockpot's lid or with a sheet of plastic wrap or aluminum foil.
The brisket should chill in the brine for at least 8 hours, if possible. For a stronger flavor and more tender pastrami, though, you could let it sit in the brine up to 3 days.

, Combine the two spices in a mortar and grind them down into a powder using a pestle.


If you do not have a mortar and pestle, you could also grind the spices with a coffee grinder or the side of a knife.
If using a coffee grinder, make sure to clean the machine well before using it for coffee.
If using a knife, crush the coriander seeds and peppercorns into powder by smashing them on a cutting board with the side of your knife, using the heel of your hand to apply pressure to flat side of the blade from the other side.

, Remove the beef brisket from the brine mixture and pat dry with clean paper towels.


The cut of meat needs to be fairly dry in order to get the dry rub to stick effectively. There can be a little dampness, but it should not be “dripping wet.”

, Apply the pepper and coriander rub over all sides of the brisket generously, using up to the full amount, if desired.


Most of the surface should be covered. If, however, you prefer a less potent flavor, you can cut down on the amount of rub you use and apply it only according to your own tastes.

, Meanwhile, prepare a baking sheet by lining it with heavy-duty aluminum foil.Heavy-duty aluminum foil is recommended due to the weight of the meat. For even better results, choose a foil with a nonstick coating on one side.

, Place the brisket in the center of the aluminum foil on your baking sheet and wrap up the sides of the foil, covering as much as possible.

Keep the fatty side of the beef facing up when you place it on the baking sheet.
It is actually recommended that you wrap the pastrami in several layers of aluminum foil. After wrapping it with the first sheet, place the pastrami seam side down on a second sheet of aluminum foil and wrap the entire cut again. Take a third, final sheet, and place the beef on it seam side down before wrapping again.

, Cook the pastrami in your preheated oven until done and no longer pink inside.

Instead of cutting the beef open, a better, more accurate way to check for doneness would be to insert a meat thermometer into the center of the beef. The internal temperature should be at least 145 degrees Fahrenheit (60 degrees Celsius)., Remove the wrapped pastrami from the oven and let it sit out at room temperature for roughly 3 hours.

, Place the wrapped pastrami in a large plastic freezer bag and transfer it to the refrigerator to chill thoroughly.


Even though the pastrami is still wrapped in foil, the foil will not create an airtight seal as effective as a plastic bag will. For that reason, the plastic bag is highly recommended.

, Switch your broiler on and let it heat up for 5 to 10 minutes.


The oven rack should be about 6 to 8 inches (15.25 to 20.3 cm) from the upper heat source.
Most broilers only have “on” and “off” settings, but if your settings are further divided into “high” and “low,” set the broiler to “high.”

, Unwrap the pastrami and place it onto a broiler pan with a raised rack.


If you do not have a broiler pan, you can line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and use that, instead. Note, however, that a broiler pan is ideal because it allows more air to circulate, browning all sides evenly as a result.

, This should take about 3 to 4 minutes. Since the meat is cooked, you only need to worry about giving it enough time to brown.


Watch carefully to make sure that the pastrami does not begin to burn or smoke. As fat renders off the meat, there is a mild risk of it catching fire in the broiler, especially if you are using a baking sheet instead of a broiler pan with a rack. Since the pastrami is broiled for such a short time, though, the risk remains quite small.

, Use a carving knife and fork set to shave off slices of the cooked pastrami, making each slice about 1/8 inch (3.2 mm) thick.


The slices can be made with a regular carving knife, but if you can borrow a professional grade slicer, the process will take even quicker.

, To warm the slices further, place them in a large skillet set over low heat with a few drops of water. Cook until the fat turns translucent. This should only take about 5 minutes.


This can be served as a main dish, but for a more classic way to eat this deli meat, consider making hot pastrami sandwiches with it.

If you are having trouble with this, stir 1 drop of green food coloring into the whites instead. You'll have reverse green eggs and ham., Set the yolk aside when you are done. If you don't do this, some of the green may get into the whites and ruin the effect. In the book, only the yolks were green. The whites were still white.

Skip this step if you added the food coloring to the whites.

, Place a pan on the stove. Add 1 teaspoon of cooking oil or butter. Turn the heat up to medium-low and wait for it to get hot. Tilt the pan around so that the entire surface is coated with melted butter or oil.

You are ready for the next step when the butter melts or the oil starts to sizzle.
Ask an adult to help you for this.

, Pour the whites into the pain. Cook them until they start to turn white., Once the egg whites turn white, gently place the yolk on top. Wait a few minutes, then cover the pan with a lid. Let the egg cook for 1 to 2 more minutes before checking on it. You want the whites to be set. The yolk can be as soft or as had as you want it to be., Once the egg is done, slide a spatula under it. Lift the spatula up and transfer the egg to a plate.

Covering the pan with a lid will help the egg cook faster.

, Place a drop of food coloring on a slice of ham. Spread it around with your finger or a basting brush. Flip it over, and coat the back too. Pat any excess dye off with a paper towel.

If you want to cook the ham, use Canadian bacon.

, You can eat the ham cold, but it will taste much better if it is warm! Place it onto the pan and let it cook until the edges start to turn crispy., Place the green egg and ham onto a plate. Add some salt and pepper, then dig in!"

Remove and serve the eggs.",How to Make Fried Eggs for a Crowd1," Put a small amount of olive oil in the pan and set the burner to medium heat.There should be enough oil to lightly coat the bottom of the pan. Substitute butter or bacon grease for the oil if desired.If you use bacon grease, keep in mind the eggs won’t look as neat due to meat particles and the coloring of the grease.
If you have extra burners and skillets, have multiple pans going at the same time to prepare the eggs faster.;
, Do this once the oil becomes shinier, indicating that it’s warm. Have a bowl ready to put the eggshells into as you go. You may want to cook three eggs at a time to keep the process manageable.Burner heats may vary. Make sure the heat isn’t so high that the eggs sizzle and whiten as soon as they hit the pan. The whites should stay translucent for a few seconds.

, You can ensure that the egg tops are cooked and not runny by spooning oil over them. Alternately, you can use a lid and spoonfuls of water.


With a small spoon, take hot oil from the bottom of the pan. Carefully pour hot oil over the whites of the eggs only. Wait a couple of minutes until the whites are set and no longer wiggly. Then spoon hot oil over the yolks.To use water instead of oil, pour one or two tablespoons of water into the empty space of the pan. Put the lid on the pan. Cook the eggs until the whites have set and aren’t loose or runny., Transfer the eggs gently to their serving dishes using a spatula. If multiple burners and skillets don’t make enough eggs all at once, you will need a way to keep the eggs warm as you repeat the steps for another batch. For the finished eggs, remove the pans from heat and put lids on them to keep the heat in. Alternately, transfer the eggs to a large serving plate and cover it with a lid. Then separate and serve them when the next batch is finished.

If you don't have hash browns, cook 3 to 4 potatoes first. Let them cool off, then peel and shred them., Stir everything together well with a spoon. Be careful not to mash the hash browns too much, however; you want them to retain their shredded texture., Use a tablespoon to distribute the hash brown mixture into each muffin well; you will need about 3 to 4 spoonfuls for each well. Next, use your fingers to press the mixture against the bottom and sides of each well, forming a nest-like shape. The nest needs to be big enough to hold an egg., You are ready for the next step when the cheese melts and the hash browns turn crispy on the edges.

Remove from heat so it cools while you move on to the next step.If you're feeling extra fancy, clarify the butter by skimming off some or all of the milk solids. Their removal will make the sauce thicker, but less rich.Alternatively, just let these sink to the bottom of the pan, and decide what to do with them when it comes time to pour.;
, If you don't have a double boiler, just fill a pan about a ⅓ full of water and heat until you see a couple thin streams of bubbles. Place a heat-safe metal or glass bowl snugly on top of the pan, without touching the water. This indirect heat reduces the risk of your sauce burning and separating.

, Add four egg yolks and 1 tbsp (15mL) lemon juice to the double boiler. Whisk constantly and vigorously until the mixture becomes frothy and lighter in color, and the whisk leaves trails in the mixture. An experienced chef can achieve this in a minute or two, but 5–10 minutes is common for a first try.


Scrape down the sides of the bowl occasionally as well. Any egg left sitting in place might scramble.

, If the egg mixture gets too hot, it will curdle or ""split"" into solids and liquid. If it starts to feel too hot or steams heavily, pick up the bowl with an oven mitt or towel. Whisk vigorously for 30 seconds to cool the eggs down, then return to heat.


The first few times you make hollandaise, it can be difficult to identify the right temperature.To play it safe, do this for a few seconds, once a minute.
If the mixture starts to curdle, immediately scrape it into another bowl and whisk rapidly with 1 tbsp (15mL) ice water., Pour the butter in a small, steady stream, whisking constantly and vigorously. The sauce should thicken easily at first, then become more difficult to combine. Pour more slowly as this happens, since too much butter can cause the sauce to split.This step can take anywhere from 2–5 minutes.


Once you're more experienced, you can add the butter ladle by ladle, or even in two large batches. This risks splitting the sauce, but if you succeed you'll have a faster, airier hollandaise., Stir in salt and cayenne pepper to taste. You may also whisk in a little more lemon juice if you want a tangier flavor. If the sauce is thicker than you prefer, whisk in a little hot water.

, Until you finish the other ingredients, cover the bowl and place in a warm spot. Cool temperatures may split the sauce.


If the sauce gets too thick, whisk in a few drops of warm water before serving.

, Heat the Canadian bacon in a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook for a few minutes until it starts to brown, turning occasionally. Once ready, leave it in the skillet to keep it warm.


English back bacon works as well.

, Cut each English muffin in half and place them on a baking sheet, cut sides up. Butter the cut sides lightly and toast under the broiler until light brown.

, Fill a wide nonstick skillet or shallow pan half full of water. Heat until there are a couple thin streams of bubbles, or until a thermometer reads 160–180ºF (71–82ºC).Optionally, add 1 tsp (5mL) white vinegar to the water. This helps the egg white stay in position instead of separating throughout the water, but this can affect the texture and flavor., Crack one egg into a small bowl, taking care not to break the yolk. Gently lower the edge of the bowl into the water, letting some water flow into the bowl. Tip the bowl to slide the egg slide into the water. Quickly repeat with remaining eggs.


If the water has reached a full simmer, ""spin"" the water once with a spoon to cool it down before adding the egg. Do not do this once an egg is already in the water.
If the pan is small, only cook two or three eggs at a time. Eggs that crowd against each other may merge into once mass.

, Cook for 3½ minutes until the egg white is set but the yolk remains soft. Remove with a slotted spoon, allowing the egg to drain.

, Place one or two muffin halves on each plate. Lay a slice of bacon on top of each muffin half, followed by a poached egg. Spoon Hollandaise sauce generously over the eggs. Top with a dusting of paprika and an olive slice or two. Garnish the plate with parsley on the side.

, Instead of the bacon, sauté spinach until it wilts, then place that on top of the English muffin. You'll need about 4 cups (960mL) raw spinach for this recipe.

, Steamed asparagus pairs perfectly with hollandaise sauce. Serve it on the side and drizzle the sauce over the entire plate. Sprinkle with finely chopped basil for more summer flavor.

, ""Eggs Blackstone"" uses crisp, fatty American bacon (streaky bacon) instead of Canadian bacon. Pair this with a slice of raw, juicy tomato between the muffin and the bacon.

, The lemon flavor works wonders with seafood. Complement the salmon even more with a finely chopped handful of dill, mixed into the finished hollandaise sauce.

Choose your dry milk.,
Reconstitute the dry milk.,
Mix with whole milk.,
Chill the milk.,
Store the remaining powder.",How to Make Dry Milk Taste Like Fresh Milk1," ""Instant"" dry milk is the most common type, and the easiest to mix. ""Regular"" (or ""non-instant"") dry milk tends to taste worse. ""Whole milk powder"" has a richer taste (and may be satisfying enough on its own), but a much shorter shelf life.In the United States, dry milk labeled ""extra grade"" has passed certain taste and quality tests.Whole milk powder can be difficult to find in stores. You may need to order it online.;
, Start by mixing the dry milk with cold water. You can follow the instructions on the package, or use this approach (for one liter / one quart milk):Mix 315mL (1⅓ cups) instant dry milk into 500mL (2 cups) cold water until dissolved.
Add in another 500 mL (2 cups) water and stir until well mixed.
Let stand a few minutes and stir again.
For regular dry milk, use 175mL (¾ cup) of the powder instead. Dissolve it in a small amount of hot water before adding to the cold water., Mixing nonfat dry milk with an equal amount of whole milk gives you a result roughly equivalent to 2% milk.If you buy dry milk for shelf life reasons, use UHT (""ultra high temperature"") milk, which can last unopened for six months at room temperature.If you buy dry milk to save money, use ordinary milk and mix in as much as your budget allows.


UHT milk tastes slightly sweeter than regular milk, and not everyone likes the extra flavor.

, Alone or mixed with real milk, dry milk tastes best cold. If you do not have a refrigerator, wrap the container in a wet towel and put it in a cellar or other cool location.If your milk is lumpy, chill overnight and stir again the next day.Lumpy milk can result from old or poorly stored powder. ""Regular"" (non-instant) powder tends to form lumps even when fresh.

, After opening a dry milk package, pour the leftover powder into a glass or metal container (plastic can add an unpleasant odor). Seal tightly and store in a dark, dry location.If you live in a humid climate, add a desiccant pouch.

",How to Make Eggs Inside a Pepper," Use only the freshest ingredients--consider trying organically grown vegetables and grain fed chicken eggs for a wholesome meal.


Select one or two large, ripe peppers. Look for peppers that are large enough so when you slice them, you can create a large pepper “mold.” Also, make sure the peppers are hearty and crisp so they don’t fall apart during the cooking process.
Gather a number of desired eggs. Go for the farm fresh, organic eggs for the ultimate healthy meal. Or you could use egg white substitute (or egg whites) if you are concerned about cholesterol.
Choose additional ingredients such as tomatoes, cheese, rosemary, bacon, etc. Essentially you will be cutting out a large slice of pepper and cracking the egg inside the pepper. If you want more than just the egg, throw in some cheese (especially if you use egg whites only) or other meat or vegetables.
Don’t forget your spices and condiments. Salt, pepper and even garlic salt/powder should be considered in order to spice up your meal.;
, The pepper slices will act as your “mold” so be sure you cut an even slice.


Wash and remove pepper seeds. As with any produce, wash the pepper and then slice of the top. Use your paring knife to remove any seeds before slicing.
Generate enough pepper slices to correspond to the same number of desired eggs. In order to be an efficient chef, pre-cut the pepper so you are ready to cook without having to stop and re-slice for every egg.
Consider either saving the remainder of the pepper to use in another dish or dice the pepper and add to your egg dish.

, In a prepared sauté pan coated with either olive oil or cooking spray, place your pepper in the pan and cook before adding the egg.


Season the pepper by sprinkling it with salt and pepper. Lightly coat the pepper with the desired seasoning, but do not overwhelm the pepper so you don’t detract from the rest of the meal.
Allow the pepper to cook in the sauté pan until slightly tender. You don’t want the pepper to become overly soft, but warm and slightly crisp.

, This may take some finesse as you want to make sure all the egg remains inside the pepper.


Crack egg on the side of the pan and hold closely over the pepper. Allow the egg to slowly slide from the shell onto the pan, inside the pepper.
If you are pouring egg substitute into the middle of the pepper, add it as though you are pouring pancake batter. Aim for the center of the pepper opening and allow the egg substitute batter to spread. Avoid adding too much egg substitute as more batter added will take longer to cook.

, Before the eggs are fully cooked, add other vegetables, meat, cheese and seasonings.


Don’t over garnish or add too many bits of meat or vegetables. You want the eggs to cook evenly, so only add enough to cover approximately a quarter of the egg area inside the pepper.
Lightly season the entire dish to taste. A light dusting of salt and pepper will enhance the dish without overwhelming it.

, Make sure eggs are thoroughly cooked before serving.


If you are feeling ambitious and you like eggs served over easy, use a spatula and gently slide the spatula underneath the pepper/egg combo and flip over. Depending on the egg size, the egg may drop down inside the pepper if you do this.
Stay on top of the cooking process to ensure that as eggs cook, the pepper does not burn or char. Consider lowering the heat if the pepper begins to overcook or complete cooking in the microwave if eggs are nearly done.

Shake well before using.",How to Make Dry Milk Taste Like Fresh Milk2," If you're using instant nonfat dry milk powder (the most common type), mix in 315mL (1⅓ cups) powder into 1 liter (1 quart) water.A blender is recommended for this method, but you can whisk by hand instead.

, Egg is an emulsifier: it allows you to combine ingredients that do not normally mix. In this case, it will let you mix in fat that restores richness to your nonfat dry milk. Egg powder is recommended since it is shelf-stable and safe to eat without cooking. Blend in the following amount with the reconstituted milk:To make 1% (low fat) milk, mix in 1.25mL (¼ tsp) egg powder.
To make 2% (reduced fat) milk, mix in 2.5mL (½ tsp) egg powder.
To make whole milk, mix in 15mL (1 tbsp) egg powder.

Note: If you don't mind buying specialty ingredients, you can add 3 to 10g soy lecithin instead to avoid egg flavor., Choose an oil with little to no taste, such as refined canola, safflower, or sunflower oil. Blend or whisk it into the milk thoroughly, until you can't see any oil droplets. The amount to add depends on the flavor you're going for:For 1% milk, use 10mL (2 tsp) oil.
For 2% milk, use 20mL (4 tsp) oil.
For whole milk, use 30mL (2 tbsp) oil.

Note: You might get a more authentic milk flavor from ""butter powder"" instead, which you can find online. This is untested, so try it at your own risk. Butter powder is not as dense as oil, so you'll need to use more than the amounts listed here.

, The oil will start to float to the top within a few hours. Shake the bottle well to mix it again.

, Reconstituted dry milk contains just as much sugar as regular milk, but extra sweetness can hide unpleasant flavors. Stir a small spoonful into your glass, or make a pitcher of ""dessert milk"" by adding 30mL (2 tbsp) sugar in one liter (quart) of milk.


Chocolate syrup covers poor flavors even more.

, This may surprise you, but a small amount of salt can enhance other flavors without making your milk taste salty. Stir it in well and you may notice a sweeter taste to your milk.

, Peel a carrot, chop it into large pieces, and let it sit in a refrigerated jug of milk. Strain it out when you're ready to use the milk. This won't have a major effect, but it can improve the taste a little."

Place 1 pound (454 grams) of fresh bean sprouts in a colander.,
Make your marinade.,
Cut 2 chicken breasts into thin strips.,
Make the sauce for the chow mein.,
Place 8 ounces (227 grams) of dry wonton noodles in a bowl of salted, boiling water.,
Chop 2 celery stalks, 1 pound broccoli or bok choy, 1/2 onion, 1 red bell pepper and 1/2 pound (227 grams) fresh mushrooms and 1 scallion.,
Place 2 tablespoons of peanut oil in the wok.,
Place 2 more tablespoons of peanut oil in a wok.,
Add the chopped vegetables to the wok, one type of vegetable at a time.,
Place all of the ingredients in the wok, except for the noodles, sauce and shallot.,
Serve the chow mein.,
Consider making the sauce a bit sweeter.,
For a more Americanized chow mein, add shredded cabbage and carrot.,
Switch up your protein, or go vegetarian.,
Experiment with different types of noodles.",How to Make Chow Mein," Rinse them thoroughly, then allow the bean sprouts to drain while you prepare the other ingredients. This should be done about an hour before the rest of the recipe is ready.


If you're not a fan of bean sprouts, that's completely fine. Some recipes leave them out entirely or replace them with 1 cup of Chinese long beans or green beans. You simply cut them into about 1"" (2.5 cm) pieces, boil them for 1 minute, blanch them in ice water for 1 minute more, and set aside.;
, Place 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) of oyster sauce in a small mixing bowl. Add 1 teaspoon soy sauce, along with salt and freshly ground pepper to taste. Stir in 1/2 teaspoon cornstarch until it becomes one uniform, thickened consistency.Again, every recipe is different. Some choose to skip the marinade entirely. If you're watching your salt in take, you may want to just stir-fry your chicken (or whatever meat you choose) plain., Place the chicken strips in the oyster sauce mixture and allow the chicken to marinate for 20 to 25 minutes. Continue making your sauce and cutting up your veggies while the chicken marinates.


You can also use this marinade with pork or beef, too. Alternatively, you could use your own marinade if you have a favorite.
Tofu and shrimp may also be substituted instead of chicken, though you may want to skip the marinade for those.

, Place 1/4 cup low-sodium chicken broth into a mixing bowl. Stir in 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) soy sauce, 1 tablespoon oyster sauce and salt and pepper to taste. Blend 1 teaspoon cornstarch with 4 tablespoons (59.1 ml) water, then stir the cornstarch mixture into the sauce. Set the sauce aside once it's thickened.Many recipes make a sauce that's a bit sweeter. Consider adding a tablespoon or two of brown sugar, honey, or half a tablespoon of plain white sugar., Allow the noodles to soften (it should take about 5 to 7 minutes), and then drain the noodles thoroughly, setting aside.


The noodles are the most confusing part. Yaki Soba noodles will get you close to what you experience in Chinese take-out restaurants (they're usually refrigerated). You can also buy fresh, dried, or steamed chow mein noodles. If they're steamed, you need only to soak them in cold water. However, regardless of what type of noodle you use, it's probably safe to follow the instructions on the package.

, Keep them separate – you'll be cooking them separately later.


The beauty about chow mein is that you can really use whatever vegetables you like. Cabbage and carrot are awfully common, too. Just dice it up and it'll be ready for stir-frying.

, Heat the oil, then stir in the marinated chicken strips. Remove the chicken from the pan when the chicken is no longer pink.


Set the chicken aside – you'll be tossing it back in after the vegetables are done.

, Fry the wonton noodles in the hot oil, one small batch at a time. Remove the noodles when they turn golden.


You may not need that much more oil after the chicken, or you may need plenty. Just make sure there's enough oil in the pan for it to adequately stir-fry whatever's inside.

, Remove each vegetable before adding the next vegetable. Add more oil as needed. Stir fry all of the vegetables, except for the scallion. Add salt and pepper to taste.


Add 1/4 cup of water and place a lid on the wok when you stir fry the broccoli or bok choy. Because of this, it's easiest to do last.

, Stir well, then make a well in the center for the sauce. Stir the sauce, then pour the sauce into the well. Stir again.


Add the scallion, stir, and then pour the chow mein over the wonton noodles. Mix it up as you like.

, Place it all into a big bowl with tongs or a large fork and spoon and let your guests serve themselves. Provide extra soy sauce on the side, too, if needed.


Make sure you have both chopsticks and a fork at the ready – some people aren't proficient at chopsticks and prefer using a fork (and some are the other way around).

, If you're looking to recreate chow mein from your favorite take-out shop, you'll likely want to add just a bit of sweetness to the sauce. A tablespoon or two of brown sugar, honey, or a bit of white sugar can do the trick.


You may want to use hoisin sauce as well, which is generally available at special Asian markets.

, Most American chow mein contains only the very basic cabbage and carrot. If you're looking to replicate a recipe, these are a sure bet. But again, any vegetable will taste delicious – and make it healthier, too.


Plenty of people are fond of onion and garlic. If you're one of them, consider adding 3 cloves of garlic and one sliced onion to your pan and stir-frying until golden.

, Chicken is pretty standard in chow mein, but that doesn't mean you have to include it in your recipe. Beef, pork, shrimp and tofu work too. What's more, you could just skip the protein source entirely – though the meal becomes a lot less hearty without it.


If you do like the idea of making vegetarian chow mein but don't care much for tofu, simply up your quantities of your favorite vegetables. It'll give the dish more nutrients and more color.

, Some people find they prefer working with steamed noodles that only require soaking beforehand. Others find that the pan-fried, generic chow mein noodles work just fine, so why mess with a good thing? And yet others have diet restrictions, and need to use mushroom noodles or other variants. It all can work, so feel free to experiment.


If you're going low-carb, mushroom (or shirataki) noodles are a good substitute. However, if you're crafty, you could also use zucchini or squash noodles, though the taste will morph as a whole.

Now it is time to eat.",How to Make Chicken Parmesan with Pasta," This is the first and most important step in preparing your dish. This allows you to know if you have all the ingredients needed.;
, This is where the process begins.


Preheat the oven to 450 degrees.
Grab the 3 bowls and place in the first bowl 2 cups of flour with salt and pepper. In the second bowl, place your 3 large eggs, and in the third bowl place your bread crumbs. After you have done this, set them aside.
Take your chicken and place it on the cutting board. From here, cut off the unwanted fat.
Lay the chicken on the cutting board with a piece of wax paper over it. Grab the rolling pin, and flatten the chicken so one side is not larger than the other. The purpose of this is to get an even cook throughout the chicken.
Before we take the chicken to bowls, pour a thin layer of olive oil in the skillet and place the skillet on the stove. Turn the stove to a medium heat, and let the oil heat up.
Once the chicken is flattened, take it over to the bowls with the eggs, flour, and bread crumbs. In this order, place the chicken in the flour, then the eggs, then the bread crumbs.
Take the saucepan and add water and salt to it. Then set it aside because it will be used for the noodles.

, Time to start making your meal!


Place the chicken in the skillet with the thin layer of olive oil, and cook it on each side for 4 minutes. Remember, the stove is on a medium to light heat.
Once the chicken has cooked on both sides for 4 minutes, remove it from the stove. The chicken will not be fully cooked at this stage, but it will cook thoroughly when placed in the oven.
Pour pasta sauce on top of the chicken. Make sure to spread the sauce out evenly.
After the sauce is added, crumble up the fresh mozzarella. Then spread it over the top of the chicken and pasta sauce.
When the mozzarella is added, sprinkle parmesan cheese over the top, and garnish with fresh basil. The basil helps give a nice presentation.
Once everything has been added to the chicken, place the skillet in the oven and cook for 15 minutes.
Grab the saucepan with the water and salt in it. Place this on the stove, and bring the water to a boil. Once the water is boiling, place your noodles in the water, and cook until the noodles are done. This should be about 8-10 minutes.

,


When the timer on the oven goes off, remove the chicken, but be careful because the skillet will be hot.
Take the noodles off the stove and drain them. After draining them, place them in a bowl.

, Put that chicken and noodles on a plate and enjoy!

Fill a large pot with 4 quarts (3.8 liters) of water.,
Place the pot on the stove and bring it to a boil over high heat.,
Add 1 pound (450 grams) of pasta and 1 tablespoon of salt.,
Cook the pasta until it is al dente.,
Drain the pasta when it is done cooking.,
Run the pasta under cold water, then set it aside.,
Heat 1 cup (240 milliliters) of milk in a saucepan over medium heat.,
Mix ½ cup (120 milliliters) of milk with 2 tablespoons of flour.,
When the milk starts to steam, mix in the flour-milk.,
Keep whisking until the milk starts to thicken.,
Reduce the heat to low and add in 2 to 3 cups ( 200 to 300 grams) of shredded cheese.,
Mix in the cheese, then add ½ teaspoon of salt and ¼ teaspoon of powdered mustard.,
Keep stirring until the cheese melts and the sauce is smooth and creamy.,
Take the sauce off the heat.,
Put the pasta into a large serving bowl.,
Add in half of the cheese sauce.,
Stir the two together until the pasta is evenly coated.,
Add the rest of the sauce, and keep stirring until the pasta is evenly coated.,
Consider adding in some extras.,
Serve the cheesy pasta immediately.",How to Make Cheesy Pasta," You will make enough pasta to feed 4 to 6 people. If this is too much for you, you can cut the recipe in half. You can also store any leftovers in the fridge. Cheesy pasta will last about a week.


If you want to add extras to your cheesy pasta, like ham or peas, you might want to start heating those up now. Any extras should already be cooked by the time you add them in at the end.;
, You can save some time by starting to prepare your cheesy sauce. If you cook the sauce and the pasta together at the same time, your meal will be ready sooner.

, You can use any type you want, but textured shaped (such as corkscrews) will hold the sauce better. You might want to add in 1 to 2 teaspoons of some sort of cooking oil. This will help keep the pasta from sticking.

, Most packages will tell you how long this will take. It can be as little as 8 minutes, to as long as 12.

, Take the pot off the stove, and carry it over the sink. Pour the water and pasta through a colander or strainer.

, Once you have drained the pasta, keep it in the strainer, and run it under cold water for a few seconds. This will stop the pasta from cooking and turning mushy. Give the strainer a jiggle to get rid of any excess water, then set the pasta aside.

, You will be adding the rest of the milk later.

, In a separate cup, whisk together the remaining milk with the flour. Keep whisking until there are no clumps left.

, Wait until the heating milk starts to form tendrils of steam. When it does, pour in the flour-milk, and stir it with a whisk.

, You are looking for a heavy, cream-like consistency. This will take about 3 to 4 minutes.

, You can use any type of shredded cheese you like. Cheddar, Colby, and Monterey Jack are popular flavors. If you are using a hard cheese, such as Romano or Parmesan, make sure that it is finely-grated. This will help it melt better.

, For more flavor, add a dash of pepper, garlic powder, or some dried herbs (such as oregano or basil).

, At this point, you can give your sauce a taste, and make any adjustments, if needed.

, You are now ready to mix it into your pasta.

, Choose a bowl that is a little bit larger than you think it needs to be. This will make mixing the pasta and sauce a lot easier. It will help prevent any bits of pasta from escaping.

, You will be adding the rest of the sauce later. It is easier to mix in small amounts of sauce at a time.

, Use a large spoon or spatula. Try to use a rolling motion, where you bring the pasta from the bottom of the bowl to the top.

, Use that same rolling motion as before, where you scooped the pasta from the bottom of the bowl to the top.

, At this point, you can add in some extras to give your pasta some extra flavor. What ever you choose to add in should already be cooked and cut into small, bite-sized pieces (or smaller). Here are some ideas for popular add-ins:Bacon or ham
Broccoli
Cauliflower
Mushrooms and onions
Peas and carrots
Peppers

, This sort of dish is best served warm. The longer it sits, the more greasy and oily it will become.

Serve with a light garnish immediately.",How to Make Carbonara1," You want the water to almost taste like an ocean. Roughly 2 tablespoons of salt for 6 quarts of water should cover it nicely., If you want the most authentically Italian dish, use the guanciale, found at specialty shops, butchers, or online. You can even make your own! If guanciale is unavailable, however, pancetta and bacon make excellent substitutes. Use a sharp knife to cut it into little squares that cook quickly and are easy to eat., Crack the eggs in and add you grated cheese. A blend of Pecorino and Parmesan is the classic mixture, but asiago, romano, or any combination of them will work as well. Add a pinch of salt and a generous helping of ground black pepper, then whisk it all together into a smooth, consistent liquid. Set aside.


Don't worry if you do this early -- the eggs will mix in better if they're allowed to warm to room temperature.
The best pancetta is a quick-moving cooking process. Preparing the eggs and meat, instead of trying to do it all on the fly, will lead to a better dish.

, Spaghetti is the classic choice, but you can use whatever you have in the house if you'd like. You want the pasta to cook until it is just about al dente -- it should be just a touch firmer than you'd normally cook it. Make sure to stir it every 2-3 minutes.


Note that you need to keep working as the pasta cooks -- this dish is all about timing and using your heat wisely.
This should take 8-10 minutes., One of the biggest tricks of carbonara is heating the eggs enough to cook, but not enough that they scramble or turn solid. By ""cooking"" the eggs later in this hot bowl, instead of over direct heat, you can accomplish this with relative ease.The bowl doesn't need to be boiling hot -- the hottest water out of your tap is likely fine.

, Once the pasta is in, you need to get started on the ""sauce."" Once the oil has just started to let off a little smoke, you're ready to move on.

, It should just be starting to darken and crisp up, but shouldn't quite be finished cooking yet.

, Before you drain the pasta, be sure to scoop up a little extra for later. Hot, starchy water from cooking helps your sauce bind to the pasta instead of forming a puddle in your bowl, and it is the best way to keep the dish hot without overcooking the eggs., This allows the pork fat to coat the pasta strands richly, helping create your egg sauce later on. It only needs a minute or two over the heat.


If you're cooking for company and you aren't quite ready to serve yet, you can cut the heat to both and then reheat in the pan later, adding a splash of the starchy water to keep everything moist.

, Pour 2-3 tablespoons of the hot water from cooking the pasta into your egg mixture and immediately stir it in. This ""tempers"" the eggs, warming them slowly so that the next step isn't a heat shock. Move quickly from here on out -- you should be serving the dish in the next 4-5 minutes so that it all stays hot., Keep it moving as you do to ensure that the egg mixture coats the entire dish. If it gets a little sticky or difficult to stir, add a splash of the starchy water to thin it out and keep it mixing.

, Once you've mixed the egg into the pasta, it's time to eat -- the egg only needs a few seconds to cook if you've kept everything hot. You can garnish it with:


Grated cheese
Black Pepper
Italian parsley
Sliced green onions"
"
Chop half of a yellow onion finely and add to the meat as it cooks.,
Add 2-3 cloves of minced garlic for the last minute the meat cooks.,
Deglaze the meat pan with a sharp kick of white wine, especially if you added onion and/or garlic.,
Add 1 cup of cooked peas for a splash of sweetness and greenery.,
Toss in a splash of fresh cream or whole milk as the meat and pasta cook.",How to Make Carbonara2," The cooked onion will bring a light sweetness to the dish, and almost as many chefs who add it to their carbonara as those who don't. Chop the onion into small squares and cook in the fat of the pork, adding them at the same time and cooking until translucent.


If possible, use a slightly bigger pan so that everything has more room to cook.
Want a little less ""onion-like"" taste? Substitute a shallot for the onion, adding it to the meat for the last minute or so of cooking., Just like the onion, there are a lot of differing opinions on whether or not garlic has a place in carbonara. So just do what sounds tasty to you! Chop the cloves up nice and small and add them right before the pasta, allowing them to cook in the pork fat for about a minute.


When in doubt, add the garlic a little later. Such small pieces will burn easily if you're not careful., Once the meat is almost finished cooking and the garlic and onions are soft, a half cup of white wine will help deglaze the pan and add a burst of fresh acidity to the dish. Once the wine hits the pan, use a wooden spoon to scrape up anything that sticks to the bottom of the pan, then add the pasta in once most of the liquid has evaporated., Of all the variations mentioned, peas are the most controversial -- some claim they are absolutely necessary for a sweet, green bite, others claim they are a sacrilegious addition to a blissfully simple peasant dish.If you fall in the former category, add them right when you toss the pasta and meat together in the pan to make sure they are nice and warmed up for serving., After you've tossed the pasta in the pan with the pancetta/guanciale/bacon, add a 1/2 cup of heavy cream and stir around the pan. Make sure to scrape up any bits stuck to the bottom of the pan, and heat until the cream is bubbling and the pasta is finished cooking. Proceed like normal from here, stirring in the egg/cheese mixture in your mixing bowl."

After three days, rinse the cheeks off and pat them dry.,
Hang the cheeks in a dry place for two weeks.,
Alternatively, roast the cheeks for 3 hours at 275F to speed up the process.",How to Make Carbonara3," Head into your local butcher and ask around if they have pig cheek, though they will likely know what you mean by guanciale as well. You can order it online, as well, if you're serious about curing your own meat frequently.


This recipe is for 1 lb of pork cheeks/jowls.

, It will be about an inch and half thick when you are finished. If you are buying directly from the butcher, you can usually ask that they clean and prepare it for you., 2 curing salt and a seasoning mixture. The curing salt can be bought at big grocery stores but is also available online. The seasoning mixture can be tweaked to your preferences and style, but a good base recipe includes:


2 tablespoons Kosher Salt + 1 Teaspoon No. 1 or No. 2 curing salt
1 tablespoon rosemary, chopped
1 teaspoon black pepper, garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon ground coriander., Make sure the entire jowl is covered by your spices. Note, again, that the mixture above is for 1 lb or jowls -- you'll need to add more if you want a bigger batch.

, This allows the salt to get to work curing and saving your meat, removing moisture quickly to speed up the process. Every morning when you wake up, flip the bag so that a different side is soaking on the bottom., They're now ready to hang, but make sure you get off as much moisture as possible. This, after all, is the point of curing it!

, This is often the tricky part for a home chef, but it doesn't have to be. You can make a simple hook with a cleaned metal coat hanger, hanging them in the basement, garage, or attack -- somewhere without a lot of traffic or light.If possible, hang it in front of a wood stove or fireplace -- this can speed up the process considerably if it is usually on.Remember that this meat still needs to be cooked before it is eaten.

, This will lead to a slightly different flavor and texture, but not so different that you can't use it to shortcut the curing process. The raised heat will speed up the drying out of the cheeks, giving you delicious guanciale in an afternoon instead of two weeks."

Store the beans in a dark spot.",How to Grow Kidney Beans," Most kidney bean plants do not survive the transplanting process, so you should plan on directly sowing the seeds instead of getting starter plants.;
, Kidney beans need full sun in order to thrive, so you should plan on growing them in a spot that gets at least six hours of direct sunlight a day, if not more.


If possible, find a spot with soil that is naturally somewhat loose. Loose soil drains water more effectively, and this is crucial if you want to grow a healthy kidney bean plant. If you notice that the water settles or pools in a given area when it rains, you should consider choosing another location.
Practice crop rotation from year to year. Do not plant kidney beans in soil where other legumes have grown within the past three years.

, The soil needs to be fairly light and loose so that water can drain. If your soil is too heavy, you will need to amend it with enough organic material to even it out. The pH of the soil also needs to be near neutral.


Good soil amendments include manure and compost. Either option will help loosen the overall density of the soil while also providing plenty of nutrition for the plant as it starts out.
Amend the soil by mixing these extra components in with a trowel or small garden rake a few weeks before you plan to plant.
The pH of the soil should be between 6.0 and 7.0.
Consider mixing a powdered inoculant into the soil, as well. This is a type of natural, healthy bacterium that makes it easier for beans to absorb nitrogen during the earliest and most crucial stages of growth.

, While many popular kidney bean varieties are bush beans, there are a few pole bean varieties. Pole beans grow vertically, so you will need to fix a stake or trellis to the growing location if you want these varieties to produce their maximum yield.

, Kidney beans require adequate warmth and humidity to thrive. Plant them in the spring once you feel fairly certain that the last frost has already passed.


The temperature of the soil should be between 70 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit (21 to 27 degrees Celsius). If at all possible, avoid letting the soil temperature drop below 60 degrees Fahrenheit (16 degrees Celsius).Ideally, the air temperature should be between 65 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit (18 and 27 degrees Celsius) throughout most of the growing season.
If a frost does arrive unexpectedly after your kidney bean plants have sprouted, cover the seedlings with a bit of mesh cloth or canvas to help protect them from the freezing temperatures.

, Kidney bean seeds should be planted 1 to 1-1/2 inches (2.5 to 3.8 cm) deep.Many gardeners prefer to space seeds 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) apart initially. After your seedlings reach a height of roughly 3 inches (7.6 cm), thin them out to a more appropriate spacing, removing the weakest seedlings when possible and preserving the strongest.

, For most varieties, you will need to sow separate kidney bean seeds 3 to 4 inches (7.6 to 10 cm) apart from one another.


More specifically, pole or vine varieties do well when spaced 4 inches (10.16 cm) apart, while compact bushes may benefit more if spaced up to 8 inches (20.32 cm) apart.
The seeds should germinate within 10 to 14 days.

, While container gardens do not provide the most beneficial set of conditions for kidney beans, these plants can grow inside of containers when taken care of properly. For each kidney bean plant, you will need a pot with a diameter of 12 inches (30.5 cm).


When choosing to grow kidney beans in containers, you should opt for a bush variety instead of a pole variety. Bush varieties tend to do better in more confined spaces.
The main reason that kidney beans are not typically grown in containers is simply that the yield of an average plant is not enough for one person. You will usually need to plant six to ten plants if you want to supply yourself with enough beans for regular use. You should only plant one kidney bean plant per pot, however, so you will need six to ten separate pots if you plan on producing enough for yourself.

, Before you add any soil to the container, you will need to spread a layer of gravel at the bottom to improve drainage. Otherwise, kidney bean plants can quickly become waterlogged inside of pots.

, As with a standard garden, you need to plant a kidney bean seed 1 to 1-1/2 inches (2.5 to 3.8 cm) deep. Sow the seed in the middle of the pot.

, The soil should never be allowed to get too soggy since the roots of the plant are easily damaged when waterlogged. As such, you should only give the plants extra water if your area has experienced a drought.


Instead of watering the soil in an effort to keep it continually damp, you should only water it if you check the soil and determine that it has dried out at least a full 1 inch (2.5 cm) down from the surface. You can test it by gently sticking your finger down into the soil and feeling for moisture.

, Even though nitrogen-based fertilizers will make your kidney bean plants look vibrant and leafy, these fertilizers actually do more harm than good since they encourage the plant to send its energy to its leaves rather than its fruits. Large doses of nitrogen will produce an impressively leafy plant that bears very few edible beans.


After the plant gets started, kidney beans actually produce their own nitrogen inside their roots. A fertilizer with high levels of nitrogen will inevitably end up feeding the plant too much nitrogen.
If your plants are suffering and in need of more nutrition, use a small amount of organic fertilizer that does not supply a hearty amount of nitrogen.

, The roots of the plant are quite shallow, so when you dig up weeds, you need to do so carefully to avoid accidentally disturbing or damaging the roots of the kidney bean plant.


Never chop up the weeds around a kidney bean plant using a hoe or trowel. Instead, you should pull the weeds up by hand.
You could also help keep weeds out by spreading a 1- to 2-inch (2.5- to 5-cm) layer of mulch on around the plant after it sprouts. Additionally, mulch provides the extra benefit of maintaining adequate warmth and humidity while preventing pods from rotting once they touch the ground.

, Some garden pests do target kidney beans, and the plant is also vulnerable to a few different diseases. If you run into problems, you may need to apply an appropriate pesticide or fungicide.


Beetles, slugs, cutworms, and leafhoppers will go after the leaves of the plant. These can be removed easily if you check your plants regularly and pick them off as you see them. If this is not an option, though, look for a pesticide that specifically targets these insects.
Aphids may also attack your plant, but these cannot be picked off by hand. Treat the plant with an appropriate pesticide once you spot aphids since these pests can spread bean mosaic virus.
Bean rust is a reddish-brown fungus that can show up in patches on the leaves of a kidney bean plant, and it should be treated with a fungicide as soon as you spot the first signs of it.
Powdery mildew may attack your plant, as well. It will look like a fine white powder. You should treat the plants with a fungicide as soon as possible and reduce the amount of watering you do. Humid conditions produce mildew, so make sure that the plants are only watered at the soil level and not on the leaves.
If squirrels, deer, or rabbits become pests, you can keep them out with fencing or netting.

, Bush varieties should be harvested once at the end of the growing season. Pole varieties can be harvested several times throughout the season, but the largest harvest will usually be at the end of the season.


Depending on the variety you chose, kidney beans should be ready to harvest after 90 to 150 days.
Pole varieties produce a harvest on a regular basis for one to two months.
Adequately mature bean pods will be dry to the touch, and the beans inside the pods will feel very hard.
Check the beans of one pod before you harvest the other pods. You can check to see if the beans are done by carefully biting down on one. If your teeth can dent the bean, then the rest should be allowed to dry for a longer period of time before you harvest and shell them.

, If dropping temperatures or other unfavorable conditions threaten your harvest, you can pull kidney bean plants early and allow the beans to finish drying the rest of the way afterward.


High humidity can also make it difficult to dry the beans on the plant. In this instance, you will need to finish drying them inside, as well.
Remove the plants and hang them upside-down by the root for several days or weeks until the pods seem dry and the beans inside are hard. Make sure that most of the foliage has died before you pull the plants.
Keep the beans in a warm indoor location with lots of circulating air as you dry them.

, After you have plucked the pods from your plant, you will need to break them open and pull out the beans hidden inside. If you allowed the plants to mature correctly, the beans should already be hard and dry.


You can shell a small harvest by hand, but if you have a larger harvest, you may want to shell them in batches. Place the pods in a pillowcase or similar bag. Carefully step on the pods through the pillowcase to crack them open. When done, sift through the pieces to sort out the beans and leave behind the broken pods.

, Place the harvested kidney beans in a jar and store them in a dry, dark location until ready to use.


Dried beans can last up to a year in the right conditions.
For best results, store the beans in airtight jars or bags."

For more flavorful noodles, use chicken broth instead of water.;
, Pour a tablespoon of salt into the boiling water and stir it with a long spoon.Continue stirring until all of the salt has dissolved into the water.


If you’re using chicken broth, don’t add salt. Chicken broth has a high sodium content.

, These noodles can be found in the pasta section of your local grocery store. However, egg noodles are not the same as pasta. These noodles are made from a mixture of wheat or rice flour and eggs, while pasta is made from semolina dough.You can substitute pasta or other noodles for this dish. However, the flavor of the dish will change dramatically.

, Let the noodles sit in the hot water for six to eight minutes, or until they’re soft and flexible.If you want to test the noodles, use tongs to pull a noodle out of the water and let it cool on a paper towel. Eat the noodle to see if it’s ready.


Avoid overcooking the noodles. They will become mushy and flavorless.

, As soon as the noodles are ready, remove the saucepan from the heat. Place a sturdy metal or plastic colander in your sink. Pour the noodles and water into the colander, allowing the water to drain away.


Once the noodles have drained, immediately place them in the serving dish.

, Cut two tablespoons of butter into small pieces. Next, add the pieces of butter to the hot noodles. Use tongs or a large spoon to stir the noodles until the butter has completely melted.


Don’t wait too long to add the butter. If the noodles are cool, the butter won’t melt.

, Once the butter has melted, sprinkle salt and pepper over the noodle dish. Use tongs or a large spoon to toss the noodles, coating each one in seasoning. Taste a noodle to see if you need to add more salt or pepper.


Add less than you think you’ll need. You can always add more salt or pepper.

, Buttered noodles are delicious all on their own. However, many people like to add additional seasonings to take the dish to the next level. For example:


Sprinkle in garlic powder to create a buttery garlic noodle entrée.
Mix in a tablespoon of chopped fresh parsley to give the noodles an herbal flavor.Grate some parmesan over the noodles to give the dish a strong, cheesy kick., Even though the recipe is simple, this noodle dish is decadent and filling. Additionally, the ingredients are inexpensive and easy to find at most grocery stores. Therefore, many people like to serve this dish by itself, without any side dishes or toppings.

A pound of dried soybeans (or other beans)
A colander or strainer
Seasonings to cook the beans, including salt, garlic, onions, bay leaves, oregano, cumin, or whatever else you like. These are optional but tasty!
A stockpot, slow cooker, or pressure cooker
A culture to ferment the beans, which you can purchase online or in health food stores or obtain by straining plain yogurt (this will be discussed more in the next section).;
, You will need a pound or so of dried soybeans (you can use more, but you'll have to adjust your cooking times). Rinse the soybeans thoroughly under running water to remove any dirt or debris. You should also pick through them to remove any shriveled beans, and to make sure there are no rocks or twigs in the beans (small rocks in bags of dried beans are very common, but you must remove them to avoid breaking a tooth).


If you have a colander or sieve, you can put the beans in it and then rinse them directly in the sink. Otherwise, you can put them in a large pot, fill with water, and swish it around, then drain out the water. Do this a few times to rinse thoroughly.

, Beans are hard to cook, and soaking them in water before cooking helps to break down their structure and soften them up for cooking.Place the beans in a large glass bowl and cover the beans with clean, warm water.
Allow the beans to sit in the water for 24 hours. You can change out the water periodically to eliminate some of the starches in the beans.Even if you don't change the water, be sure to add more as needed; the beans will triple in size and soak up a lot of the water you've placed them in.
Drain the beans and rinse once before cooking.

, There are a few methods you can use to cook the beans, depending on what equipment you have handy. Beans can be cooked in a slow cooker, boiled, or cooked in a pressure cooker. You can also add various herbs and spices for flavor;garlic, onions, oregano, and cumin is a delicious combination.


To cook the beans in a slow cooker, place beans in a 3 1/2 quart slow cooker and enough water to cover the beans by two inches. Add a teaspoon of salt if you like. Set the slow cooker to ""low"" and cook for six to eight hours, depending on how firm you want your beans. Add another teaspoon of salt toward the end of cooking time.To boil the beans, place them in a medium to large sized stockpot. Add enough water to cover them by one inch, and turn on the burner to the medium-high setting. When the water comes to a boil, turn the burner down to low so that the rapid boil turns to a gentle simmer (the water should be moving, but just a bit). You can decide if you want to leave the lid on or off of the beans depending on how firm you like the beans; no lid will result in firmer beans, but a lid placed slightly ajar will result in softer beans. Cook for an hour or so until they are tender, and then add salt to taste (usually about two teaspoons for a pound of beans).To cook the beans in a pressure cooker, place beans, a teaspoon each of salt and vegetable oil, and eight cups of water to the pot. Secure the lid tightly and turn heat to high. When it reaches high pressure, turn the heat down to medium low.Cook the soybeans for 22 minutes if you're using an electric pressure cooker, or 20 minutes if it is a stovetop cooker. You'll need to increase your cooking time if you are at an elevation above 2,000 feet above sea level.Whichever method you choose, cook the beans until they are soft and easy to stab with a fork or smash with your fingers (be careful, they're hot!). Don't overcook them, or they will be mushy.

, Before you begin to ferment the beans, you should taste them to know what you're working with.


If they are already well flavored and seasoned from your cooking method, you won't need to add any more seasonings. Otherwise, if they taste bland, you can add seasonings like salt, garlic, herbs, or onions to taste.

, After they have cooked and cooled, you need to add a bacteria culture to the beans to begin the fermentation process. There are several ways to add a culture to your beans. Two convenient options include:


Purchase a dry culture powder. These are sold at health food stores or online (search for ""powdered starter culture for vegetables""). The package will tell you how much to use.
Strain the whey from buttermilk or plain, unflavored and unsweetened yogurt or kefir. The whey is the liquidy part of yogurt, and it contains live bacteria cultures that will ferment the beans. It can take a little while to strain, but it is easy to do: place a coffee filter in a sieve or strainer placed over a large bowl. Pour the yogurt into the strainer and let it sit so that the liquid drains through.Use a tablespoon for every cup of beans you want to ferment., Beans have a skin on the outside that will prevent the culture from getting inside and fermenting the beans, so you have to break the skin open in order for the beans to ferment.You can mash the beans if you want a mashed texture. If you want to keep the beans mostly intact you can bruise them by stirring vigorously. , In order for the culture to ferment the beans, the bacteria has to have a chance to grow. That means you have to leave them in a warm environment for a few days while the culture works its magic.


Cover the container tightly so that no dust or bugs gets inside.
Place the beans in a warm place--the top of a radiator, a warm sunny window, or the top of a clothes dryer are all good places.
Leave the beans to ferment for several days, checking on them often.

, As the beans ferment over the next few days, gasses will build up inside from the chemical reaction going on.


Open the lid slightly once a day to release excess gasses and prevent a blowout., In a tightly sealed container, fermented foods can last a long time, since the fermentation process preserves the food.It's possible that fermented beans would still be good a year later, but to be on the safe side, eat the beans with a month.During the first month of storage, keep an eye on the package to be sure that it doesn't build up more gasses and explode. You might need to ""burp"" the container that the beans are in by opening it a bit and then re-closing it., Fermented soybeans can be a main entrée when served with rice.


This is the traditional way to use fermented beans in Japan, where they are called natto. Eat natto over hot rice with soy sauce.

, Especially if you have cooked them with a lot of seasoning, fermented beans are a great way to add tang and saltiness to many dishes.


In China, fermented black beans are eaten as a condiment known as dou chi in Mandarin. You can braise them with meat or use them in sauces or stir fries."

At most grocery stores, dried soybeans will be sold in the bulk food sections. They may also be available with the rice and/or pasta.;
,


Check the soybeans for signs of damage or disease before using them in your recipe. Pour them into a large, flat baking sheet, and inspect all beans. Any soybeans which appear discolored or are misshapen should be removed and discarded. Also pick out any small pieces of pod or debris that may have been included.

,


Pour the soybeans into a large colander, and rinse with cool water. Make sure all beans have been rinsed to remove any dirt, dust, or debris.

,


Dried soybeans must be soaked overnight before they can be used in cooking or baking. Place the rinsed soybeans into a large bowl, and cover with enough water to submerge all of the beans. You may want to consider covering the bowl with a sheet of plastic wrap to prevent disaster if the bowl is accidentally knocked or nudged.

,


Drain the soybeans from the water they have soaked in, and place them in a large, sturdy pot. Pour water into the pan, making sure to again add enough water to completely cover the soybeans.

, Place the pot over high heat, and bring the water to a boil. Once the water has come to a boil, reduce heat to a simmer, and continue cooking the beans for 2 to 3 hours.

, During the boiling, the hulls of the soybeans will fall off. Use a large slotted spoon to carefully remove these hulls from the water. You will need to monitor the soybeans on a regular basis to remove any additional hulls which have fallen off, and to stir the beans.,


Once the soybeans are tender, remove them from the heat source. Allow them to cool to room temperature, skimming off any hulls which may remain at the top of the water. Drain the water from the soybeans.

If desired, add about a pinch of salt per cup of rice.Use oil or butter to soften the rice and add flavor. Add a half a tablespoon of butter or oil per cup of rice.Get creative. Add some of your other favorite seeds and spices if you feel inspired. This will definitely change the flavor of your rice, so consult with others before you go too far.;
, Use about a half a cup of rice per person. Measure it, and put it in the pot. The pot should be large enough so the rice fills it to about 1/4 of the entire pot. It is important to have the right sized pot, as a larger pot will alter the rice-to-water ratio, and a smaller pot could overflow., Not everyone finds this necessary. It is said that a good rinse will remove extra starch from the rice and avoid clumping. Fill the pan with water until the water completely covers all of the rice. Stir with a spoon. Pour the cloudy water back in the sink. Use a spoon or strainer to avoid pouring the rice out too.

, Using the same cup that you used for the rice, add the necessary amount of water. Generally, the ratio of water to rice is two to one. For example, if you are cooking one cup of rice, add two cups of water. This may vary, however, by the type of rice you are using. Remember that too much water will make the rice too soft and not enough water will leave it hard. Ask someone or consult the packaging if you are unsure.Brown rice varieties will need about 2 ½ cups of water per one cup of rice.
Wild rice can take up to four cups of water per one cup of rice.

, Add the pinch of salt, oil, or butter.

, Keep a close eye on the rice. It can burn quickly on high heat., Let the rice simmer for about ten minutes with the lid on. Quickly check for steam holes in the rice. This is a good sign. It means that the rice is absorbing the water. Don't take the lid off for too long-- you need the steam to cook the rice!

, Let the rice stand on the same burner with the lid on for 10 minutes. This is important because the steam will finish cooking the rice. , Serve as desired.

Decide on the type of rice you want to use for your meal.,
Choose a long-grain rice.,
Choose a medium-grain.,

Use a specialty rice.,
Ask for advice.,
Purchase the rice you desire.",How to Cook Rice in a Pot2," There are several different types of rice. Choose the rice that best fits your recipe. , This will do for average recipes that are not rice-centered. South Asian inspired dishes often call for long-grain rice as well.


American long-grain white or brown rice varieties are the most common in the United States. White rice is fluffy and dry. Brown rice tends to be more chewy and grainy in flavor.
Jasmine rice is soft with a slight floral aroma. It is used in a lot of Southeast Asian cooking.
Basmati rice has a nutty flavor. It is often used in south-central Asian cooking. , This type of rice usually absorbs a lot of water and can be quite sticky.


Japanese-style rice is firm and often sticky. It is used in a variety of Japanese dishes.
Bomba rice is also sticky and absorbs a lot of water. It is commonly used in Spanish dishes like paella. , Short-grain rice can become sticky, and even creamy, with the right amount of water. Try these for a more soupy rice dish.


Arborio rice is quite sticky and creamy. It is used to make Italian dishes like risotto.
Short-grain brown rice can also be quite sticky and chewy in flavor. , Mix a specialty rice with a typical long-grain rice to add color, flavor, and texture to your meal.


Wehani rice is an American whole grain option. It is reddish-brown in color and mixes well with other rices.
Chinese black rice is also a whole grain rice. Unlike other short-grain rices it is firm and non-sticky. It is a deep purple color when cooked.
Wild rice cooks firm and chewy with a grainy flavor. It is long-grain and a dark brown color when cooked. , Someone in the supermarket or even a friend may be able to help you decide on the right type of rice for your meal. If you don’t have a specific dish in mind, you may enjoy trying a new type of rice just for fun!

, American long-grain rice is quite common and can be easily found in supermarkets. For specialty rice, try going to health food stores or stores that cater to specific parts of the world. "

Peel and slice a fresh, washed cucumber.,
Drain the liquid from the cucumber slices.,
Make your cream cheese spread.,
Spread the cream cheese mixture on both pieces of bread.,
Sandwich the cucumbers between the bread slices.,
Remove the crusts and cut the sandwich into small pieces.",How to Make Cucumber Sandwiches1," Traditionally, cucumber sandwiches use thin, crisp slices of cucumber with the dark green peel removed. Use a potato peeler or a small, sharp knife to shave off the peel.


You can use thick slices or leave the peel on if you wish — it's up to you. The peel won't hurt you, but its texture is slightly tougher than the flesh of the cucumber.;
, Drop the slices into a colander in the sink. Let them drain for about 10 minutes, then remove them to a plate and pat dry with a paper towel.


Getting your cucumber slices as crisp and dry (on the outside) as possible is important for a good sandwich. Soft, wet slices of cucumber are exactly what you don't want — they'll leave you with a dull, soggy mess.

, In a small bowl, combine cream cheese, Worcestershire sauce, mayonnaise, garlic powder, and onion salt. Stir well until smooth and uniform.

, You can be as generous as you like with the spread.


One of the nice things about putting the spread on both pieces of bread is that it traps the moisture from the cucumber slices in the middle of the sandwich so that they don't make the bread soggy. This is something you can do with many fat or oil-based spreads (like peanut butter)., Lay down a few slices of cucumber on one of the pieces of bread. You can be generous here — you want a little cucumber in every bite. When you're done, lay the other piece of bread on top (spread facing down, of course).


Congratulations — you just made your first cucumber sandwich!

, There's no ""wrong"" way to eat a cucumber sandwich, but in England, the sandwich is often eaten in small, crust-less squares, triangles, or fingers. Cut the sandwich how you wish (or leave it how it is) and serve immediately.If you're serving guests, repeat the steps above for more sandwiches, working through your loaf of bread. If needed, make more spread or cut more cucumber slices.
In the section below, you'll learn a few tips for ""spicing up"" the basic cucumber sandwich recipe. Use these variations as you wish — you may even want to try serving a platter with every different kind of sandwich for variety's sake.

Sprinkle dill over the cucumbers for a subtly fresh flavor.,
Use lemon pepper for a tangy twist.,
Add Italian-style salad dressing for savory flavor.,
Use pumpernickel rye bread for a traditional combination.,
Try with chopped mint for added coolness.,
Try the sandwich with Marmite spread (if you're bold).",How to Make Cucumber Sandwiches2," Dill pairs excellently with the smooth, subdued flavors of a typical cucumber sandwich. After all, it's a crucial ingredient in dill pickles (which are made from cucumbers). A pinch or two of dried dill sprinkled into the sandwich will add some of this unique pickle-y flavor to the dish.


For an eye-catching presentation, try serving the sandwiches open-faced (without the top piece of bread) and laying a single sprig of fresh dill across the cucumber slices.It'll look gorgeous (and taste great, too).

, With their crisp, cool taste and texture, cucumber sandwiches are the perfect summertime snack. Adding a little lemon pepper to the spread or sprinkling it over the cucumber slices gives your sandwiches just a hint of sourness, making them even more refreshing.


Lemon pepper can be bought for fairly cheap at most mid- to high-end grocery stores. You can also make it yourself from lemon zest, salt, and pepper., If the standard cucumber sandwich doesn't have quite enough flavor for you, try adding a splash of your favorite Italian salad dressing as you're mixing the spread. This will give it a slightly more savory, substantial flavor without ruining the overall smoothness that makes a cucumber sandwich so great.

, Cucumber sandwiches are great with any good-quality white or wheat bread, but for an old-fashioned taste, use pumpernickel rye. Its heavy, sweet flavor contrasts well with the light, crisp bitterness of the cucumbers and the smoothness of the spread.


Rye breads aren't always sold at neighborhood grocery stores, but you should be able to find it at many higher-end locations.

, Cucumbers are cool and crisp on their own, but with the added flavor and aroma of fresh mint, they're practically ice cold. Chop a few sprigs of mint and sprinkle them over the cucumbers or add them on top of each sandwich as a garnish.


If you can, chop the mint into small, fine pieces. It's a little difficult to chew through whole mint leaves when they're in the middle of a sandwich.

, Marmite is an infamous, strong-flavored spread made from yeast extract that is popular in the U.K. and some Commonwealth countries.Some people love it and some people hate it — it doesn't leave many tasters without a strong opinion. People who enjoy Marmite have been known to add it to cucumber sandwiches.If you want to try it but you've never had Marmite before, using a small amount is recommended.


Marmite is often described as having a very salty taste with fishy qualities. It also has a strong odor that, to some, is unappealing."

Instead of slicing the jicama, scoop out the middle and then throw the taco ingredients in the middle., Wash, peel and slice up a cucumber. You should cut the cucumber into quarter inch slices. Replace each piece of bread with one piece of cucumber. Since there is a fairly small surface area, you may need to make a couple cucumber sandwiches for each of the bread sandwiches you had planned to make., Decide which protein you want to use for your breadless sandwich and then prepare it. If you use cooked, shredded chicken breast, you can go right ahead and throw it on your breadless wrap. If you choose a can of tuna or salmon, you will need to drain it and then mix it with a teaspoon of mayonnaise, salt and pepper. Beans will need to be drained, and then can be added directly to the wrap., Remember that most substitutes for bread will absorb less moisture, so you may need to adjust your usual condiment choices. For instance, you may want to avoid condiments with a lot of water content, since they may make a bit of a mess. Choose thicker condiments like tahini, as opposed to watery condiments like greek dressing., You will want to be a bit conservative in terms of the amount of ingredients you throw inside, which should be proportional to the size of the leaf. Start by throwing in your protein. Next, choose a crunchy vegetable or seed such as shredded carrots, slivered almonds, sprouts, cucumber sticks or shredded carrots. Then, you will want something creamy such as yogurt or tahini. Finally, throw in something to boost the flavor a bit such as mustard or hot sauce. Finally, roll up the wrap like you would a burrito. Roll it horizontally, moving away from you."

Put together the sandwiches.",How to Make Breadless Sandwiches3," You have two options for preparing the cucumbers, which will be used instead of the bread for this tuna sandwich. If you are making appetizer sandwiches, you should simply peel and then slice the cucumber horizontally, into quarter inch slices. This option will give you a greater number of smaller tuna sandwiches. Alternately, if you want to make a sub style tuna sandwich, you can halve the cucumbers lengthwise. Then, scoop out the seeds and flesh to make little boats, where you will put the tuna mix. Poke the inside a bit with a fork, so that the cucumber absorbs more of the flavor., In a medium sized bowl, whisk the mustard, vinegar, salt and black pepper. Then, slowly whisk in the olive oil. Finally, pour the vinaigrette onto the cucumber., Start by draining the tuna fish. Rinse it well with cold water, and then put it aside. In a small bowl, whisk the mayonnaise, yogurt, dill, celery leaves, scallions, celery, lemon zest, quarter teaspoon of salt and a pinch of black pepper. Throw the tuna into the bowl and then mix to combine all ingredients., If you are making the appetizer version, place a dollop of tuna mix and then a few sprouts on top of each slice of cucumber.

Use different greens.,
Forget the greens completely.,
Add a base of healthy carbs.,
Turn your favorite foods into a salad.",How to Make a Salad More Satisfying1," If you use the same greens as the base of your salad, you can get bored quickly. The taste may also stop satisfying you. Instead of using iceberg or Romaine lettuce all the time, try different types of greens for the base of your salad.Try Bibb lettuce, green lettuce, or red lettuce, if you want to eat lettuce.
Get rid of the lettuce completely and try another green, like arugula, dandelion leaves, kale, spinach, or collards. Try this kale salad recipe.
Try cabbage-based salads instead of lettuce.
Go for a mix. Put cabbage, lettuce, kale, arugula, spring mix, mesclun mix, or any other green together in the same salad.;
, Greens as the base of the salad isn’t the only way you can eat a salad. You can try making the base of your salad out of beets, cucumber, or green beans. You can mix any vegetables together you want for your meal.Try a salad made mostly of tomatoes, Brussels sprouts, carrots, or asparagus.
Consider this Thai tomato and green bean salad or this chickpea and feta salad.


, Including healthy carbs can help your salad be more filling and satisfying. Healthy carbs can also provide additional nutrients to the already healthy salad. Try making your base out of grains or sweet potatoes.You can use quinoa, chickpeas, brown rice, farro, or barley. Try this quinoa and vegetable salad, this chickpea and red bean salad, or this quinoa chicken salad.

, You can make your salads more interesting by taking your favorite foods, like hamburgers and tacos, and turning them into salads. You get the same base taste through a salad without the extra carbs and calories.For example, you can make a deconstructed hamburger salad. Cook the hamburger meat together in one pan instead of splitting it up into patties. You can also sauté mushrooms or onions to add to it. Make a base salad with any greens of your choice. Top the salad with the hamburger meat, cheese, mushrooms, avocado, onions, and condiments, just like a hamburger.
A taco salad can be fixed similarly. Make your taco meat out of hamburger, ground turkey, chicken breast, fish, shrimp, or any other meat you like on tacos. Make a bed of greens of your choice. Top the greens with taco meat, cheese, avocado, corn, black beans, black olives, tomatoes, salsa, cilantro, sour cream, or any other taco topping you enjoy.

Also, put in one or two teaspoons of lemon juice, half a teaspoon of cumin powder, and half a teaspoon of salt. Add some water and blend or grind the mixture until it is smooth. Check it for taste and add more salt or lemon juice if needed.;
, Cook it until it is easily pierced with a fork, but not completely soft. Once done, drain off the boiling water and run cool water over the potato to cool it down. Then cut it into round slices.

, Cut the onion into thin, round slices. The tomato and cucumber may be diced into small chunks. It doesn't matter too much how they are sliced, so long as the pieces are small.

, You can use wheat or white bread for this sandwich. Lay out your bread slices and slather each with butter. Make sure to butter them evenly. Next, spread the chutney on top of the butter. Doing it in this order helps keep the bread from getting soggy.

, On one side of the slices of bread, add some of the vegetables that you cut up earlier. Sprinkle one to two pinches of chaat masala and cumin powder over the each veggie as you add it. Cover them with the other bread slices and generously spread butter over the top.


Chaat masala is a spice used in many types of Indian cooking. If it's not available at your local grocery store, look for it in Indian or Middle Eastern food stores.

, Make sure that the buttered side is facing down, and then butter the other side. Let the sandwiches grill for two to three minutes, or until the bread becomes crisp.

Top the salad with interesting flavors.,
Add avocado.,
Top the salad with fruit.,
Include sources of protein.,
Sprinkle cheese on top.,
Change the salad dressing.",How to Make a Salad More Satisfying2," Maybe you think croutons or bacon bits are the only things you can place on top of a salad. Actually, you can throw just about anything on top of a salad. Try roasted nuts and seeds, or raw onions, carrots, or red cabbage for some extra crunch.Try warm, cooked ingredients, like grilled onions and eggplant. Sauteed vegetables can also make a nice salad.

, Avocado is a healthy fat that can leave you feeling fuller. It is also a delicious addition to a salad. It provides a smooth, creamy texture for the salad. Chop up chunks of avocado and sprinkle them on top of your salad.You can also try mashing the avocado and mixing it with the base for a creamier salad.

, Salads don’t have to be all savory or vegetables. A little bit of sweetness can totally change your salad experience. Fruit is a perfect addition to a salad that people often forget. Try putting your favorite fruits or no-sugar added dried fruits on your next salad.For example, apples, berries, pears, orange or grapefruit slices, grapes, or pomegranates make great additions to salads.
Try dried fruit, such as raisins, figs, dates, cranberries, or apricots, or canned fruit such as mandarin oranges.

, You can add protein on top of your salads for extra taste and nutrition. Sprinkle cut up pieces of chicken breast, steak, shrimp, ground beef, or salmon on the salad. You may want to add eggs or ham.Adding leftovers from the night before can be a good way to eat the rest of your food and easily add meat to the salad.
Try a salad with a base of kale, tomatoes, chickpeas, apples, and avocado with a vinaigrette. Add roasted chicken breast to it or baked salmon from the night before. Or put together arugula with feta, pears, nuts, black olives, and steak.

, Cheese can help enhance the flavors of the salad. Any cheese will be good on a salad. You can use shredded cheese, small cubes, or thin slices. Throw on your favorite cheese or try to match flavors.For example, pear goes well with gorgonzola or havarti cheese. Apples go well with cheddar, edam, and muenster. Grapes also go well with münster and edam., Switching out your dressing may be a way to make your salad taste more satisfying. You can try olive oil and vinegar, a raspberry vinaigrette, or switching to a ginger-based or spicy dressing. Try a new flavor palate to make the dressing more appealing.Be careful with salad dressings. Make sure to read the label carefully. Salad dressings can be full of calories, fat, and carbs, and they can also be packed with unhealthy artificial ingredients. Consider making your own salad dressing, like Italian, a Vinaigrette or even Avocado Ranch.

Add ingredients you enjoy eating.,
Place different textures in the salad.,
Cut the ingredients very small.,
Add the dressing last.,
Grow your own vegetables in your garden.",How to Make a Salad More Satisfying3," One reason people don’t like eating salads is because they don’t like the taste. Perhaps you hate iceberg lettuce, carrots, or tomatoes. If that’s so, don’t put them in your salad. Instead, include ingredients you enjoy eating.For example, if you like kale, green beans, steak, avocado, and feta cheese, toss all of them together in a salad.

, Combine different ingredients in the salad to get varied textures. You want a bit of crunchiness, crispiness, chewiness, and softness. These differences can help keep your salad interesting and satisfied.You can get crunch by adding roasted nuts and seeds, croutons, or pita chips. Crispy textures can be from sliced radishes, raw peppers, or apple. Chunks of meat and dried fruit can provide a chewy texture, while avocado or egg can be soft.

, Salads can be easier to eat when you cut the pieces very small so you don’t have huge chunks of vegetables that are awkward to eat. Cutting the ingredients very small also helps the ingredients mix together so the flavors can meld.For example, large chunks of carrot are awkward to place on forks; however, shredded carrots can be easier to eat and incorporate into the overall salad.

, Consider keeping your dressing in a separate container until you are ready to eat the dressing. If you mix your salad with dressing in the morning, your salad may be soggy and limp by lunch time. Instead, toss the salad lightly with dressing right before you are ready to eat it.

, Another way to feel personal satisfaction from your salad is to grow the ingredients yourself. You can grow lettuce or kale, tomatoes, cucumbers, peppers, and other ingredients in your backyard garden. Your salad may taste better when you put the time and work into growing the ingredients yourself.

",How to Make a Subway Club," It's Subway policy.;
,,, If they can't decide, recommend the white bread.

, For the sake of this article, we'll assume they chose the Subway Club.

, However, do not cut through the whole piece of bread; Leave a slight hinge. This allows the meats and vegetables to sit easily on the bread and close much easier.

, Make sure the turkey and ham are folded horizontally, and all of the meat is out of the hinge. This allows for a better close.

, Each Subway has different choices, but for the sake of this article, we'll say they chose the American cheese.

, Make sure the tips of the American cheese are pointing in opposite directions as you place them along the sub.

, It's Subway policy to ask if the customer would like their sub toasted, but let's say they chose not to toast their sub.

, Again, for the sake of this article, we'll say they only want lettuce and tomatoes. If the customer wants more of a vegetable, always give them more.

, Place it across the bottom half of the bread from end to end.

,, For the sake of this article we'll say they only want oil, salt, and pepper.

, Unless the customer specifies how much they want, quickly pass over them from end to end at least 3 times.

, Subway has a salt and pepper mix shaker as well as separate shakers for both seasonings. Pass over the vegetables at least 2-3 times, depending on how much the customer wants.

Next, set a large baking sheet on rack so it will preheat along with the oven.To make cleanup easier, you can line the baking sheet with parchment paper or foil in case any of the cheese drips out of the melt as it bakes.;
, In order to ensure that the oven is hot enough to bake the veggie melt, it’s important to preheat it. Set the temperature to 450 degrees Fahrenheit (230 degrees Celsius) and allow it to fully preheat., Add ¼ cup (58 g) of mayonnaise and 3 tablespoons (54 g) of whole-grain mustard to a small bowl. Whisk the two together until they are fully blended, and set the mixture aside.You can prepare the mayonnaise-spread up to a day in advance. Cover and store it in the refrigerator.
Instead of the mayonnaise-mustard spread, you can use either the mayo or mustard separately if you prefer.
You can also use an entirely different spread or dressing for the sandwich if you prefer. Pesto, balsamic vinaigrette, or even jalapeno cream cheese are tasty options.

, Add 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of olive oil to a large skillet. Heat it on medium until the oil begins to shimmer, which should take approximately 3 to 5 minutes.If you prefer, you can roasts the veggies for the melt instead of sauteing them. Toss them with olive oil and roast them on a baking sheet at 450 degrees Fahrenheit (230 degrees Celsius) for approximately 10 minutes, or until they are tender.

, Once the oil is hot, add half a small onion that’s been diced to the skillet. Let the onion cook for 3 to 4 minutes, or until it softens.Be sure to stir the onion occasionally as it heats to ensure that it cooks evenly.

, When the onion is soft, add 8 ounces (224 g) of asparagus that’s been cut into 2-inch (5-cm) pieces, 8 ounces (240 g) of fresh mushrooms that have been thinly sliced, and a medium red bell pepper that’s been cut into ½-inch wide strips to the pan. Season the mixture with ½ teaspoon (3 g) of kosher salt and ¼ teaspoon (½ g) of freshly ground black pepper, and stir well to ensure that the ingredients are fully combined.You can use substitute with or add your favorite veggies to the melt. Some other options that work well include chopped broccoli, plum tomatoes, and fennel.

, After you’ve mixed and seasoned the veggies in the skillet, let them cook for approximately 5 minutes, or until they become tender. Stir the veggies occasionally to ensure that they cook evenly., When the veggies are tender, add a minced clove of garlic and 3 cups (300 g) of shredded kale leaves. Saute the mixture for 2 to 3 minutes or until the kale wilts, and remove the pan from the heat.You can substitute other greens, such as spinach or arugula, for the kale.
You can saute the veggies up to a day in advance. Place them in a covered container and store in the refrigerator, but bring them to room temperature before assembling the sandwiches.

, To assemble the sandwiches, lay out 8 pieces of your favorite bread. Use 2 tablespoons (28 g) of softened, unsalted butter to cover one side of each piece.Some breads that work well for the veggie melts include sourdough, whole-grain, and Italian. For the best results, though, make sure the slices are at least ½-inch (13-mm) thick.

, After you’ve applied the butter to one side of the bread slices, turn them over. Add the mayonnaise-mustard spread that you made earlier to the other side, and place the bread, butter-side down, onto the preheated baking sheet from the oven.Make sure to use a potholder or oven mitt to remove the baking sheet from the oven because it will be extremely hot.

, After you’ve set the bread slices out on the baking sheet, divide the veggie mixture between four slices of the bread. Spread them in an even layer over the mayo-mustard mixture so the vegetables don’t fall out the sides.You should have four slices of bread that don’t have any veggie topping on them when you’re done.

, Once the veggies are spread on the bread slices, divide 1 ½ cups (170 g) of grated Gouda cheese between the covered slices. Sprinkle the cheese evenly over the veggies so they’re all covered.You can substitute another cheese for the Gouda if you prefer. Mozzarella, Swiss, and Havarti are tasty options.

, After you’ve layered the veggies and cheese on half of the bread, return the baking sheet to the preheated oven. Allow the sandwiches to bake for 5 to 8 minutes, or until the cheese melts and is bubbling.If you prefer, you can grill the sandwiches in a nonstick saute pan. Put both pieces of bread together first, and then heat them on medium for 2 to 3 minutes on each side, or until the cheese melts.

, Once the sandwiches are finished baking, transfer the veggie and cheese-covered pieces to a cutting board. Place the untopped slices of bread on top of them and press gently to close the sandwiches.When you place the untopped bread slices over the topped pieces, make sure to set them down with the mayo-mustard spread-covered side face down.

, When the sandwiches are closed, use a sharp knife to cut each one in half. Place the melts on individual plates, and serve.The veggie melts pair very well with soups, especially tomato.

To pull it off, however, takes good kitchen timing and pre-planning. Instead of rushing to chop things and add them as they cook, get in the habit of preparing the big things ahead of time. Jambalaya can use any combination of meats you like, as long as they are pre-cut:



Chicken should be cut in slightly large than bite-size pieces

Sausage should be cut into round discs, roughly 1/4-1/2 inch thick.

Smoked ham should be cut into bite-sized cubes.

Shrimp should be thawed, peeled, and deveined.;
, Onions, celery, and green pepper form the ""Holy Trinity"" of Cajun food, and these three aromatic ingredients are at the base of almost every Cajun dish. While you can adjust the ratios however you see fit, most Cajun cooks end up with roughly two parts onion and one part celery and bell pepper. Chop them into pieces no bigger than a half inch.The Holy Trinity can be adjusted to taste, usually adding more onion instead of celery or pepper. More onions usually lead to a richer dish.
In a pinch, shallots can be substituted for onions and red and yellow peppers for green. This usually leads to a slightly sweeter Jambalaya., Make sure you have a nice large sauce pot, preferably with a thick-bottom.You don't want the oil to start smoking, just shimmering lightly, as if a quiet lake is being disturbed by a light breeze.

, Salt should be added in small doses while you cook, as it helps unlock the natural flavors of your ingredients as you're cooking.


You want these vegetables to cook until the onions are slightly see through, or ""translucent."" That said, you should move to the next step while they heat up to stay on time., Now that your base is completed, you can start making it your own. Chop up 1-2 jalapeno peppers and 3-5 cloves of garlic, depending on taste. Cut them up about half as large as the vegetables above, and toss them into the hot oil to cook for 1-2 minutes.


Try to time your additions so that the onions, peppers, and celery finish cooking (remember -- translucent) at the same time as the finely chopped garlic and peppers.
The seeds of jalapenos are the hottest part, so you can scrape a few of them out if you're worried about it being too hot., Toss in everything but the prawns and let them cook until they are almost finished. Use the chicken as your marker, as it takes longer than the rest and it is easiest to see when it is finished cooking (no more pink flesh). This should take roughly 5-7 minutes, depending on how small you cut the meat.If you have raw, unsmoked sausage, you might consider partially cooking it first. When it is still a little pink, remove it and cook the Holy Trinity in the remaining sausage fat, then add the meat back in with the chicken.
If things are sticking, add an extra 1/2 tablespoon of oil, let it heat for 10 seconds or so, then add in the meat.

, You can add it cold, but this literally halts the cooking process until the pot can get back up to heat. It is best to preheat your broth first.

, A simmer is when the bubbles are constantly breaking the surface of the liquid. If you preheated the stock, this should happen quickly. Use your wooden spoon to scrape up any bits stuck to the bottom when the liquid hits -- these give the jambalaya it's appealingly dark, rich color.

, This is where you really can make the jambalaya your own, customizing it to your taste buds and preferences. The following spices can all be mixed and matched in any quantities you want, but the basics illustrated here are a good place to start. If you're really lost, try purchasing a Cajun or Creole spice blend from your local supermarket instead:


1/2 teaspoon black, white, red, and/or cayenne pepper (heavier on the cayenne)
1 bay leaf
1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika
1 teaspoon thyme and/or Oregano
1/2 teaspoon cracked red pepper flakes
A pinch more salt
1/2 teaspoon garlic and/or onion powder, Check the rice starting at 20-25 minutes, stirring every few minutes to prevent the rice on the bottom from burning. As it cooks, the rice should absorb all of the liquid, leaving you with a big, creamy, and flavorful rice dish. If the rice isn't cooked completely and the water is all gone, add another 1/2 cup or so to finish cooking.


Try not to remove the lid for long, as this releases the steam needed to cook the rice. Give it a quick stir every 3-4 minutes and then get the lid right back on., As the rice is getting done, stir in the shrimp and let them cook until they are pink throughout and completely cooked. Use this time to test the spices as well, adding a dash of salt and some seasoning if you desire it.

, Most Cajun dishes will come with all three options on the table. Some people even love a bright, acidic punch of a lemon slice. Of course, this is all up to your personal preference, but know that these ingredients will certainly up the ""authentic"" factor of your dish."

Focus on fresh ingredients.,
Make your own broth.,
Purchase healthy brands.",How to Make Healthier Soups1," Ultimately, the quality of a soup is determined by the quality of ingredients you use to make it. Thus, you should use fresh ingredients whenever you can. By using fresh ingredients, you’ll make sure that your soup tastes good and is free of additives that could harm your health.


If you can’t find fresh vegetables or other ingredients, use frozen ingredients.
While canned products may be okay, they often contain added sodium and preservatives. In addition, some canned food may be contaminated with the carcinogen, BPA.Beans and lentils are a great way to make a more filling soup. Used dried beans instead of canned. Soak them overnight before adding them to your soup.;
, By making ingredients from scratch, you’ll make sure that you know what will be in your soup and that it is healthy. Avoid store-bought broth. Store-bought broth is often high in sodium, has preservatives, and other additives that could be harmful to your health.To make your own vegetable broth, simply cook a mixture of vegetables for 5 minutes, add water and simmer them for 45 minutes. Strain your broth at the end.
To make a basic beef broth, cover four pounds of beef marrow and knuckle bones with twelve cups of water. Add onions, celery, and herbs if desired. Bring to a boil before reducing the heat. Simmer for up to twenty four hours. Strain at the end.To make chicken broth, put four pounds of chicken in a large pot with about four quarts of water. Simmer it for up to two hours before straining.

, While it may be tempting to buy the most common and cheapest products to use in your soup, you should instead buy the healthiest products possible. Focus on natural, healthy, or green product lines for anything you use in your soup.


You may have to visit specialty health stores, or grocery stores like Whole Foods, Earth Fare, or Fresh Market for a larger diversity of healthy products.
Review the ingredient list of any product your purchase. For example, if you’re buying vegetable broth to put in your soup, look at the ingredients to see what sort of preservatives and additives are present. The more names you don’t recognize or can’t understand, the more you should stay away from the item.
Look at the nutritional information of a product. Buy products that are low in saturated fat, trans fat, and sodium."
"
Avoid putting too much salt.,
Use oil sparingly.,
Limit dairy products when you can.",How to Make Healthier Soups2," Using too much salt is a common mistake that many people make when making soups. Although you might think that you’re improving the soup, you’re substantially increasing the sodium content and negatively impacting your health. Read the label of any pre-made ingredients, like broth, before you add them to a soup.


Calculate the sodium content of any item you use in your soup into the overall amount of sodium in the soup.
Over consumption of sodium could create high blood pressure. If you have heart disease, it could worsen your condition.
The American Heart Association suggests that adults consume no more than 2,300 milligrams of sodium every day. In addition, some doctors recommend that adults limit their consumption to 1,500 milligrams a day.
To give you an idea, 1 teaspoon of salt has 2,300 milligrams of sodium.
Sodium is present in almost all foods, especially processed foods such as canned soup and pre-made broth. Be aware of this when making your own soups., When people make soup, they often use oil liberally. However, depending on the oil you use and the amount you use, this could turn a healthy soup into an unhealthy soup as cooking oil often contain high levels of fat. Use as little oil as possible.


Some decent cooking oils you can use include: canola, corn, olive, peanut, safflower, soybean, and sunflower.
Avoid oils that have more than 4 grams (0.14 oz) of saturated fat in each tablespoon.
Stay away from oils that have partially hydrogenated oil or trans-fat., While dairy products can enrich a soup and add a creamy quality, you should limit the amount you put into a soup. Ultimately, by limiting the amount of dairy in your soup you’ll also decrease the amount of fat and cholesterol in it. Reduce or cut the amount of dairy in your recipe, if possible.


For instance, if your recipe calls for 4 tablespoons of butter, only use 2 or 3.
For creamy soups, consider substituting dairy products for soymilk, cashew milk, or even pureed cauliflower or other vegetables.
Avoid using recipes that call for a lot of dairy products. Instead, focus on recipes that have minimum amounts of dairy."
"
Opt for veggie-rich recipes.,
Avoid cream-based soups and chowders.,
Pick vegetable broth instead of meat broth.",How to Make Healthier Soups3," Perhaps the easiest way to pick healthy soups are to pick those that include vegetables as the main ingredient. Veggie-rich soups will often be low in fat and cholesterol but high in nutritional value.


Many veggie-rich soups may have a simpler ingredient list than other soups. For instance, you’ll see a wide variety of vegetables such as celery, peas, and carrots as ingredients.
Try Asian-oriented soups like vegetable hot and sour soup or vegetable Thai noodle soup.
Think about vegetable soups that are season appropriate. For instance, buy or prepare a squash soup or bean and mushroom soup in the autumn or winter. In summer or spring, make gazpacho., Cream-based soups and chowders are full of dairy products, and thus, high in fat and cholesterol. As a result, you should stay away from these soups when you can.


Stay away from cream of broccoli, cream of mushroom, and cream of corn.
Although it might be tasty, don’t eat New England Clam Chowder if you are counting calories.
Look for vegan “cream of” soups. You’ll be surprised to find a decent selection of vegan alternatives that use cauliflower, peas, broccoli, or other ingredients to create creamy soups.
Focus on tomato-based chowders like Manhattan Clam Chowder., A simple way to alter a recipe to make it healthier is by substituting vegetable broth for meat broth. By eliminating meat broth, you’ll decrease the cholesterol and maybe even the saturated fat content of the soup. In the end, you’ll be able to make your favorite recipe just a bit healthier.


Make your own vegetable broth using your favorite vegetables.
Use store-vegetable broth to substitute for meat both. For instance, use vegetable broth instead of chicken or beef broth.
If you must use meat-based broth, focus on chicken broth. It will likely have less saturated fat and lower cholesterol."

Keep cooking the mixture until the chicken is completely cooked.You'll probably need to cook the chicken for about 8 to 10 minutes.
If there's a lot of grease in the pan, consider draining it before you add the chicken.

, Open two (15 ounce or 425 g) cans of white kidney beans. Rinse and drain the beans before adding them to the soup pot. You'll also need to stir in two (14.5 ounce or 428 ml) cans of chicken broth, two (14.5 ounce or 411 g) cans of diced tomatoes, 1 teaspoon of dried basil, and 1 teaspoon of dried oregano.If you don't have white kidney beans, you can also use cannellini beans.

, Turn the heat up to high, so the soup begins to boil. Turn the heat back down to medium-low, so the soup just bubbles gently. Simmer the soup for about 10 minutes. This will develop the flavors.Keep the lid off while the soup simmers. This will thicken the soup a little.

, Measure out 6 cups (1.35 kg) of fresh spinach leaves and roughly chop them. Stir this into the soup and heat it for a few minutes, so the spinach wilts a little.

Before getting started, you'll need to figure out what kind of soup you're looking to make. Is it a hearty vegetable soup? A mineral-rich bone broth? Having a good idea of where to go early on will take the stress and guesswork out of the process later on.;
, While this is by no means an exhaustive list of recommended ingredients to have in your homemade soup, it's a good place to start.


Potatoes, peas, kidney beans and carrots are great if you're looking to make a hearty broth. Other vegetables like roughly chopped celery, tomatoes and corn can give the soup a richer taste.
Aromatics like onions and garlic are highly recommended for their flavour. The smaller you cut them, the more their flavour will inform the rest of the broth.
Noodles are great in soups as they tend to embody the flavour of the stock. They're an especially effective addition to a soup that's otherwise lacking in solid substance.
If you choose to have meat in your soup, make sure it is pre-cooked, and kept in small enough pieces. You'll also want to make sure the type of meat complements your soup stock. If you're using beans, make sure to have them pre-soaked in water. This will ensure they cook more evenly alongside the other ingredients., There are multiple ways to do this. Though it depends on the type of soup you would like to make, one recommended method is to make a stock by simmering soup bones in a pot of water overnight. This will extract the minerals and flavour from the bones, giving your soup a hearty and nutritious base to start with. Chicken and beef bones are standard choices for soups, though different bones will each yield their own individual tastes.


For a vegetarian alternative, adding finely chopped vegetables to a pot of water and letting it simmer will make a fine vegetable stock for your soup. If you're thrifty, you can use the small, unused remains of past veggie recipes to make the stock. Adding these to cold water and proceeding to simmer will ensure all each vegetable's flavour has a chance to be released. Some dieticians recommend simmering bones for as long as 12-48 hours. This longer process reportedly ""breaks the bones down, releases nutrients and minerals, and makes nutrient-rich collagen, gelatin, and glucosamine easier to digest."" Oxtail may also be used as a good alternative to bones. If you don't have bones or meat to take it from, you can try asking your local butcher for spare bones to fuel your soup stock. If you want to skip this step, you can purchase a prefabricated bouillon at your local grocery store.

, Again, there are a number of ways you can effectively spice up a soup. A tablespoon of sea salt, a teaspoon of peppercorns, and a bunch of parsley are all versatile ways to add zest to a half-pot of soup.


Try adding one or two chicken feet to the broth while it simmers. It may not sound appealing, but a chicken foot will add a gelatinous texture to the soup that some may find enjoyable.

, If you made the stock with soup bones, remove them with a ladle. Cut up your vegetables if you haven't done so already. If you're using the recommended ingredients, the potatoes and carrots should be cut into small enough chunks that they'll be able to get consistently soft inside the soup. Add the ingredients in descending order from largest to smallest (e.g: beginning with potato chunks and meat, slowly working to peas and corn.) Working by this process will ideally give all of your ingredients an opportunity to cook relatively evenly., Stir regularly for optimal consistency. Taste the broth periodically during the cooking process. If you think something is missing, adding a dose of salt and pepper is an easy way to liven up a soup.

, Distribute your soup into bowls with a ladle. Making a homemade soup can be a lengthy ordeal when you take overnight stock simmering into consideration, but with a little luck and effort, you'll find homemade soup can be one of the most satisfying dishes available.

, Clear soups are one of the most freezer-friendly dishes around! Put whatever you won't be eating in the next 1-2 days in the freezer, and the soup will stay fresh for a long time.

Rinse and mash the cannellini beans.,
Saute the onion, garlic, and cabbage.,
Stir in and simmer the broth and beans.,
Make garlic toast.,
Serve the vegetarian Italian peasant soup.",How to Make Italian Peasant Soup2," Open two 15-ounce (425 g) cans of cannellini beans and dump them into a mesh strainer. Rinse the beans with cold water and measure out 1 1/2 cups (425 g) of the beans. Put these into a small prep bowl and mash them with a fork.Set the mashed and remaining beans aside while you saute the vegetables.

, Pour 1 teaspoon of the extra-virgin olive oil into a Dutch oven or soup pot. Turn the heat on to medium. Cut one medium onion in half and then slice it. Add the sliced onion to the pot and saute it for 2 to 3 minutes. Shred half a head of Savoy cabbage (so you have 4 cups or 400 g) and add it to the pot. Stir in 3 cloves of minced garlic and saute the mixture for another 2 to 3 minutes.The cabbage will wilt and the garlic should become fragrant.

, Pour in three 14.5 ounce (428 ml) cans of vegetable broth. Add the mashed beans and the reserved whole beans. Turn the heat up to medium-high, so the soup begins to bubble gently. Turn the heat back down to medium-low and simmer the soup for 10 to 12 minutes.Prop a lid on the pot, so only a little steam escapes.
Season the soup with salt and pepper to taste.

, Get out eight pieces of day-old whole-wheat country bread. They should each be about 1/2-inch (12 mm) thick. Toast the bread under a broiler or in a toaster. Immediately rub half of a garlic clove over each piece of toast.You could also use a rustic white bread or large baguette.

, When you're ready to serve the soup, place a piece of garlic toast into each serving bowl. Pour soup over the toast and sprinkle each bowl with some grated fontina or Parmesan cheese. Drizzle just a little of the remaining tablespoon of olive oil over each bowl and serve the soup right away.To get eight servings of soup, you'll need 1 cup (108 g) of grated fontina cheese or ½ cup (50 g) of shredded Parmesan cheese.

In a large mixing bowl, stir yeast and honey into warm water.,
Pour in salt, oil and half the flour.,
Knead for 6 minutes.,
Lightly grease the bowl and the dough.",How to Make a Stromboli1," If you have a stand mixer, that's best. Let it sit for 5-10 minutes or until bubbles form on the surface and the mixture begins to foam. These are the signs to look for to know that the yeast is doing its job.;
, Mix it well, and once that flour is fully combined, start adding the rest of the flour in bit by bit until you get the stromboli dough to the consistency you want. It should be a little tacky, but when you touch it nothing should stick to your fingers.


Using a standing mixer will greatly eliminate your woes. This is doable by hand, but it'll be a workout. Be patient.

, Turn a timer on and keep those arms working until it buzzes -- resist the temptation to stop any earlier. After six minutes, the dough should be smooth and easy to work with.


It may be tempting, but don't cave. If you overwork the dough, it becomes harder to work with, the consistency becomes undesirable, and it won't raise properly.

, If you don't, it'll dry out. Cover the dough with plastic wrap, set it on your counter, and let it rise for 1-2 hours. Try to use it as shortly after this period as possible -- it's freshest when recently risen.

Figure out what kind of thick soup you want to make.,
Purée ingredients for your soup's base.,
Introduce your desired veggies and aromatics.,
Add a thickening agent.,
Let simmer for an hour.,
Complete your recipe with a garnish.,
Serve and store your thick soup.",How to Make Homemade Soup2," A purée, a blended vegetable paste, is the most common form of thick soup. Most often, a thick soup is defined by its thickening agent (I.E: cream) as much as its dominant ingredients. If this is your first time making a thick soup, you may want to stick with making a simple purée; if you're feeling more daring, a cream-based soup can be one of the most delicious things you can make from home.


Although the possible choice of ingredients is just as varied as with the clear soup, keep in mind that the base of a thick soup won't complement every ingredient. If you're unsure where or how to start with planning your soup, try looking up a few good specific recipes online. Cream of mushroom soup is a well-loved standard, for instance!

, In the vast majority of cases, you'll achieve the base of your thick soup by puréeing vegetables. Boil the vegetables you want to make your base with. Then, using a food processor or immersion blender, purée your chosen base vegetables until they make a fine paste. Adding this paste to simmering water and stir until the purée is fully mixed.


Although the ratio will vary depending on the desired thickness of your soup, using 1 pound of vegetables per 4 cups of water is a good place to start. You can make a meat base by finely chopping or puréeing cooked meat, like chicken. This will yield a much different direction for the soup, and you may find a meat base carries flavour more easily than its vegetarian counterpart.
As an alternative measure, you can go without puréeing anything, instead relying on the thickening agent (which you'll add later!) for the soup's texture. A homemade or store-bought meat or veggie stock works in this occasion, although certain ingredients (like mushrooms) make for wonderful cream soups without being puréed., As with the clear soup, you'll want to give extra time to the larger ingredients you'll be adding to the soup, for the sake of letting everything cook evenly. You'll find aromatics like onions and garlic are particularly useful when it comes to making a thick or cream-based soup.

, This is the decisive part of making a thick soup. How you decide to thicken the soup will have just as much of an impact as the central ingredients you've decided to put in it. There are several ways to do this:


With a roux. A roux is an equal mixture of flour and fat (like butter) that may be used to thicken your soup. Mix both into a saucepan on medium heat and stir until the melted butter has enveloped the flour. Adding this to your soup is the best option if you want a thick soup, but don't want it cream-based. Butter may also be replaced with cooking oil or grease.
With starch, like grated raw potato. Use a grater to grate shreds of potato directly into the simmering soup. 5-10 minutes should be enough to produce the consistency you're looking for.
With cream or milk. Cream is the essential element in cream-based soups. To make sure the milk doesn't curdle, warm it up in the microwave beforehand. Add your milk or cream to A 1/2 cup of cream should suffice for a quart of soup; up to a full cup of milk will sate a similar effect. If you decide to make a cream-based soup, do not add the cream until just prior to the soup being consumed.
With egg yolk. 1 egg yolk per cup of soup should be enough. Beat the egg yolk until it's a mixture. Don't add the egg directly to the liquid; instead, add some of the soup to help warm up the beaten egg mixture before joining it in with the pot. This will ensure the egg yolk mixes properly with the soup.
With flour. Although vegetable soups may not stand up to flour, you'll find adding a couple tablespoons of flour will thicken a rich meat soup effectively. , Stir the soup regularly, to make sure the flavours disperse evenly. You may also find it helpful to periodically taste test the soup. If the taste isn't to your liking, adding salt and pepper helps in a dash to improve a soup's flavour. Other seasonings (like parsley and peppercorn) go a long way towards improving a dish.

, A garnish may include anything that livens up, or decorates your soup. This is the step that can elevate your homemade soup to restaurant status! A garnish may even be added simply for visual flair. As with the other ingredients in a homemade soup, you are completely free to experiment with whatever you think would give your homegrown recipe some added personality. Here are some examples:


A slice of bread or tortilla is a fun and practical addition; the bread will absorb the flavour of your soup and give you something more solid to munch on.
A thin meat like prosciutto is a light, but effective way of adding excitement to your soup.
Lightly grating cheese like parmesan on a cream-based soup is sure to add flavour to your soup. Moreover, it will give your dish a distinctive visual flair.
Even if your soup already consists largely of vegetables, adding fresh vegetables on top of it can add a new angle of taste and texture to the soup.

, While clean soups have a simple charm to them, a well-made thick or cream-based soup can taste like a fine restaurant creation, even if it's made from home. If you're planning on a cream-based soup, it's a good idea to add the cream and stirring moments before eating it. Thick soups don't generally keep as well as their lighter counterparts, particularly those with cream thickeners. For a long-lasting dish, it's actually recommended you don't add thickener to stored portions, instead adding a cream once it's been defrosted."

Transfer to a cutting board and sprinkle with basil.",How to Make a Stromboli2,", If it's been on the short side of two hours, check to see that it's adequately raised.

, Recover it with the plastic wrap, and let it rest at room temperature for 15 minutes. It'll be a bit more manageable when it cools slightly.

, Add the oregano and salt and bring to a boil. Stir it occasionally, thoroughly combining the spices.

, Crush the tomatoes with a wooden spoon until the sauce thickens. This should take about 10 to 15 minutes.

, Cover with the sauce and top it with the cheese and the meat of your choice -- pepperoni, sausage, salami and chicken all work well. But any filling you can imagine works, too.

, Crack it into a separate bowl, whisk it up, and brush the yolk onto the dough to give it a golden color. Don't throw it out after this step! You'll need it for the top, too.

, For instructions on this, scroll toward the bottom of the page. The stromboli can take very different forms, depending on your desired method.


Once put together, brush the top with egg and sprinkle the Parmesan and parsley over the egg-brushed surface. These additions will fool your friends into thinking it's restaurant-made.

, Keep an eye on it, especially if your oven runs hot or cooks unevenly.

, Slice the bread into rounds and divide among individual plates.

Brown your ground beef in a medium-sized skillet over medium-high heat.,
Form the dough.,
Spread the sauce over the dough.,
Fold the dough.,
Bake for 15 to 20 minutes or until crust is golden brown.",How to Make a Stromboli3," Grab a cookie sheet and spray it with nonstick cooking spray. If you'd prefer, line a sheet with parchment paper (no muss, no fuss, just throw it away after).

, Chop up your bell pepper(s) and, if applicable, shred the mozzarella. Measure out your ingredients and set aside for swift assembly.


The pepper works best for this recipe if it's in thin slices, not chunks. But any shaped pepper is better than no pepper at all!

, Make sure to stir frequently to cook it evenly, browning it on all sides. Drain away the juices, fat, and set aside.

, Place it on the sprayed cookie sheet and get to work. Starting at the center and working outward, form a 12x8-inch (30 by 20 cm) rectangle by pressing out the dough with your hands.

, Make sure to leave a crust! You want the sauce to within 2 inches of the long sides and 1/2 inch of the short sides. Place the cooked ground beef lengthwise down the center (about 3 inches in width) and to within 1/2 inch of the edges on the short sides. Top with cheese, bell pepper and Italian seasoning -- or whatever whets your appetite.


If you'd like your dough to be braided, leave extra room on the sides.

, See the next section for possible folding methods. Once folded, if you'd like a golden color, whisk up an egg and brush it on the top just before baking. Add on any spices or cheeses for a flavor-y crust.

, If your dough seems a bit overstuffed, be especially careful. Keep an eye on it and flip it halfway through, if necessary.


Remove from the oven and let cool. Slice as you see fit. This recipe should serve 6.

For a braid, pile your fillings in the center.,
Then, fold the uncut top and bottom edges over the filling.",How to Make a Stromboli4," You want the largest section of non-filled dough to be at the end of the roll. This gives it a nice thin-to-thick shape and helps the dough maintain form in the oven.


Brush with an egg yolk, if desired. Resume cooking instructions.

, Start making parallel horizontal cuts about 1 1/2 inches (3.75 cm) from the filling and at 1 1/2 inch (3.75 cm) intervals down both sides. Leave a 1 1/2 inch (3.75 cm) uncut edge at the top and bottom for the ends.

, Starting at the top, start braiding the cut ends. Fold one strip over from the right side, then the left, and repeat, slightly overlapping a bit each time. Continue in this motion to create a braided effect, tucking in the last strips underneath the bottom, uncut edge.


Cover with a kitchen towel or cheesecloth and allow the stromboli to rise for 30 minutes. Resume cooking instructions.

Mix the two together well so the pork is fully coated and let the meat sit for 10 to 15 minutes.You can omit the pork from the soup if you want to make a vegetarian version.;
, Add 4 small Chinese dried black mushrooms and 12 dried tree ear mushrooms to a large bowl or pot. Pour 3 cups (710 ml) of boiling water over the mushrooms, and let them soak for until they are softened, which should take approximately 30 minutes.You can usually find Chinese dried black mushrooms and dried tree ear mushrooms at Asian grocery stores.
Make sure that the water completely covers the mushrooms.
Use a large bowl or pot that has plenty of extra space because the tree mushrooms will expand significantly as they soak.
While the mushrooms are soaking, turn them over every so often to ensure that they soften all over.

, After the mushrooms have softened, use a knife to remove the stems from the black mushrooms. Squeeze the mushrooms over the bowl to extract the excess liquid, and slice them thinly. Set them aside on a plate for the moment.If there are any hard portions of the black mushrooms, remove them with the knife.

, After you’ve removed the black mushrooms from the bowl, lift out the tree ear mushrooms. Use a knife to remove any hard portions, and set them on the plate with the black mushrooms, reserving the soaking liquid.If the tree ear mushrooms are very large, you should cut them into bite-size pieces.

, Once you’ve removed the mushrooms, mix ¼ cup (59 ml) of the liquid that the mushrooms have soaked in with 1 ½ tablespoons (12 g) of cornstarch in a small bowl. Whisk the two together until they’re fully blended and smooth. Set aside the mixture for the moment., Place 12 dried lily buds in a small bowl, and pour 1 cup (237 ml) of warm water over them. Allow the lily buds to soak for 20 minutes to soften them, and then drain the water.Lily buds are sometimes known as golden needles. You can usually find them at Asian markets.

, After you’ve drained the lily buds, use a knife to cut off the tough tips. Next, slice the buds in half lengthwise and then tear each half into two or three pieces., Add ½ cup (115 g) of canned sliced bamboo shoots that have been cut lengthwise into ⅛-inch (3-mm) wide strips to a small saucepan. Next, pour enough cold water into the pan to cover the shoots by about 2-inches (5-cm).A half cup (115 g) of bamboo shoots usually amounts to half an 8-ounce (230 g) can.

, Place the pan with the bamboo shoots on the stove, and heat over medium-high heat. Allow the mixture to just come to a boil, which should take about 5 to 7 minutes.Boiling the bamboo shoots helps remove some of their bitterness.

, Once the bamboo shoots come to a boil, remove the pan from the heat. Pour the bamboo shoots through a sieve or colander to drain, shaking well to remove the excess moisture.After you’ve drained the bamboo shoots, set them aside for the moment.

, Add 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of red-wine vinegar, 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of rice vinegar, 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of light soy sauce, 1 ½ teaspoons (6 g) of sugar, and 1 teaspoon (6 g) of kosher salt to a small bowl. Whisk the ingredients together until they’re fully combined, and set aside.Be sure to use unseasoned rice vinegar for the soup.

, Place a large wok on the stove, and heat it on high until a drop of water vaporizes on contact with it within a couple of seconds. Next, add 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of peanut oil and swirl it in the wok to coat all of the sides.If you don’t have a wok, you can use a large pot for the soup.

, Once you’ve oiled the wok, add the marinated pork loin pieces. Cook the pork until it just changes color, which should take about 1 minute.Be sure to stir the pork with a wooden spoon to ensure that it cooks evenly.

, After you’ve stir fried the pork for a minute, mix the mushrooms, lily buds, and bamboo shoots into the wok. Stir fry the mixture for another minute., Once you’ve stir fried the pork mixture for a couple of minutes, add 4 cups (946 ml) of reduced-sodium chicken broth to the wok. Allow the mixture to come to a full boil, which should take approximately 5 minutes.It’s best to use reduced-sodium broth for the soup because some of the other ingredients, such as the soy sauce, are high in sodium. However, you can use a homemade broth if you prefer.
If you want to make a vegetarian version of the soup, you can substitute vegetable stock for the chicken stock. You can even use water in place of the chicken stock, though your soup may not have as rich a taste as a version with the stock.

, After the broth mixture has come to a boil, add 3 to 4 ounces (85 to 113 g) of firm tofu that’s been rinsed, drained, and cut into ¼-inch (6-mm) thick strips to the pot. Allow the soup to return to a boil.You can use semi-firm tofu instead of firm if you prefer.

, When the soup has return to a boil, add the vinegar mixture. Mix well to blend it into the soup, and then bring it back to a boil, which should take about 3 minutes., Once the soup is boiling again, add the cornstarch mixture that you made earlier. Allow the mixture to return to a boil once more, stirring the whole time to help thicken it.Before you add the cornstarch mixture to the soup, make sure to stir it well. It can clump up while it sits.

, When the soup has returned to a boil, lower the heat to medium. Let the soup simmer for 1 to 2 minutes., Crack 2 large eggs into a small bowl and beat well. Add just a few drops of sesame oil and stir together until they’re well combined.You can use egg substitute in place of the eggs if you prefer.

, When the eggs and oil are mixed, pour the mixture into the soup in a slow, steady stream. Stir the soup in a single direction to mix in the eggs.The eggs should cook almost immediately when you add them to the soup.

, Once you’ve mixed the eggs into the soup, stir in 2 teaspoons (10 ml) of sesame oil, 1 ½ teaspoons(3 g) of freshly ground white pepper, and ¼ teaspoon (1 ml) of chili oil. Stir well so the ingredients are fully incorporated.Adding the chili oil is optional. Your soup will have plenty of heat from the white pepper alone.
Taste the soup after you’ve mixed in the seasonings. Add more pepper, chili oil, and/or salt if necessary.

, When you’re ready to serve the soup, spoon it into 6 to 8 individual bowls. Use 2 tablespoons (13 g) of thinly sliced scallion greens and 2 tablespoons (3 g) of whole cilantro to garnish the soup and serve."

Add the flour and use a whisk to stir it into the butter. Keep stirring as the mixture cooks and turns from gold to brown.









Don't overcook the roux, or it will change the flavor of the gumbo. Turn down the heat if it looks like it's cooking too quickly.
If the roux overcooks, it's best to start over with a new batch of butter and flour.

, As soon as the roux looks ready, ladle the stock to keep the roux from burning. Stir the mixture until the stock heats and begins to simmer.








, Stir in the onion, celery, and bell pepper mixture. Sprinkle in the chopped okra and garlic. Bring the stock to a boil.








, While the stock is coming to a boil, place a skillet on a burner and turn the heat to medium high. Pour some oil on the skillet and let it heat up. Lay the bite-sized chunks of raw meat on the skillet and let them brown on one side for a minute. Use tongs to turn the meat over and brown it on the other side.









Work in batches if necessary, since crowding the pan with meat will prevent liquid evaporation and prevent proper browning.
It's not necessary to completely cook the meat, since it will finish in the gumbo pot.

, Use tongs to transfer the browned meat to the pot. Add the smoked meats as well. Use a large wooden spoon to stir the mixture, and bring it back to a boil, then reduce it to a simmer and let it cook for one hour.

Add whole grain noodles to your soup.,
Choose a lean protein option.,
Add zucchini to your soup.,
Add carrots to your noodle soup.,
Add healthy mushrooms to your noodle soups.,
Avoid unhealthy additions.",How to Make Healthy Noodle Soups3," Instead of conventional noodles, use a whole grain variety. There are many whole grain pasta varieties including whole wheat pasta, as well as ancient whole grain pastas like kamut. Whole grain pastas are better for your because they have a lot of fiber content, which is an important dietary factor in reducing blood cholesterol levels.Kamut is an ancient grain that has approximately forty percent more protein than wheat and is also much richer in magnesium, zinc and selenium.Reduce the calories by going light on pasta. Simply add less pasta than is indicated on the recipe to lower the calories in your noodle soup.

, By choosing a lean protein with less fat like a skinless chicken breast or tofu, you will be able to get your protein without too much fat. Lean protein options include skinless turkey or chicken breast, pork loin, and tofu.A cup of roasted chicken breast has forty three grams of protein and five grams of fat.A cup of extra firm tofu has six grams of protein, two grams of carbohydrates, and two grams of fat., If you are making a chicken noodle soup at home, try adding more chopped zucchini. Slice the zucchini thinly, so that it will cook in good time. You could also chop it into quarter inch cubes, depending on your preference. Finally, you could replace the noodles with zucchini noodles by using a spiralizer.

Make zucchini pasta with a spiralizer. You can make pasta out of zucchini instead of wheat by using a spiralizer. A spiralizer is a tool that allows you to shred and cut your vegetables into useful shapes, including into pasta. You can purchase a spiralizer online or at your local kitchen supply store.
Zucchini is rich in vitamin A and very low in calories, with no cholesterol or saturated fats., If you are making a noodle based soup, try adding some carrots to it. Chop the carrots to your desired thickness but keep in mind that the thicker they are, the longer they will take to cook in your soup.

Carrots have a great flavor and are incredibly healthy. Carrots are rich in antioxidants, vitamin A, and are very low in calories. They also have lots of fibre.

, Maitake, reishi, cordyceps, and lion’s mane are mushrooms that are purported to boost immunity and help fight cancer.These mushrooms are also great additions to noodle soups. If you are making a soba noodle soup, ramen soup, or even a chicken noodle soup, consider adding one or more of these mushrooms to your soup. These mushrooms will add a depth of complexity and flavor to your healthy noodle soup.

Maitake is a mushroom from Japan that has been touted by the American Cancer Society for its immune boosting and anti-cancerous properties.Shiitake mushrooms grow abundantly in China and Japan and can be found in many grocery stores. They are touted for their ability to build immunity and fight inflammation.Reishi has been used for lung conditions and for prostrate cancer.Lion’s mane is known for its ability to protect and enhance nerve growth and enhance memory.Cordyceps is great for energy and endurance., If you are trying to cut the calories in your noodle soup, try avoiding the addition of croutons and cheese. In particular, if you want to cut down on your fat, carbohydrate, and sodium intake, you might consider eliminating these toppings from your noodle soup.

A cup of croutons has two grams of fat, four grams of protein and twenty-two grams of carbohydrates. It also contains nine percent of your daily sodium requirements.A cup of cheddar cheese has sixty seven percent of your daily fat requirements, including one hundred and thirty nine percent of your daily saturated fat recommended intake."

Use herbs.,
Use cheese.,
Add chopped hard boiled eggs to hearty soups.,
Use cream.,
Drizzle oil over the top.,
Make croutons.,
Sprinkle with nuts and seeds.",How to Make Garnishes for Soups," This is one of the simplest ways to garnish a soup, yet it looks fabulous and it adds an extra element of taste. For example:


Use chopped parsley on tomato, vegetable, creamy and seafood style soups.
Use snipped chives on many different types of soups. Remember that this will add an onion flavor, so be sure it will enhance the soup.
Sprinkle a bit of chopped dill over creamy or seafood soups. Dill is a very strong taste, and it's not to everyone's liking, so be sparing with it.
Add some hand-ripped mint to fresh soups and Asian-inspired soups. The refreshing taste of mint will give the soup quite a lift.
Fresh sprigs of coriander/cilantro go well with Asian/Central and South American style soups. Coriander has quite a strong taste when it's fresh, so check that it's to everyone's liking.;
, Many a child will be most grateful for some shredded cheese sprinkled over the soup just prior to serving. If you're floating a piece of bread or toast on the soup, sprinkle the cheese over that; you could even grill the cheese on top for added tastiness and a delicious texture.


Be careful with blue cheese; not everyone likes the odor or taste of it.

, The chopped egg will bob on the top and adds an extra flavorsome source of protein to the soup.

, There was a time when a drizzle of cream was essential for any classy soup but nowadays it's less popular, so be sure that it matches the flavors of the soup. You can use runny cream and swirl it around the top in a nice spiral pattern, or you could use whipped, salted cream and dollop it in the middle of the soup. If you don't want cream, try sour cream or yogurt instead.


Non-dairy cream can be purchased if preferred.

, Choose a high quality extra-virgin olive oil (EVOO) or a flavored oil and simply swirl it around the top of the soup. It'll add flavor and it looks good too.

, This garnish requires a bit of extra effort but it's often the crunchy, oily texture that draws the whole soup experience together and turns it into a taste sensation. To make croutons, see here.


Flavored croutons can make an interesting touch; consider frying them with a spice, such as cinnamon or pepper.
Other crunchy-style additions to the top of a soup include fried onion pieces, crunched up potato crisps/chips (the crumbs at the bottom of the bag are great), broken up pappadams, corn chips broken into little pieces, popcorn or fried bacon bits.

, Whether the nuts and seeds are raw or roasted, salted or flavored, they can be a delicious addition to the right soup. Pumpkin seeds, walnuts, almonds, sesame seeds, sunflower seeds, poppy seeds, hazelnuts, macadamias, etc. all make tasty choices to garnish a soup.



Dukkah makes a nice choice for a mixture of nuts and seeds, with added flavor.

As such, it should not be stored in containers made from brass, copper, iron or tin or corrosion and leaching will set in, creating reactions between the metals and the vinegar and therefore damaging the food. The safest container for storing vinegar in is glass.;
, You can even put it into the refrigerator. Although vinegar is the product of wine having gone bad, vinegar can also go bad after a while and it tends to lose flavor after it is opened. Store for around 6 months; after a year you will probably find that the vinegar doesn't taste as good as it did when first purchased.Fruit and herb vinegars are best kept in the refrigerator as this keeps their flavor at its best., In between use, avoid contact with air by ensuring that the lid is on properly.

Color the horseradish, if desired.,
Make a classic horseradish cream: Whip cream to stiff peaks, then incorporate the white, grated mixture to taste, by folding in.,
Try adding your horseradish paste to favorite recipes that take well to seasonal twists.,
Finished.

",How to Prepare Fresh Horseradish," When buying, choose roots that are firm and have no mold, soft or green spots. Older roots will look shriveled and dry. They may even begin to sprout. These are to be avoided.;
, This root is pungent. The biting flavor and smell of horseradish strengthens when the root is grated, due to mustard oils released by enzymes when the cells are crushed. The mustard oil dissipates within 30 minutes of exposure to air, and it is destroyed by heat, so vinegar is usually used to stop the reaction and stabilize the flavor. The time at which the vinegar is added can control the heat, so if your prefer milder horseradish, add the vinegar sooner. Fresh horseradish also loses flavor as it cooks, so it is best added towards the end of a dish when cooking.

, Cut into pieces appropriately sized for your particular blade size and capacity of blender or food processor.

, Experiment with grate size, but the finest is usually best for condiments.


This will burn your eyes and throat. Work at an arm’s length away and whatever you do, don’t deliberately smell the horseradish! You might want to wear gloves and eye protection. Work cleanly; don't spread the mixture to your body or other foods.

, The time at which you add the vinegar is important. Vinegar stops the enzymatic action in the ground product and stabilizes the degree of hotness. If you prefer horseradish that is not too hot, add vinegar immediately. If you like it as hot as can be, wait three minutes before adding the vinegar.""

, Press the mixture through a muslin, cheesecloth, or fine mesh sieve, yielding the desired pastiness/liquid content. Use in recipes right away, or store in clean jars for future.

, To color, boil a minced beet in vinegar and use this vinegar during preparation. You can play with golden beet, red beet, or other coloring agents (saffron and turmeric are also good, but these will alter the flavor profile, as well as the color). The cooking time and the ratio of vinegar to root also affect the depth, brilliance, clarity, and saturation of the final color.

, Serve immediately. You can also mix grated horseradish with sour cream, crème fraîche or mayonnaise. Add kosher salt to taste.

, These include: mashed potatoes, potato pancakes, salad dressings, dips, cream cheese or chèvre spreads, hamburger patties, cocktail sauces, Bloody Mary mix, gazpachos, vegetable salsas, slaws, gelatin molds, salmon or other fish mousse, egg salad, hot wings, marinades, martinis, maki rolls, sambals, popovers, brioche, cheese fondue, sandwiches, fermented vegetables, etc. The possibilities are endless!

Use the right storage containers.,
Store bottles and jars of fragrant or herbal oils away from sources of heat and light.,
Remember that all oils soon oxidize.,
For commercially produced herb and flower oils, follow the instructions.",How to Store Herb and Flower Oils," When making your own scented oils, always remember that light destroys scent. As such, the very best containers are usually dark ones, such as amber colored or dark glass. Also, ensure that the storage bottles are airtight, as air destroys the scent quickly when it gets inside the bottle.;
, Always prefer a cool, dark and dry location to keep them, such as a back shelf of the pantry.

, Use oils within the time specified by the recipe.


Avoid keeping mixed oils any longer than two months. This is especially important where the oil mix includes a carrier oil base, as when mixing essential oils with a carrier oil. These mixtures tend to begin oxidizing as soon as they are blended.

, Many will advise either cool storage or even refrigeration.

Research varieties of vanilla beans.,
Buy vanilla beans.",How to Make Vanilla Extract1," Vanilla beans are produced in many different countries, and there are several dozen varieties to choose from. They each have a different flavor profile.


Bourbon vanilla beans are fruity, with hints of figs and persimmon.Madagascar vanilla beans are full-bodied, with a hint of tobacco. They have a higher vanilla content than other beans, making them a flavorful choice.Mexican vanilla beans are smooth and creamy.
Tahitian vanilla beans have a floral scent.
Indian vanilla beans are dark and oily with hints of cinnamon and other spices.;
, Buy whole vanilla beans from gourmet food stores. You can also buy them online if you want a bigger selection to choose from.


The vanilla beans you buy should be dark and moist with oils. They should feel dense when you pinch them with your fingers, and they should emit a strong vanilla smell.
Don't use vanilla beans that are light in color, dry or crumbly. If you're unsure whether one is still usable, wrap it around your finger. If it bends easily and stays together, it's fine to use. If it falls apart, don't use it to make extract.

Leave all of the ingredients out at room temperature for approximately 30 minutes prior to preparing the mayonnaise. This aids in the process of emulsification, or binding of the ingredients.;
, Cup your hand with your fingers spread slightly apart over a small mixing bowl. Crack the egg in your hand and allow the whites of the egg to slide between your fingers into the bowl. When only the egg yolk remains in your hand, place it in a separate container and set aside.

, Once the ingredients have reached room temperature, place 2 small egg yolks or 1 large egg yolk, along with 1 tsp. (5 g) of salt and 1 tsp. (5 g) of white pepper, into a medium size mixing bowl and mix gently using a wire whisk.

, Fill a measuring cup with 8 oz. (2.5 dl) of olive, corn, peanut or safflower oil. Holding the measuring cup of oil in 1 hand and a wire whisk in the other hand, let a small amount of the oil drip into the mixing bowl while stirring briskly with the wire whisk. Once the mixture has begun to thicken and increase in volume, increase the rate of oil from a drip to a very slow pour. Continue to vigorously stir in the remaining oil.

Let the vodka become infused with vanilla.,
Transfer the vanilla to amber bottles.",How to Make Vanilla Extract2," Line the pods on a cutting board. Place the tip of a sharp knife at the tip of the first vanilla bean. Lay the edge of the knife down the center of the bean, so that it aligns with the bean lengthwise. Press down to slice the bean open. Repeat with the remaining beans.


Some people skip the slicing step. Slicing the beans may make the extract more flavorful, but the tiny black seeds, or caviar, can give it a cloudy appearance.
If you want to make sure the extract has great flavor but you don't want to cloud it with caviar, slice off the tips of the beans instead of slicing them in half.

, Put them directly into the bottle and close the cap tightly. Shake the bottle to distribute the contents.

, Place the bottle into a cool and dark place and leave the extract to infuse for two months. You'll notice the vodka change color to a golden-brownish color.


Don't store the vanilla in a warm or bright place, as it might spoil.
Shake the bottle every so often to distribute the contents.

, Place a colander over a bowl and pour the vanilla extract through, so that the beans are caught in the colander. Use a funnel to transfer the extract to amber bottles, which protect the extract from sunlight so that it keeps for years on end.


If you prefer not to transfer the liquid, you can leave it in the vodka bottle, as long as it's stored in a cool, dark place.
If the extract doesn't taste strong enough, leave it in the vodka bottle and add a few more vanilla beans. Let it sit for another few months before using.

, Whether you chose to infuse brandy, bourbon, tequila, or another type of alcohol with vanilla, just place the beans directly into the container and close the lid. Shake well.

, Since strong-flavored spirits take longer to pick up the more subtle vanilla flavor, the bottles need to be shaken so that the vanilla gets distributed. For a week after putting the vanilla beans in the container, shake it several times a day. In the second week, shake it once a way.

, Vanilla extract made with spirits aside from vodka takes longer to infuse. Store it in a cool, dry place for at least three months.

, Open the bottle and sniff it, then take a taste. If the extract has a strong vanilla flavor, it's ready to use. If you can only taste the alcohol, replace the cap and let the extract infuse for another few weeks before using.

If you want to boil them, leave the jars in the pot of hot water, so the jars stay warm while you make the rhubarb.If you sterilize the jars in the dishwasher, remove them and place them in a warm oven until you're ready to fill them or use them right when they're out of the dishwasher.;
, You'll need two new canning lids with fresh seals and bands. Fill a small saucepan halfway with water. Bring the water to a boil and turn off the heat. Set the two lids into the pot. The seals will soften which will help them fit on the jars. Keep the lids in the pan while you pickle the rhubarb.You don't need to sterilize the bands or keep them warm. You can even use old bands, so long as they haven't been dented.

, Stir together the pickling ingredients in a small saucepan until they're combined. Turn the heat on to medium-high and heat the liquid until it comes to a boil. The sugar and salt should dissolve. You'll need to heat:1 cup (240 ml) apple cider vinegar
1 cup (240 ml) water
1 cup (200 g) granulated sugar
1/2 teaspoon fine grain salt

, Measure 1 teaspoon of mustard seeds, 1/4 teaspoon of black peppercorns, 1/4 teaspoon of whole cloves, and 1 star anise into each of the sterilized pint jars., Place a large pot on the stove and set a wire rack in the bottom. Fill the pot with water and turn it to medium, so it can begin to heat up as you pack the jars., Wash 1 pound (453 g) of rhubarb stalks. 1 pound is usually around 4 to 6 stalks. Use a sharp knife to trim off and discard the ends. Slice the stalks, so they're as tall as your pint jars.If the stalks are very wide, you may need to slice them in half lengthwise.

, Fill the jars with the sliced rhubarb. The rhubarb will completely fill each jar. Ensure that you can close the jar with the lid or you may need to trim the rhubarb more. Carefully pour hot pickling liquid over the rhubarb in each jar and leave 1/2-inch (12-mm) of space at the top of the jar.Tap the jars gently to remove any air bubbles. Look at the jars again and ensure that you have only 1/2-inch (12-mm) of headspace. Add more pickling liquid if you have too much space.

, Place a warm lid on each jar and screw on the lids just so they're fingertip tight. If you screw them on too tightly, air will have trouble escaping as the jars process., Be careful handling the jars of pickled rhubarb, since they'll be hot. Lower each jar of rhubarb onto a wire rack in the bottom of your water bath canner. You may want to use a jar lifter to lower it into the water. The jars should be covered by 1 to 2-inches (2.5 to 5-cm) of water. Turn the heat to high and bring the water to a boil. Start your timer and process the jars for 10 minutes., Fold a clean, dry towel and set it on your work surface. Turn off the heat to the water bath canner and carefully lift the processed jars out. Set the jars on the towel and let them cool for 12 hours or up to one day.Keep the area draft-free since shocks in temperature could cause the jars to crack.

, Once the jars are cool enough to handle, remove the bands. Check the seals by pulling on the lids. It should stay firmly attached to the jar. Always check the seals before you open preserved food.You can store the sealed jars of pickled rhubarb for up to 1 year. Once you open a jar, you should store it in the refrigerator and use it within 2 weeks.

Pour the vinaigrette over your salad.",How to Make Vinaigrette1," You should add a dollop of mustard that is about the size of your fingertip. Mustard acts as an emulsifying agent--when two liquids don’t mix, like water and oil, mustard breaks them down and helps them to mix.


You can also add a fingertip-sized dollop of mayonnaise to the bowl. Mayo is also an emulsifier and adds a nice creamy texture to the vinaigrette. However, for a lower-calorie vinaigrette, skip the mayo.;
, This item will depend on the kind of vinaigrette you are making. The most standard vinaigrette is one made with lemons. Squeeze one fresh lemon into your bowl. If you don’t have a fresh lemon, you can also use four tablespoons of bottled lemon juice. Whisk the lemon juice with the other ingredients in the bowl. Make sure that it is thoroughly mixed.


Other options for your acidic element include red wine, white wine, and apple cider vinegar.

, To properly combine all of the ingredients, continue to whisk the lemon mixture while slowly pouring in the olive oil. Whisking while pouring will help the water-based lemon juice combine with the oil. Continue to whisk until all of the ingredients are thoroughly combined.

, For a basic vinaigrette, all you need to ad is salt and pepper. Add as much or as little as you like. Season to taste. If you want to add other herbs, now is the time to do so. Other herbs you might like to add include:


Minced garlic, onion, or shallot.
Finely chopped basil, parsley, thyme, or dill.
Other spices like paprika or cumin.

Get used to using your slow cooker.,
Brown the meat in a frying pan before it goes in your slow cooker.,

Reduce the amount of liquid you put in a converted soup recipe.,
Wait to add your herbs and spices to your recipe, until the end.,
Place root vegetables into the bottom of the slow cooker.,
Place dairy ingredients, such as milk, cream, buttermilk or soft cheeses into the slow cooker near the end of the cooking time.,
Add cornstarch or flour near the end to thicken the recipe.",How to Change Your Recipes To Easy Slow Cooking Recipes," Each brand cooks slightly differently, so you should get a feeling for how hot your slow cooker runs even on the low setting. Many people believe that older slow cookers cook at a lower temperature than newer versions.


If you find that your slow cooker runs hot, then you will want to reduce the amount of cooking time listed in the recipe. You may find the vegetables are mushier and meats fall apart, if you do not make the adjustment to slow cooker recipes.;
, Even if this is not required on your original recipe, it adds a complex flavor to the meat because it seals in the juices. The meat will also hold together better, while it cooks for hours rather than minutes.


You can also dredge raw meat, like chicken breasts or pork cutlets, in an herb and flour mixture. Then brown it on the stove top. The result will be a more crisp, complex flavor.

, Most recipes should be adjusted to the ""low"" setting on the crock pot rather than ""high."" The following times are good guidelines to follow for time adjustments:


If the cooking time is between 15 and 30 minutes on a stove top or in a conventional oven, then set it to cook for 4 to 6 hours on low. You can also set it for 1 and a half to 2 hours on high.
If the cooking time is between 30 and 45 minutes, then set it to cook for 6 to 8 hours on low. You can also set it between 3 and 4 hours on high.
If the cooking time is between 45 minutes and 3 hours, then set it to cook for 8 to 10 hours on low. You can also set it between 4 to 6 hours on high.

, Look for recipes that are stewed, simmered, slow roasted or braised. These recipes will convert easily and with the best results because they use similar methods.

, Make sure it includes recipes for slow cooking meats, vegetables, soups, stews and even casseroles. Find the recipe in the book that is most similar to your favorite recipe and model your favorite recipe on it.

, The slow cooker traps liquid inside the pot, so extra liquid will result in a soupy texture.


If your recipe does not call for any liquid, and does not contain fatty meats, then add 1/2 cup (118 ml) of broth or water.

, If the directions say to simmer the soup uncovered, then reduce the liquid by 1/3. If you are directed to simmer it while it is covered, then reduce the amount of liquid by 1/4.

, Herbs tend to break down and disappear over long hours in the cooker, where spices tend to become dominant. To avoid either of these things from happening, add herbs near the end of the recipe, and add extra salt and pepper before you serve.

, They take longer to cook than other vegetables. Cut them into 1 inch (2.54 cm) pieces and place them underneath meats or other ingredients.

, Some hard cheeses, such as Parmesan or Swiss may be put in the cooker at the beginning, because they hold together more firmly.

, If you have too much liquid in your pot, remove the lid and turn the heat up to high. You can also drain off the liquid with a baster and reduce it in a pot on the stove.


If you want to add cornstarch or flour to thicken the sauce, create a slurry first. Add a few spoonfuls of flour or cornstarch to a small bowl and mix it with cool water. Make sure there aren't any lumps before adding it to the slow cooker.

",How to Cook for a Southern Fish Fry," In the south, catfish are probably the number one choice, but near clean, sandy bottomed bayous and bays, black mullet are also popular and inexpensive, and easy to prepare.






;
, If you are working in hot weather, look for a shady area, but try to choose a location where no flammable materials like dry grass and leaves pose a risk. Here are the basic items you will need:









12-32 quart stock pot or other large pan with a strainer basket, if available.
Propane tank and regulator with an outdoor stove.
Slotted spoon or frying tongs.
Cooking oil (about 2 gallons, depending on the size of your fryer).

, After the fish have been cleaned, rinse them with fresh water and while they are wet, drop them in a container of seasoned cornmeal. The type of meal is up to the individual, but medium to fine grind yellow Cornmeal is popular in the south. Salt is the only usual seasoning, but when you get the hang of it, you may want to experiment with other spices. For a finer crust, you can add one part all purpose flour to each 4 parts of Cornmeal. This will allow the fish to cook longer before they brown, for a more well done fish.








, Leave them in the mealing container until they are ready for the fryer. This will help the Cornmeal to adhere better to the fish, giving them a good coating when they fry.








, Ease pieces of fish into the hot oil one at a time until it is near its cooking capacity, being careful to avoid splashing the oil.








, They will begin to float as they become done, making it easy to observe the color of the pieces. When they are a golden to medium brown, remove them and allow the pieces to drain in a pan or cardboard box lined with paper towels. This is where a basket or strainer comes in handy, since all the fish can be lifted out at one time, the excess oil will drain back into the pot, and the pieces dumped into your holding container.








, Because hushpuppies are made with a mixture of cornmeal and wheat flour, adding the liquid to the recipe too early will allow the dry ingredients to absorb too much, making them very heavy and dense.








, Mix these ingredients completely. When the last batch of fish are placed into the fryer, add the Cornmeal mix (or separately, 2 parts cornmeal, one part all purpose flour, baking powder, and salt) to the previous ingredients and mix once more.








, Use a spoon to dip batter from your bowl (or other container), then, holding it just above the oil, let it slide off of your spoon. Drop as many hushpuppies as the oil can easily cook. When the hushpuppies are done (cooked) on the bottom, they should float up and the heavier, raw batter on top will cause them to flip themselves over to continue cooking on the other side. Shaking the frying basket will help them do this.








, Place them in your holding container to allow excess oil to drain off.

Grease an 11x17-inch baking pan with 1 tb of butter.,
Divide the remaining 1 1/2 cups of butter into small pieces.,
Heat the butter on medium-high in a large, heavy-bottom saucepan.,
Add the sugar, syrup, water, salt and corn syrup and lower the heat to medium-low.,
Stop stirring when the mixture boils.,
Clamp a candy thermometer into the mixture and wait until it reads 300℉.,
Turn off the heat and quickly stir in 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract.,
Carefully pour the toffee onto your baking sheet.,
Cool the toffee in the freezer for 20-30 minutes.",How to Make Toffee1," Use the butter to lightly coat the bottom and sides of the pan. This will keep the toffee from sticking to the pan when you need to remove it. Set the pan aside on a wire cooling rack for later -- you'll be pouring the hot toffee into this to cool.


You can also line the bottom with parchment paper or use a Silpat mat if you don't want to grease the pan.;
, Simply cut the butter up into squares. This increases the surface area of the butter and helps it melt evenly.

, Heavy bottom pans will prevent the sugar from burning later on, but you can use a normal pot if you don't have one.Stir the butter regularly as it melts. Once you are sure that all of it is melted, move on to the next step -- you do not want it to brown.

, Once the butter is melted, add 2 cups granulated white sugar, 2 tablespoons light corn syrup, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 cup water and stir it in until the sugar has completely dissolved. When possible, use a wooden spoon instead of a metal one to prevent sugar crystals from forming.If you do not have corn syrup, add an extra 4 tablespoons of butter, divided into small pieces., Sugar can recrystallize when overstirred, leading to grainy toffee instead of the smooth texture you are looking for. Use a pastry brush dipped in water to knock any loose sugar crystals off the sides of the pan and down into the mixture, then let the toffee sit, unstirred, until you take it off the heat.You can also cover the pot briefly -- the steam will condense on the sides of the pot, dissolving the sugar and dripping back into the mixture.

, This is the ""hard crack"" stage of candy. This means that, when it cools, the candy will break up into the hard pieces of toffee that you are looking for. Turn the heat off when the thermometer reads 300℉.


If you do not have a candy thermometer, the toffee is done when the mixture is a rich golden-amber color, similar to the skin of an almond.Do not let it get brown, however, as this means it is burning.

, This ensures that you get the extract throughout the mixture evenly, but don't cause any more crystals to form. 3-4 stirs around should be enough.

, You'll leave it in your baking sheet to cool and harden, then you can break it up into smaller pieces afterward.


If you want nuts in your toffee, spread them on the sheet ahead of time and pour the toffee over them.

, You can then remove it, crack it into pieces, and serve. Toffee will last for 7-10 days in an air-tight container at room temperature and up to a month in the freezer.

Once it's lightened in color, use a plastic spatula to spread the chocolate evenly across the surface of the toffee, making a two-layered chocolate-toffee treat. Freeze as usual.

, Toffee has long been served with nuts, particularly almonds and pecans. Put a cup of nuts on the baking tray before you pour the toffee out. Then use a food processor to finely chop another 1/2 cup of nuts and pour them on top of the toffee when it is still hot (or the chocolate, if you chose to add it on top). Freeze as usual.

, Put 8 ounces of white chocolate chips and 2 ounces of finely ground coffee in a small saucepot. Heat up 1-2 inches of water in a larger pan, then place the chocolate pot in the water pan to warm the chocolate indirectly. This is called a double boiler, as the hot water surrounding the pot melts the chocolate, not the direct heat of the stovetop. Stir the coffee and chocolate until fully melted, then pour and spread on the partially cooled toffee., Brown sugar has a darker, molasses-like quality that will make an especially distinct treat. You can treat the rest of the recipe the same as normal toffee.

, This decadent but simply candy is such a perfect combination you may not cook it any other way. The caramelized sugars go perfectly with a pinch of salt, sprinkled right over the top of the toffee right after pouring onto the baking sheet., Sweet, salty, and savory, bacon toffee is hard to resist.

, You want your juice to become thick (kind of like the consistency of syrup.) You can continue adding sugar if you want to.,, Lower the string into the glass, keeping it straight, until the pencil touches the rim and stays there.,, Your candy is ready if the sugar crystals have stuck on the string. If not, it may just need more time or there wasn't enough sugar in the juice."

Cut the butter into small, even squares.,
Stir the mixture constantly until the sugar is dissolved and the butter is melted.,
Cook the candy, stirring frequently, until it reaches 300 degrees on the candy thermometer.,
Remove the pan from the heat once the candy reaches 300 °F (149 °C).,
Immediately after the toffee is poured onto the baking sheet, use a spatula to spread the candy to an even thickness.

,
Allow the toffee to begin to set for a minute or two, then spray a knife with nonstick cooking spray and score the toffee into small squares or rectangles, firmly cutting through to the bottom of the pan.,

Sprinkle the tops of the toffee bars generously with chopped nuts after the chocolate has begun to set.,
Place the toffee in the refrigerator to set the chocolate for about 20-30 minutes.,
Finished.

",How to Make Toffee Candy," Place the chopped butter, sugar, water, and corn syrup in a large heavy saucepan over medium heat.;
, Insert a candy thermometer and bring the candy to a boil. Periodically brush down the sides of the pan with a wet pastry brush to prevent sugar crystals from forming on the sides and turning your candy unpleasantly gritty.

, If the candy appears to separate (with a layer of melted butter on top) carefully stir it vigorously to make it come back together again. Watch the candy as it approaches 300 °F (149 °C), since it cooks quickly and can easily scorch at high temperatures. As it reaches the proper temperature it will turn a dark, golden amber color.

, Carefully remove the pan from heat and pour the toffee onto the prepared baking sheet.

,, Allow the toffee to cool completely.

, At this point, the toffee is finished and can be served plain. If you wish to dip it in chocolate, proceed to the next step.

, Place it in a microwave-safe bowl and microwave it in one-minute increments, stirring after every minute to prevent overheating.

, You can dip it halfway in, or if you prefer, you can use a fork or dipping tools to submerge the toffee pieces entirely in chocolate. Remove the toffee from the chocolate and drag the bottom of the fork across the lip of the bowl to remove excess chocolate. Place dipped toffee pieces on a baking sheet lined with aluminum foil. You can serve the chocolate-dipped toffee as-is, or if you would like to cover it with chopped nuts, proceed to the next step.

, Repeat with the remaining chocolate, toffee and nuts.

, Once the chocolate is set, the toffee can be served immediately or stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to one week.

Load the steamer with water.Fill the basin of a handheld steamer with distilled water.,
Pass the steam over the fondant.,
Re-steam as needed.",How to Make Fondant Shiny1," Turn on the steamer and allow the water to heat up.


You can use a clothing steamer for this technique as long as no detergents or other chemicals were ever poured into the basin.
Every steamer works differently, so it's best to consult the manufacturer's instructions prior to use. Typically, however, you should use a plain hose attachment and low heat for the best results.;
, Hold the steamer approximately 4 inches (10 cm) away from the fondant. Press the steam trigger to release the steam onto the piece.


Turn the fondant piece or move the steamer around as needed to evenly apply steam to all sides.
Only allow the steam to hit the fondant for 3 to 5 seconds per spot. Using too much steam can cause the fondant to melt and may also cause water droplets to form on the surface.
In addition to giving the fondant a soft glossy finish, steam can also remove traced of corn starch and powdered sugar previously left behind on the surface of the fondant.

, Within an hour, you'll likely notice the gloss fading as the water dries. Apply additional steam in the same manner to return the gloss.


Steamed gloss will fade every time you apply it, so it's generally best to use this method only if you plan on presenting the fondant immediately.
Note that any sugar or starch residue obscured by the steam will not return, however.

"
"
Avoid using fats on the fondant.,
Combine corn syrup and alcohol.,
Brush the mixture over the fondant.,
Let it dry.",How to Make Fondant Shiny2," Fats can cause this glaze to separate. As a result, the surface will look ""bubbled"" and uneven instead of smooth and shiny.Do not knead the fondant in shortening, oil, or other fats prior to applying this glaze. Do not use this method in conjunction with the shortening glaze technique, either.
Additionally, you should avoid using silicone or vinyl sheets for rolling your fondant when you intend to use this glaze. Oils and fats can collect on these sheets from previous works, and the residue can be enough to cause separation of this glaze.

, Pour one part light corn syrup and one part clear drinking alcohol into a shallow cup. Stir well to combine.


The alcohol should be 150 proof or higher. Vodka works well, but clear grain alcohols are also effective.
The exact amount will vary depending on the amount of fondant you need to glaze, but using 1 tsp (5 ml) of each component will usually work well for small decorations.

, Use a small, soft paintbrush to evenly apply the glaze of the surface of the fondant.


The glaze should create an instant and permanent high gloss over the fondant.
It's best to apply the glaze in thin layers. Thicker coats will create a shinier appearance, but they will also take longer to dry.

, Let the glaze dry completely before you handle the fondant further. This can take anywhere from 1 to 12 hours, depending on how thick the glaze is.


Avoid brushing over the glazed area or touching it with your fingers once the glaze starts setting. You can easily leave marks in the glaze during this stage, and those marks will be permanent.
You can apply additional coats once the glaze is completely dry, but re-application should not be necessary to maintain the initial sheen.

"
"
Fill a spray bottle with vodka.Fill a small, clean spray bottle with approximately 2 inches (5 cm) of vodka.,
Mist the fondant.,
Let it dry.",How to Make Fondant Shiny3,"


If you don't have vodka, clear grain alcohols may also work. Avoid using tinted alcohols, though, since the color will bleed onto the fondant.
Use a clean spray bottle that has never held hair products or other chemicals to avoid accidental contamination. Salon-quality spray bottles are better than cheap bottles since cheap bottles may spray unevenly. Note than an airbrush could also work.

, Hold the nozzle about 4 inches (10 cm) away from the surface of the fondant. Lightly and evenly spray the alcohol over the fondant.


Only spray a light mist of alcohol onto the fondant. Using too much can cause puddles to form and may dry out the fondant to a damaging degree.

, Wait several hours for the alcohol to completely dry. After it dries, the fondant should have a soft glossy finish.


The gloss should be semi-permanent. It may fade after several days, but you should avoid re-applying the alcohol since too much can quickly dry out the fondant.

"
"
Apply shortening to the fondant.,
Buff the fondant.,
Re-apply as needed.",How to Make Fondant Shiny4," Use your fingers to carefully rub a thin, smooth, and even layer of vegetable shortening over the surface of the fondant.


If you want to keep your fingers clean, you could try using vegetable cooking spray instead of solid shortening.Hold the nozzle approximately 4 inches (10 cm) away from the fondant and lightly mist it over the surface at even intervals.

, After applying the fondant, use a dry paper towel to lightly buff the shortening into the fondant, working in small, circular strokes.


Any irregularities, fingerprints, or stroke marks should fade as you buff the fondant. Press lightly, however, to avoid leaving any indentations.
After you buff the piece, you should be left with a smooth, satin gloss.

, The gloss should remain intact for a day or so, but you may notice some fading once the fondant begins to absorb the oil. You can apply another coating at this point in the same manner used for the first.


Shortening does not dry completely, however, so some gloss will likely remain even after absorption occurs.
Since fondant remains wet and sticky, it's easy to accidentally leave fingerprints and other marks while moving the cake. You can remove these marks before presenting the piece by lightly buffing them out with a dry paper towel.

"
"
Combine gum arabic and water.,
Let it sit.,
Brush the mixture onto the fondant.,
Let it dry.",How to Make Fondant Shiny5," Add one part gum arabic and two parts distilled water to a small bowl. Stir vigorously to combine.


The exact amount will vary depending on the amount of fondant you need to cover, but you should always maintain these proportions. For most small pieces, 1 Tbsp (15 ml) gum arabic and 2 Tbsp (30 ml) water should suffice.

, Allow the mixture to sit at room temperature for 15 minutes. Afterward, vigorously stir it again to combine the components.


Resting and re-stirring the mixture in this manner should help the two ingredients combine more evenly, making the glaze more effective after application.

, Using a small, soft paintbrush, immediately paint an even layer of glaze over the fondant.


Work carefully to avoid getting stroke marks, fingerprints, or other marks in the glaze.
Immediately after applying the glaze, the fondant should have a very high gloss. This will not be the way the final finish looks, however.

, Wait for the glaze to dry a full 24 hours before handling the fondant further. Once dry, the fondant should be slightly hard and semi-glossy.


This glaze should be permanent, so re-application is not necessary.

"
"
Apply pasteurized egg white to the fondant.,
Let it dry.,
Add further coats as needed.",How to Make Fondant Shiny6," Pour 2 to 4 Tbsp (30 to 60 ml) of pasteurized egg whites into a small, clean dish. Using a small, soft paintbrush, lightly and evenly brush these egg whites onto the surface of the fondant.


For safety reasons, you should use pre-separated, pasteurized egg whites from a carton.
When working with small pieces, you can dip the fondant directly into the egg whites instead of brushing the egg whites over the piece. Tap off any excess before leaving the piece to dry.
When you need to brush the fondant onto the piece, use a small brush and leave behind as few stroke marks as possible. Tap off any excess egg whites that pool in the crevices of the piece immediately after application.

, Let the egg whites dry for several hours. Once dry, the fondant should have a natural, medium-level shine.


The egg whites must dry completely before you handle the piece. If you touch it while the whites are still drying, you may leave behind fingerprints that you won't be able to remove later.
Note that the egg whites should dry to a semi-hard, permanent finish. Re-application should not be necessary.

, If the fondant is not as shiny as you would prefer, you can apply additional coats following the same procedure.


Allow each coat to finish drying before applying the next coat. Doing so minimizes the risk of imprinting the egg whites with fingerprints or brush marks.

Top your baked fudge with ice cream or whipped cream.,
Sprinkle fruit, nuts, or candy on top.",How to Make Baked Fudge," Set your oven to 325 degrees Fahrenheit (165 degrees Celsius) and let it warm up while you mix up the batter. When you’re done making the batter, you can immediately pop it into the oven. Depending on your oven, it can take anywhere from 10 to 20 minutes to preheat., Crack open both eggs into a mixing bowl. Using a whisk, begin beating the eggs together. Continue doing this until they’re a light yellow color.If you do not have a whisk handy, you can use a fork for this step., Once you’ve beaten the eggs thoroughly, you can add the other ingredients. After adding each one, give the mixture a stir to ensure everything is well combined. After everything has been added to the mixture, stir it gently for a few moments to make sure everything is blended., This recipe will make enough to fill four large ramekins, which are baking dishes.You can find these at any home goods store, or even Target or Wal-Mart. The great thing about baking your baked fudge this way is that everyone will get a personal dish, and they can top it with whatever they like!, After you’ve poured the batter into the ramekins, pull out a larger pan that all of the ramekins will fit into. Place all of the ramekins in the pan, and then carefully fill it about halfway full with water.The water will absorb the heat of the oven, helping your fudge bake evenly and slowly., Carefully place the pan into the oven, and set your timer for 40 to 50 minutes. Keep an eye on your fudge as it bakes, however. You want to pull it out when the top appears crispy. The rest of the fudge will not be firm, but will continue to solidify a bit as it sits. You don’t want your fudge to be cooked completely through.If you notice that the water has evaporated, carefully pour a bit more into the pan as your fudge finishes cooking., Once the top layer of the baked fudge is crispy, it’s done baking. Don’t worry if the inside is gooey – that’s the best part of this dessert, after all. Let the ramekins cool a bit before serving so that no one burns their fingers. However, these are best served warm so don’t let them cool completely!, The best part about making your baked fudge in ramekins is that everyone can top theirs with whatever they like – or they can choose to skip the toppings. Different flavors of ice cream are a great option. The cold ice cream with the warm fudge is always a crowd-pleaser. Whipped cream is another solid option., If you want to add a bit of extra flavor or crunch, don’t hesitate to add some toppings. You can easily turn your baked fudge dishes into brownie sundaes, Chopped fruit, a handful of nuts, or some crushed candy will take this dessert from delicious to positively decadent."

Be sure to follow the regular ingredient amounts, utensils and baking dishes, steps or instructions, oven temperatures, and baking times as well.;
, Using a damp knife, cut the cake in sections or quarters. This allows the insides of the cake to cool down faster, rather than having the cake cool down from the outside in.

, When the cake pieces has reached room temperature or warm to handle, use your hands to crumble the cake in a large mixing bowl. You will want to break down any chunks, especially any hard corners.

, Start off with 1/4 cup of icing in the bowl. Use a wooden spoon to thoroughly incorporate the cake crumbs and icing together until you achieve a consistency of dough, as if you're making cookie dough. Add additional icing, if needed.

, Having the mixture chilled makes it easier for you to roll it into balls., Use a cookie dough scooper to help you make even ball amounts, about 1 tablespoon (15 ml) (15 grams). To avoid multitasking, scoop the entire mixture and place the balls onto a flat surface (such as a baking sheet or counter top), lined with parchment paper.

, Use both palms of your hands and circle each ball in a circular motion, to allow any flat surfaces become evenly round.

, For the best results, it's recommended to refrigerate the cake balls for at least two hours. By doing this, any coating won't affect the prepared cake when dipping.

, You can either use a microwave-safe bowl or create a double boiler. Stir the chocolate to make sure everything is melted evenly.

, Prick them in the center, just enough to pick them up from the parchment paper and hold.


If you're wanting to present the cake balls on a stick, it's recommended to use lollipop sticks, which can be found in specialty baking aisles. Dip about 1/2 inch (1.27 cm) of the stick into the melted chocolate prior to inserting them into the cake balls.
If you're wanting to present the cake balls in decorative individual wrappers, poke them with toothpicks.

, While holding the lollipop stick or toothpick, submerge the cake ball into the melted chocolate. When lifting it back up, gently lift them in a swirling motion or give them a gentle shake.


If you are using toothpicks, remove them from the balls. Add a very small amount of extra melted chocolate to cover the holes. You can use the back of a spoon to evenly spread out any extra coating as well.

, Place the chocolate covered cake ball in the same place on the waxed paper. Pick up the next one and repeat the dipping until everything is covered.

, You can create even zig-zag lines by moving your arm back and forth in a uniform way across the entire sheet of cake balls.

, Place one piece on the top of each cake ball, as a garnish.

, To ensure a hard coating and for any topping to appear more uniform, place the cake balls in the freezer or refrigerator for about an hour or two.

Prepare your baking pan.,
Heat the butter and heavy cream in the microwave until the butter melts and the heavy cream is hot.,
Fill a small, heavy-bottomed saucepan with corn syrup, slowly add the sugar, and stir everything together.,
Bring the mixture to a boil over medium heat, then cover it with a lid for 1 minute.,
Take the lid off, clip a candy thermometer to the side of the saucepan, then cook until the mixture reaches 320°F (160°C).,
Pour the melted butter and cream mixture into the saucepan, a little bit at a time, using the candy thermometer to stir it in.,
Let the mixture heat back up to 240°F (116°C).,
Pour the caramel over your prepared baking pan.,
Let the caramel cool a little, sprinkle salt over it, then let it finish cooling.,
De-mold the caramel, then cut it into small rectangles.,
Serve the caramels.",How to Make Sea Salt Caramels1," Lightly grease a 9 by 5-inch (22.86 by 12.7-centimeter) baking pan with butter or oil, then line it with parchment paper. Leave the parchment paper hanging over the sides by at least 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) so that you can pull it out later. Lightly grease the parchment paper, then set the baking pan aside.
, Cut the butter into 8 cubes and put it into a microwave-safe bowl. Put the heavy cream over it. Put the bowl into the microwave, and heat it for 1 to 2 minutes in the microwave. Once the butter has melted and the heavy cream turned hot, give the mixture a stir, then set it aside.

Make sure that the heavy cream or heavy whipping cream that you are using has at least 36 to 40% butterfat content. Do not use plain whipping cream. That has only 30% butterfat content, and that is not enough to make successful caramels.If you don't own a microwave, you can heat the butter and the heavy cream in a little saucepan over the stove. Don't let it come to a boil, however!

, Be careful not to get any sugar on the sides of the pan, or the sugar may crystallize. The cleaner you keep your saucepan, the less crystallization will occur, and the smoother your caramel will turn out.Once you have the sugar in, stir it just enough to moisten the sugar, then set the spoon aside. You will not be stirring the mixture from now on., This will create steam which will then dissolve any sugar grains stuck to the sides of the pan. It will help keep the sugar from crystallizing., This will take about 5 to 10 minutes. Do not stir the mixture during this time. As it cooks, the sugar will start to turn a light, golden color.Make sure that the bottom of the candy thermometer does not touch the bottom of the pan. If it does, it won't read the temperature correctly.

, Once the mixture reaches 320°F (160°C), pour in about one-sixth of the butter and cream mixture into the saucepan. Take the candy thermometer off of the saucepan, and use the tip to stir everything together. Keep pouring and stirring the butter and cream mixture one-sixth at a time until you have none left.Be careful during this step. The mixture will bubble a lot as you add the melted butter and cream into it. Don't let the mixture bubble out of the saucepan.
Do not let the tip of the candy thermometer scrape the bottom of the saucepan

, When you added the butter and cream to the sugar mixture, the temperature will have lowered. Let the mixture cook until it heats back up to 240°F (116°C). This will take another 5 to 10 minutes. This will eventually create soft caramel candies. If you want your candies to be a little harder, let the mixture heat up to 245°F (119°C) instead., Use a rubber spatula to help guide the mixture across the bottom of the baking pan and to smooth it out. Be sure to scrape out any residue left inside the saucepan., Let the caramel cool for about 20 to 30 minutes first, then sprinkle your coarse or flaked salt evenly over it. Let the caramel finish cooling for another 3½ hours.You don't have to use exactly ½ teaspoon of coarse of flaked sea salt .You can use a little more/less according to your personal tastes.

, Use the parchment paper to lift the caramel out of the pan. Place the parchment paper down on a flat surface. Use a sharp knife to cut the caramel into 1 by ½ inch (2.54 by 1.27 centimeters) rectangles.

If the caramel is too soft, place it in the fridge for 30 to 45 minutes first, before you take it out of the pan. This will help the caramel firm up a little., If you don't plan on eating them right away, wrap the pieces individually in little pieces of plastic wrap, cellophane, or wax paper."

Leave the parchment paper hanging over the edges by at least 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) so that you can pull it out later. Grease the parchment paper with butter, then set the pan aside., Make sure that the saucepan is large enough to hold 3 quarts (3 liters). You won't be making quite that much candy, but you need extra room in your saucepan in case the mixture starts to boil over., Once the butter has melted, pour in the sugar, salt, corn syrup, and milk. Stir everything together to combine, then allow the mixture come to a boil. Stir it constantly as it cooks., This will take about 40 to 50 minutes. Do not stir the mixture as it cooks, and do not let the tip of the candy thermometer to touch the bottom of the saucepan., Use a rubber spatula to scrape everything out of the saucepan, and guide it into the baking pan. If you need to, use the rubber spatula to smooth out the top of the caramel., The caramel must be completely cool before you add the chocolate. If it is too warm, the chocolate won't set fast enough, and it might mix into the caramel instead., Put the chocolate chips into a microwave-safe bowl, then add the vegetable oil. Place the bowl into the microwave, and heat for 30 to 40 seconds on high. Every 10 seconds, pause the microwave, and give the chocolate a stir. Keep doing this until the chocolate is all melted.Chocolate melted in the microwave tends to keep its shape until you stir it.
Every microwave is different. Your chocolate may be ready sooner than that. It may also need more than 40 seconds to melt.

, Working quickly, pour the chocolate in an even layer across the caramel. If you need to, use a rubber spatula to help spread it from edge to edge, corner to corner., Using your fingers, take a pinch of coarse or flaked sea salt, and sprinkle it over the chocolate while it is still wet. You will need about 1 teaspoon of salt, although you can use a little more or a little less if you want to. Once you have salted the chocolate, transfer the entire pan into the fridge so that the chocolate can set up and harden., Grab the excess parchment paper, then carefully lift it out of the baking pan. Set the parchment paper down onto a flat surface. Use a sharp knife to cut the caramel into 8 rows and 6 columns.If the parchment paper is sticking to the sides of the caramel, carefully peel it away first.

Whisk constantly until the cream is fully incorporated.,
Allow the sauce to boil.,
Remove the pan from the heat and mix in the salt.,
Allow the sauce to cool.,
Pour the sauce into a glass jar for storage.",How to Make Salted Caramel Sauce," Add 1 cup (200 g) of granulated sugar to a medium size saucepan with a heavy bottom. Turn the burner to medium to allow the sugar to start to heat.A 2 quart (1.9 L) saucepan is usually large for the sauce.
Make sure that your saucepan is clean before your start making the sauce. If there is any dirt or debris in it, crystals can form around it when you begin heating the sugar.;
, As the sugar is heating, use a heat-resistant rubber spatula or wooden spoon to stir it constantly. The sugar will start to clump, and eventually melt into a liquid. Continue stirring it until the liquid is thick and turns a dark amber color, which can take 5 to 10 minutes.The sugar can burn easily, so be sure to watch it and stir continuously.

, When the sugar has melted into an amber colored liquid, mix 6 tablespoons (90 g) of salted butter that’s been cut into pieces into the pan. Allow the butter to heat until it melts into the sugar, which typically takes 2 to 3 minutes. Stir the mixture regularly to help the butter melt.When you add the butter to the sugar, the caramel mixture will bubble rapidly. Be careful to avoid burning yourself.
You can use unsalted butter in the sauce if you prefer. No other changes need to be made to the recipe.

, Once the butter has melted into the caramel, slowly and carefully pour ½ cup (120 ml) of heavy cream into the pan. Because the caramel in the pan is hotter than the cream, the mixture will bubble aggressively and possibly splatter up so be careful as you drizzle in the cream.To minimize the bubbling and splattering, bring the cream to room temperature before adding it to the caramel.
You can substitute light whipping cream or double cream for the heavy cream, but don’t use milk in the recipe.

, As you add the cream to the caramel, use a wire whisk to continuously stir the mixture. Continue mixing until the cream is fully incorporated into the caramel.If the mixture bubbles up too much to whisk it comfortably, take the pan off the heat for a moment to allow it to cool down.

, When the cream is completely blended into the caramel, let the mixture boil for 1 minute. As it boils, the sauce will begin to rise in the pan. Stir it occasionally to ensure that the sauce is smooth., When the sauce has finished boiling, remove the pan from the stove. Stir in 1 teaspoon (6 g) of sea salt until it’s well combined and the sauce is smooth once again.Fleur de sel has a very delicate texture so it easily melts into the sauce, but any fine sea salt will work for the recipe.
Make sure to mix in the salt when the sauce is still hot so it completely dissolves into the mixture.

, Once you’ve mixed the salt into the caramel sauce, leave it in the pan and set aside. Let the sauce cool for approximately 15 minutes before transferring it from the pan.If you plan to use the sauce right away, serve it while it’s still warm so it isn’t too thick to pour.

, When the sauce has cooled sufficiently, carefully pour it into a glass jar for storage. You can store the sauce in the refrigerator for up to two weeks.If you are refrigerating your sauce, be sure to warm it up before serving or incorporating it into another dish. You can heat it in the microwave on high in 5 second intervals until it’s thin enough to pour.

Chill the dipped truffles.",How to Make White Chocolate Cookie Truffles1," To make about 4 dozen white chocolate Oreo truffles, you'll need 36 Oreo cookies, 8 ounces (225 g) of cream cheese, and 1 pound (450 g) of white chocolate. Blitz the Oreo cookies in a food processor until they're finely crushed and set them aside. Coarsely chop the white chocolate so it's in chunks.It will be easier to roll the truffles if you let the cream cheese set out until it's softened.
For a variation, try using baked sugar cookies instead of Oreo cookies.;
, Place the finely crushed cookies and the softened cream cheese into a medium sized mixing bowl. Beat the ingredients with a stand or hand mixer on low speed. Keep beating the mixture until it combines and becomes thick.

You shouldn't see streaks of cream cheese in the mixed truffle filling. If you do, continue to beat the mixture until it's a uniform dark color.

, Lay a sheet of parchment paper, foil, or wax paper on a rimmed baking sheet and set it aside while you shape the truffles. Use a small cookie scoop or two spoons to scoop out a few tablespoons of the truffle mixture. Roll the truffle between your palms to make a ball that's about 1 inch in size. Set it on the baking sheet and continue shaping truffles until you have about 48.

If you don't have a rimmed baking sheet, you can use a standard baking sheet without the edges. Just ensure that the truffles don't roll off the sheet as you transfer them to and from the refrigerator.

, Place the baking sheet of Oreo truffles in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes or until they're firm. You could also freeze the truffles for about 10 minutes to harden them. Ensure that you have space in your fridge or freezer before you're ready to chill them.Chilling the truffles will help the white chocolate covering set up faster.

, Place a few inches of water in a large saucepan and heat it until the water starts to simmer (bubble gently). Set a medium-sized mixing bowl on the saucepan and put the chunked white chocolate in the bowl. Stir it as the water simmers and melts the chocolate in the mixing bowl. Let the chocolate cool slightly before you dip the truffles.You could also microwave the white chocolate in a microwave-safe bowl. Use the lowest setting and stir the chocolate every 30 seconds.

, Remove the sheet of chilled Oreo truffles from the refrigerator or freezer. Set a truffle on the tines of a fork and lower the entire truffle into the chocolate. Lift the truffle out of the chocolate and let the excess chocolate drip through the fork and into the mixing bowl. Place the truffle back on the baking sheet and continue dipping the rest of the truffles.If you place the dipped truffle back on the sheet without letting the excess chocolate drip off, the chocolate will puddle at the base of the truffle.

, Once you've dipped all of the Oreo truffles in the white chocolate, put the baking sheet with them in the refrigerator. Chill the dipped truffles for one hour or until the white chocolate has hardened.You can refrigerate the truffles for up to one week in a covered container or you can freeze them for up to one month.

, Using a damp knife, cut the cake in sections or quarters. This allows the insides of the cake to cool down faster, rather than having the cake cool down from the outside in.

, When the cake pieces has reached room temperature or warm to handle, use your hands to crumble the cake in a large mixing bowl. You will want to break down any chunks, especially any hard corners.

, Start off with 1/4 cup of icing in the bowl. Use a wooden spoon to thoroughly incorporate the cake crumbs and icing together until you achieve a consistency of dough, as if you're making cookie dough. Add additional icing, if needed.

, Having the mixture chilled makes it easier for you to roll it into balls.

, Use a cookie dough scooper to help you make even ball amounts, about 1 tablespoon (15 ml) (15 grams). To avoid multitasking, scoop the entire mixture and place the balls onto a flat surface (such as a baking sheet or counter top), lined with parchment paper.

, Use both palms of your hands and circle each ball in a circular motion, to allow any flat surfaces become evenly round.

, For the best results, it's recommended to refrigerate the cake balls for at least two hours. By doing this, any coating won't affect the prepared cake when dipping.

, You can either use a microwave-safe bowl or create a double boiler. Stir the chocolate to make sure everything is melted evenly.

This allows the insides of the cake to cool down faster, rather than having the cake cool down from the outside in., When the cake pieces has reached room temperature or warm to handle, use your hands to crumble the cake in a large mixing bowl. You will want to break down any chunks, especially any hard corners., Start off with 1/4 cup of icing in the bowl. Use a wooden spoon to thoroughly incorporate the cake crumbs and icing together until you achieve a consistency of dough, as if you're making cookie dough. Add additional icing, if needed., Having the mixture chilled makes it easier for you to roll it into balls., Use a cookie dough scooper to help you make even ball amounts, about 1 tablespoon (15 grams). To avoid multitasking, scoop the entire mixture and place the balls onto a flat surface (such as a baking sheet or counter top), lined with parchment paper., Use both palms of your hands and circle each ball in a circular motion, to allow any flat surfaces become evenly round., For the best results, it's recommended to refrigerate the cake balls for at least two hours. By doing this, any coating won't affect the prepared cake when dipping., You can either use a microwave-safe bowl or create a double boiler. Stir the chocolate to make sure everything is melted evenly., Prick them in the center, just enough to pick them up from the parchment paper and hold.

If you're wanting to present the cake balls on a stick, it's recommended to use lollipop sticks, which can be found in specialty baking aisles. Dip about 1/2 inch (1.27 cm) of the stick into the melted chocolate prior to inserting them into the cake balls.
If you're wanting to present the cake balls in decorative individual wrappers, poke them with toothpicks.

, While holding the lollipop stick or toothpick, submerge the cake ball into the melted chocolate. When lifting it back up, gently lift them in a swirling motion or give them a gentle shake.

If you are using toothpicks, remove them from the balls. Add a very small amount of extra melted chocolate to cover the holes. You can use the back of a spoon to evenly spread out any extra coating as well.

, Place the chocolate covered cake ball in the same place on the waxed paper. Pick up the next one and repeat the dipping until everything is covered., You can create even zig-zag lines by moving your arm back and forth in a uniform way across the entire sheet of cake balls., Place one piece on the top of each cake ball, as a garnish., To ensure a hard coating and for any topping to appear more uniform, place the cake balls in the freezer or refrigerator for about an hour or two."

Whip the mixture on medium until stiff peaks form, which should take approximately 1 to 2 minutes. Set the mixture aside.It’s best to use a stand mixer to make the nougat center filling for the pecan log roll. A handheld electric mixer may not be strong enough for the heavy texture of the candy.
To separate the egg white, crack an egg against a flat surface, such as a countertop or table. Pry the halves apart over a bowl, and let the yolk fall into the lower half. Move the yolk back and forth between the shell halves while allowing the white to drip out into the bowl below. When you’ve let all the white drip out, set the yolk aside for use in another recipe and add the white to your stand mixer bowl.;
, Add ¼ cup (75 g) of light corn syrup, ¼ cup (59 ml) of water, and 1 ¼ cups (284 g) of sugar to a medium saucepan with a heavy bottom. Place the pan on the stove, and heat the mixture on medium, stirring it constantly with a wooden spoon until the sugar dissolves, which should take approximately 5 to 7 minutes.Make sure to stir the mixture gently to avoid splashing it against the sides of the saucepan.

, After the sugar has dissolved, place a lid on the pan. Allow the mixture to cook on medium for another 3 to 4 minutes while covered. This will create condensation to wash away any sugar crystals that may have gotten stuck to the sides of the pan., Remove the lid after the corn syrup has cooked for another few minutes. Raise the heat to medium-high to bring the mixture to a boil, and heat the pan until the mixture reaches 255 degrees Fahrenheit (123 degrees Celsius) on a candy thermometer.For best results, use a candy thermometer with a metal clamp that secures it to the side of your pan.
If you don’t have a candy thermometer, you can use the cold water test. Place a drop of the syrup in a glass of cold water. Remove it from the water after several seconds -- it should form a firm but pliable ball., When the syrup has reached the right temperature, turn the stand mixer with the whipped egg mixture still inside to medium-high. Slowly pour the hot syrup into the bowl to mix them. The egg whites will double in volume.Be careful when you’re pouring the syrup into the egg whites. The mixture will be extremely hot, and can easily burn your skin.

, Once you’ve mixed the syrup into the egg whites, add 1 teaspoon (5 ml) of vanilla extract to the bowl. Turn the mixer’s speed to high, and continue beating the mixture until it becomes dull and has a rough texture. That may take between 10 and 20 minutes., Use wax paper or parchment paper to line a 9-inch by 5-inch (23-cm by 13-cm) loaf pan. Lightly grease the paper with butter to keep the nougat from sticking to it.You can use a butter-flavored nonstick cooking spray in place of the butter if you prefer.

, Use a spatula to pour the nougat out of the stand mixer bowl and into the prepared baking dish. Smooth it gently, and then allow the nougat to set for 3 to 5 minutes or until it’s cool enough to handle comfortably.To keep the nougat from sticking to the spatula, grease it lightly with a small amount of butter.

, Once the nougat is cool enough to handle, use a knife to separate it into six equal pieces. Lift each piece from the baking dish and roll into a log that’s approximately 5-inches (13-cm) long.You can make the smaller or larger logs depending on how many you’d like. Customize the size to suit your needs.

, After you’ve rolled all of the nougat pieces into logs, wrap each one individually in wax or parchment paper. Place them back in the baking dish, and chill in the freezer for approximately 30 minutes or until the logs are firm.You can freeze the nougat overnight if you want to get some of the work done ahead of time.

, Add 1 12-ounce (340 g) package of caramels and 3 tablespoons (45 ml) of milk to a medium saucepan. Heat the pan on medium, stirring the mixture regularly until the caramels are completely melted and smooth.You can substitute half-and-half for milk if you prefer.
When the caramel has melted, you can lower the heat to medium-low or low. You don’t want it to burn, but it sets quickly so it’s important to keep it warm.

, Once the caramel is melted, pour 2 cups (250 g) of chopped pecans into a shallow dish, such as a pie plate. Spread them in an even layer so you can easily roll the logs in the nuts.If you prefer, you can leave the pecans in whole pieces rather than chopping them.

, When you’re ready to coat the logs, use a pair of tongs to place them one at a time into the warm caramel. Turn the logs over in the pan to ensure that they’re well coated on all sides.If you don’t have tongs, you can use a wooden spoon or fork to dip and turn the logs over in the caramel.

, Right after you’ve dipped the logs in the caramel, roll them one by one through the pecans. You may want to roll them a second time to ensure that they’re fully covered., When the nougat logs are coated in the caramel and pecans, set them down on a cookie sheet that’s been lined with wax or parchment paper. Refrigerate the logs for 30 minutes to help set the caramel.If you like, you can slice the chilled logs and wrap in foil for individual servings.
Store the logs in the refrigerator for up to a week.

Prepare the counter.,
Simmer your mixture.,
Finish the pralines.,
Pour the pralines.",How to Make Pralines1," The praline process is delicate and time sensitive. You need to make sure that you have a spooning area ready before you begin to cook. This will make sure you don't let your pralines cool too much later on. Place a few sheets of parchment paper near you. Place a spoon by the paper in case you need it to help get the mixture off the spoon. You will also need a candy thermometer.


You can also use aluminum foil instead of parchment paper. Do not use wax paper. The heat of the pralines will melt the wax off the paper.
You can also put the parchment paper on a flat baking if you want to be able to move them after your make them.;
, Butter the sides of a 2 quart saucepan. Pour in the sugars, salt, corn syrup, milk, and butter in the saucepan. Stir them together and cook over medium heat. Stir the mixture constantly until the sugar dissolves and the mixture comes to a boil. Continue to cook until it reaches 236 degrees on the candy thermometer. Remove it from heat and allow it to cool for 10 minutes.


You can use the soft ball test if you don't have a candy thermometer. When you think your mixture is thick enough, drizzle a drop of the candy mixture into a glass of cold water. Take the ball that forms out of the water. If it squishes flat between your fingers but stays together, it is ready to come off the heat.

, Once the mixture has cooled, put the nuts and the vanilla into the mixture. Beat the mixture by hand with a spoon for about 2 minutes. The candy should start to thicken and lose its glossy sheen.

, Once it it no longer glossy, take your spoon and start to measure out your pralines. Each spoonful should be dropped on the parchment paper you prepared earlier. If the mixture gets stuck on the spoon, use the spoon you set aside earlier to help get the mixture off. Continue this until all of the pralines are formed. Let them cool to room temperature before you eat them.


Pour a teaspoon or two of hot water in the pralines if the mixture starts to harden before you are done spooning them out.You can make a few variations of this recipe if you want. For chocolate pralines, add a 1/2 cup chocolate to the ingredients in the saucepan. If you want peanut butter pralines, add a 1/3 peanut butter in the 30 seconds before your mixture is done boiling. If you are allergic to nuts, add in 1 1/2 cups of puffed rice cereal instead of pecans."

Stir the sugar and water over a medium heat to help the sugar dissolve. Once it is dissolved, stop stirring the mixture. Use a pastry brush to remove any sugar crystals from the side of the pot.


Removing the crystals makes it so your caramel isn't grainy.

, Increase the heat of the pan. Bring the mixture to a boil. When your mixture starts to get golden brown, add in your almonds and stir the mixture. Once the sugar turns golden brown, remove it from the heat.


Make sure you watch your pot very carefully. The mixture will burn easily.

, Take your pan and plunge the bottom into a sink or bowl full of cold water. This lowers the heat of the pan and keeps the caramel from getting too brown. Cover a flat baking sheet with parchment paper. Pour out your praline mixture and spread it across the pan in an even layer. Let it cool.

, One of the differences between British and American pralines is that they are crushed and used as a topping instead of eaten as candies. Once the pralines have cooled completely, break it apart. Put the pieces into a food processor. Pulse until it makes a fine powder.


These are good as toppings on other desserts such as cakes and ice cream sundaes."

Get creative by wrapping your candy.",How to Make Hard Caramel Candies," Get a high quality, four quart saucepan to cook the caramel in. A heavy bottom is especially important because it allows for the temperature to distribute more evenly. Thin saucepans tend to have isolated areas of heat, which can easily burn the caramel. , Candy thermometers are crucial for cooking caramel because sugar can easily burn, ruining the caramel. These thermometers are made specifically for testing oils and sugars so you can cook your candies to the ideal temperature. Your local Target, Walmart, or other large supermarket should have these in stock. , A rubber spatula is ideal for stirring the mixture as plastic spatulas can burn and melt under high temperatures. Stainless steel spatulas can be useful as well, but they can easily scratch your saucepan., This pan is necessary for the final step when you transfer your mixture from the saucepan. Be sure to get a high-quality, clean baking pan so any rust or caked-on food won’t find its way in your candy., These supplies will be necessary during the boiling so you can assess the consistency of the caramel. Be sure to have these at the ready so you don't waste precious time gathering the materials while the caramel could be burning., After the four quart heavy-bottom pan has heated up, pour two cups of sugar, one and a half sticks of butter, one can of sweetened condensed milk, one cup of light corn syrup, and a half cup of water into the pan. Heat the mixture up until it reaches a rolling boil. , Only allow 5-10 second intervals between stirs. The sugar will start to melt and turn the color of caramel. Put the candy thermometer in the mixture and wait until it reaches 240 degrees Fahrenheit. The ideal temperature is 245 degrees, but you should start testing the mixture at 240.

, In order to keep tabs on how the mixture is forming, it’s crucial to get a feel for the firmness of the caramel. The caramel should be solid and sturdy, while keeping a soft texture. If it’s rock hard, then the syrup has been overcooked. Grab your spoon, medium sized bowl filled with ice cold water, and have it ready next to the pan containing the mixture.
Once it reaches 240 degrees, gather a small sample of the mixture in a spoon, and then immerse the spoon into the bowl of water.
Give the mixture a few seconds to cool down, and then take the spoon out of the water. Feel the cooled caramel and lightly press down on it to assess its consistency.

, Once the mixture reaches the right consistency, it’s time to turn the heat off. Next, add in one teaspoon of salt and stir to evenly spread it throughout the mixture. Leave the mixture sitting for roughly two hours, until it reaches room temperature, which is approximately 72 degrees.

, Put a baking sheet down, and scrape all the caramel into the bottom of the pan, making sure only to hold it with a pot-holder. Scrape everything into the baking pan, making sure it is evenly spread. , Get a sharp knife and cut the caramel into even strips. Then using the same knife or a pizza cutter, cut the strips into small squares or whatever shape you desire., You could start eating the caramel pieces right off the pan, but if you’re giving it as a gift then it’s a good idea to wrap the individual candies. Cellophane or wax paper work well as wrappers. Measure out a small section of the wrapping paper and give it enough room to cover the candy with some extra paper to tie it up neatly. Try putting some in a bowl around your house for some homemade snacking!"

You can use a handheld electric mixer to mix the truffles if you prefer.;
, Once the cream cheese is fluffy, add 4 to 5 cups (440 to 550 g) of powdered sugar to the bowl. Beat the sugar in 1 cup (110 g) at a time, though, and mix well after each addition until a thick dough forms.Powdered sugar is also known as confectioners’ sugar or icing sugar.
You’ll know the mixture has reached the right consistency if it holds its shape when you form it into a ball. If it is too loose, continue adding the sugar.

, When the mixture has formed a thick dough, use clean hands to roll it into balls. Aim for balls that are approximately 1-inch (2.5-cm) large.You can adjust the size of the balls depending on how large you’d like the truffles to be.

, After you’ve formed balls from the dough, fill a shallow dish with 2 to 3 cups (150 to 225 g) of sweetened coconut.

, When the mixture reaches the right temperature, take the pot off the heat. Allow the mixture to cool for 8 to 10 minutes., Once the mixture has cooled, pour it out on a solid surface slab. The slab should be cool and slightly damp when you add the mixture to it.A quartz or granite countertop makes an ideal solid surface. If you don’t have the proper countertop, a quartz or granite slab cutting board will also work.
Don’t scrape out all of the mixture. If there are bits that are stuck, leave them in the pot.

, When the cream mixture is spread out on your slab, use a candy scraper or butter knife to work the mixture around the surface. Continue scraping it until it begins to thicken and is no longer glossy, which should take approximately 5 minutes. .Any straight edge tool should work for scraping the cream mixture. A clean wall scraper can even work.

, Once the cream mixture has thickened, add 2 teaspoons (10 ml) of vanilla, a dash of salt, and 1 ¼ cups (94 g) of the finely chopped coconut to it.

",How to Make Pumpkin Spice Cake Pops," Follow the specific recipe you are using, in addition to adding the cinnamon, pumpkin puree and spice, and brown sugar. Be sure to follow the regular ingredient amounts, utensils and baking dishes, steps or instructions, oven temperatures, and baking times as well.;
, Using a damp knife, cut the cake in sections or quarters. This allows the insides of the cake to cool down faster, rather than having the cake cool down from the outside in.

, When the cake pieces has reached room temperature or warm to handle, use your hands to crumble the cake in a large mixing bowl. You will want to break down any chunks, especially any hard corners.

, Start off with 1/4 cup of icing in the bowl. Use a wooden spoon to thoroughly incorporate the cake crumbs and icing together until you achieve a consistency of dough, as if you're making cookie dough. Add additional icing, if needed.

, Having the mixture chilled makes it easier for you to roll it into balls.

, Use a cookie dough scooper to help you make even ball amounts, about 1 tablespoon (15 grams). To avoid multitasking, scoop the entire mixture and place the balls onto a flat surface (such as a baking sheet or counter top), lined with parchment paper.

, Use both palms of your hands and circle each ball in a circular motion, to allow any flat surfaces become evenly round.

, For the best results, it's recommended to refrigerate the cake balls for at least two hours. By doing this, any coating won't affect the prepared cake when dipping.

, You can either use a microwave-safe bowl or create a double boiler. Stir the chocolate to make sure everything is melted evenly.

, Prick them in the center, just enough to pick them up from the parchment paper and hold.


If you're wanting to present the cake balls on a stick, it's recommended to use lollipop sticks, which can be found in specialty baking aisles. Dip about 1/2 inch (1.27 cm) of the stick into the melted chocolate prior to inserting them into the cake balls.
If you're wanting to present the cake balls in decorative individual wrappers, poke them with toothpicks.

, While holding the lollipop stick or toothpick, submerge the cake ball into the melted chocolate. When lifting it back up, gently lift them in a swirling motion or give them a gentle shake.


If you are using toothpicks, remove them from the balls. Add a very small amount of extra melted chocolate to cover the holes. You can use the back of a spoon to evenly spread out any extra coating as well.

Store your fudge in the refrigerator.",How to Make Salted Caramel Chocolate Fudge," Fudge is pretty sticky, so you won’t be pouring it directly into a pan. Instead, grease an 8-inch by 8-inch pan with a non-stick spray. Then, place a sheet of parchment paper or wax paper into the pan, making sure that it covers the bottom and sides completely, with a couple of inches to spare. Spray the paper with the non-stick cooking spray as well., Using a double boiler, or a homemade double boiler, start creating the chocolate mixture. Pour the chocolate chips, sweetened condensed milk, butter, bourbon, and vanilla into the top bowl. Set your stovetop to low heat so that the water in your double boiler begins to boil. Stir the ingredients as the chocolate begins to melt and the ingredients blend together.It’s important not to raise the heat too quickly, because the chocolate chips can burn easily.
Make sure to stir your mixture constantly as it’s on the stove.

, After everything is thoroughly mixed together, pour it into the pan you prepared. Use a rubber spatula to get all of the chocolate – you want to make as much fudge as possible! Smooth the surface of the fudge and make sure the entire pan is filled., You can make dulce de leche from scratch for this recipe. If you’d rather skip the extra work, you can also buy dulce de leche from your local grocery store (although you’d be more likely to find it in ethnic or specialty grocery stores). Warm the dulce de leche in your microwave until it is a consistency that can be easily poured., You can do this however you want. If you have a steady hand, you can make neat zigzagging stripes over your fudge. Otherwise, just pour it on! If you have enough dulce de leche, you can also certainly cover the entire pan of chocolate, so that there is a solid caramel layer at the top., The only thing missing from your salted caramel fudge is the actual salt. Instead of grabbing for regular table salt, sprinkle some coarse sea salt over the fudge. Not only will this taste better, but it’ll make your fudge look absolutely gourmet!, Place your pan in your refrigerator uncovered. The fudge will be cooled and ready to serve after about four hours. Ideally, you should leave it over night. This gives the caramel and chocolate type to really meld. After your fudge cools, it’ll be deliciously dense., The easiest way to cut through the dense dessert is with some warmth. Hold your knife under hot water for a couple of seconds, and then quickly dry it. Slice into your fudge immediately. Cut it into small squares, about half the size of a typical brownie (or even smaller). These are extremely rich., To keep your leftover fudge good, it’s best to store it in your refrigerator. It should be good for about two weeks. However, after you taste your fudge, it might not last that long! Enjoy."

, Stir until the butter is melted and the sugar dissolves. Stir occasionally until the mixture comes to a boil. Once it reaches this point, stir continuously while boiling for five minutes.

, Spread this over the chocolate layer in the pan, taking care to not disturb the chocolate and to spread it in an even layer. Return the pan to the refrigerator to set the peanut layer.

, Microwave until melted, stirring after every minute to prevent overheating. If the caramels are very stiff and resist melting, add another tablespoon of water, but only if completely necessary. (Adding too much liquid will make the caramel soft and cause it to ooze from the fudge once it is cut.)

, Smooth it into an even layer, and return the pan to the refrigerator to briefly set the caramel, for about 10 minutes.

Store or serve immediately.",How to Make Chocolate Strawberries," Discard any strawberries that show signs of damage:Mushy or leaking juice
Large white or green areas
Dry, brown caps instead of green
You can use strawberries with missing caps and stems, but they won't last as long.;
, Fill a colander with the strawberries. Rinse under cool, running water. Gently shake the colander to clean all sides of the strawberries.Don't wash the strawberries more than an hour in advance. They spoil quickly once washed.

, Even a drop of water can make the chocolate grainy and unpleasant. Pat dry, then space the strawberries out on dry paper towels to finish air drying. Leave them at room temperature to avoid condensation from the fridge., Push a toothpick into each strawberry cap. You can skip this if the stems are still attached.








, Parchment paper will work as well. Aluminum foil will prevent sticking just as well, but may leave a pattern on the chocolate strawberries.

, Besides the taste, cheap chocolate may not melt and harden evenly. Semisweet, bittersweet, or dark chocolate is easier to melt than milk and white chocolate.Use chocolate chips, or chop bars into even, ¼ inch (6 mm) pieces.
""Candy melts"" are extra-easy to use, but usually don't taste as good as real chocolate.If using a candy melt, follow the instructions on the label.

, This makes the chocolate smoother and easier to use as a dip. Mix in 2 teaspoons (10 milliliters) unsalted butter for every 8 ounces (225 grams) chocolate.Never use more than this, or the water in the butter could ruin the chocolate's texture.


Shortening has no liquid, so it will never ruin the chocolate. However, it should only be added after the chocolate has melted., You can make one of these at home by placing a stainless steel or heat-safe glass bowl over an ordinary pan. Fill the pan with an inch or two (2.5–5 cm) of water, but make sure it doesn't touch the bottom of the bowl.Bring the water to a simmer, then add chocolate to the bowl and stir until melted.


Use the lowest heat setting possible to keep the water simmering. Chocolate melts at low temperatures, and can separate if heated too high.

, Be aware that this method comes with a high risk of damaged chocolate. It should only be used for small amounts of dark or bittersweet chocolate. Set the microwave to defrost or the lowest power setting. Microwave the bowl of chocolate for 30 seconds, then take out and stir. Repeat in 15–30 second intervals until fully melted. Let stand 30 seconds, then stir one last time.Melted chocolate may still look shiny and hard, and will not feel hot. You'll have to give it a stir to test for melting.

, Leave the chocolate at room temperature for a couple minutes. It's easiest to dip strawberries in chocolate that's at around 100ºF (38ºC). This is roughly human body temperature, so it will feel tepid.

, Hold each strawberry by the stem or using a toothpick. Dip it into the melted chocolate, nearly up to the green cap. As you pull it out, give it a small shake. This fills in gaps in the chocolate and leaves a smooth line. Finish by rotating the strawberry to let excess chocolate drip off.







, Place the dipped strawberries upside-down on the baking sheet covered in wax paper. Space them so they don't touch, or they'll stick together.

, Sprinkle chopped nuts or sprinkles over the chocolate while it is still soft. Or, if you'd like to add a classic white chocolate drizzle, refrigerate the strawberries first. Melt the white chocolate the same way as before, then drizzle it over the hardened chocolate using a fork.








, Leave them in the refrigerator until the chocolate hardens completely. This should minimize the chance of white fat ""blooming"" to the surface.


The chocolate is still safe to eat if it does bloom. You may wish to decorate it as described above, in order to hide the white surface.

, These are best served the same day they are made. If storing them longer term, you have a few options:Room temperature: Hold flavor best, but only lasts 2–3 days. Keep covered but not in airtight container. May become limp. Hot temperatures will cause white fat blooms.

Refrigerator: Keeps for 5–7 days. Lay a paper towel at the base of a container and sprinkle with baking soda, then add berries and cover. This absorbs moisture, preventing sugar in the chocolate from forming white crystals.

Freezer: Best within 3 months, but keeps indefinitely. Chocolate must cover 100% of the strawberry to lock in juices. Freeze separated on a flat sheet first, to prevent sticking together.

Large heavy-bottomed saucepan
Wooden spoon
Pastry brush
Candy thermometer
10-inch square baking pan greased with butter, or lined with parchment paper
Pizza cutter or sharp knife;
, Combine them in the heavy-bottomed saucepan and heat over medium heat. Stir to combine, and continue stirring regularly until the sugar melts.It’s important to use a saucepan with a heavy, or thick, bottom because this will help prevent the sugar from burning.
Make sure you use heavy cream or heavy whipping cream, which both contain at least 36 percent butterfat. This fat quantity is required for the caramelization process., Stir in the butter until it melts. Once the butter has melted, bring the mixture to a boil, stirring frequently. As you wait for it to boil, brush down the sides of the saucepan with a pastry brush to remove as much sugar as possible.


Brushing the excess sugar off the sides will help prevent the caramel from crystallizing., When the mixture comes to a boil, stop stirring. Sit back and let the caramel heat up to 250 F (121 C). When it reaches that temperature, remove it from the heat and stir in the vanilla.It’s important that you don’t stir the caramel as it heats up, because the agitation can encourage the growth of sugar crystals, which will turn your soft and chewy caramel into a grainy mess.

, Immediately pour the mixture into the prepared baking pan. After you pour the caramel, you can sprinkle the top with a few pinches of salt if you want a salted caramel flavor. The salt complements the sweetness, and helps bring out the flavor of the caramel.Once the caramel has been poured, set it aside and let it cool to room temperature, about two hours.

, When the caramel has cooled, turn it out onto a flat surface. Use the pizza cutter or sharp knife to cut the caramels into one-inch (2.5-cm) squares.From here, the caramels are ready to eat, cover in chocolate, or package for gifts or storage.

, Whether you want to eat your caramels within a few days, give them out as gifts, or store them for a longer shelf life, it’s important to wrap them individually. This protects them from moisture, and from sticking together.For each caramel, cut a four-inch (10-cm) square of waxed paper, parchment paper, or plastic wrap. Wrap up each caramel square in an individual piece of paper, and then twist the ends to seal the caramel.Because of the milk in the recipe, room temperature caramels should be eaten within about three days., Once the caramels are individually wrapped, you can transfer them to a sealable plastic bag and store them in the refrigerator. Keeping them in a plastic bag will help keep them chewy and soft.Refrigerated caramel squares will last for about three months., To keep your caramels fresh for longer, transfer the individually wrapped treats to a freezer bag, press out all the air, and store them in the freezer.Before using or eating your caramels, give them a few hours to thaw completely.
Caramels stored in this way will last for up to six months.

, One way to make caramel squares even more decadent is by covering them with chocolate, and you can do this easily and with just one ingredient. You'll need:One pound (454 g) of milk or semi-sweet chocolate. Cut the chocolate into small pieces to help it melt faster and more evenly.
A double boiler. If you don’t have a double boiler, you can use a small saucepan and a large glass bowl.

, Fill the bottom of the double boiler with about an inch (2.5 cm) of water. Place the bowl or top of the double boiler on top, making sure it doesn’t touch the water. If it does, pour out a little of the water.


Place the chocolate into the top of the double boiler and heat it over medium heat. Stir it regularly.
When the chocolate has completely melted, whisk it vigorously until it’s shiny. Turn the heat down low to keep the chocolate warm as you work.

, When the chocolate is ready, drop a few caramels into it. Use two forks or spoons to roll each caramel around in the chocolate, coating each one evenly.


When the caramels are covered, transfer them to a sheet of wax or parchment paper and set them aside to cool before serving or wrapping.

Clean up.",How to Make Caramel1," You do not need any special equipment to make caramel, but the saucepan or skillet you use should be completely clean. Make sure the pot is heavy, solid, and light-colored so you can monitor the caramelization process. If you plan on adding cream to your caramel, be sure the pot you choose can accommodate the caramel's expansion.Any impurities in your pot or on your cooking utensil (spoon, spatula) can cause an unwanted reaction called recrystallization. Recrystallization is a chemical process by which impurities and a compound (sugar) are dissolved in a solvent (water) and either the impurities or the compound can be coaxed out of the solution, leaving the other behind. For our purposes, this means the formation of awful sugar clumps.
;
, Heated sugar can splatter, and burn you very badly. Wear long-sleeves, an apron, and an oven mitt. If you have glasses, wear them.


Keep a deep bowl of cold water nearby to plunge your hand in if caramel lands on it.


, Sprinkle the sugar in a thin layer at the bottom of your saucepan or skillet. Pour your water over the sugar slowly and evenly so all of the sugar is covered. Be sure there are no dry spots.


Only use granulated sugar. Brown sugar and powdered sugars contain too many impurities and will not caramelize. Raw sugar is not recommended.


, Cook the sugar and water on medium heat until the sugar dissolves. Watch the mix closely and swirl the pot if you notice any sugar clumps forming. Most clumps will melt during cooking.


To prohibit recrystallization, you can keep the pot covered until the sugar is completely melted. Any sugar crystals hanging on to the sides of the pot will be forced to the bottom by the condensation created.
Another trick to prevent recrystallization is to add a tiny amount (a drop or two) of lemon juice or cream of tartar to the sugar water mix right at the moment it begins to dissolve. These recrystallization ""agents"" prevents large crystal lumps from forming by coating the smaller crystals.
Some people also use a pastry brush dipped in water to wipe any sugar crystals off the sides of the pot during the heating process. While effective, the bristles can come off the brush and wind up in your beautiful caramel confection.


, Watch the sugar as it darkens. When it has reached the point of almost being burnt and when it is gently foaming and smoking, immediately remove it from the heat.


Because cookware and stoves do not always distribute heat evenly, it is important that you stand over the caramel during the entire process. Browning occurs quickly and caramel can burn quickly if left unattended., Add in the cream and butter to cool the pot and stop the cooking process. Stir with a whisk on low heat. Any lumps that remain can be strained out. Cool the caramel and store in an airtight container.


To make a salted caramel sauce, stir in 1/4 teaspoon of Kosher salt once the caramel mixture cools to room temperature.
To make a a vanilla caramel sauce, stir in 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract when you remove the caramel from the heat.

, Cleaning up your sticky pan may seem daunting, but it is fairly simple. Either soak your pan in warm water or fill the pan with water and bring it to a boil. Boiling will melt all of the caramel.

Refrigerate the apples for 1 to 2 hours.,
Finished.

",How to Make Caramel Apples1," Some apples come waxed, which can keep the caramel from sticking. If your apples came waxed, wash them using some baking soda and water., This will cool the apples down, and help the caramel coating harden faster.If the stick doesn't enter the apple easily, you can make a shallow slit using a sharp knife first. Make sure that the apples are secure on their sticks.

, The baking sheet needs to be large enough to fit all of the apples without touching. If you don't have wax paper, lightly coat the baking sheet with some cooking spray instead. This will keep the caramel apples from sticking to the sheet.

, This will take some time. If you are in a hurry, heat the caramel and water in the microwave instead. Place both into a microwave-safe bowl, and heat for about 3 minutes, stirring after each minute.The melted caramel should be thin enough to drip off of a spoon.

, As you lift the apple out of the sauce, give it a twist. This will help the caramel coat the apple more evenly. It will also help get rid of any excess caramel.


You can dip the apple into the sauce all the way, or only ¾ of the way., This will keep the caramel from pooling too much at the bottom of the apple., As soon as you finish dipping one apple, and scraping the bottom, set it down onto the baking sheet and move onto the next. Work quickly, as the wax will start to harden.


Remember to leave a little space between each apple on the backing sheet, or they will stick.
If the caramel sauce starts to harden, simply place the double-boiler back onto the stove, and heat it back up again.

, Once the caramel hardens, you can serve the apples. Some people prefer to leave the apples on the counter for about 15 minutes, so that they won't be too cold.

Cook the sugar syrup.,
Combine the butter and milk mixture with the sugar syrup.,
Bring the caramel mixture to a boil.,
Stir in the the vanilla.,
Pour the caramel mixture into the baking dish.,
Allow the caramels to set.,
Cut the caramels into pieces.,
Wrap the caramels in wax paper.",How to Make Caramels," You’ll need a mold to help form the caramels, and an 8-inch by 8-inch (20 cm by 20 cm) or 9-inch by 9-inch (23 cm by 23 cm) baking dish works best. To keep the caramels from sticking to the dish, line it with parchment paper so the excess hangs over the edge. Next, spray the sides of the dish and the paper with nonstick cooking spray.If you don’t have parchment paper, you can line your baking dish with foil instead.
You can substitute butter for the cooking spray, but be careful not to apply too much.;
, In a small sauce pan, combine 1 cup (237 ml) heavy cream, 4 tablespoons (454 g) unsalted butter, and ¼ teaspoon (4 g) salt. Heat the ingredients over medium heat until the butter melts completely. It should take approximately 5 minutes. Remove the saucepan from the heat, but keep it close by.Cutting the butter into pieces can help it melt more quickly.

, In a larger sauce pan, combine 1 ½ cups (300 g) granulated sugar, ¼ cup (60 ml) corn syrup, and ¼ cup (59 ml) water. Stir the mixture gently to moisten the sugar and form a thick paste.Wipe down the sides of the pan to ensure that there are no sugar crystals above the surface of the sugar mixture before heating it. You can use a damp paper towel or pastry brush to wipe away the sugar.
Don’t try to combine your ingredients in a small sauce pan. The sugar will triple in size when you eventually add the cream so it can overflow if you use a smaller pan., Clip a candy thermometer to the side of the pan so you can monitor the mixture’s temperature. Next, place the sugar mixture on the stove at medium to medium high heat. Allow the syrup to come to a boil without stirring it at all. Let it cook for approximately 5 to 10 minutes or until the mixture reaches approximately 320 degrees Fahrenheit (160 degrees Celsius).At 320 degrees Fahrenheit (160 degrees Celsius), the syrup will darken, taking on a golden color. You may also notice that it starts to smell like caramel.
Don’t allow the mixture to go above 325 degrees Fahrenheit (163 degrees Fahrenheit) or it may burn.

, Once the sugar syrup has reached the right temperature, turn off the heat. Slowly add the cream and butter mixture to the syrup, whisking gently to fully incorporate it. After you’ve finished adding all of the cream and butter to the pan, stop whisking.When you mix in the cream and butter, the sugar syrup will triple in size as it bubbles up. Don’t be alarmed.

, Once the cream mixture is fully incorporated into the sugar syrup, turn the heat under the pan back up to medium or medium-high, and bring the caramel mixture to a boil. Don’t stir the caramel as it boils. Remove the pan from the heat when the mixture reaches 245 to 250 degrees Fahrenheit (118 to 121 degrees Celsius).The caramel mixture will start out a golden color, but gradually deepen to a reddish-brown caramel shade as it cooks.

, Right after you remove the caramel from the heat, whisk in ½ teaspoon (2.5 ml) vanilla extract into the mixture. Work quickly so the mixture doesn’t get too thick before you fully incorporate the vanilla., As soon as you’ve finished whisking in the vanilla, transfer the caramel to your prepared baking dish. Don’t scrape the bottom of the pan to get out all of the mixture because there may be some burnt bits that you don’t want in the candy. To get out all of the good caramel from you pan, you can knock it against the counter a couple of times. That will break any air bubbles and allow the caramel to flow more freely.

, Once the caramel is in the mold, it needs time to set before you can cut and eat it. Place the pan in an out of the way spot, and allow it to sit for at least three hours. Once the caramels reach room temperature, though, you can cover the dish.For the best results, let your caramels set over night.
If you want to add any toppings to your caramel, such as sea salt or shaved chocolate, do it after approximately 20 to 30 minutes of setting. The caramels won’t be so soft that they’ll absorb the topping, but they’ll still be soft enough for the toppings to stick.

, Once the caramel is completely set, you can cut it into pieces. Lift the caramel out of the pan using the edge of the parchment paper, and use a very sharp knife to cut the caramels into your chosen shape. A 1-inch by ½ inch (2.5 cm by 1.2 cm) rectangle is a classic option.If your caramel is still too soft to work with, place the pan in the refrigerator for 30 minutes to an hour to help it firm up.

, After you’ve cut the caramels, cut small pieces of wax paper that are slightly longer than the candies. Wrap each caramel in the paper, twisting the ends to seal them.The caramels should stay fresh for approximately two weeks if kept at room temperature.

You could also dip the bananas into the butter and let it sit, but this will make the bananas extremely buttery.

, Sprinkle the brown sugar to cover all of the bananas.

, Flip immediately and then coat that side with sugar as well. Let them sit for about one minute.

, Pour the rest of the sugar in. Let most of it sit in the pan now, in order for the brown sugar to melt and create a rich caramel.

Line a slice pan with foil or parchment paper.,
Heat the sugar and water in a saucepan.,
Heat the mixture to a light amber color.,
Add cream, butter, corn syrup, and salt.,
Cook to ""soft ball"" stage.,
Beat until thick.,
Pour the mixture into the lined pan.,
Let the caramel cool.,
Divide the fudge.",How to Make Caramel Fudge1," Any baking pan will work, but this recipe makes a good thickness of fudge in 8x8 or 9x9 pans. Spray the paper with a light cooking spray or rub with butter.


The greased paper will make the fudge much easier to remove and slice once it's finished.;
, Using a slow, steady heat and a heavy pan will give the best results here. Try starting the sugar on medium-low heat and only turning the burner up cautiously. Turn down the heat slightly once you notice boiling to keep the mixture at a gentle simmer.


Only stir until the sugar dissolves in the water. It can be tempting to give the mixture lots of vigorous stirring, but this can actually mess up the texture by introducing air and causing clumps to form., Let the mixture continue at a gentle simmer without stirring. As the water evaporates and the sugar starts to caramelize, the liquid will gradually turn amber-colored, then orange-ish brown as it thickens. You're looking for a light amber shade — the caramel should still be quite fluid at this point.

, Add each of these gradually and in order. Cut the butter into thin slices and toss them throughout the mixture so they incorporate well. At this point, you can and should start stirring again. Fold the edges of the caramel (which usually cook faster) in from the sides of the pan to the center.Be careful when you add the cream — the caramel can bubble and sputter when it touches liquid. At this point, it's very hot and sticky, so you do not want to get hit with any splatter. Try wearing gloves and adding the cream at arm's length.

, Fill a cup or bowl with cold water. Your caramel is ready when a small amount of dropped into the water can be gathered and pressed into a soft, gooey ball. This is, appropriately, called the ""soft ball stage."" If it only forms soft strands, it's not done yet. If it forms a firm or hard ball, you've gone too far.


At this point, the mixture should have a pleasantly tan or brown color turned somewhat orange by the cream. Keep a close eye on your caramel — it can go from ""under-done"" to ""burnt"" in a matter of minutes.

, Remove the caramel from the heat. Use an electric mixer (or, if you're careful, a whisk or spoon) to beat the mixture. As you beat it, it will gradually become thick, smooth and somewhat firm. This can take three to five minutes. Use your best judgement — if the texture seems appealing, you're probably fine.

, Be careful as you pour it — it is still very hot and sticky. Protective mitts or gloves are a must.

, Set the pan full of hot caramel into the fridge (uncovered) for about one hour. Remove it, cover it, and set it back in the fridge to cool for two to four more hours. When it's pleasantly firm but chewy, transfer it out of the fridge and set it on the counter (somewhere safe from children and pets) until it comes to room temperature.

, Carefully pull the baking parchment out of the pan to lift the fudge in a single block. Use a kitchen knife to chop it into small cubes. Serve these as-is or in a decorative arrangement for a gift box.


Small pieces are best — this recipe is very dense.

Put the sugar in a pan.,
Heat the sugar.,
Brown the sugar.,
Cool it down.,
Now you have your caramel sauce!",How to Make Caramel2," Sprinkle an even layer of sugar in the bottom of a heavy skillet or saucepan. Be sure the pan is large enough to accommodate the sugar's expansion.

, Cook the sugar on medium heat. You will notice the edges of the sugar will begin to brown and cook first. With a clean heatproof utensil, push the liquefied sugar towards the middle of the pan.


You want to make sure to move the liquefied sugar so it doesn't begin to burn. Once burnt, it cannot be saved.
If lumps begin to form, turn down the heat slightly and stir slowly. The lumps should melt by the time you are done., The process here will begin to speed up, so don't leave the stove. Watch as the sugar deepens in color to a rich amber. If a recipe you are using calls for the addition of a liquid (like cream), add it in now to cool the pan and slow the cooking process.


Use caution when adding liquid to the pan as it will bubble up.
If you are using the caramel in a mold (for flan or crème caramel) pour it into the mold now.
To make pralines, add a cup of toasted, chopped nuts to the pan. Stir them slightly with a couple pinches of salt, and pour the mixture onto a wax-paper lined baking sheet to cool., If you are not adding liquid to your caramel, another way to cool it down (and stop the cooking process) is to set the base of the pan in a large bowl of cold water. Clean the pan by soaking or boiling water in the pan until all of the caramel has melted away.

, Enjoy!

",How to Make Caramel Apples2," If your apples came waxed, the caramel will not stick. In this case, you'll want to wash them using water and baking soda.

, If you find the sticks difficult to insert, make a shallow slit in the apple first using a sharp knife. Make sure that the apples are secure on the sticks.


The caramel coating will harden faster on cold apples than room-temperature ones.

, If you don't have wax paper, lightly coat the baking sheet with cooking spray. This will prevent the apples from sticking to it. Also, make sure that the baking sheet is large enough to fit all the apples without them touching.

, Save the remaining ¼ cup (60 milliliters) of heavy cream for later. To help the butter melt faster, cut it into small cubes first.

, Use a candy thermometer to gauge the temperature. As the ingredients cook, they will turn a golden color. This will take about 8 to 10 minutes., Avoid stirring too much. Stir just enough to mix the cream and vanilla into the caramel. You want the color and texture to be even and consistent, with not streaks or swirls.

, Once the caramel cools, take your first apple and dip it into the sauce. As you lift it out, give the stick a twist. This will help the caramel coat the apple more evenly. It will also get rid of any excess caramel.


You can dip the apple into the caramel all the way, or only ¾ of the way.
You want the caramel to still be liquid enough to drip off the back of the spoon.

, This will get rid of excess caramel, and prevent caramel puddles from forming on your baking sheet.

, This will give the apple some extra texture. After dipping the apple, be sure to scrape the bottom again with your knife or spoon. This will allow the apple to sit more evenly on your baking sheet.


You can use any type of chopped nuts, but popular choices include peanuts, walnuts/pecans, or pistachios.
If you don't like nuts, you can use other goodies, such as sprinkles, chocolate chips, or crushed candy.

, Keep dipping the apples into the caramel sauce and setting them down onto the wax paper until you have none left. Remember to leave some space between each apple so that they don't stick together.


If the caramel sauce starts to harden, simply place the saucepan back onto the stove, and heat it back up again.

, Once the caramel hardens, you can serve the apples. Some people like to leave the apples on the counter for about 15 minutes so they won't be as cold.

, You can do this in the microwave, but if you have the time, using a double boiler usually works best. See our article on double boilers for more information. In either case, low, gentle heat works best to prevent the white chocolate from burning or seizing.

, Pour the milk, dulce de leche, melted white chocolate, vanilla, butter, golden syrup, and sugar into a pot over medium-low heat. Stir to combine. When the ingredients form a smooth, thick mixture, increase the heat to reach a boil.


Don't have a can of dulce de leche? Don't worry — you can make your own with a can of condensed milk. Click here.

, Reduce the heat to maintain a gentle simmer. Let the caramel simmer as you stir for about 10 minutes until you reach a rich golden color.If you smell smoke or notice your caramel becoming a darker, orange-brown color, remove it from the heat immediately.

, Expect to beat the caramel for about three to five minutes. When it reaches a thick but smooth consistently, it's ready.


Just like in the recipe above, you can use an electric mixer or a spoon. In either case, be sure to wear protective mitts or gloves to prevent burns from caramel splatters.

, Transfer to the fridge to cool. It should be firm but chewy after a few hours.

, The caramel should come easily out of the pan with the parchment or foil. Use a kitchen knife to cut the fudge block into small cubes. It should be ready to eat immediately.

, Dulce de leche is a thick, brown, caramel-flavored spread that comes in a can and is found in the ""Hispanic Foods"" section of most grocery stores. It's perfect for caramel fudge recipes, but if you don't have any, it's easy to make from ordinary condensed milk. Follow the steps in this subsection to make your own., Start by removing the can's label. Set the can on its side in a large soup pot or dutch oven. Add water to the pot until it covers the pan generously (at least two inches above it).


This is crucial — if you don't cover the can with water completely, it can rupture or explode.

, Heat the pot to a boil, then reduce the heat to maintain a gentle simmer. Don't forget to reduce the heat. If you do, the condensed milk can burn.

, The exact amount of time you will need to cook the can for is a matter of taste. Generally, you'll want to simmer for about two to three hours (the longer you cook it, the darker and more bitter it will be).


Check the water level occasionally — the can must always be submerged completely, so add more water as needed.

, Careful — it will be hot. Use a slotted spoon or a pair of tongs to protect yourself. Let the can cool to room temperature before opening.



Don't open it while it's hot. Because of the built-up pressure in the can, this can cause it to sputter hot dulce de leche at you.

Use as a dipping sauce for strawberries.",How to Make Caramel Fudge3," Caramel fudge is great, but if you can't stand fudge without chocolate, don't worry — it's easy to make caramel-chocolate fudge. Start by making either of the recipes above. When your caramel fudge is in its lined baking pan, melt some chocolate (of your preferred darkness). Pour this chocolate over the fudge in a single thin layer. When your fudge comes out of the fridge, it'll have a delicious chocolate stripe running along the top!See our article on melting chocolate for help.

, Salt and caramel is a classic combination — just like peaches and cream and mustard and mayo. Sprinkling just a pinch of your best sea salt over the top of a plate of caramel fudge will give the sweet dish a subtle but mouthwatering ""bite.""


If you don't have fancy Himalayan salt, plain table salt also works well.
The trick here is not to use too much. Pouring loads of salt on your caramel can completely overpower its flavor.

, Walnuts, peanuts, pistachios, almonds, and other nuts all pair well with the smooth taste of caramel. Chop your favorite nut and toss it over a plate of fudge or use a mix of nuts — it's up to you!


If you're serving your fudge at a party, be sure to label it with ""contains nuts"" for the benefit of anyone with allergies.

, Salt, caramel, and strawberries may not seem like they go together, but one taste will have you convinced! Try serving these ingredients with a set of skewers for some easy at-home fondue.


Ripe strawberries are much better than unripe ones here — their sweetness goes with caramel much better than the tart flavor of unripe strawberries.

",How to Make Caramel Cream Candies," When making caramel cream candies, you will need to do several things to prepare yourself. Read the guidelines below to help you do this.


Wash your hands. While making these candies, you will be touching foods, stirring mixture, and cutting things. Wash your hands to prevent germs from getting into your food and making others sick.



 


Tie your hair back if it is long. In this recipe, you need to boil certain things, and you wouldn't want to scald your hair in the process.






Make sure that your supplies are clean and that your ingredients are not stale. Dirty supplies, such as knives and bowls will spread germs and unwanted excess food in your recipe. Stale foods could make you sick or leave a terrible taste in your mouth. To help prevent this, clean your supplies in the dishwasher and check the expiration date of your ingredients.





;
, The cooking spray will help you prevent the ingredients you pour on from sticking to the pan. This will also save you from having to shake the pan and causing an unwanted mess in the process.

, If desired, add any alternative ingredients, such as sprinkles, chocolate pieces, or cut-up strawberries into the mixture as well. Stir with a whisk or spoon over medium hear until the sugar begins to dissolve and the butter strips melt.

, Cover the saucepan with a top and wait three minutes. Be sure to check often, and be sure not to boil past the time limit.

, Be sure to do this with an oven mitt on. Continue to boil at 250 degrees but do not stir. Stirring will make the mixture too moist and frothy, therefore leaving your candies squishy and fragile.

, Smooth carefully with the back of a spoon and let it cool for 5-8 minutes.

, Once firm, cut your treats into bite-sized pieces and wrap individually in wax paper or cling wrap. Candies can be stored in Tupperware containers at a room temperature.

Get some un-popped corn kernels.,
Heat 1½ tablespoon of oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat.Use a heavy-bottomed, 3-quart (3-liter) saucepan.This will ensure that the popcorn has enough room to pop.,
Add three corn kernels, and wait for them to pop.,
Add the rest of the corn kernels, and spread them around.,
Cover the saucepan with a lid, then take it off of the stove for 30 seconds.,
Put the saucepan back onto the stove, and cook the popcorn.,
Turn off the heat, hold the lid down tightly for a few seconds, and shake the saucepan one last time.,
Transfer the popped corn into a large bowl.,
Preheat your oven to 200 to 250ºF (94 to 122ºC).,

Take the saucepan off the stove and stir in the baking soda and vanilla extract.,
Slowly pour the caramel sauce over the popcorn.,
Spread the popcorn across two large, lightly-greased baking dishes.,
Bake the popcorn for 1 hour, stirring it every 15 minutes.Carefully place the baking sheets into the oven and set the timer for 1 hour.,
Take the popcorn out of the oven, spread it onto a sheet of parchment paper, and let it cool.The popcorn may have clumped together.,
Try salted caramel corn.,
Give it a crunch with chopped walnuts of pecans.,
Add in some color with candy.,
Add some spices to the caramel sauce.,
Make some ""zebra"" caramel corn.",How to Make Caramel Corn," You will need 2 ounces (42 grams) of un-popped corn kernels to make 8 cups (88 grams) of popped popcorn. Be sure to get the plain, un-seasoned kind.You can also pre-popped corn. If you choose to go that route, make sure that you get the plain, unflavored kind, and skip down to {{#sauce|making the caramel sauce}}. You will need 8 cups (88 grams) of popped popcorn.;
,









If your saucepan is smaller, then you will need to do this in two batches.
If you don't have vegetable oil or peanut oil, try another type of oil with a high smoking point, such as canola or coconut., This will let you know when the saucepan is hot enough for the rest of the popcorn.

, This will help them get evenly coated with oil. Make sure that the corn kernels are distributed evenly across the bottom of the saucepan.








, This will bring everything down to the same temperature. It will help all of the corn kernels to pop at the same time and reduce scorching.







, Once the corn kernels start to pop rapidly, shake the saucepan back-and-forth across the burner. This helps the corn pop evenly as well as prevents scorching. Keep the saucepan on the stove until the popping slows down to several seconds apart.









Keep the lid tilted open slightly. This will let the steam escape, and give you nice, dry, crispy popcorn., Sometimes, not off of the corn kernels pop. This will knock them to the bottom of the saucepan, and pop them.







, To get rid of any un-popped corn kernels, give the bowl a good shake, then use a cup to scoop the popcorn out and into another bowl.







, You will be using the oven to dry the popcorn later on. While it is pre-heating, you can make the caramel sauce.









, Place a medium-sized saucepan on the stove. Cut the butter into cubes, then put it into the saucepan. Let it melt over medium heat, then stir in the sugar, corn syrup, and salt using a rubber spatula.








, Stir the mixture as it comes to a boil. Once it starts to boil, stop, and set your rubber spatula aside. Let the mixture cook without stirring for 4 minutes.









If you have a candy thermometer, use it to test the temperature. The ideal temperature should be between 250 and 300°F (122 and 149°C).If you want extra crunchy popcorn, cook the popcorn until you see wisps of smoke., The caramel may start to fizz at this point, which is fine. Keep stirring until everything is evenly combined.







, If you have not already, transfer the popcorn into a large bowl. Pour the caramel over the popcorn slowly, stirring the popcorn as you do so. The corn needs to be evenly coated.








, Lightly grease the baking dishes first, then spread the popcorn across them as evenly as you can. If your baking dishes are small, then you may need to use a third one.








, Give the popcorn a stir with a rubber spatula ever 15 minutes. This will help the popcorn bake evenly, and prevents it from getting soggy.









, You can leave it like this, or you can break it apart using a spatula.








, Increase the salt to 2 teaspoons. Just after you have taken the popcorn out of the oven, sprinkle some sea salt over it., After you have popped the corn, stir in about 3 cups (375 grams) of chopped walnuts of pecans. Next, stir in your caramel sauce, and proceed with the rest of the recipe., Make the caramel corn according to the recipe, but reserve about ¼ to ½ cup (60 to 120 milliliters) of the sauce. After the popcorn has cooled, spread it out onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, and drizzle the rest of the caramel sauce over it. Toss in a handful of mini chocolate caramels, such as Rollo's, and another handful of candy-coated chocolates, such as M&Ms. Stir everything together, and serve. M&Ms come in seasonal blends and colors, such as red and green for Christmas, and orange, yellow, and brown for Halloween/Thanksgiving.

, After you have finished the sauce, stir in some of your favorite ground baking spices along with the vanilla extract. You will need at least 3 teaspoons. Great options include pumpkin pie spice, apple pie spice, and cinnamon., Make your caramel corn first, then let it cool. Melt ½ cup (90 grams) of semi-sweet chocolate chips in the microwave on medium for 2 minutes. Give it a stir, then heat it at 20-second intervals, stirring in between, until it is smooth. Drizzle it over the caramel corn. Repeat with ½ cup (90 grams) of white chocolate ships. Wait for the chocolate to harden, then serve."

",How to Make Chocolate Chip Cake Ball Pops," Follow the specific recipe you are using, including ingredient amounts, utensils and baking dishes, steps or instructions, oven temperatures, and baking times.;
, Using a damp knife, cut the cake in sections or quarters. This allows the insides of the cake to cool down faster, rather than having the cake cool down from the outside in.

, When the cake pieces has reached room temperature or warm to handle, use your hands to crumble the cake in a large mixing bowl. You will want to break down any chunks, especially any hard corners.

, Start off with 1/4 cup of icing in the bowl. Use a wooden spoon to thoroughly incorporate the cake crumbs and icing together until you achieve a consistency of dough, as if you're making cookie dough. Add additional icing, if needed.

, Having the mixture chilled makes it easier for you to roll it into balls.

, Use a cookie dough scooper to help you make even ball amounts, about 1 tablespoon (15 grams). To avoid multitasking, scoop the entire mixture and place the balls onto a flat surface (such as a baking sheet or counter top), lined with parchment paper.

, Use both palms of your hands and circle each ball in a circular motion, to allow any flat surfaces become evenly round.

, For the best results, it's recommended to refrigerate the cake balls for at least two hours. By doing this, any coating won't affect the prepared cake when dipping.

, You can either use a microwave-safe bowl or create a double boiler. Stir the chocolate to make sure everything is melted evenly.

, Prick them in the center, just enough to pick them up from the parchment paper and hold.


If you're wanting to present the cake balls on a stick, it's recommended to use lollipop sticks, which can be found in specialty baking aisles. Dip about 1/2 inch (1.27 cm) of the stick into the melted chocolate prior to inserting them into the cake balls.
If you're wanting to present the cake balls in decorative individual wrappers, poke them with toothpicks.

, While holding the lollipop stick or toothpick, submerge the cake ball into the melted chocolate. When lifting it back up, gently lift them in a swirling motion or give them a gentle shake.


If you are using toothpicks, remove them from the balls. Add a very small amount of extra melted chocolate to cover the holes. You can use the back of a spoon to evenly spread out any extra coating as well.

, Place the chocolate covered cake ball in the same place on the waxed paper. Pick up the next one and repeat the dipping until everything is covered.

, You can create even zig-zag lines by moving your arm back and forth in a uniform way across the entire sheet of cake balls.

, You can either use additional mini chocolate chips or add cookies in a food processor to make crumbs.

, To ensure a hard coating and for any toppings to appear more uniform, place the cake balls in the freezer or refrigerator for about an hour or two.

Read the package instructions to determine what other ingredients to add to it and how to mix the batter properly.In most cases, you’ll need to add water, some type of oil, and eggs to the box cake mix.
You can use any flavor of cake mix that you like for the cake pops. Batters that are lighter in color, such as vanilla or lemon, may work better, though, because you’re covering them with light colored candy melts.
If you prefer, you can use your favorite from-scratch cake recipe for the cake pops.;
, After you’ve mixed the cake batter, pour it into a greased 9-inch by 13-inch (23-cm by 33-cm) cake pan. Next, place the cake in the oven and bake it according to the package instructions.You can use a nonstick cooking spray or coat it with shortening or butter and lightly dust it with flour to grease the cake pan.
The packaging instructions will likely require preheating your oven to a certain temperature. Read the instructions carefully so you can start to preheat the oven before you mix the batter.

, When the cake is finished baking, remove the pan from the oven. Let the cake sit in the pan for 10 to 15 minutes afterward, so it has time to cool., When the cake has cooled, use a knife to loosen it and remove it from the pan. Use clean hands to crumble the cake into a large bowl.If there are any hard or burnt bits in the cake, remove them as you break it up.

, Once the cake is crumbled in the bowl, add 1 cup (256 g) of frosting and mix well.

, For the flower cake pops, you’ll need 24 ounces (680 g) of yellow candy melts. Place them in a microwave-safe bowl and microwave them on high for a minute. Stir the mixture, and microwave it for another 45 seconds on medium-high.Be careful not to overheat the candy melts. If they aren’t melted after a minute and 45 seconds, continue to heat them in 10 seconds intervals, stirring after each.
You can use any color of candy melt that you like for the cake pops, but the coating will cover the outside of the flower’s center so yellow usually works best.

, When the candy melts are ready, remove the cake pop balls from the refrigerator. Dip a lollipop stick into the melted candy melts and then insert it halfway into the cake pop balls.Make sure to cover a ¼ inch (6-mm) of the end of the lollipop stick before pressing it into the cake pop ball.

, With the stick in place, carefully dip the cake pop into the melted candy melts. Move it up and down in a smooth motion to ensure that it’s completely coated. Gently Tap the pop against the side of the bowl to remove the excess and place it in a cake pop stand.Be careful not to move the pop around in the candy melts too much or you may loosen the stick.
If you don’t have a cake pop stand, a piece of craft foam works well to hold the cake pops upright as they set.

, While the candy melt coating is still soft, add a few white sprinkles to the top of the ball. Repeat the process of coating and adding sprinkles to all of the cake pops and allow them to dry for 30 to 60 minutes.You can substitute any color of sprinkles for the white.

, For the flower cake pops, you’ll need 24 ounces (680 g) of premade, precolored fondant in your choice of color. Break off a small piece of the fondant and roll it with a rolling pin until it’s smooth and approximately ¼ inch (6-mm) thick.You can use any color of fondant that you’d like to form the cake pop flowers’ petals.
To keep the fondant from sticking to the surface and rolling pin, grease them lightly with shortening.

, When the fondant is rolled out, use a 2-inch (5-cm) flower-shaped cookie cut to cut out the cake pops’ petals. Repeat the process to make enough flowers for all of the cake pops, rolling out more fondant as necessary., After you’ve cut out all of the flower shapes, carefully lift the fondant flower off your work surface. Use a hole punch to create a small hole in the center of the flower.If you don’t have a hole punch, you can use a sturdy straw to create holes in the fondant.

, Once the fondant flower has a hole it the center, place the lollipop stick from a cake pop through the hole. Press the foundation petals up around the cake pop to form the flower. Repeat the process with all of the cake pops.The fondant will remain soft, so be careful when you handle it.
The fondant will be slightly tacky, which means it should adhere to the cake pop without any help.

, When you’ve finished forming all of the cake pops into flowers, they are ready to serve. For a striking presentation, place the pops in a vase like real flowers and set out on your dessert table.If you like, you can hot glue green ribbon around the lollipop sticks to create decorative “stems” for the cake pop flowers.

Temper the chocolate. Place the bowl of melted chocolate into a bowl with ice water, and stir slowly but constantly. Once it begins to thicken, crystallization or ""tempering"" occurs, and you can remove it from the cold water. The trick is to warm it again without overheating and losing the tempering. Place the bowl over the pot of warm water if need be, to loosen up the chocolate a bit. For more details, read How to temper chocolate.

, Pour a third of the melted and tempered chocolate over the almonds in the bowl. With a rubber spatula, completely coat the almonds. Keep stirring until the chocolate starts to set on the almonds.


If the chocolate isn't setting after 6 minutes, then place in the fridge for 2-3 minutes to speed things up.
Separate any clusters that have formed. Each coated almond should be individual.

, Stir through once again until the chocolate sets. Add the last chocolate and repeat until all chocolate has been stirred in and has set over the almonds. Again, separate any clusters that form.


You can stop here and simply have chocolate coated almonds without a dusting of cocoa powder. Or, you can proceed to the next step and give them a ""powdered"" finish.

Determine your beverage.,

Create the openings through which you'll slam.,
Suck your drink through the Tim Tam.,
Slam the melty treat into your mouth.",How to Do the Tim Tam Slam," You can drink virtually anything with your Tim Tams, so long as the liquid is not too thick. Pudding, for example, would likely be difficult to Tim Tam slam. Research done by Arnott's, the company that created the Tim Tam, indicates some favorite beverages you might want to Tim Tam slam, including...Coffee
Port
Hot chocolate;
, If you do not live in Australia, you may have difficulty finding this delicious treat. While local grocers might not stock Tim Tams, you may be able to find these at an international food store or multicultural market.There are many different varieties to choose from, including Tim Tam fingers and flavored Tim Tams. To accomplish the traditional slam, you'll want the biscuits labeled ""Original"" on the packaging.
You may find that the long, thin version of Tim Tams, Tim Tam Fingers, make an even better straw. You may want to give this a shot once you've experienced the traditional Tim Tam slam with the original biscuit., Open your pack of Tim Tams and remove one from the packaging. You'll want to hold the Tim Tam between your pointer finger and thumb, with your fingers being placed roughly in the middle of the cracker.


You may want to have some napkins or paper towel on hand. The Tim Tam will melt as your beverage passes through it. The melted chocolate will transfer to your fingers easily., You're going to create a straw with your biscuit by nibbling two diagonally opposite corners of the Tim Tam. Be sure you eat enough of the corner that you can see the creamy chocolate filling that is between the two crackers.


The creamy middle is the route through which you'll be slurping your drink. If you have not eaten away enough of the malted wafer, it will be difficult for you to draw your beverage up through the Tim Tam., Now that there's an opening at opposite ends of your biscuit, you can dunk one of your nibbled off ends into beverage and begin sucking at the opposite nibbled off end. This should draw the liquid up through the Tim Tam.


Your Tim Tam will also begin to absorb whatever you are drinking. Some beverages will absorb more quickly than others, but eventually your Tim Tam will become saturated.
Timing is important at this point in the slam. If you wait too long, your Tim Tam might fall apart into your drink. If you jump the gun, you might find your Tim Tam hasn't reached optimal saturation.
You should avoid drinking beverages that are too hot with your Tim Tam. This could result in you burning your mouth! If your drink just came out of the coffee pot, microwave, or off the stove, you may want to wait a few minutes., Once the Tim Tam has become a delicious, gooey mess of chocolate, you should quickly put it in your mouth before it falls apart and you lose it in your drink! You may want to insert your fingers into your mouth along with the biscuit so that you can lick away any residual chocolate.You should always wash your hands before eating, and especially before doing the Tim Tam slam. The melty chocolate can mix easily with dirt or bacteria on your fingers and get in your mouth."

Stir the almond bark constantly.",How to Melt Almond Bark1," It is easier to melt almond bark when it has been cut into smaller pieces. If your almond bark came in small disks, as it sometimes does, you do not need to chop it up., A double boiler is made up of two components--a large pan filled with water and another, smaller pan that sits on top. Double boilers help to ensure that your chocolate does not burn while you are melting it because you are heating it indirectly through the use of both pans., Place the top pan containing the chocolate on top of the larger pan with the water. Turn the heat to medium to high heat.

, The bark will begin to melt almost instantly. Stir it to keep the bark from burning. When all of the chunks are melted, turn the heat off and remove the top pan from the lower one.

, When the time is up, take the bowl out (be careful, it may be hot), stir the bark, and then put it back in the microwave. Continue to heat the bark in 15 second increments, taking it out and stirring each time. The reason you need to heat it at such small increments is because almond bark burns easily."

",How to Mold Chocolate Candy," Don't confuse with baker's chocolate, which is unsweetened. Do not use chocolate chips, baking chocolate or store bought chocolate bars because they are the wrong thickness/fluidity (technical word is ""viscosity"") for molding.






;
, Clear plastic is the best choice for beginners. Molds are generally inexpensive and come in a variety of shapes.








, This step is extremely important to yield a visually appealing final product with the proper texture and mouth feel. Melt your chocolate over a double boiler. To temper chocolate:








, For milk and white, heat to 113 °F (45 °C) and cool to 82 °F (28 °C).








, Make sure you get an even coating on all sides of the mold and in all the nooks and crannies.








,, Place it back in the freezer. Repeat this process until you have a solid shell of chocolate (this is where the clear plastic mold will come in handy; check the underside of the mold to look for any thinner spots or holes). Depending on the size of the mold, you will probably need about seven layers.








, Using a spoon, fill the mold(s) to the brim with chocolate. Replace in the freezer and leave for several hours (or overnight) for security. When you take them out, turn your mold gently over a counter or cutting board. The chocolates should come out without too much trouble, but if you find them getting stuck, tap the mold firmly against the counter or flex the mold a little, and that should free them.

Note that chocolate chips and most chocolate wafers are usually small enough to use without chopping.;
, Spread the chocolate out evenly in the top bowl of a double boiler or in a heat-resistant glass bowl that can fit safely and securely on top of a saucepan.


You should never let water come into direct contact with water as you melt it. Doing so may cause the chocolate to seize up, and the texture and consistency will become nearly impossible to work with.

, Fill the double boiler bottom or a saucepan with roughly 2 inches (5 cm) of water.


You should only use enough water to just barely fill the bottom pan without touching the bottom of your glass bowl once you place the bowl inside.

, Place the top part of the double boiler back into the bottom and place the entire thing on the stove. Heat over low heat until it begins to simmer.


Do not let the water come into direct contact with the bottom of the bowl as it simmers. You need the steam to reach the bottom of the bowl, but the water itself will be too hot.
Make sure that the bowl you use for your double boiler fits securely enough to prevent steam from getting into your chocolate as it melts. The chocolate needs steam to melt, but the moisture from the steam could be enough on its own to cause the chocolate to seize.

, Stir the chocolate continuously with a spatula until it melts and becomes smooth.


Continue stirring until there are no lumps. This may take a few minutes.

, Place the bowl on a dry kitchen towel to remove the moisture from the bottom.

, Heat the corn syrup in the microwave for about 30 seconds to warm it up slightly.


The corn syrup should not be hot. If it gets too hot, it could burn the chocolate.
You could use room temperature corn syrup, but warm corn syrup will be easier to blend in.
The amount of corn syrup you need will vary depending on the type of chocolate you are using. Chocolate with a higher fat content needs less corn syrup, while chocolate with a lower fat content and higher cacao content will need more corn syrup.

, Add the warm corn syrup to the melted chocolate and immediately begin stirring it in.


The chocolate will stiffen as soon as you add the corn syrup.
Do not over-mix the chocolate at this point. You only need to mix it about 20 times or so., If you want to add color to an entire batch of white chocolate, the easiest way to do so is to add the food coloring into the chocolate as you add the corn syrup and blend them both in simultaneously.


You can only add color to white modeling chocolate.
If you only want to add color to a small amount of modeling chocolate, you can do so later on by kneading it in after the modeling chocolate has already cooled.

, Wrap the chocolate in plastic wrap or a large plastic bag and let it cool until it becomes soft and pliable.


In warm environments, the amount of time it takes the chocolate to cool may be longer. Under some circumstances, it could take up to 24 hours.
Note that you could also quick-cool the modeling chocolate in the refrigerator, but letting it cool gradually at room temperature will make the modeling chocolate more stable.
To refrigerate the chocolate at this point, wrap it in plastic wrap or a plastic bag and place it in the refrigerator for 30 minutes to 2 hours.

, Knead it with your hands for 20 to 30 seconds to smooth it out and make it moldable.


Knead the chocolate as you would knead bread dough. Flatten it out, fold it over, turn it, and repeat

, Keep the chocolate in a cool place away from sunlight until ready to use.


If wrapped well and stored correctly, modeling chocolate can last up to a year.
Do not keep the modeling chocolate in the refrigerator.
If it becomes too hard after several weeks or months of storage, knead another 1 Tbsp (15 ml) or so of corn syrup into the modeling chocolate before using it., Chocolate chips and most chocolate wafers are small enough to use directly without chopping, but if you are starting with chunks of baker's chocolate or bars of chocolate, you will need to cut the chocolate into small pieces with a sharp knife before melting it down.


The pieces you use should be about the size of your average chocolate chip.

, Spread the pieces of chocolate out evenly in a dry glass bowl.


Make sure that there is no moisture inside the bowl. Moisture could cause the chocolate to seize and become unworkable.

, Microwave the chocolate for 20 to 30 seconds on high. Mix the chocolate, then continue microwaving it in 15 to 20 second intervals until melted.


Stir the chocolate after each interval.
If you overheat the chocolate, it could seize or scorch. As a general rule, once the bottom of the dish is too hot to touch, you should not longer continue microwaving it.
Leave the bowl uncovered as you microwave the chocolate.

, Pour the corn syrup into a separate bowl and microwave on full power for about 30 seconds.


The corn syrup should not be hot. If it gets too hot, it could burn the chocolate.
You could use room temperature corn syrup, but warm corn syrup will be easier to blend in.
The amount of corn syrup you need will vary depending on the type of chocolate you are using. Chocolate with a higher fat content needs less corn syrup, while chocolate with a lower fat content and higher cacao content will need more corn syrup.

, Stir the warmed corn syrup into the melted chocolate until evenly combined.


The chocolate will stiffen as soon as you add the corn syrup.
Do not over-mix the chocolate at this point. You only need to mix it about 20 times or so.

, If you plan to color an entire batch of white chocolate, add liquid food coloring into the white chocolate alongside the corn syrup and stir the two liquid ingredients in at the same time.


You can only add color to white modeling chocolate.
If you only want to add color to a small amount of modeling chocolate, you can do so later on by kneading it in after the modeling chocolate has already cooled.

, Transfer the dough-like chocolate to a sheet of plastic wrap or a large plastic bag. Let it cool to room temperature.


In warm environments, the amount of time it takes the chocolate to cool may be longer. Under some circumstances, it could take up to 24 hours.
Note that you could also quick-cool the modeling chocolate in the refrigerator, but letting it cool gradually at room temperature will make the modeling chocolate more stable.
To refrigerate the chocolate at this point, wrap it in plastic wrap or a plastic bag and place it in the refrigerator for 30 minutes to 2 hours.

, Use your hands to knead the chocolate for 20 to 30 seconds. When finished, it should be at a clay-like consistency.


Knead the chocolate as you would knead bread dough. Flatten it out, fold it over, turn it, and repeat.

, Place the chocolate into a durable plastic bag and store it in a cool place away from sunlight.


If wrapped well and stored correctly, modeling chocolate can last up to a year.
Do not keep the modeling chocolate in the refrigerator.
If it becomes too hard after several weeks or months of storage, knead another 1 Tbsp (15 ml) or so of corn syrup into the modeling chocolate before using it.

, Separate as much white modeling chocolate from the full batch as you plan to use.


This method is most useful when you only want to color a small portion of modeling chocolate. If you plan to color an entire batch, you would be better off adding the color in as you make the modeling chocolate.
You can only add color to white modeling chocolate.

, Add the food coloring to the chocolate in small amounts.


When using this coloring technique, wear rubber gloves as you work with the food coloring. Otherwise, the food coloring may dye your hands.
Less is more for this technique. Start by adding one or two drops. If you need more, you can knead it in later.

, Sprinkle cornstarch on the modeling chocolate in approximately equal amounts with the food coloring.


The cornstarch is necessary because it helps to absorb the moisture you added to the modeling chocolate when you added the liquid food coloring. You will also have an easier time kneading the chocolate by including cornstarch since the starch will make it less sticky.

, Use your hands to knead the modeling chocolate until it turns an even, consistent color.


Knead the chocolate as you would knead bread dough. Flatten it out, fold it over, turn it, and repeat to spread the cornstarch and food coloring throughout the entire chunk of modeling chocolate.
There should be no streaks of darker color once you finish.

, If the color is not quite bright enough, slowly add a few more drops of food coloring to the modeling chocolate and knead it in as before.


If the color becomes too dark, you may need to knead in more white modeling chocolate.

, Before you use the chocolate to model anything, you should let it sit undisturbed for about an hour.


By the time you finish kneading the color into the chocolate, the warm generated by your hands and by the simple kneading action will cause the modeling chocolate to warm and soften significantly. As a result, it will be too warm to use for modeling purposes at this point. You need to let the temperature come back down a bit, first.

You can mix in chopped nuts, shredded coconut, dried fruit pieces, or other mix-ins to customize your chocolate.
Add a few drops of peppermint extract if you want to make mint chocolate.

, While it's still hot, pour the melted chocolate into individual candy molds. Molds come in all sorts of shapes and sizes, and can be found at kitchen supply stores. Fill the molds to their rims. If necessary, use the back of a spoon to smooth the chocolate into the corners.


If you don't have candy molds, get creative and make your own. Use mini muffin tins, small paper cups, shot glasses, or another type of container as molds.






To help the chocolate settle, you can lift it a few inches above the counter and let it drop. This removes air bubbles and smooths out the chocolate.

Remove the chocolate from the mold.",How to Make Homemade Chocolate1," By definition, dark chocolate is chocolate that has a higher concentration of cocoa butter and less milk. It’s actually possible to make dark chocolate without any milk at all, making it perfect for people who can’t or don’t consume dairy. Along with your ingredients, you'll also need:Grater
Double boiler
Metal whisk
Candy mold
Optional ingredients to add to the chocolate, such as dried fruit or nuts;
, In the bottom of the double boiler, fill the pot with an inch (2.5 cm) of water. Place this over medium heat and allow the water to come to a boil.


If you don’t have a double boiler, fill the bottom of a regular saucepan with water, and use a metal or glass bowl as the top portion of the double boiler.
Make sure the bowl doesn’t touch the water, otherwise the chocolate will burn. Place the bowl into the saucepan and make sure the water isn't touching the bowl. Pour out some water if the water is touching the bowl.

, Grating the cocoa butter will help it melt faster.You can also cut the cocoa butter into small chunks if you prefer. When the water is boiling, place the cocoa butter into the top of the double boiler. Use the metal whisk to stir it frequently as it melts.


It’s important that you don’t use wooden utensils to make chocolate, because the wood can still contain moisture from the tree, and this can leach into the chocolate, changing its composition.Some recipes call for coconut oil instead of cocoa butter, but coconut oil will result in an oily chocolate that isn't as smooth, rich, and creamy as chocolate should be.

, Once the cocoa butter has melted, add the cocoa powder and whisk to combine. When the cocoa powder melts and the mixture starts to take on a glossy appearance, whisk it until it becomes smooth and creamy.When the chocolate is creamy and glossy, add the sugar and vanilla, and whisk to combine. Continue heating and whisking until the sugar is melted.
You can use honey, maple syrup, or any other sweetener in place of the sugar.

, When all the ingredients are melted and fully combined, pour the mixture evenly into your mold. Use a flat mixing spatula to distribute the chocolate in the mold if necessary.


Once the mold is full, you can sprinkle in any additional ingredients you're using, such as nuts or dried fruit. Try to distribute the ingredients evenly throughout the chocolate.
You can use any mold you like for this chocolate, including a bar mold, heart shapes, or any other design. If you don’t have a chocolate mold, you can use clean ice cube trays.
You can also use dark chocolate to make chocolate chips, truffles, and other delicious confections.

, Set the chocolate aside to cool to room temperature, because you don’t want it to harden too quickly. Once it reaches room temperature, transfer the mold to an air-tight container and into the fridge to set for about an hour.It’s important to wait before putting the chocolate in the fridge and to put it in an air-tight container first. If the chocolate cools too quickly or is exposed to moisture, the chocolate can bloom, which is when the surface of the chocolate becomes dull and streaked., Take the chocolate out of the fridge once it has set. To get it out of the mold, place the mold upside down on a flat surface. Peel the mold away from the chocolate.


You can also put the chocolate into the freezer for five to 10 minutes then try again to peel away the mold.Gently tap the back of the mold with the but end of a kitchen knife if the chocolate doesn’t come out right away.
Instead of tapping the mold with the knife, you can gently tap the entire mold against a hard, flat surface to release it.

Collect the chopped chocolate into a small bowl.,
Preheat the oven to 350ºF (176ºC).,

Pour the still-warm chocolate hazelnut spread into your storage jar.",How to Make Homemade Nutella," Look for a high-quality chocolate bar or discs (chips have less cocoa butter and are harder to melt). Different types of chocolate will have different percentages of milk and cacao, which will affect the taste and appearance of your hazelnut spread.


Milk chocolate has a low percentage of cocoa solids and has a very sweet flavor. It is used in many popular candy bars. This is a good choice if you want your chocolate spread to be sweet, mellow, and not too chocolatey.Semi-sweet chocolate is most often used in chocolate chip cookies. It has less sugar and higher percentage of cocoa solids (40%-60%) than milk chocolate and will give you a rich chocolate flavor. Higher percentages can have a slightly bitter taste.Bittersweet chocolate can have a similar flavor to semi-sweet. It contains little sugar but more chocolate liquor. It usually contains between 60%-85% cocoa solids. This is a good choice if you want a spread that is less sweet, slightly bitter, and very chocolatey.Avoid unsweetened chocolate, which should only be used for baking.;
, This makes it easier to melt the chocolate later.


Always use a sharp knife (more accidents occur with dull knives).

, If you plan to melt the chocolate in the microwave, make sure it is a microwave-safe bowl. Set the bowl aside to melt when after the hazelnuts are toasted--this will take some time and your chocolate will probably harden again if you melt it now.

, If you don't have an oven, it is possible to toast the hazelnuts on a stovetop. Heat a large frying pan on medium-high heat. Add the nuts (don't use any oil or spray, as the nuts are naturally oily) and stir constantly with a spatula until golden brown., The hazelnuts should fit on the sheet in a single layer--they should not overlap or sit on top of each other or they may bake unevenly or steam instead of toast.You can also line the baking pan with a silicone sheet, which is reusable and easy to clean.
Use a rimmed baking sheet so the hazelnuts don't roll off as you put them in the oven.

,


If you don't have the time or means to toast the hazelnuts, you can purchase dry roasted, unsalted hazelnuts at some grocery stores and use them instead., One way to do this is by wrapping the nuts into a kitchen towel or tea towel (make sure it's one you don't mind possibly staining). Rub the wrapped nuts vigorously. This should remove most of the skins (it's okay if some skin remains).Remove the hazelnuts from the towel, leaving the skins behind, and allow them to cool.
You can also put the hazelnuts in a mesh bag (the kind in which bulk citrus is sold) and use your hands to rub them together over a sink. The hazelnuts will stay in the bag while most of the skins will fall through the mesh and into the sink.A more time-consuming method is to peel off the skins by hand. Again, don't worry if you don't get every single scrap of skin.

, This is when you have one pot of boiling water and fit another pot on top. The top pot is where you will put your chocolate. This method heats the chocolate gradually and keeps it from burning.


You can also heat the chocolate in a microwave. In a microwave-safe bowl, heat the chocolate in 15-second intervals, stirring in between. Heat and stir until the chocolate completely smooth., Though the bain marie should keep the chocolate from burning, chocolate can overheat and burn very easily. Keep an eye on the chocolate, stirring until it is smooth and melted, with no little lumps.Remove the bowl of chocolate from the heat once melted. Set it aside and allow it to cool., Grind the nuts in 1-minute increments to prevent your machine from overheating.The hazelnuts will first become a powder and then, as the natural oils are released, it will form into a paste.Make sure you stop to constantly scrape the sides of the bowl.
If you don't have a food processor, you can use a high-powered blender.

, Continue processing in 1-minute increments until the mixture is completely smooth. Some people like a little texture in their hazelnut spread, so if you like it crunchy make sure you don't blend out all of the chunks of hazelnut.Make sure your vegetable oil is relatively flavorless--like canola or grapeseed oil. Or, if you want to add some complexity to the taste, you can use coconut or peanut oil.If you like your spread a little on the salty side, add another pinch of salt to the mix.

, Process until well combined, pausing to scrape the sides to make sure the chocolate is completely incorporated.You may want to taste it at this point to decide if you want to add more salt or sugar.The mixture may be quite thing and runny at this point, but don't worry--it will thicken up as it cools., If you prefer your spread to be chunky or don't mind a little grittiness, then you can skip this step. Otherwise, hold a fine sieve over a bowl and carefully pour the mixture through (you might want to get someone to hold the sieve so you don't spill any of the delicious spread).If your spread seems to thick, you can add a little extra oil to make it more spreadable., Allow the spread to completely cool to room temperature before covering.Store in the refrigerator or on the counter at room-temperature. It may last longer in the refrigerator, but may need to be warmed before use to get the right consistency.If you live in a warmer climate, store it in the refrigerator.
Consider pouring the spread into several small jars and giving them as gifts to your friends.

",How to Make Homemade Chocolate2," Making milk chocolate is very similar to making dark chocolate. The major difference is that milk chocolate incorporates milk powder. When you make milk chocolate, you don’t just have to make chips. You can also use it to make chocolate bars, sauces, and other yummy treats. To make milk chocolate chips, you'll need your ingredients, plus:


A double boiler or metal bowl and saucepan
Metal spoon
Whisk
Parchment-lined baking sheet
Pasty bag with a small circle tip
Toothpick

, You can also cut the cocoa butter into small chunks. Place the cocoa butter into a double boiler over medium heat. You can also use a bowl set on top of a saucepan filled with one inch (2.5 cm) of water over medium heat. Stir with a metal spoon until the cocoa butter melts.Make sure the bowl isn't touching the water to avoid burning the chocolate. If the bottom of the bowl is touching the water, remove the bowl and pour out some water.

, Add the pinch of salt, followed by the cocoa powder. Stir to combine, then add the sugar and stir. When that is all incorporated, add the milk powder and stir until everything is mixed together.


Once the ingredients are fully incorporated, whisk the chocolate vigorously until it becomes glossy.
It’s important to use powdered milk when making chocolate instead of liquid milk. Milk contains a lot of water, and water causes chocolate to seize, meaning it clumps up into a chunky mess., Spoon or pour the chocolate into the pastry bag fitted with the circle tip. Dab pea-sized dots of chocolate onto the parchment-lined baking sheet. While the chocolate is still warm, dab a toothpick into the center of each chip and lift to create a peak in the middle.If you don’t have a pastry bag, use a freezer bag. Fill the bag with the chocolate and use scissors to snip off a small hole in one of the bottom corners. Push the chocolate out of the hole like you would with a pastry bag.
When you’ve finished piping out the chips, set them aside to cool to room temperature. When they're cool, transfer them to an air-tight container.

Place a piece of parchment paper on the baking sheet as a liner so you can easily remove the bark when it’s ready. Set the baking sheet aside.You can substitute a silicone baking mat for the parchment paper if you prefer.;
, Add 2 pounds (907 g) of the chocolate of your choice to a heatproof bowl, and place the bowl inside a saucepan with water that’s simmering on the stove at medium to medium-high. Heat the chocolate in the double boiler until it is melted and completely smooth.Stir the chocolate constantly to ensure that it heats evenly and doesn’t burn.
Dark chocolate, bittersweet chocolate, semisweet chocolate, and milk chocolate will all work well for the bark.

, Once the chocolate is completely melted, add ½ teaspoon (2 ½ ml) of hazelnut extract and ½ cup (150 g) of chocolate hazelnut spread. Stir well to ensure that all of the ingredients are fully blended, and remove the bowl from the heat.You can find hazelnut extract in the same aisle at the grocery store where the vanilla extract is sold.

, After all of the ingredients are combined, transfer the mixture to the prepared baking sheet. Use a spatula or spoon to spread it in an even layer across the sheet., When the chocolate mixture is spread on the baking sheet, sprinkle 1 cup (90 g) of finely chopped hazelnuts over the top. Distribute the nuts as evenly as possible across the chocolate.If you’d like to give the bark a salty flavor, sprinkle some sea salt along with the nuts.

, Once you’ve sprinkle the nuts over the chocolate, place the tray in the refrigerator. Allow the bark to chill until it is completely firm, which should take 25 to 30 minutes.If you want to cover the chocolate before you refrigerate it, tent some foil over it. If you use plastic wrap, it may fall into the chocolate and stick to it as it chills.

, When the chocolate hazelnut bark is firm, remove it from the refrigerator. Use clean hands or a butter knife to break the bark into pieces and serve.Store the bark in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to a week.

, For the spicy orange hazelnut chocolate bark, you’ll need a large baking sheet. Cover it with a piece of parchment paper to keep the bark from sticking to it as it chills.A silicone baking mat also works well for lining the baking sheet.

, Add 8 ounces (227 g) of chopped bittersweet chocolate to a large microwave-safe bowl. Heat the chocolate in the microwave on high in 30 second intervals until it is completely melted. Be sure to stir it after each interval to help the chocolate melt evenly.You can melt the chocolate in a double boiler if you prefer.

, Once the chocolate is melted, add ¼ teaspoon (½ g) of cayenne pepper, 1 teaspoon (2 g) of finely grated orange zest, and ⅜ cup (68 g) of coarsely chopped toasted hazelnuts. Stir well to ensure that the ingredients are well blended.If you prefer to have the orange flavor without the spice, leave out the cayenne pepper.

, When the chocolate mixture is fully blended, transfer it to the prepared baking sheet. Use the back of a spoon or an offset spatula to spread it over the sheet in an even layer., After the chocolate is spread over the baking sheet, sprinkle the remaining ⅛ cup (22 g) of coarsely chopped hazelnuts over the bark. Add some flaky sea salt to taste as well.You can omit the sea salt if you prefer.

, Once you’ve added the hazelnuts and sea salt, put the baking sheet in the refrigerator. Allow the bark to chill until it is solid, which should take 15 to 20 minutes., With clean hands, break the bark into individual pieces. Place the bark on a platter or plate for serving.Store the bark in an airtight container at room temperature. It will stay fresh for 5 to 7 days.

, For the hazelnut marble chocolate bark, you’ll need a large, rimmed cookie sheet. Set down a layer of waxed paper or foil to make it easier to remove the bark when it’s finished chilling.You can also use parchment paper or a silicone baking mat to line the cookie sheet.

, Add 6 ounces (170 g) of white chocolate to a medium microwave-safe bowl. Place the bowl in the microwave, and heat on high for 30 seconds. Stir the chocolate well, and if necessary, heat for another 30 seconds to melt it completely.If the white chocolate still isn’t melted after 1 minute, continue heating it in 15 second increments until it’s completely smooth. Be sure to stir well after each increment.

, Add 6 ounces (170 g) of semisweet baking chocolate to another medium microwave-safe bowl. Place the bowl in the microwave, and heat on high for 30 seconds. Stir the chocolate well to see if it’s melted, and heat for another 30 seconds if necessary to melt it completely.As with the white chocolate, continue heating the semisweet chocolate in 15 second increments until it is melted completely. Stir well after each time that you heat it.

, Once both chocolates are completely melted, add ¼ cup (45 g) of finely chopped toasted hazelnuts to each bowl. Stir well to ensure that the nuts are thoroughly incorporated in each chocolate., After you’ve mixed in the nuts, use spoons to transfer the chocolates to the cookie sheet. Place the chocolates in alternating side by side rows until you use up all of the chocolate.Spread the chocolates evenly so it has a thickness of approximately ¼-inch (6-mm).

, Once the chocolates are arranged in alternating rows, take a knife or small metal spatula and swirl through both chocolates. The goal is to mix them slightly to create a marbled effect.You don’t need to be perfect when you cut through the chocolate. You can create as subtle or dramatic a marbled effect as you like.

, After you’ve swirled through the chocolate, place the cookie sheet in the refrigerator. Chill it until it is firm, which should take approximately 1 hour., When the bark is solid, remove it from the refrigerator. Use a knife or clean hands to break it into smaller pieces and serve.Store the bark in an airtight container.

Most molds do not need to be prepared in any special manner. Just make sure that the molds are clean and dry before use.;
, Fill the bottom portion of a double boiler with roughly 1 inch (2.5 cm) of water. Place the double boiler on the stove and heat on medium until the water starts simmering.


If you do not have an actual double boiler, place a heat-resistant bowl or pan over a saucepan. The lip of the bowl should be able to rest on the lip of the saucepan, and the bottom of the bowl should not extend low enough to touch the surface of the water in the saucepan.

, Place the cocoa butter in the top part of your double boiler and heat it gently, stirring occasionally, until the block of butter completely melts.


The cocoa butter should reach a temperature of 122 degrees Fahrenheit (50 degrees Celsius).Monitor the temperature using a candy thermometer.
Consider breaking or cutting the cocoa butter into similarly sized pieces before adding it to the double boiler. Doing so ensures that the butter will melt quicker and at an even pace.
Note that cocoa butter melts quickly and you should not allow it to overheat. In fact, you may want to turn the heat setting down from medium to low or medium-low. Chocolate that becomes too hot will develop a pale white coating known as ""bloom.""
True dark chocolate uses cocoa butter. If you are searching for a slightly healthier alternative, however, you can swap out the cocoa butter for coconut oil. The coconut oil should be melted and treated in the same way throughout the recipe.

, Stir the three ingredients together in a medium bowl until evenly mixed.


You can use any cocoa powder for this recipe. Refined cocoa powders have a great taste, are easier to find, and less expensive, but the refining process removes some of the antioxidants of the cocoa. Natural or unprocessed cocoa powder is packed with more antioxidants and is the healthiest option.
Use sugar, honey, or maple syrup for your sweetener. Note that dark chocolate prepared with sugar can be stored at room temperature but chocolate prepared with honey or maple syrup will need to be refrigerated.
The amount of sweetener you use will change the cacao percentage of the dark chocolate.Using 1 Tbsp (15 ml) produces 85% dark chocolate.
Using 1-1/2 Tbsp (22.5 ml) produces 73% dark chocolate.
Using 2 Tbsp (30 ml) produces 60% dark chocolate.



, Gradually pour the cocoa powder mixture into the saucepan of cocoa butter, mixing thoroughly until the new product is smooth. Remove the mixture from the heat when ready.


Allow the entire mixture to return to a temperature of 122 degrees Fahrenheit (50 degrees Celsius) before removing it from the heat.

, Carefully pour roughly three-fourths of the chocolate mixture onto a glass cutting board or marble slab with a low rim around the edges. Set aside the remaining mixture.


This tempering process may seem like a lot of extra work, but it is strongly recommended that you follow through with it nonetheless. Tempering chocolate causes the cocoa butter to harden in a specific crystalline pattern, and as a result, the dark chocolate will have a more appealing sheen and texture.Note that untempered dark chocolate may have trouble setting, look blotchy, have a distorted inner texture, or be prone to developing white fat bloom on the surface.

, Use a flexible plastic scraper or palette knife to spread the chocolate out into as thin and even a layer as possible.

, Use the knife to scoop the edges of the chocolate into its center, working as quickly as possible.

, Quickly spread the chocolate out into a thin layer, then immediately scoop it back into its center. Repeat this process for the full amount of time, keeping the chocolate moving throughout the duration of that time limit.


Allow this first portion of tempered chocolate to reach a temperature of 82 degrees Fahrenheit (28 degrees Celsius) before moving onto the next step.

, Add the chocolate still in the saucepan to the chocolate on the slab. Quickly mix it the two together with a single round of spreading and scooping.


After adding the hot chocolate mixture to the tempered chocolate, the temperature should be about 90 degrees Fahrenheit (32 degrees Celsius).

, To verify that the chocolate has been appropriately tempered, drop a small dab of the chocolate onto an empty space of the marble or glass. It should set very quickly.


If the chocolate mixture does not set when tested, continue tempering it for another few minutes before trying again.

, If you are using nuts, dried fruit, or chia seeds, sprinkle them over the surface of the chocolate during this step and quickly fold or mix them in.

, Scoop the chocolate mixture up using a large serving spoon and transfer it into your lined pan. Once all the chocolate is in the pan, quickly smooth out the top using your scraper or palette knife.


If you use molds instead of a square tin, spoon the chocolate mixture into a bottle or disposable decorating bag and squeeze it into the molds one by one. Once all the molds are filled, lightly tap the molds on your counter to pop any air bubbles that may have formed.If you want to make chocolate chips, spoon the chocolate mixture into a pastry bag with a narrow tip and pipe the chocolate chips out onto a baking sheet lined with wax paper or parchment paper.

, Allow the chocolate to harden on its own. You can leave it out at room temperature as it sets, place it in the refrigerator, or place it in the freezer.


If you cool the chocolate in the freezer, it should be ready within 30 minutes or so. In the refrigerator, the mixture may take a little over 1 hour. At room temperature, the mixture might take several hours to set.
Note that dark chocolate made with honey or maple syrup may not set sufficiently at room temperature. Cool the candy in the refrigerator or freezer, instead.

, Once the chocolate has completely hardened, remove it from the pan and peel away the wax or parchment paper.


To remove dark chocolate from molds, turn the the mold upside-down over a sheet of parchment paper or wax paper. Tap on the bottom of the molds with your fingers or a butter knife, or carefully flex the mold to loosen the candies. The chocolate should fall out of the molds as you do this.

, Your dark chocolate bar is ready to enjoy at this point; eat it as a whole bar or snap it into smaller chunks. If you aren't quite ready to eat it yet, though, wrap the dark chocolate in a clean sheet of wax paper or place it in a resealable plastic bag to save it for another time.


Dark chocolate made with sugar can be stored at room temperature. If you make it with honey or maple syrup, however, the chocolate should be stored in the refrigerator.

",How to Make Oreo S'mores," Twist all the Oreo cookies so it can be one cookie that is not stacked with two. Be careful not to twist too hard or the cookie will break. Remove the frosting on the cookie using a spoon.


You can choose whether to eat the frosting or throw it out.;
, Place all the marshmallows in a baking tray and have them bake in the oven on broil. Do this until they are melted slightly, but not roasted. It should just take a minute. You want the marshmallows to melt slightly to make it easier to place on your s'more. Take caution not to burn your marshmallows as they melt easily. When done, remove from oven.


Do not heat the marshmallows for too long; they are going to get roasted when the s'more is made. Heating them slightly just helps make them easier to handle and stack on a s'more.

, Cover one Oreo cookie with your favorite spread - think of it like spreading mayonnaise on a sandwich. Use a butterknife to cover the cookie thoroughly. Only cover the ""top"" part, not the bottom.


You can use different spreads for each of your s'mores. Feel free to be creative.

, Stack a mini chocolate bar or a mini chocolate candy right on top of your s'more. The chocolate should stick because of the spread. Only add one chocolate piece since Oreo cookies are small, and putting in any more than one means that you will struggle to close your s'more.

, Place a roasted marshmallow on top of your chocolate. Only add one, as your s'more will not close well otherwise. Close your s'more with a plain Oreo cookie. Gently press on it so it can stick and not fall apart.

, Repeat the same steps: covering the Oreo cookie with your spread, adding the chocolate, and closing it with a marshmallow and cookie. Continue to do this until you are all out of cookies.

, You can either place the s'mores in the oven again until the marshmallows roast and chocolate melts slightly, or you can use a cooking torch to slightly roast the marshmallows. It is recommended to use a cooking torch to avoid the cookie from softening while baking. When using a cooking torch, lightly heat the sides only to melt the marshmallows.

Continually wipe down the insides of the pan with a pastry brush to keep sugar from crystallizing there.Alternatively, you can let the sugar and water come to a boil, and take it off the heat.Corn syrup helps keep the mixture from crystallizing, meaning your marshmallows will usually stay softer.

It should be thick and glossy., To get most of the marshmallow off the beater, let it lift slowly while you leave the beater going on low to medium. Quickly pour the mixture into the prepared pan, spreading it out with a spatula. Keep in mind it will set how you leave the top of it, so try to get it smooth. You can also just use your (oiled!) hands to smooth the top out., Add a dusting of powdered sugar on top of the marshmallows. Leave it alone so it can set up.It will take at least four hours, but you may want to leave it as long as a full day. You can leave it at room temperature., Once the mixture has set, add more powdered sugar to the top (use your hand to make sure it's coated), and then try to flip it out onto a surface. Sprinkle more powdered sugar on the other side., Dip a cloud cookie cutter into powdered sugar. Use the cookie cutter to cut clouds out of the block, trying to fit as many in as you can. If you don't have a cloud cookie cutter, you can freehand shapes with a knife. Cut the leftovers into small squares. Toss the marshmallows in more powdered sugar., To store the marshmallows, place them in an airtight container. They'll stay fresh about a week at room temperature. They may start to crystallize, but they are still okay to eat after that process begins."

Add in the cup of butter. Blend the mixture until it is light and fluffy. Add the eggs and extract and beat until they are well combined and fluffy.Creaming the butter and sugar together adds air to the cookies, making them lighter. If you cream these two ingredients until they are light and fluffy, you're actually creating more dough with the air you're incorporating., Dump the flour mixture and the chocolate chips into the wet ingredients. Using a low speed, begin to beat the mixture together. Keeping mixing until the ingredients are combined into a thick dough., Take a ball of dough, and use it to cover about 4 or 5 marshmallows.

Inspect the strawberries for moldiness, dirt and rotting.







 


Leave the stems and leaves intact, as they make the berries easier to grip. It also looks nicer when finished.
Wash the strawberries as demonstrated here: how to clean strawberries.

After cleaning the strawberries, dry them well; the chocolate won't stick if they're wet. To do this, transfer to a colander to drain.
Since the chocolate will cover most of the strawberry, you can use strawberries that don't look perfect but make sure to check for bruises and dark spots and either remove those spots or discard the entire strawberry if it's gone bad.;
, Make sure the cooking sheet is large enough to place all the strawberries on the sheet in a single layer, leaving a few inches of space for when they are placed back on the sheet after dipping in the chocolate.





, Use a double boiler to make sure you don't burn the chocolate. If you don't have a double boiler, you can make one by filling a medium saucepan 3/4 full with water. Then rest a smaller saucepan or a heat-proof bowl inside of it and fill it with your chocolate chips.

Turn the stove on low heat.
Stir occasionally. Be sure to avoid getting any water or condensation into the chocolate or it will ""seize"", meaning it becomes very difficult to work with.










If you want milky chocolate, use milk chocolate chips. Milky chocolate is less strong and possibly more enjoyable for kids.
Use dark chocolate for after-dinner strawberries––it's the most elegant and preferred by many adults.

, When all but a few pieces have melted, turn off the stove; you don't want to burn the chocolate, have it boil over or form condensation in the bowl that drips back into the chocolate.

Stir the chocolate until it is uniformly melted.
Continue stirring until the chocolate turns smooth and creamy.










If you have a candy thermometer, measure the temperature of the melted chocolate. Melted chocolate is at an ideal consistency for dipping at approximately 43ºC/110ºF. Alternatively, a small amount picked up on your finger should set immediately (just be careful to do this when the chocolate has cooled enough).

, The toothpick should be inserted at least halfway into the strawberry to ensure stability when dipping., Twirl it around to get it completely coated. Put it on the cookie sheet to cool. Repeat until all of the strawberries are covered.






For a fancy touch, melt white chocolate in the double boiler as mentioned above. Then, put in a press seal sandwich bag and close. Cut off a tiny bit of one corner of the bag, and drizzle a messy zigzag across each berry. Let cool.

,






If storing temporarily after the chocolate sets (rather than serving immediately), place the set strawberries between pieces of waxed paper in an airtight container. This will ensure the purity of the taste by preventing fridge odors from absorbing into to the treats.

, Gently lift them off the wax or parchment paper without holding the chocolate too much (or your body heat will melt it). Immediately transfer to the serving container.





, Place in a fancy container for serving at the table. Chocolate-dipped strawberries can also be arranged on a plate of dried and fresh fruit, as one of many delicious fruit choices for dessert or a buffet.

Let the mixture cool, checking on it every few minutes with a candy thermometer until it reaches 240 degrees F (115.5 degrees C), about eight minutes.240 degrees F (115.5 C) is known as the “soft ball stage” of candy making. Fudge, pralines and other soft treats are made by cooking their ingredients to this temperature.
Candy thermometers are designed to measure the temperature of melted sugar and syrups. They have a much higher temperature range than regular thermometers, which are used primarily for checking the temperature of meat and typically only go up to 200 or 220 degrees F (93.3-104.4 C).

, Use a stick of butter to lightly grease the bowl of a standing mixer, or a large bowl if you don’t have a mixer. Then pour the maple mixture into the bowl and let it sit, checking every fifteen minutes or so with the candy thermometer, until it reaches a temperature of 100 F (37.7 C), which should take about an hour., After the fudge has cooled, add in the vanilla, then mix by using the highest setting of a mixer or by beating the fudge by hand.

You may choose either golden syrup or corn syrup. Golden syrup is made from sugar cane, while corn syrup is made from — you guessed it — corn. Golden syrup has a richer, more complex flavor profile than corn syrup, although it's more expensive. In America, most corn syrup is genetically modified.;
, Stir with a heavy-duty whisk until all the ingredients are combined and the liquid has taken on a distinctly chocolate color.








, Remove the pot from the burner.









If you can, make sure the temperature of the liquid does not exceed 240° F (115° C). This will ensure that hot fudge doesn't seize up and become hard. In sugar boiling points, this is known as a soft boil.If the liquid exceeds 240° F, it will go into a hard boil and the sugar will become firmer. For hot fudge, this is not ideal.

, Stir to incorporate. As the fudge begins to cool, it will thicken up, although it will still retain its liquid form.

, Using a damp knife, cut the cake in sections or quarters. This allows the insides of the cake to cool down faster, rather than having the cake cool down from the outside in.

, When the cake pieces have reached room temperature or are cool enough to handle, use your hands to crumble the cake in a large mixing bowl. Break down any chunks, especially any hard corners.

, Start off with 1/4 cup of icing in the bowl. Use a wooden spoon to thoroughly incorporate the cake crumbs and icing together until you achieve a consistency of dough, as if you're making cookie dough. Add additional icing, if needed.

, Chilling the mixture makes it easier for you to roll it into balls.

, Use a cookie dough scooper to help you make even ball amounts, about 1 tablespoon (15 ml) (15 grams). To avoid multitasking, scoop the entire mixture and place the balls onto a flat surface (such as a baking sheet or counter top), lined with parchment paper.

, Use both palms of your hands and circle each ball in a circular motion, to allow any flat surfaces to become evenly round.

, For the best results, it's recommended that you refrigerate the cake balls for at least two hours. By doing this, any coating won't affect the prepared cake when dipping.

If you're planning to present the cake balls on a stick, it's recommended that you use lollipop sticks, which can be found in specialty baking aisles. Dip about 1/2 inch (1.27 cm) of the stick into the melted chocolate prior to inserting them into the cake balls.
If you're planning to present the cake balls in decorative individual wrappers, poke them with toothpicks.

, While holding the lollipop stick or toothpick, submerge the cake ball into the melted chocolate. When lifting it back up, gently lift them in a swirling motion or give them a gentle shake.


If you are using toothpicks, remove them from the balls. Add a very small amount of extra melted chocolate to cover the holes. You can use the back of a spoon to evenly spread out any extra coating as well.

, Place the chocolate covered cake ball in the same place on the waxed paper. Pick up the next one and repeat the dipping until everything is covered.

, You can create even zig-zag lines by moving your arm back and forth in a uniform way across the entire sheet of cake balls., You can either sprinkle by hand or dip it in the coconut while the chocolate is still in a liquid state, if you're not drizzling chocolate on top.

Dip your cake balls into the melted chocolate.,
Decorate your cake ball.,
Harden your cake balls in the fridge.",How to Make Cake Balls," The great thing about cake balls is that you can create them out of any of your standard favorites: chocolate, vanilla, red velvet, whatever! Between the cake mix, frosting, and decorations you can use for your cake balls, your options are pretty endless.


Make sure to pick up all of the ingredients listed on the cake mix (typically oil and eggs).;
, You don’t need to do anything special– just prepare the cake as directed. You can use any pan, just make sure you’re following the directions for that pan size. Pop your cake into the oven for the directed amount of time. If they list a baking time range, opt for the lower end– soft cake works best for cake balls., Check to see that it’s cooked thoroughly by sticking a toothpick into the middle of it. If the toothpick slides out relatively clean, the cake is done. If the toothpick comes out with batter on it, you’ll need to stick your cake in the oven for a few more minutes. Just make sure you check it regularly so it doesn’t burn.







, It’s best to do this while the cake is still warm. Cut chunks of cake at a time and crumble them into the mixing bowl. You can use your hands, or you can use a mixer to break it up more quickly. Continue until the entire cake is crumbled into the bowl.







, Scoop the frosting into the bowl of crumbled cake, and continuously stir.Depending on the size of your cake mix box, the amount of frosting you’ll need will vary. Most cake mixes are 15.25 ounces, but there are also mixes that come in 18.2 ounces and bigger. For a 15.25 box of cake mix, you'll need about 3/4 cup of frosting. Add a bit more for a bigger box. Keep adding frosting until the mixture is a malleable texture, like Play-Doh, and you can form it without it crumbling.








, If you want to make chocolate cake balls, use chocolate cake mix with chocolate frosting. For vanilla, use vanilla cake and vanilla frosting. Otherwise, feel free to mix and match cake mix flavors and frosting flavors to create hybrid flavors. Some combination ideas include:


Red velvet cake with buttercream frosting
Angel food cake with strawberry icing
Chocolate cake with red velvet icing

, The optimal size for a cake ball is about the size of a Ping-Pong ball. Grab a chunk of dough and roll it between your palms. Once it’s as smooth and round as you can make it, place it on a tray lined with wax paper.







, You don’t need to keep it in there very long. Fifteen to twenty minutes will allow the balls to firm up, and they’ll be easier to coat and decorate.If you’re crunched for time, put them in the freezer for about five minutes.


The cake balls are done with the outside no longer feels moist and you can squeeze them gently without them losing their shape.

, You can use white chocolate, milk chocolate, or dark chocolate– whatever you’re in the mood for. Make sure to purchase the chocolate specifically meant for melting and baking. Set your stove to low heat, stirring constantly, so that you don’t burn your chocolate. Once it is completely melted, turn off the heat.

, This step can be tricky, but there are a few different ways to do this. Try sticking a toothpick into the cake ball and use it to dip the ball into the chocolate, turning it in the pan so that the entire ball is evenly coated. Once you’ve let the excess chocolate drip off the cake ball, place it back on the wax paper.


You can also place the cake ball in the batter with a spoon or even with your hand, but you may have difficulty getting the chocolate perfectly smoothed around the cake ball.

, While the chocolate is still warm, you can add some extra goodies, if you want. Scatter colorful sprinkles over the balls, or coat them with edible glitter. To make your cake balls extra decadent, you can even sprinkle them with crushed Oreos, Reese’s, or M&M’s. You can drizzle your cake balls with caramel or another liquid topping as well.









If you’re making several different kinds of cake balls, it can be helpful to use your decorations to signify what flavor of cake is in the inside. For example, red velvet cake balls could be decorated with crushed Oreos while vanilla cake balls could be decorated with sprinkles.

, You can leave them in their overnight, or just pop them in there until the chocolate is completely solidified. Once the chocolate is solid to the touch, they’re all done. Enjoy!

Choose your chocolate.,
Break the chocolate bar into pieces and put them into the bowl.,
Melt the chocolate in the microwave.,
Choose your tools.,
Choose your methodology.,
Remove the chocolate and clean your molds.",How to Make Chocolate Shapes1," The fact of the matter is that chocolate is not the same. Melting chocolate is your best bet and will yield the most consistent results, but any chocolate will probably be delicious, even if it doesn't cooperate like you want it to. Cocoa mass pistols and tempered chocolate buttons are good choices, too.


Milk chocolate and white chocolate don't handle as easily, but clearly taste is more important than anything.However, do know that chocolate for eating should have around 70-75% cocoa content -- more and it'll taste bitter. Bittersweet chocolate comes in at around 65% and is great for most recipes. Chocolate that's 85% and over is good for baking.But in white chocolate's defense? You can add oil-based food coloring to it for pretty colors!;
, If the chocolate is just one giant mass, it will not melt evenly. It'll start scorching on the sides and be cold as day in the center. So break your bar into bite-size chunks unless you want a goopy, chocolate mess on your hands.

, Put it on half power for 1 minute, stirring right after. It won't be melted, so don't expect it to be. Keep repeating this process until it's melted. You'll know when it's done when it drips from your spoon in a stream, like a syrup.


This cannot be overstressed: do not overcook your chocolate. This 1 minute on half power thing is for a reason. If you check it at periodic intervals, stirring each time, never going overboard, you'll never go beyond the point of no return. So be patient!
Though this shouldn't be an issue, make sure you don't get any water into the chocolate -- not a single drop. If it gets into contact with water, it'll become grainy and gross.
Using white chocolate and food coloring? Add a few drops in now!

, You now have the chocolate world at your fingertips. What's in your kitchen? You can use cookie cutters, chocolate molds, or even make your own stencils with poster board and a sharp knife.


When it comes to cookie cutters, try to stick to ones that are more rounded. The more points they have, the more likely the chocolate will break off.
Whatever you're using, make sure it'll stand up to the heat -- or switch up your methodology. No one way is better than the other.

, This will largely depend on your tools, but here's the breakdown:


Using molds? Simply pour your melted chocolate directly into clean, ungreased molds. Tap the molds on a hard surface to remove the air bubbles and pop 'em into the freezer. When the molds become misty, take them out and remove the chocolates by tapping.







Using plastic cookie cutters? You'll want to let the chocolate cool ever so slightly (so, so slightly) before pouring it into the cutters. Place them on a baking sheet lined with wax paper, pour, and then pop them into the freezer or fridge until hard.







Using metal cookie cutters? You have two options:







Option 1: Pour the chocolate directly into the cutters on a lined baking sheet. Tap to remove bubbles, freeze, and tap to remove from cutters.

Option 2: Pour the chocolate onto a baking pan lined with wax paper, shaking a bit to even out the layer of chocolate. Chill or leave on the counter to harden. Then heat up your cutters over your stove and start making shapes!



Using your own stencil? Follow option two above, substituting the cutter for your stencil (but don't heat the stencil up). Just place the stencil over your pan of chocolate, cutting around it with a sharp knife.

, In just about every method, you'll need to chill your chocolate and tap against a hard surface to remove from the mold. That's it! Then just clean your molds with warm, soapy water.

Choose your chocolate.,
Get out your double boiler.,
Shave or cut your chocolate into chunks and place 2/3 of it into the double boiler.,
Bust out the thermometer.,
Test the chocolate, if you'd like.,
Pour into the molds.,
Take out your molds.",How to Make Chocolate Shapes2," As discussed in the previous method, with the variety of chocolates available, it's safe to assume that all kinds bake slightly differently. Here's a few basics:


Melting chocolate is clearly best (hence why they call it melting chocolate).
White chocolate and milk chocolate sometimes don't handle well. If you're new to the melting game, start with something easier.
A good percentage of cocoa is around 70-75%. Much more and it gets bitter and is better for baking.

, The best part about this method is that it prevents scorching. Wahoo! The microwave is much quicker but it's rather precarious; with the double boiler, unless you're cursed, your chocolate should be fine.


In the bottom of your double boiler, place enough water until it hits about an 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) below the upper pan. Put the double boiler over low heat, heating the water.

, The smaller your bits of chocolate, the faster it'll melt (and with the double boiler method, you're already looking at 15-20 minutes). Fill the top of the double boiler (the level not touching the water) with as much chocolate as you need. And keep stirring!


This is perhaps the most important note of all: do not let the chocolate come into contact with even a single drop of water. If you do, it'll get grainy and, quite frankly, disgusting. So watch out!
Don't be tempted to up the heat. Keeping it on low will result in a smooth chocolate that has a glossy sheen when it's cooled.

, You want to bring the chocolate to around 100-105°F (38°C), but not higher. Once it hits that point, remove the bowl from the heat and add in the rest of your chocolate, which should knock down the overall temperature to about 90°F (32°C). Keep stirring. When it's all melted, you're ready to start molding!


If you don't have a candy thermometer, you'll probably be just fine. Just take the chocolate off the heat when it's thoroughly melted and all stirred up. Give it a second to cool before you place it into your molds.
If you're using white chocolate and would like to color it, add a few drops of oil-based food coloring at this stage.

, Take a spoonful and place it on a bit of wax paper. Let it cool -- is it smooth and shiny? It should be! That means it's perfect and ready to go. If it doesn't look right, just cool it and temper it again. That's the great thing about chocolate -- it can take just about anything!

, With your melted, tempered chocolate, start pouring it into your molds. Silicone or metal will be fine, but be careful with plastic -- it can warp if it gets exposed to extreme temperatures for too long. Be sure to tap the molds once full to even out the chocolate and get rid of any air pockets.


Alternatively, you can spread the chocolate onto a baking sheet lined with wax paper. Shake it a bit and tap it to remove any bubbles and allow it to chill in the fridge or on the counter. Then you simply heat up your metal cookie cutters over your gas stove or carve out your shapes however you like.

You can take your pan of chocolate and use posterboard as a stencil! Then just cut around it. What are your fine motor skills like?



, Once the molds are chilled and misty with the cold temperatures, they're probably ready to go. Just give them a few taps and the chocolate should pop right out.


And then you'll be left with delicious chocolate and some dirty molds. Once you're done eating, clean the molds with soap and water. Easy as pie!

Choose your chocolate.,
Melt your chocolate.,
Pour your chocolate into a squirt bottle.,
Draw shapes on wax paper and let cool.,
Peel the wax paper away from the chocolate.",How to Make Chocolate Shapes3," A walk into any gourmet grocery store will give you more than a plethora of chocolately options. Here's a few things to consider (as discussed previously):


White and milk chocolate can be a bit temperamental. But white chocolate can be dyed with oil-based food coloring! It'll work just fine if you remain diligent.
Are you eating this chocolate? You'll want to keep it around 70-75% cocoa. Any more and it'll be rather bitter (but if you like bitter, go for it). At around 85%, it's best for baking.

, There are generally three methods to choose from:


In your microwave. This method is outlined in detail in method 1 above, but the long and short of it is this: put your chocolate in small chunks in the microwave on half power in one minute intervals, stirring periodically to prevent scorching.







In a double boiler. This method is outlined in detail in method 2 above, but the long and short of it is this: put your chocolate in small chunks in the double boiler over low heat, stirring frequently. This method takes longer, but the chances of scorching are minimal at worst.







Over the stovetop. Over low heat, place your chocolate into a saucepan, stirring regularly. Keep an eye on it as this method is particularly dangerous. Too long or too hot and your chocolate can burn.







, Once it's melted and smooth, your chocolate is ready to pour into a squirt bottle. You can scoop it, too.

, On a baking pan lined with wax paper, start drawing shapes! An open-ended heart is a great garnish on the side of a glass or plate. You can also draw words or complicated art pieces to adorn a dessert, adding that professional touch.


Always make more than you need. Some will break. Accept it now and get to work.
If you like the side of a plate idea, draw the shape directly onto the plate and then chill it in the fridge.
These make great ""nametags"" too! Get creative.

, And not the other way around. If you peel the chocolate up, you risk ruining your perfect creations! So take the shape in your hand and gently peel back the paper. It should come off just fine if it's cooled all the way.

Prepare and measure chocolate and cream.,
Heat over a double boiler.,
Stir ingredients together in the double broiler.,
Add any optional ingredients.,
Serve immediately or store in a container in the fridge.,
Enjoy your delicious chocolate sauce.",How to Make Chocolate Sauce1," The ingredients should be enough to make approximately 1 and 1/2 cups of chocolate sauce.Use bittersweet, semi-sweet or milk chocolate, depending on your preference.
There are alternatives to using cream, although cream is the preferred liquid because of the rich sauce it creates. You could also use milk or half-and-half.
Note that if you use chocolate with a higher percentage of cacao and a liquid that doesn’t have much fat in it, the flavor of the sauce will be intense.;
, Fill a medium saucepan with a few inches of water over medium high heat. Place a metal bowl on top of the saucepan and add the chocolate and heavy cream.Take care not to burn the chocolate. Tempered chocolate can seize up if overheated or burned. One thing to look for if you fear your chocolate is burning is if it starts to look grainy or clump together. If it also loses some of its smooth sheen, this is also an indication that the chocolate is burning. If this does happen, you'll have to start over as the chocolate will have a burned taste to it and will not taste right in the recipe. Remember that chocolate is the star dish for this ingredient!Ensure that no little beads of moisture are allowed to mingle with the chocolate and that the metal bowl with the chocolate and cream does not touch the water in the pan. Chocolate is adverse to moisture, so mixing moisture with chocolate will usually cause the chocolate to seize and burn.You can also place the chocolate and cream in a microwave safe dish and microwave for 1 minute on medium power. Be careful not to burn it. Remove from the microwave and stir until smooth.

, As the water simmers gently, mix the ingredients together as they melt. If it looks like the sauce is getting too hot, remove the saucepan from the heat and allow the sauce to continue melting over the remaining steam. When the chocolate is smooth and has a nice sheen to it, you know it's melted.

, While melting the chocolate and cream together, feel free to jazz up your sauce by adding extra flavorings or ingredients.


Add a small pad of butter to the sauce to give it a super smooth texture and glossy sheen.Add a teaspoon of vanilla extract to bring out and heighten the chocolatey flavor.Add 1/4 teaspoon of a flavored extract, like peppermint, almond, orange or raspberry.
For a boozy twist, add a dash red wine, Grand Marnier, Kahlua or your other favorite liqueur. , The sauce should keep for up to two weeks.


To reheat, microwave for 30 seconds to 1 minute or briefly rewarm in a pan or sink of hot water. It's best to microwave the sauce for a short time and then put back in if it's not melted enough. You don't want to burn it!

, This basic sauce is great on top of ice cream and other treats. It's also great on its own, right out the container with a spoon!

Serve.",How to Make Chocolate Leaves2,", Wash each leaf well; they must be clean, as well as safe.,

You could also use white or dark chocolate. Dark chocolate should be tempered before using, otherwise it will appear dull when it sets.

, Place each leaf so that the back of the leaf is facing upward, as this will produce a much more interesting pattern effect on the chocolate when completed., Paint the backside of the leaf with the chocolate. Aim to keep a smooth and even layer across the leaf.

Avoid dripping chocolate onto the underside of the leaf. If this happens, wipe it off with your finger. Chocolate stuck on the underside of the leaf will make it harder to peel the chocolate leaf off later.

, Repeat until you've made as many leaves as you wished to make., This can be done in one of three ways:

Let sit in a cool and dry area of the kitchen until set.
Place in the refrigerator and allow to set.
Place in the freezer and allow to set.

, Start with the stem end, as this is the strongest part you'll be able to grip. Simply peel the leaf away from the chocolate, carefully.

If you find that the leaf veins did not transfer as well as you'd have liked, etch in additional veins with a toothpick.

, If you need to keep the leaves to serve later or to decorate a cake with, place them back on the parchment covered tray and put into the refrigerator. This will help them to retain their shape and they won't melt., Look for leaves that are of a decent size, unblemished and without rips or bumps. Wash and dry the leaves before proceeding.

You can often buy organic mint leaves at the supermarket or fruit and vegetable stores if you don't grow your own. Some places also sell live mint plants for culinary usage.

,, Leave space between the leaves to prevent them from sticking together.

Use tweezers or small tongs to help you hold the leaf by its stem, if wished.

, Parchment paper can be used instead, if preferred., They will set during this time. They can be left in the freezer for up to 5 hours if needed. Don't leave longer or they may get freezer burn and won't taste as good., Remove from the wax paper (use tweezers to help). Arrange on a lovely, dainty platter for decorative effect. These are wonderful on their own or as a beautiful garnish to any dessert.


Serve direct from the freezer; the frozen texture is part of the eating experience.
