Take 100 grams of cocoa beans and spread them on your roasting pan.,
When the beans have cooled, put the cocoa beans in a plastic bag.,
Pour the beans into a bowl and gently direct the hairdryer over it.,

Add in the nibs and grind for about 5 minutes.,
When the chocolate is refined as much as possible, add in spices.,
Heat up your mortar and pestle by placing it in a warm microwave for a few minutes.,

At first, the smell will be very acidic and vinegary, but when your kitchen smells like brownies you know the beans are done! Take the beans out and let them cool.
, Seal the bag and crush the beans with a cast-iron skillet or rolling pin. Don't be gentle; the hull (outside) of the bean needs to be separated from the nib (yummy inside)., Agitate the bowl slightly, either by stirring with your hands or shaking the bowl. IF you have to hairdryer at the right distance, the hulls will fly right out of the bowl! Check the nibs carefully to make sure the hulls are completely removed., A 100 gram batch of 60% dark chocolate requires 60 grams of nibs and 40 grams of sugar.,, If your grinder cannot take 5 minute at a time, grind for about one minute and let the grinder cool down before starting it up again. At a certain point, the cocoa butter will be released, creating a thick, tar-like appearance. At this point, you need to scrape off the mass that is stuck to the side and bottom of the grinder. The grinding is done when the mass flows easily., This step is optional., Add in your chocolate after the mortar and pestle is heated and grind away!, When it tastes done, you know it's done! The next step is optional but is very recommended., Take about 2/3 of the total batch and pour it on to the marble slab. Fold and agitate the melted chocolate with the scraping tools, ensuring that no lumps are forming., When it does, pour it back into the rest of the batch and mix. At this point, you can now pour it into molds. Enjoy!"

Coat the marshmallows in powdered sugar.,
Store the marshmallows in an airtight container.",How to Make Lemon Marshmallows," Get out a 9-inch (23-cm) square baking pan. Dip a pastry brush in some vegetable oil and spread it along the bottom and sides of the pan. Place 1 cup (125 g) of powdered sugar into a small, fine mesh sieve. Dust enough of the powdered sugar to completely coat the pan. Tap out the powdered sugar that doesn't stick to the oil.You won't need to use all of the powdered sugar. Just set the sieve aside since you'll need to dust more powdered sugar later.
You could also spray the pan with cooking spray instead of spreading it with vegetable oil.;
, Wash 4 medium lemons (about 1 pound or 453 g). Use a vegetable peeler to peel away the zest in large strips. Avoid peeling so deeply that you also get the white pith. If you do, just use a small knife to trim away the pith. Set the lemons aside and roughly chop the strips of lemon zest., Put the chopped lemon zest into a small food processor along with 1 1/2 cups (300 g) of granulated sugar. Blitz the zest and sugar for one to two minutes. The zest should be finely ground and combined with the sugar. Set the mixture aside., Cut the 4 lemons you peeled in half and juice them. Strain the juice through a mesh sieve to remove any pulp or seeds. You'll need to get 1/2 cup (120 ml) of lemon juice. Pour the juice into a large mixing bowl., Pour 2 tablespoons of water into the bowl with the lemon juice. Sprinkle 2 ounces (56 g) of powdered unflavored gelatin over the liquids. Stir the mixture a little so all of the powder is touching the liquid. Set the lemon-gelatin mixture aside to soften.You'll probably need four envelopes (1/4-ounce each) of unflavored gelatin.

, Place a 3 to 4-quart saucepan on the stove and put the ground lemon sugar into it. Add 1 cup (323 g) of light corn syrup, 1/4 teaspoon of salt, and 1/2 cup (120 ml) of water. Stir the mixture until it's combined., Turn the heat on to medium and stir the sugar syrup until it dissolves. Once the sugar is dissolved, stop stirring and keep heating the syrup until it boils and reaches 240 degrees F (115 C) on a candy thermometer. Turn off the heat.Don't worry if the syrup foams up as it reaches temperature. You may just need to turn the temperature on the stove down a little.

, Place the bowl that has the gelatin into the base of a stand mixer and turn the mixer on to low. Slowly pour the hot syrup into the side of the bowl so it gradually mixes into the gelatin. Turn the speed up to high, add 1/4 teaspoon (about 30 drops) of yellow food coloring, and beat the mixture for about 5 minutes so it becomes marshmallow.The marshmallow will become thick and fluffy once it's finished beating. If you turn off the mixer and lift a beater up, the marshmallow should make a thick ribbon when it falls back into the bowl.
If you want a brighter yellow color, you can add more yellow food coloring.

, Scoop the marshmallow into the prepared pan. Dip your fingers in water and use them to spread the marshmallow evenly in the pan.Don't worry if the marshmallow is very sticky. You may just need to wet your fingers down a few times so you can smooth the marshmallow.

, Set the pan of lemon marshmallow aside. Keep it uncovered and let it sit at room temperature for at least four hours (or overnight). The marshmallow will dry out so it's not sticky anymore.Drying the marshmallow will make it easier to handle and cut.
Never cover the marshmallows with plastic wrap since it could fall onto the marshmallows and stick.

, Once the marshmallow is dry to the touch, dust a cutting board with some of the powdered sugar. Run a rubber spatula around the sides of the marshmallow in the pan and flip it onto the cutting board. Dust the top of the lemon marshmallow with more powdered sugar., Dip a pastry brush in vegetable oil and brush it along a long knife. Dust the knife with powdered sugar to keep it from sticking to the marshmallow. Cut the marshmallow into 8 strips. Turn the pan 90 degrees and cut another 8 strips so you end up with 64 squares.You may need to brush and powder your knife once or twice as you're cutting the marshmallows.
If you want larger marshmallows, just cut 6 strips instead of 8. You'll end up with 36 larger marshmallows.

, Dust the marshmallows with powdered sugar so they're coated on all sides. Gently shake or brush the excess powdered sugar off of each marshmallow.Coating the marshmallows will prevent them from sticking to each other.

, Lay a sheet of wax or parchment paper in the bottom of an airtight container. Place a single layer of the marshmallows on the paper and top it with another sheet of the paper. Arrange another layer of marshmallows and paper until you've stored all of the marshmallows. Store the marshmallows at room temperature for up to one month."

Sandwich the s'more.",How to Make Gourmet S'mores," Most s'mores are made with plain or honey graham crackers, but using a different flavor of graham cracker is one of the easiest ways to make a fancy s'more. Buy one of these flavored graham crackers to use as a base for your s'mores:

Cinnamon
Chocolate
Vanilla
Chocolate chip;
, If you can't find graham crackers or want a different base for your s'mores, buy classic sandwich cookies. Just twist apart the cookie and sandwich the toasted marshmallow and any fillings between the cookie lids. You can also use thin waffle cookies for a slightly caramelized flavor.

If you'd like a similar flavor to graham crackers, try using digestive biscuits/cookies.

, Bake a batch of your favorite kind of cookie. Try to make the cookies spread a little as they bake so they come out thin. Or try mixing and matching cookies so you have two different types of cookie for each lid of the s'more. Consider using:Chocolate chip cookies
Peanut butter cookies
Gingersnaps
Oatmeal raisin cookies

, Instead of using the standard milk chocolate, use a gourmet chocolate that contains more cocoa solids. Look for a bittersweet or semisweet chocolate bar. For something even more sophisticated, try:White chocolate with mint
Salted caramel filled chocolate bars
Cocoa nib chocolate bars (for a little crunch)
Cappuccino or coffee flavored chocolate

, You can always use your favorite candy bar as the chocolate in s'mores. To make it easier to eat, chill the candy bar in the freezer for a while and then slice it in half. Lay the halves of the candy bar on your cookie or cracker base.You can use peanut and caramel candy bars, candy bars with nougat or whipped marshmallow, or even peanut butter cup candy.

, Substitute your favorite dessert spread for a truly gourmet s'more or spread it on the cracker underneath the chocolate bar. Chocolate hazelnut spread is an easy way to upgrade basic s'mores. You can also use:Dulce de leche or salted caramel
Cookie butter (speculoos butter)
Candy bar peanut butter

, For a really unique s'more, you can leave out the chocolate and use a fruit curd instead. Spread a few spoonfuls of lemon, orange, or raspberry curd on your base. You can still top it with a marshmallow. Or if you enjoy the flavor of citrus and chocolate, just spread the fruit curd on the cracker underneath the chocolate bar.For example, spread lemon curd on a graham cracker. Top it with a toasted marshmallow for a s'more that tastes like lemon meringue pie.

, Nut butters are a great alternative or addition to chocolate. They're also great if you're looking to cut back on some of the sugar in traditional s'mores. Just spread a layer of your favorite nut butter over the cookie or cracker base. Try almond, hazelnut, or peanut butter.Nut butters also taste great when you pair them with fruit (like bananas).

, More stores are carrying unusual marshmallows, so buy several and try out different textures and flavors. You may be able to find square marshmallows which are perfect for completely filling standard graham crackers. Or pick up toasted coconut-coated marshmallows for a little chewy texture.

You can probably find seasonal flavors, especially in cooler weather. For example, you might find pumpkin spice or gingerbread flavored marshmallows.

, Several gourmet markets sell flavored marshmallows or you can make them at home to control the flavors. Try simple flavored marshmallows (like chocolate or strawberry) or make a unique flavor combination (like bourbon vanilla).Keep in mind that some homemade marshmallows may be lighter or fluffier than commercial marshmallows. They may toast faster, so keep an eye on them when you're heating them.

, For a really easy way to include marshmallow, just spread marshmallow filling over your cracker or cookie base. This works well if you don't have access to a heat source for toasting marshmallows.

Marshmallow filling will also help other loose toppings stick (like chopped nuts or sprinkles).

, Include a sweet fresh flavor by slicing and adding fresh fruit. You can thinly slice strawberries or bananas to place on the s'mores. Consider leaving fresh berries whole and arrange them on the marshmallow or filling.You can also spread a little fruit jam or roasted fruit over the graham crackers or cookie base.

, To add a smoky sweet flavor to your s'mores, candy a few strips of bacon. Lay the bacon on a baking sheet and rub some brown sugar over the strips. Bake the bacon in a 375 degree F (190 C) oven for 15 to 25 minutes. The bacon should look glazed and crispy. Set the candied bacon on paper towels and let the bacon cool completely before you put it on your s'mores.The candied bacon may take longer to cook if you're using thick-cut bacon.

, Sprinkle a little toasted coconut over the chocolate, spread or filling in the s'mores. This will help it stick. The coconut will give a slightly chewy or crisp texture depending on how toasted it is. You can also sprinkle a dash or two of your favorite spices.For example, add a sprinkle of cinnamon and cayenne for a slightly spicy s'more. Or sprinkle some ground ginger if you're using a citrus or fruit filling.

, Lay your cookie or graham cracker bases on a serving plate. Spread any fillings you're using over the cookie or cracker bases. Set any chocolate bars or fruit on the filling or base., You can toast the marshmallow over a low fire or place it in the microwave. Heat the marshmallow on low heat until it softens and puffs up. Transfer the marshmallow off of your toasting stick or from the microwave and onto your cookie or cracker base.

If you're using the microwave, heat it for 5 to 10 seconds.

, Place the top cookie or graham cracker base over the warm marshmallow. Press it down to sandwich all of the s'more ingredients together. This can also help melt the chocolate, if you're using a bar. Enjoy the s'more immediately."

Decide if you are going to use dark chocolate or white chocolate.,
Buy oil based coloring that is made especially to color chocolate.,
Get vegetable shortening, not vegetable oil.,
Melt the chocolate in a double boiler, if possible.,
Melt the chocolate in a glass bowl if you use the microwave.,
Work in small batches.,
Place the white chocolate chips in a glass bowl.,
Stir the chocolate as you microwave it for intervals of 30 seconds.,
Check the consistency of the melted chocolate.,
Place a deep pot with a handle on the stove.,
Take a metal bowl and set it on the pot with water.,
Stir the chips as they start to melt.,
Check the consistency of the chocolate once it has melted.,
Take the chocolate off the heat and place the bowl next to the oil or powder colors.,
Sprinkle the powder color directly into the chocolate.,
Stir the chocolate to blend in the color.,
Place the bowl back on the double broiler if the chocolate starts to harden.,
Warm the coloring oil before you put it in the chocolate.,
Place the tightly sealed coloring oil in a small zip lock bag.,
Place the plastic bagged bottle in a bowl with warm water for 10-15 minutes.,
Remove the oil from the plastic bag.,
Slowly add a few drops of oil to the warmed chocolate and stir.,
Work on one color at a time.",How to Color Chocolate," Use dark or milk chocolate if you are trying to get a nice jet black color. Otherwise, you will need to use white chocolate to make any other colored chocolate.Choose a white chocolate with a low viscosity, or that appears very thin when you melt it.
Tollhouse’s White Chocolate Chips are one of the better brands for coloring.
Go for chips instead of bars, as the smaller the pieces of chocolate are, the faster they will melt.;
, Never add a water based food coloring to chocolate. It was cause the chocolate to seize, or turn lumpy and solid. You want to create colored chocolate that is smooth and easy to work with. So skip the cheap water based colors and go for oil or powder colors.


You can buy oil based coloring and powder coloring online.One good brand is Americolor, which creates strong colors without having to add a lot of oil to the chocolate.If you are trying to create a pale color like light blue or yellow, go for oil based colors as you only have to add very little coloring to the white chocolate to get the color you want.If you are trying to create a more vibrant color, like a bright yellow or a bold red, buy a powder coloring or paste coloring. The more oil you add to the chocolate, the less smooth it will be. So using a small amount of powder coloring or paste coloring should create a vibrant color without adding too much oil to the chocolate.

, Vegetable shortening usually comes in a round plastic tub and is hard in appearance, almost like butter. The shortening will help the chocolate to set properly on your candy or on a cake pop. It will also speed up the melting time of the chocolate.


Vegetable oil will only make the chocolate more loose and limp, meaning you will end up with messy chocolate covered candies or limp cake pops.

, If you have access to a stovetop, a large metal bowl, and a pot with a handle, you can boil the chocolate on the stove instead of in the microwave.The double boiler method works a bit faster and you have more control over the chocolate as it melts.

, Glass conducts heat evenly and quickly, so its the vessel of choice for melting chocolate in the microwave.

, When melting the chocolate, its best to melt a small amount at a time. So only use 1-2 cups of chocolate chips to start., Microwave the chocolate for no more than 30 seconds at a time on medium high heat.


You may be tempted to microwave the chocolate for longer than 30 seconds to speed up the process, but don’t do this. Any longer than 30 seconds at a time will heat the chocolate up too fast and cause it to become lumpy.

, Right before the chocolate is completely melted, take it out of the microwave and stir it to completely melt it.


It’s fine if a few of the chips on the sides of the bowl have not completely melted.

, Make sure most of the chocolate is smooth and easy to stir. The chocolate should fall easily off the spoon.

, Fill the pot about ⅓ of the way with water. Turn the burner to high heat so the water boils., The water should hover about half an inch below the metal bowl.


Once the water boils in the pot, turn off the heat. Then, pour the white chocolate chips into the bowl.

, Use a kitchen towel to hold the hot bowl with one hand. Don’t worry if the chips don’t seem to melt fast at first. After a few stirs, they should start to melt.


You can add a spoonful of vegetable shortening to speed up the process.

, You want it to fall off the spoon easily.

, Leave the chocolate in the warm bowl as the heat will keep the chocolate smooth and melted.

, Sprinkle a dash or two of the powder right into the bowl., As you stir, add more or less powder depending on how bright you want the color to be.


Remember that the bowl will be hot, so use a kitchen towel to hold it as you stir!

, As you stir, the chocolate may begin to harden around the edges of the bowl. You want the chocolate to remain melted so warm up the bowl again as you stir.

, Chocolate is very sensitive to temperature changes. So when you add the oil to the chocolate, its important that the oil is the same temperature as the chocolate. This will prevent the chocolate from seizing, or turning lumpy and hard., Squeeze the bag to remove as much air as possible from the bag.

, The water should be no more than 20 degrees warmer than the chocolate. Shake the bottle every 5 minutes to distribute the heat evenly.


It's a good idea to warm your oil up right before you warm up the chocolate, or in between warming up your chocolate. You want to avoid letting the chocolate sit and harden as you warm up the oil.

, Make sure you dry it off completely. You don’t want to get any water in the chocolate by accident, as this will dilute it!

, With most chocolate oils, a 2 oz. bottle will vibrantly color up to 6 pounds of chocolate. So for a deep, rich color, use about 2 teaspoons for each pound of chocolate. Use less for a lighter color.

, If you are planning to make several different colored bowls of chocolate, work one color at a time. This will prevent any mixing of the colors or accidents with the powder or oil."

Pick a chocolate to melt.,
Keep chocolate away from water.,
Melt the chocolate over low heat.,
Have vegetable oil.,
Get your dipping items ready.",How to Melt Chocolate for Dipping1," Apart from the basic types of chocolate - bittersweet, semisweet, milk and white - you can choose to melt chocolate bars, chocolate chips, or discs of special melting chocolate. They can all be melted using the same basic methods. Keep these tips in mind when you're deciding which form of chocolate to buy:









Melting chocolate is available at specialty baking and confectionery stores. It's formulated to melt easily and withstand higher temperatures than ordinary chocolate.
White chocolate is fussier when it comes to melting, since high heat can cause it to get dry and crumbly.
Unsweetened chocolate bars can also be melted for dipping. Sugar may be added to taste after the chocolate has been melted.;
, Even one stray drop of water can cause melting chocolate to seize, or harden, ruining its texture and consistency. Seized chocolate won't melt smoothly, no matter how long you stir it.









As soon as you unwrap your chocolate, place it in a dry bowl away from the sink or other water sources.
No matter what melting method you choose, be aware that even steam and condensation can cause chocolate to seize.

, Overheating chocolate can also cause it to seize. Overheated chocolate takes on a dry, crumbly appearance. Avoid this outcome by making sure you always melt chocolate slowly using low heat, no matter what melting method you use.








, Adding a drop or two of vegetable oil to seized chocolate can sometimes save it from having to be thrown out.









Stir a tiny amount of vegetable oil into chocolate that has seized because of the presence of water. If only a small portion of the chocolate has seized, the vegetable oil might help to smooth out the chocolate.
Stir a tiny amount of vegetable oil into chocolate that has seized due to overheating. Vegetable oil should help restore moisture to the chocolate.

, Chocolate cools and hardens quickly after it melts, so it is best to have your dipping items to start dipping as soon as the melting process is complete.









Make sure the fruit you are using has already been washed and stemmed. Pieces of wet fruit could cause the chocolate to seize; be sure to towel dry strawberries, blueberries and other freshly washed fruit pieces.
Line a baking sheet with waxed paper or parchment paper. As you dip fruit and other items, lay them on the sheet. Place it in the refrigerator when you are finished dipping. The chocolate won't stick to the paper once it has cooled and hardened.

"
"
Do not add water.,
Add the chocolate to top of a double boiler.,
Stirring constantly, move the chocolate around until it begins to melt.,
Continue stirring until the chocolate has fully melted.,
Use the chocolate for dipping, dressing, or incorporating into another recipe.








",How to Melt Chocolate1," The chocolate will become unusable.If you do happen to introduce a bit of water into the chocolate while melting, a little bit of vegetable oil will make the chocolate more usable, but it may still be grainy.






;
, If you don't have a double boiler, you can easily place a light, non-plastic bowl set over a pot of lightly steaming water. The steam will slowly heat the chocolate above.









Make sure not to let the bottom of the bowl (holding the chocolate) have contact with the steaming or boiling water. Contact with the water may cause the bowl to grow too warm, burning the chocolate instead of melting it.
The chocolate will melt faster if it is broken up into smaller pieces.

, Because chocolate is very easily burned, be careful not to leave the room or stop stirring for too long.








, Adjust the heat on the stove if you believe the chocolate is melting too quickly. The whole process should take anywhere from 5 to 10 minutes.








,"
"
Set up a double boiler.,
Place the chocolate in the double boiler.,
Heat the double boiler over medium-low heat.,
Stir the chocolate often.,
Start dipping.",How to Melt Chocolate for Dipping2," Double boilers are perfect for melting chocolate because they heat the chocolate indirectly, making it easier to keep the melting temperature low and controlled. Fill the bottom part of a double boiler with a couple of inches of water and set it on the stove.









If you don't have a double boiler, you can make one.

Find a medium-sized pot and a smaller one that fits inside. The fit does not have to be perfect, but it is easier to control the boiler if the smaller pot is just a few inches smaller than the larger one.
Fill the larger pot with a few inches of water. Place the smaller pot inside the larger pot, so the bottom of the smaller pot is submerged in an inch of water. The water should not come close to reaching the brim of either pot.
Be careful not to splash water into the smaller pot.



, Pour your chocolate into the top part of the double boiler.









If you are melting chocolate bars, break them up into smaller pieces before putting them in the double boiler. This will help them melt more evenly and quickly.
Don't overfill the double boiler. It is better to melt chocolate in small batches, since changes in temperature or exposure to moisture can cause it to seize.
Don't cover the double boiler with a lid. The condensation that collects there from the heated water could drip down into the chocolate.

, After a few minutes, the bottom layer of chocolate will begin melting.








, This will help it melt evenly and prevent it from becoming overheated.









If the chocolate is melting too quickly or burning, turn down the heat.
Continue stirring until the chocolate is entirely melted.

, Once the chocolate is melted, you can start dipping fruit, cookies or candies straight into the top of the double boiler.









To keep the chocolate melted while you dip, turn the heat down to low and stir the chocolate every few minutes.
If you'd rather dip away from the stove, turn off the heat, remove the top part of the double boiler, and set it on the counter before you start dipping.

"

Place the chocolate in a microwave safe dish.,
Place the dish in the microwave.,
Remove the dish from the microwave and start dipping.",How to Melt Chocolate for Dipping3," Any plastic, glass or ceramic bowl or mug will work well.









Don't overfill the dish. You can always melt a little more chocolate if you need it.
If you wish, add a tablespoon of vegetable oil per cup of chocolate pieces. This ensures even melting and helps prevent the chocolate from seizing, but it may affect the taste.

, Microwave it on medium heat in 30-second bursts.









After each 30-second burst, remove the dish from the microwave and stir the chocolate. Be careful, since the dish will get hot.
Repeat until the chocolate is entirely melted.

, It's easiest to dip fruit, cookies and candies directly into the dish, since transferring it to a different dish will cause it to cool faster.








"
"
Place the chocolate in an oven-safe dish.,
Place the dish in the oven.,
Stir the chocolate.,
Remove the chocolate from the oven.",How to Melt Chocolate for Dipping4," Spread it evenly in the bottom of the dish to help it melt more quickly.









Metal dishes are effective, since they heat through more quickly.
If you would like to use a toaster oven, place the chocolate in a smaller dish.

, Set the oven to it's lowest possible temperature, close the door and allow the chocolate to melt.









If your oven runs hot, keep the oven door slightly open, so the chocolate does not overheat.
If you are using a toaster oven, melt the chocolate using its lowest setting.

, Monitor the chocolate's progress as it melts, and be sure to stir often to help it melt more evenly and quickly. Continue until the chocolate is completely melted. It should take about an hour.








, Place it on a table or counter and start dipping.

Sprinkle them on baked goods before cooking.,
Substitute nuts or chocolate for cacao nibs.,
Add cacao nibs to ice cream.,
Try candied cacao nibs.",How to Use Cacao Nibs1," Cacao nibs have a unique bitter flavour, similar to dark chocolate, but with no added sugars. By sprinkling them on the top of baked goods, you will be able to taste the flavour of the nibs without being overwhelmed. The sweet flavour from the baked goods will soften the intensity., If you are making chocolate chip cookies, or banana nut muffins, try substituting the chocolate chips or nuts for cacao nibs. You could also try adding them to brittle instead of, or in addition to, nuts., Try using cacao nibs as an ice cream topping. The bitter taste of the cacao nibs will complement nicely with the sweet flavor of the ice cream. You can also combine with additional toppings, such as berries and nuts to make a tasty dessert., Candied cacao nibs are coated in a caramelized sugar. These treats can be a delicious stand alone snack, or you can try adding them to baked goods, such as truffles, brownies, and cakes. In order to make candied cacao nibs:Combine ½ a cup (118 ml) of granulated sugar, 2 tablespoons of water, and 1 tablespoon of corn syrup in a small saucepan. Place the saucepan on the stove on medium heat and stir until the sugar dissolves.
Bring the mixture to a boil and then insert a thermometer and continue to cook (without stirring) until the mixture reaches 330 F (165 C).
Remove the pan from the heat and add 1 cup (237 ml) of cacao nibs. Once the nibs are thoroughly coated, add 1 tablespoon of unsalted butter.
Then line a baking sheet with tinfoil and scoop the candied mixture onto the tinfoil. Spread out evenly across the baking sheet.
Let the candied cacao cool at room temperature until it has hardened. Then you can break into bits and enjoy!

, Place the bowl into the microwave.








, Be sure to change your power setting to the lowest you can before nuking the chocolate.









If you are using small chocolate chips, the cooking time on the initial blast will be much lower than 30 seconds. Go in intervals of 10 to 15 seconds initially to make sure that the chocolate chips won't burn.

, Continue to microwave the chocolate on its lowest setting.








,









A less expensive chocolate might be better suited for your first try at microwaving, in case it's accidentally scorched. Burning a less expensive chocolate is a lot easier on the psyche (and the wallet) than a more expensive one.

Gently pluck the deflated air balloon from inside the cup.,
Scoop approximately ½ to 1 cup of chocolate mousse into your chocolate cup.,
Sprinkle a few chocolate shavings on top.,
Shape a handle.,
Gently top the cup with the remaining whipping cream.",How to Make Hot Chocolate Cups," Don't fill them with water. Instead, just add some air and tie a knot at the bottom.

Blow the balloons up to cup size and keep mind you will be filling them with chocolate mousse.



 


Blow the balloons up before you melt the chocolate. Once the chocolate is melted, you have to work fast to create the cups before the chocolate sets.;
, This aids the melting process and reduces the chances of burning the chocolate.

, This step requires constant supervision, as chocolate burns easily:

Stir the melting chocolate often. If you're melting it in a pan or double boiler, stir constantly on low heat until the chocolate is fully melted.






Check the melting chocolate every 30 seconds. If you're melting the chocolate in a microwave, set it to cook for 30 seconds. Check and stir before returning it to cook for another 30 seconds.






Remove the melted chocolate from the heat source when it has a smooth, silky consistency. Now it's time to quickly create your cups.







, Cover the balloon three quarters of the way with chocolate.

, Avoid making it too thick; a thin covering works well.

, Allow them to dry/cool.


Allow the chocolate covered balloons to cool for up to 30 minutes. Alternatively, place the balloons in the refrigerator for faster cooling time.







, Combine 1 cup of heavy cream with a teaspoon of sugar. Whip using an electric mixer at high speed until peaks form.


Measure ½ a cup of whipping cream and place inside the refrigerator. This cream will sit atop the chocolate mousse cups.







, Sprinkle with the gelatin. Leave for 10 minutes to allow for it to expand.

,


Stir the mixture constantly to ensure complete integration. Also, stirring the chocolate will minimize the possibility the chocolate will burn.






Remove from the heat source while a few chocolate chunks are still visible. Combine with a bowl of whipping cream mixed with gelatin.







, Be sure to fully integrate the powder into the cocoa to get a hint of “kicked up” flavor.


Do not overwork the mousse––too much whipping will lose its fluffy appeal.

, Make sure a full 30 minutes has passed if you're unsure whether the chocolate is ready.

Gently prick the top of the water balloon with a thin needle to release the air; do this carefully so the balloon doesn't explode.






Allow the balloon to deflate and line the bottom of your cup. Wait for all the air to be released before proceeding to the next step.







, Take care not to disturb the chocolate cup when removing the balloon.

, The amount will depend upon the size you've made your chocolate cups.

, Don’t overdo it, but simply add a few slight shavings to add body and crunch to your mousse.

, This step is optional but it does give a realistic appearance to the chocolate cup if you're prepared to do some more work:


Melt some additional chocolate. Allow to cool until it can be handled.
Pour a thin ""U""-style shape of melted chocolate onto a tray lined with parchment paper (or onto a silicone sheet). Use your fingers or a tool such as a knife to shape the ""U"" if needed. Leave to set.
Apply the handle using dobs of melted chocolate.

, Consider adding some more shaved chocolate or even grate a coffee bean on top. Finished.

Finished.

",How to Make Chocolate Lace," You could use any of the following surfaces: baking/parchment paper, wax paper, or plastic food wrap. Just be sure there are no creases or wrinkles in the surface.


Alternatively, this can be done on a cold surface such as a granite or marble chopping board. A cold surface helps the chocolate to set quickly.;
, Ensure that the chocolate is tempered.

, Move the piping tool up, down, diagonally and back and forth, to create a lattice or lace effect.


When you become more adroit at doing this, you can make specific designs, such as shown in this image of webs. Designs could be butterflies, bows, candy shapes, etc.







, The chocolate lace will set best at room temperature.

, Add to the dessert or cake for decorative effect.

Make sure that the bottom of the upper pot or bowl is not touching the water. The double boiler will allow you to melt the marshmallows slowly so that you can use them as a dip or in fondant.;
, This will prevent the marshmallows from sticking to the pot and spatula as they melt.

, You will need a 16 ounce bag (about 400 grams) of marshmallows. You can use large marshmallows or miniature marshmallows, although you may find that the miniature marshmallows melt easier. You can even use colored or flavored marshmallows, but be sure that they are all the same color and flavor.

If you use multiple colors all at once, the colors will mix together and make brown. If you use different flavors all at once, the flavors will combine, and the ending result may not be very tasty.







, You will notice that the marshmallows are starting to melt.

, If you are using white-colored marshmallows, you can tint them another color with a few drops of food coloring. If you wish to add flavor to your marshmallows, you can add one teaspoon of vanilla extract or flavoring. Make sure that the flavoring you are using is clear, or your marshmallows will take on the color of the extract: brown., If you use high heat, you will risk scorching the marshmallows.

, Once the marshmallows begin to melt, add two more tablespoons of water. This is to prevent them from drying out. Make sure that you stir the mixture so that the marshmallows heat evenly. If you find that the marshmallows are starting to stick to your spatula, wipe them off and re-grease your spatula.

, If you wish to use your melted marshmallows as a fondant, you will need to add some powdered sugar into the mixture.

Using a greased spatula, stir the sugar one cup (125 grams) at a time into the mixture. Once it thickens, place the mixture onto a well-greased surface and knead it. Make sure that your hands are well-greased as well; this will prevent the marshmallow mixture from sticking. Once the fondant reaches the desired texture, wrap it and place it in the fridge overnight. The next day, you can roll it out and use it for decorating.The fondant will tear if it is too dry. If this happens, add ½ teaspoon of water and knead. Keep adding more water, ½ teaspoon at a time, and kneading until the fondant no longer tears."

Serve the marshmallows.",How to Melt Marshmallows2," You will need the skillet to be very hot before you can add the marshmallows, so leave the skillet in the oven while it is heating. This method will allow you to make a s'mores dip.


If you do not have a cast-iron skillet, you can use another, similar-sized oven-safe dish instead.

, Set the marshmallows down on their (curved) sides, and cut them in half using a sharp knife. You should end up with a disk-shaped marshmallow. Set these aside.

, Make sure that you use a pot holder, because the skillet will be very hot. Do not turn the oven off.

, You can simply hold the skillet by the handle and twist and turn it until the butter coats the entire surface. If you are not using a skillet, then you can spread the butter around on the surface using a heat-safe spatula instead.

, If you wish to make a s'more dip, you will need to add some chocolate. Measure out 1 ½ cups (265 grams) of chocolate chips and spread them out evenly on the bottom of the skillet.

, Arrange them so that they are touching each other. They should fit snugly inside the skillet. Be careful not to burn your fingers on the skillet!

, Let the marshmallows bake for 5 to 7 minutes. The tops will turn golden-brown and crispy, but the insides will be soft and gooey.


If you want a crispy, fire-like texture, turn the broiler on during the last few minutes. Watch them carefully to avoid burning them.

, Set it down on a heat-safe surface and let the dip cool for at about 5 minutes.

, You can spread the marshmallows onto graham crackers, cake, or cupcakes using a butter knife. You can also break graham crackers in half or into quarters, and dip them into the melted marshmallows.

Place a large marshmallow on a skewer or stick.,
Place the marshmallow over the flames and turn it.,
Remove the marshmallow from the flames once it is cooked.,
Consider serving the marshmallow as a s'more.",How to Melt Marshmallows3," If you are using a gas grill, set it on medium to high heat so that you will have some flames. You will be roasting the marshmallows over the flames, which will give you a nice, crunchy outside and a soft, gooey inside.

, Make sure that the skewer or stick is long enough so that you can hold the marshmallow over the flames without scorching your hand. You can use a metal skewer, but make sure that the handle is heat-resistant so that you don't burn yourself. If you are using a long stick, consider shaving the end into a point; this will not only make it easier to impale the marshmallow onto it, but it will also lessen the changes of any tree bark getting into your marshmallow.

, Keep the marshmallow just above the flames and turn it slowly to ensure that it roasts evenly.


If your marshmallow catches on fire, do not wave it around. Instead, gently blow the flame out.

, You can tell when your marshmallow is melted on the inside if the outside is golden brown and crispy to the touch.


If you like your marshmallows charred, hold it closer to the flames and keep roasting it.
This method is perfect for toasting a marshmallow for topping. For example, a marshmallow milkshake can have several roasted marshmallows incorporated into the mixture in the blender and one on top for garnish.

, Break a graham cracker in half and place a small piece of chocolate on one of the halves. Place the marshmallow (without pulling it off of the stick or skewer) on top of the chocolate, and press down on it with the other graham cracker. While still pressing down on the graham cracker, gently pull the stick or skewer out from the marshmallow. Wait a few moments before serving, so that the marshmallow can cool down and melt the chocolate.Don’t forget to turn off your gas grill when all of your marshmallows have been roasted.

It will take about 10 minutes for the gelatin to bloom. Prepare the rest of your ingredients during this time.
You can also use a food processor fitted with whisks instead. Don't insert the whisks just yet, however.;
, The gelatin will “bloom” during this time.

, Pour the remaining ½ cup of water into a small saucepan. Stir in the granulated sugar, salt, and corn syrup. Let the mixture cook, covered, over medium-high heat for 3 to 4 minutes.

Don't add the powdered sugar just yet.







, Remove the lid from the saucepan and clip a candy thermometer to the side. Allow the sugar water to cook until it reaches to 240°F (115°C). This will take about 7 to 8 minutes. As soon as it reaches to 240°F (115°C), remove the saucepan from the stove.

, Fit the whisks into your mixer or food processor. Turn the speed on to low, then slowly pour the sugar water down the sides.

, Once you have used up all of the sugar water, switch the speed on your mixer to high. Let it continue whipping until the mixture is thick, fluffy, and lukewarm. This will take about 12 to 15 minutes., Be sure to mix everything together well. If you don't like vanilla, you can omit it, or you can use a different extract, such as peppermint.

, Mix together ¼ cup (30 grams) of powdered sugar and ¼ cup (30 grams) of cornstarch. Spread the mixture across the bottom and sides of a greased, 9 by 9-inch (22.86 by 22.86-centimeter) square baking pan.Save any leftover cornstarch/sugar for later.

Dip the bud in chocolate.,
Add a surprise to the inside of the marshmallow.,
Experiment with other flavors and aromas.",How to Make a Blooming Marshmallow2," Melt the cup of milk chocolate and pour it into the silicone cupcake mold. Be sure to use a mold meant for small cupcakes, as a regular-sized cupcake mold is too large. Save a small amount of the chocolate for use in a later step.If chocolate collects in the bottom of the cups, pour it out so that there’s only a thin layer of chocolate on the bottom and side of each individual mold.
Place the mold in the refrigerator until the chocolate re-hardens. Pop each chocolate cup carefully. These will serve as the bases for your marshmallow flowers.

, Dust a flower-shaped cookie cutter with cornstarch and use it to remove “flowers” from the sheet of marshmallow. Place them on surface dusted with cornstarch without allowing them to touch one another if you’re cutting out more than one at a time., Meticulously fold the petals of your flowers inwards towards themselves, so that it looks like a hand with all of the fingertips touching. You may wish to elongate individual petals of your marshmallow flowers to allow for easier folding. To do so, use a knife to deepen the valleys between the petals., Once your flower buds are sculpted, dip the bottom of each bud into a bit of melted chocolate. Then press the bud into it’s own hardened chocolate base. Finally, allow the individual buds to cool and seal the marshmallow flower to the base., You may wish to increase the appeal to your flowers by inserting something in the middle of the flower. Whatever you hide here will be revealed when the flower blooms. A particularly apt option would be a tiny truffle - though the specific is entirely up to you.Be creative. For instance, you could shatter a candy cane and dust the interior of the flower, or burrow a gummy bear within the petals arms.
Another option is adding a drop of food coloring to the center of the marshmallow flower before folding it up. Alternatively, you can brush a mixture of water and food coloring to whatever portion of the marshmallow you want.

, This recipe calls for vanilla extract as the only flavoring additives, but feel free to add other flavors as well. For instance, you could add a drop of all natural lavender essential oil when you add the vanilla. This will not only imbue the flowers with a subtle lavender flavor, they will also give off a thematically appropriate aroma.Similarly, you can make the chocolate based with either dark chocolate or white chocolate if you prefer.

Test your marshmallow buds.,
Serve it with hot cocoa or coffee.,
Top your marshmallow with seasonal spices.",How to Make a Blooming Marshmallow3," You may want to make sure you've mastered the process before unveiling your blooming marshmallows with all of your friends around. To do so, practice beforehand. If the flower doesn’t “open,” when you place if in hot chocolate, make sure the walls of the chocolate base aren’t too high, and that your individual petals weren’t stuck together too firmly.

Further, your buds will only open if the hot chocolate is hot enough to melt the chocolate. Accordingly, use hot chocolate that is still steaming and add the blooming marshmallow before the beverage cools.

, It almost goes without saying that blooming marshmallows are meant for use in one particular drink. Of course, if you want to try it in another hot drink, the world is your oyster. One particular interesting option would be making the base with caramel flavored chocolate chips, adding allspice to your flower bud, and serving this alternative blooming marshmallow in hot apple cider.Never to be forgotten, coffee is always a good call for sweet and seasonal garnishing.
Always add the marshmallow buds carefully, with the chocolate base down.

, Simply sprinkle cinnamon or whichever spice you have in mind onto your marshmallow bud before adding it to your hot chocolate. When you do, the petals will turn over as the bloom, dispersing the spice into your beverage and adding aroma in tandem with the visual allure of the opening marshmallow flower.Other spices that you can use to top your marshmallow include nutmeg and allspice. Similarly, consider sprinkling crushed candy cane or dark chocolate shaving on the marshmallow too.

Turn off the heat of your stove and cool your mixture.,
Whisk the mixture vigorously.,
Pour your fudge batter into the greased baking dish.,
Allow your fudge batter to cool.,
Portion your fudge for eating.",How to Make Russian Fudge," Making Russian fudge will requires you to first prepare the fudge mixture and then allowing the fudge batter to cool until it properly sets into fudge proper.In addition to your ingredients, you will also need:


Baking dish (like a bread pan, 8½"" x 4½"")
Cutting board
Cutting knife
Large stove top pot (or heavy bottomed saucepan)
Measuring cups
Metal whisk
Thermometer (candy or probe)
Wooden spoon;
, Once your Russian fudge mixture is prepared, you'll have to add it quickly to your baking dish before it firms and becomes difficult to work with.This is why you should grease your pan with unsalted butter before beginning to make your fudge batter.


Salted butter should be avoided, as it is more likely to burn and impart some saltiness to the fudge.Forgetting to grease your pan might result in your fudge burning or getting stuck to your baking dish.
The fudge batter also easily absorbs oil, leading to altered flavors and increased stickiness to the dish.

, Put your pot or saucepan on your stove and turn the burner to medium heat.Allow your pot to heat for a short while before adding the sugar and milk to it.


Stir the milk and sugar constantly with your wooden spoon while heating the mixture until the sugar dissolves completely.A milky film should appears on top of the mixture when the two ingredients have combined.

, Continue stirring your mixture regularly until you notice that the butter, which is one of the ingredients you'll be adding to your mixture, has melted. You'll also need to add to your sugar-milk mixture:


Butter
Condensed milk
Salt
Corn syrup (or golden syrup)

, Turn the heat of your stove-top to high and stir thoroughly and continuously. You'll want to pay special attention to the bottom of your pot or saucepan; you don't want your mixture to build up on the bottom of your cooking dish.This stage of your fudge mixture preparation can take anywhere from 5 to 30 minutes., The soft-ball stage is the temperature at which a sugar solution, when dropped into cold water, forms into soft, malleable balls.This can be measured with a probe or candy thermometer.


235°F (112.78°C) – 240°F (115.56°C) is the temperature range for the soft-ball stage., At this point, your Russian fudge mixture should appear golden brown appearance. You'll want to wait about five minutes or so, until the mixture has thickened.

, Once your fudge batter has cooled, you should beat it with a whisk until the consistency of it is about that of melted chocolate or thick caramel. The whisking process may take anywhere from 10 to 30 minutes., Once your fudge batter has thickened to the consistency of melted chocolate/thick caramel and stirring becomes somewhat difficult, pour your fudge immediately into your greased pan.As soon as your fudge batter reaches the appropriate consistency, you should transfer it to your baking dish; it will quickly set and become difficult to work with., Your fudge should be fully set at room temperature after roughly two hours have passed. You can aid in the setting process by allowing your fudge batter to cool and then putting it into your refrigerator until the fudge is firm., Now that your fudge has set, you can cut it into small or large squares and place it on a serving dish. Your fudge will stay fresh at room temperature for about 7 to 14 days in an air tight container, and should not be refrigerated, as this will negatively impact the fudge's consistency.If you would like to save some of your Russian fudge for a later date, you can freeze your fudge wrapped in wax paper and sealed in an airtight container for several months."

Wrap any uneaten candy and store in the fridge.",How to Make Potato Candy," Place a medium-sized pot of water on the stove. Sprinkle in a pinch of salt, then turn the heat up to medium-high and bring the water to a boil. When the water reaches a boil, drop in the potato., Keep the potato in the hot water for around fifteen minutes. After fifteen minutes, use a large serving spoon to remove the potato from the water. Poke the potato with a fork. If the potato is soft and easy to pierce it, the potato is done cooking. If it is still hard, put the potato back into the water and cook more until it is easy to pierce., After you take the potato out of the hot water, pat it dry, then wait for it to cool slightly, about five to ten minutes. Then cut the potato in half and use a spoon to scoop out the cooked, white inside of the potato., Place the potato pieces that you scooped out into a large, sturdy bowl. Use a potato masher to pound the potatoes and mash them down to a paste as smooth as you can.You can also use an electric mixer to mash the potato.

, When you have achieved a thick, smooth paste, add ½ teaspoon of vanilla extract. Mix in the two pounds of confectionary sugar gradually by pouring it in half a pound at a time, then stirring to mix.You can also use maple flavoring or almond extract if you prefer those flavors to vanilla.

, When you have added all the sugar, stir with a large, sturdy mixing spoon. With all the sugar added, the dough should be very thick and somewhat difficult to stir. Make sure to mix until all the sugar is integrated and the dough looks uniform., Once you have thoroughly mixed the dough, cover it and place it in the refrigerator for an hour. Refrigerating will thicken and stiffen the dough to give it a better texture., Clean off a counter or a large cutting board, then sprinkle on powdered sugar in a thin layer. You can also lay a piece of parchment paper on top of the counter or cutting board and sprinkle the sugar on the parchment paper., Take the bowl of dough out of the refrigerator and place the dough on top of the sugared cutting board or counter. Use a rolling pin to roll out the dough into a rectangle that is about ¼ of an inch thick.If you notice that the dough is too soft or sticky, sprinkle more powdered sugar.

, Scoop out ½ cup of peanut butter onto the rectangle of dough. Use a knife to spread the peanut butter evenly until it covers the dough in a thin layer.You can use regular peanut butter or natural peanut butter depending on your preference. Regular peanut butter has a sweeter flavor, or you can use natural peanut butter, which has a more robust taste.

, Chunky peanut butter will add a crunch to the potato candy.

, Once you have added the layer of peanut butter, roll the dough starting at one side of the rectangle until the dough is rolled into a cylinder shape. Make sure not to press down on the dough too hard as you roll, but also try not to roll too loosely, or else there will be a lot of empty space within the roll.The roll should be a log-like shape that is the same thickness throughout.
Roll the dough just as you would for a jelly roll or a cinnamon roll.

, Carefully wrap the potato roll with parchment paper, then place the roll in the fridge for three to four hours. This will help to firm up the log so that it is solidified and easier to eat., Take the potato candy log out of the refrigerator after a few hours. Rub a stick of butter onto a sharp knife, then cut the roll into slices that are about ½ inch thick.Buttering the knife prevents the slices of potato candy from sticking to the knife.

, Wait until the potato candy comes to room temperature, then serve! The potato candy should have a thick and smooth texture and taste sweet and peanut-buttery!, If you have any leftover candy, wrap it in plastic wrap and store it in the fridge. Potato candy can dry out very fast if it is not wrapped up."

Ready your work space.,
Place the ingredients in the saucepan.,
Cook the syrup.,
Ice the syrup.",How to Make Spun Sugar1," Keep all of your supplies near your stove top or range so you aren't running around your kitchen with hot sugar. You'll need a heavy-bottomed medium saucepan on your stove. Set a large bowl of ice water on the counter next to the stove. You'll also need a small bowl of water, a pastry brush, and a candy thermometer.Make sure the saucepan will be able to fit inside the bowl with ice water.;
, Pour 1/2 cup of water in your saucepan. You'll also need to scoop in 1/2 cup of corn syrup and 2 1/2 cups of granulated sugar. Try not to get any of the granulated sugar on the sides of the saucepan since this can make the mixture crystallize.It may help to pour the granulated sugar directly into the center of the saucepan.

, Stir the mixture just once so that the water and sugars combine. Turn the heat onto medium-high heat so that the sugar dissolves. Avoid stirring the mixture while it cooks or it may crystallize and become grainy. The mixture will bubble and begin to darken a little. Keep cooking until a candy thermometer reads 293 degrees F (145 degrees C).To prevent crystallization, dip your pastry brush in some water and wipe down the sides of the saucepan. Take extra care not to burn yourself with the hot sugar.

, Once your sugar syrup has reached the proper temperature, you'll need to immediately stop it from cooking further. Use hot pads to carefully lift the saucepan off of the stove and plunge the bottom of the pot directly into the bowl of ice water. Keep the saucepan on the ice water for 5 seconds.This should bring the temperature of your sugar syrup down to around 275 degrees F (135 degrees C).

Choose a bowl.,
Spin the sugar syrup over the bowl.,
Trim the rim of the sugar cage.,
Remove the cage from the bowl.,
Use the spun sugar cage.",How to Make Spun Sugar2," Determine what size cage you'd like to make and find a bowl that is the diameter of what you need. Wash and dry the bowl. Spray the inside of it lightly with a little cooking spray so you can easily remove the sugar cage.Make sure the bowl you use can handle the high heat of the sugar syrup. Avoid using flimsy plastic or styrofoam bowls.

, Pour the somewhat cooled sugar syrup into a microwave-safe bowl. When the syrup is thickened to the consistency of honey, dip the tines of a fork into the syrup. Wave the fork over the bowl so that the syrup strands begin to cover the bowl and drape over the sides. Keep spinning the sugar until the cage is as thick and even as you'd like it.You'll need to be careful when handling the hot syrup, but work quickly. If the syrup in the bowl hardens too much, simply microwave it briefly so that it becomes syrupy again.

, At this point, you'll have a spun sugar cage nestled inside your bowl with long strands draping over the sides of the bowl. To clean up the look of your sugar cage, trip the edges of the bowl. Take a sharp chef's knife and trim along the edges of the bowl.To strengthen the sugar cage and make it easier to remove, you'll need to let the sugar cage set up for about 5 minutes.

, Once the cage has completely hardened, you'll need to unmold the sugar cage. Place your thumbs on the outside of the bowl and rest your other fingers on the inside so they're touching the sugar cage. Gently apply pressure so you can pull the cage up and away.If it seems like your sugar cage may break, move your hands and fingers to another point along the bowl. Applying even pressure can prevent the cage from breaking as you remove it.

, Set the sugar cage on top of your dessert and serve it immediately. The sugar cage will begin to absorb moisture from the air and it may fall apart if you wait too long to serve it.If the sugar cage is still too warm, it will collapse. If it begins to do this, place it back into the bowl so that it keeps its shape while it hardens.

"
"
Ready your work space.,
Spin the sugar.,
Gather and form the nests.,
Use your spun sugar nests.",How to Make Spun Sugar3," You can use any type of wooden dowels, rolling pins, or spoon handles to drape the spun sugar. Since it's a matter of personal preference, you can try using one large rolling pin or several wooden handles. Cover your counter space and floor with foil. This will make clean up easier since the sugar may fall and harden.If you'd like to use several wooden handles or dowels, consider taping them to your counter space so they don't fall while you're spinning the sugar. Keep them several inches apart so you can pull the sugar between them.

, Dip the tines of one or two forks into your bowl of sugar syrup. Raise them up so the biggest drips of syrup fall back into the pan. Working quickly, point the fork tines down over the wooden dowels, handles, or rolling pin and wave your wrist back and forth.Moving your wrist quickly while the sugar falls will create thin delicate strands of sugar that you can form and work with.

, The strands of sugar will cool very quickly and you should be able to gently loosen them from the wood. Gather the strands of sugar together in your hands. Loosely cup your hands together so that the sugar strands form a small nest. Continue pulling and forming the strands to create as many nests as you need.Make sure your hands are cool when working with the spun sugar or else the thin strands may begin to melt.

, Since the nests are made of delicate sugar strands, they'll begin to absorb moisture from the air. You should serve the desserts with sugar nests immediately (or at least within an hour).If you must store them for a little while before serving, place the nests in an airtight container with parchment and silica packets (to absorb the moisture). This can help store them for up to one day.

Hold the sugar syrup over a sharpening steel.,
Wind the sugar around your tool.,
Remove the sugar spiral.,
Use your sugar spiral.",How to Make Spun Sugar4," Dip the tines of a fork into your sugar syrup and allow the biggest drips of syrup to fall back into the bowl. When the syrup becomes a very thin stream, hold it over a sharpening steel (like you use to sharpen knives).If you don't have a sharpening steel, you can also use the greased handle of a metal kitchen tool.

, Begin winding the strand of sugar around the handle of the tool you're using (sharpening steel or metal kitchen utensil). Start close to you and gradually wind the sugar to the end of the tool. You'll need to work fast so the sugar doesn't completely cool before you've made your spiral.This may take several tries since the sugar has to be delicate enough to wrap, but strong enough not to break.

, Snap the end farthest from you to create a trimmed spiral. Working very carefully, cup the sugar spiral with the palm of one of your hands and gently pull it away and off from the handle of your tool.Since a sugar spiral is made using one strand of sugar, it may be very thin and delicate.

, Serve the sugar spiral on your dessert right away since it will begin to absorb moisture from the air. Since the sugar spirals are so delicate, you really shouldn't plan on storing them for any length of time. But, if you'd like to try to keep them for use within the same day, you should:Store the spirals in an airtight container
Set the spirals on parchment paper
Place silica packets in the container to absorb moisture

Heat the sugar, water, and cream of tartar.,
Bring the mixture to the hard crack stage.,
Remove from the heat and add the remaining ingredients.,
Roll the candy into a rope.,
Cut the rope into individual candies.,
Coat the candies with sugar before cooling.",How to Make Lemon Drops1," The main ingredients in lemon drop candies are sugar and lemon flavors. To make these little treats, you have to bring the sugar to a boil to get it to a specific temperature so it becomes hard candy. To do this, you'll need:Medium heavy-bottomed saucepan
Wooden spoon
Candy thermometer
Heat-proof mat
Oiled spoon
Oiled counter or marble slab
Oiled kitchen shears
Parchment-lined baking sheet
Large bowl;
, Combine the three ingredients in a heavy-bottomed saucepan. Heat the pan over medium-high heat. Stir regularly until the sugar melts and the three ingredients are fully combined.


The cream of tartar in this recipe isn't necessary, but it will help prevent the sugar from crystalizing. If the sugar crystallizes, it won’t become hard candy.
It’s important to use a heavy-bottomed saucepan, because this will prevent the sugar from burning.

, Once the sugar melts and everything is fully incorporated, stop stirring the mixture. Use the candy thermometer to measure the temperature as the mixture heats up. You must bring the sugar to 300 F (149 C), which is the hard crack stage.The hard crack stage means that the sugar will become hard and brittle when it cools.

, As soon as the mixture reaches the hard crack stage, remove the pan from the heat and transfer it to a heat-proof mat. Wait for the mixture to cool for about 30 seconds, and then add in the extract, citric acid, and five drops of the yellow food coloring. Stir with an oiled spoon to prevent sticking.Stir the mixture until all the ingredients are fully combined. Add another five drops of food coloring if necessary to achieve the desired shade of yellow.

, Wait about five minutes to give the candy time to cool. When it’s cool enough to handle, turn the candy out onto an oiled surface. With your hands, roll the candy into a long, thin rope. Continue rolling the candy on the counter until the rope is about one inch (2.5 cm) thick.

Alternatively, you can also pour the entire candy mixture into a parchment-lined baking sheet as soon as all the ingredients are combined. That way, you can cut the candy into any shape you like. After you pour the candy, let it cool for about five minutes before cutting it., When you’ve rolled the candy out into the rope, use the oiled kitchen shears to cut the candy into half-inch to inch-long (1.3 to 2.5 cm) individual pieces. Add more oil or grease to the shears as necessary to prevent sticking.If you poured the candy into the baking sheet, use an oiled knife to cut the candy sheet into individual pieces. You can cut the candies into squares, circles, strips, or any other shape you like.

, Fill the bottom of a large bowl with castor sugar. Transfer the individual candies to the bowl and toss to coat them in the sugar. When the candies are fully coated, transfer them to a parchment-lined baking sheet to cool and harden for about an hour.Castor sugar is finely ground white sugar. You can coat the candies in regular granulated sugar or powdered sugar in case you can't find castor sugar.
Store any leftover candies in an air-tight container. If the candies are exposed to air, they will become sticky and soft.

Gather your supplies.,
Make the simple syrup.,
Prepare the glass.,
Combine the ingredients for the cocktail.,
Pour and serve.",How to Make Lemon Drops2," Along with the ingredients that you'll need to make this martini drink, you'll also need a cocktail glass, a martini shaker, and a small, flat plate. The plate will be used to rim the cocktail glass with sugar.

To make the simple syrup that’s called for in this recipe, you'll need ½ cup (113 g) of sugar and ½ cup (119 ml) of water.

, Combine the sugar and water in a saucepan. Heat over medium-high heat until the mixture boils. Reduce the heat to medium and simmer for three minutes.Remove from the heat and set the syrup aside to cool for about 30 minutes.

This will make about ¾ cup (178 ml) of simple syrup, which is more than you need for a single cocktail. Transfer any leftovers to the fridge for other uses.
You can also increase or decrease the quantities to make more or less syrup. You always need equal parts sugar and water to make simple syrup.

, Sprinkle a thin layer of sugar onto the small plate. Take the lemon wedge and run it around the entire rim of the glass to wet the inside and outside of the rim with juice. Dip the wet rim into the sugar on the plate and twirl the glass around to coat the rim in sugar.Set the glass aside to let the sugar dry as you make the martini.

, Pour the vodka, orange liqueur, simple syrup, and lemon juice into the martini shaker. Fill the shaker with ice. Put on the strainer and the lid and shake about 10 times to mix and chill the ingredients.

To make more than one drink, simply double or triple the quantities for each ingredient that you pour into the shaker.
Good orange liqueurs for this recipe include Grand Marnier, Triple Sec, and Cointreau.You may want to wrap the martini shaker in a towel to prevent your hands from freezing.

, Remove the lid from the martini shaker, but leave the strainer in place. Pour the cocktail into the prepared glass and serve. You can garnish the drink with a piece of lemon zest, grated lemon zest, or a lemon wedge."

, It should boil until it reaches 310 degrees Fahrenheit (154 Celsius). Be patient, since achieving this temperature can take a while.


It is essential that the candy reach 300 to 310 degrees, which is considered “hard-crack.” At this point the sugar will change consistency.

, Hold on to the handle and keep stirring.

, Jolly Rancher flavors include cherry, apple, lemon, watermelon, strawberry and grape, so you can make several batches to achieve a mixed bag of candies.

, For example, green apple should be green, while cherry will be red.

, Your candy texture will be smoother thanks to the extra stirring; however, it should still be very hot when you pour it into your baking sheet.

, Let it cool on the flat surface until you can touch it lightly. Test it with your finger. It should be slightly firm but malleable., Try to do this in one swift motion so it doesn’t stretch

, Turn the cutting board 90 degrees and score it in the opposite direction every one-half inch (1.3cm). This will make rectangular Jolly Rancher candies.

, Wrap each candy in wax paper or cellophane while it is still warm. Try to keep the candy separated and airtight so that it doesn’t absorb too much moisture from the air.

Wait for the candy to cool.,
Remove the candy from the baking sheet.,
Store your Jolly Rancher lollipops.",How to Make Jolly Rancher Lollipops1," In order to make Jolly Rancher lollipops, you will need to melt the Jolly Ranchers. Turn on your oven and set it to 275°F (135°C). This will be hot enough for the Jolly Ranchers to melt once you put them inside.
, The aluminum foil will prevent your baking sheet from getting sticky or ruined, and the parchment paper will make it easier to remove the lollipops once they have cooled. Place the parchment paper on top of the aluminum, and lightly grease your parchment paper with shortening or cooking spray. This will help the lollipops from sticking., Arrange the groups in rows, and leave enough room for some lollipop sticks. Each group should have 2 to 3 candies.

You can create long, rectangular lollipops by lining up 5 pieces instead of 3. Consider alternating the colors, such as red and green, or pink and blue. You can turn these rectangles into lilies by rolling them into cones once the candy melts.
To make daisies, arrange 5 to 6 Jolly Ranchers in a circle. You are creating something that looks like a star. There will be a gap in the middle of your star. You can leave the gap as is, or fill it with another hard candy, such as a Life Saver. When the candies melt, the candy will flatten out. The ""rays"" will look like petals.

, Let the Jolly Ranchers bake for about 6 to 8 minutes or until melted. The Jolly Ranchers will spread and flatten out into rounded squares or circles. Keep an eye on the candy, however, as each oven is different, and your candy might melt sooner., Once the candy has melted, take the tray out of the oven and set it down on a stable, heat-resistant surface. You may have to take the candy out in less than 6 minutes., Take the lollipop sticks and start laying them down into the melted Jolly Ranchers. You want just the first inch or two of the lollypop stick to be inside the melted Jolly Rancher. Twist the lollipop stick slightly as you are laying it into the melted candy. This creates a secure bond.If you made rectangular lollipops with 5 pieces, then place the lollipop stick into one of the narrow ends of the rectangle. Because this is a bigger piece, you can put more of the lollipop stick into the candy.
If you are making daisies, insert the lollipop stick between two petals. Try to make the top of the stick go all the way to the center of the flower.
If you are making lilies, insert the lollipop stick into the wide end of the rectangle, then roll the rectangle into a cone.
After you have inserted the lollipop sticks, but before the candy hardens, consider decorating it further with some sprinkles or other candies.

, Leave the lollipops undisturbed on the baking sheet for about 5 minutes, or until they have cooled off and hardened., If there is any residue left behind from the shortening or cooking spray, then wipe it off with a cloth., Once you have finished making your lollipops, you will need to store them in a cool, dry place so that they don't get sticky. Keep them in a sealed container, or wrap them in cellophane bags and tie them off with string.

If you made Jolly Rancher flowers, consider tying a short, green ribbon around the lollipop stick to resemble leaves, and place the lollipop in a small vase. You can use it as decorations or favors at a party.

These are apple-flavored, and you will need them to make your caramel apple lollipops. Unwrap the candy and discard the wrappers., Arrange the candy in groups of 2 to 3 on your baking sheet. The candies should be placed side by side, and resemble squares or rectangles. Remember to leave space for lollipop sticks., Let the candy bake for 6 to 8 minutes, or until the candy has melted. The melted Jolly Ranchers will be thin, and look like rounded squares or circles., Set the sheet down on a stable, heat-resistant surface. Leave the candy undisturbed while it cools. This will take about 5 minutes., Take a small, clean pot and drop some hard, caramel candy into it. You can also use caramel melting bits, found in the baking department of a supermarket, instead. Turn on the stove, and wait until the caramel melts. Once the caramel has melted, take the pot off the stove and set it down onto a stable, heat-resistant surface. You can transfer the caramel into a clean bowl or you can leave it in the pot.

Consider adding some water, milk, heavy whipping cream, or butter to your caramel. This will make it either thinner or thicker; it can also enrich the flavor. Remember, the more milk or water you add, the softer and thinner your caramel will be when it hardens again.Consider further enhancing your caramel by adding a few drops of vanilla extract.
You can also melt your caramel in a melting pot, a double boiler, or in the microwave., You can dip the entire candy into the caramel, or just the top half. Turn the lollipop stick between your fingers so that the caramel covers the entire candy, and wipe the excess caramel off on the side of the pot or bowl Work quickly, as the hot caramel may cause the candy to start melting again.For additional flavor, dip the caramel apple lollipops into a bowl of crumbled walnuts or pecans. Do this quickly, before the caramel hardens. For a less nutty lollipop, you can lay the lollipops on a flat surface, and sprinkle some crumbled walnuts or pecans onto the caramel part before it hardens.
Consider drizzling some melted chocolate over the caramel.

, Once you have covered the candy with caramel, set the lollipop down on a baking sheet and leave it some place where it won't be disturbed until the caramel cools off and hardens., Once the caramel has set, you will need to store your lollipops in a cool, dry location.

If you wish to use a silicon ice cube mold, make shallow slits along the edges of each shape. Do not make the slits too deep; you still want the bottom portion of the mold left whole., Place the lollipop sticks into the slit of each mold. Only the first inch or two of the lollipop stick should be in the mold; the rest should be sticking out.

, Place a heat-safe, glass bowl on top of the pot. Make sure that the bottom of the bowl is not touching the water.


While it is possible to melt the baker's chocolate in the microwave, a double boiler gives you the most control. You will be less likely to scorch your chocolate.

, This will make it easier to melt. Unlike most other types of chocolate, baker's chocolate is pure cocoa and does not contain any milk. This makes it ideal for vegans as well.

, If you want to make dark chocolate chips, omit the butter.The butters will give you richer, creamier chocolate, but they will also make the chips softer in the end. Chocolate chips made without butter will be more bitter, but they also will be less likely to melt.


You can try using coconut oil instead, but keep in mind that the final chocolate chips will be soft and melt quicker.
If you don't have any maple syrup, you can use finely-ground maple sugar crystals, coconut sugar crystals, or a few drops stevia instead., Turn the stove on to low or medium-low heat. Stir the ingredients often until everything is melted and mixed together.Try to use a silicone spoon or spatula; the melted chocolate will not stick to that.


If you are using powdered chocolate, wait until the butter melts first, then stir it in.

, If you don't have a pastry bag, spoon the mixture into a plastic, re-sealable freezer bag. Zip the bag shut tightly, then snip off one of the corners at the bottom. Don't snip off too much, or you will get chocolate ""kisses"" instead of ""chips."", To create the points, lightly touch the center of the chip with a toothpick.

",How to Dye Chocolate," Chocolate that is milk brown or dark brown will not show the true color of most dyes––you'll end up with murky black or deep brown colors instead. However, if your recipe calls for a different type of chocolate and insists that it will work, follow the recipe in preference to this general rule.






;
, Chocolate can be melted in one of the following ways:









Use a microwave, on medium power, in 10-second increments to melt the chocolate to a smooth consistency.
Use a double boiler or a metal pot filled with water and a glass bowl to melt the chocolate over low heat.
Use a dry oven, set to 110ºF (43ºC) to melt the chocolate. It will take about an hour to melt using this way. If your oven does not go this low, use the lowest temperature setting and leave the oven door open a little bit.

, These thermometers will provide temperatures in 1 degree increments, allowing better control than the standard candy thermometer. The ideal temperature for the chocolate will depend on the chocolate treat you're making.








, If making several different colors, divide the chocolate evenly among bowls for each color.








, If the colorant comes with instructions for creating a certain color, follow those amounts. Remember that you can always add more but not remove too much already added, so add it gradually.








, Changing the color of chocolate should be done slowly, to get the color spread evenly throughout.








, If the color is not right yet, consider adding a little more color to the chocolate and mixing it again. Add the colorant a little a time to ensure you get the exact color you are looking for.

Fill them up about two inches., If you want multicolored gummy worms like the ones in stores, add a few drops of food coloring to the remaining mixture.If you don't care about having multicolored worms, you can skip this and the next step. Just pour all of the mixture into the straws.

, Wait for the mixture in the straws to solidify. It should take ten to twenty minutes. Once the mixture in the straws is solid, add the rest. Pour as evenly as possible., Remove the jar from the ice bath and put it in the fridge to sit overnight.

, Pull the straws out of the jar. They may be difficult to remove because of the excess gummy material in the bottom.


You can use a knife to score around the outside of edge of the straws to make removal easier.

, Use a knife to remove excess gummy material from the sides and ends of the straws. It should cut away easily.


This material may not be shaped like worms, but it's still tasty! Don't let it go to waste!

, With your fingers or a rolling pin, squeeze the worms out of the straws. Work from the empty end down.The worms may be easier to remove if you run the straws under warm water for a few seconds.Don't do it too long or your worms may melt.

, Eat some of your worms! You should store those that you aren't going to eat right away in the fridge in an airtight container.


To be sure they don't stick together, you can lightly spray the worms with a little vegetable oil. Toss and refrigerate."

",How to Make Chocolate Curls3," 50%-70% cacao will do. You may need to chill the chocolate for several hours in the refrigerator before shaving. If you try to use room temperature chocolate for chocolate curls you will end up with thick, broken, chunky pieces of chocolate instead of thin, delicate shavings.


Wrapped blocks of chocolate can be found at most grocery and specialty stores. Regular bars of chocolate will not work as they are too soft.

, Hold the bar of chocolate in one hand -- you may want to hold it in a piece of paper towel to stop the bar from melting in your hand. Slowly and carefully, use the peeler to shave along the length of the bar to form pretty chocolate curls.


Pressing the peeler deeper into the chocolate will result in bigger, more dramatic curls, while drawing it gently across the edges will produce smaller, more delicate curls.

Conch and refine the chocolate.,
Temper the chocolate.,
Mold the chocolate while it is still at about 32ºC (90ºF).,
Remove the chocolate from the molds after it has hardened.",How to Make Chocolate2," Roasting the beans will improve the flavor of the chocolate, in addition to sterilizing them and making cracking easier. Here's what you need to know:


Lay the beans in a single layer across a baking sheet. Start off with an 18-minute roast in a preheated oven at 120ºC (250ºF). They'll be ready when they start to crack and when they actually taste like chocolate (but let them cool before tasting!).
In general, expose the beans to an initial high temperature then to a lower the temperature gradually. Stop roasting when the beans start to crack (but not burn). You can accomplish this in your oven or by using a store-bought roaster. The temperature and duration will depend on how many beans you're roasting, but try 5 to 35 minutes at temperatures between 120 and 160ºC (250-325ºF).
For roasting larger quantities of cocoa beans, you may want to invest in a drum, which is rotated over a gas grill.
See the Tips and Warnings below about roasting.

, After roasting, the beans must be cracked into nibs and winnowed, during which the husks (chaff) are removed.


For small batches, crack the beans with a hammer and remove the husks (which should be loose after proper roasting) by hand.
For larger batches, use a coarse, Corona-type mill or purchase a specialized mill to crack the beans into nibs. (In case you were wondering, a meat grinder doesn't work.)

, Once you've cracked the beans, get rid of the leftover husks. Stir the beans gently with your hands or a spoon as you blow on them with a hair dryer or small shop vac until the husks are gone.

, You will need equipment strong enough to liquefy the nibs and separate the remaining husks. General food processors, Vita-Mix, coffee grinders (burr and blade), meat grinders (manual and electric) mortar and pestles, and most juicers will not work. You may need to experiment to find equipment that gets the job done.


Many home chocolatiers find success with a ""Champion Juicer"". Feed the nibs into the grinder/juicer one handful at a time, being sure to push them in gently (not forcefully) or else the motor may overheat. Cocoa liquor will come through the screen and a mixture of husks and liqueur will find its way through the spout. Feed this mixture through the juicer again until only the husks come through the spout.

, Weigh the cocoa liquor in grams using a kitchen scale. You will use this measurement to determine how much of the other ingredients you will add. If you don’t have a kitchen scale, you can eyeball the proportions, which should be as follows:Cocoa butter: up to 20 percent as much as there is cocoa liquor
Sugar: anywhere from 15-20% (bittersweet) to 75-80% (very sweet milk chocolate) as much as there is cocoa liquor
Nonfat milk powder: for a milk chocolate, use the same volume (not weight) as the cocoa liquor, or slightly less.
Vanilla (optional): Split the pod and soak it in the cocoa butter for an hour.

, By definition, conching affects the characteristic taste, smell and texture of the chocolate, while refining reduces the size of the cocoa solids and sugar crystals. Both processes can be applied at the same time with a powerful wet grinder (success has been reported with a Spectra 10 melanger, also called the ""Stone Chocolate Melanger""). How you conch and refine the chocolate will depend on what equipment you use, but here are guidelines for the Spectra 10 melanger:


Melt the chocolate and the cocoa butter in the oven to about 50ºC (120ºF).
Combine with non-fat dry milk powder, sugar, and lecithin.
Pour the chocolate mixture in the grinder, periodically pointing a hair dryer at it for 2-3 minutes to keep the chocolate melted during the first hour (until the friction created by grinding keeps the chocolate liquid without additional heat being needed).
Continue refining for at least 10 hours and no more than 36 hours, until the chocolate tastes smooth and balanced, but be sure not to over-refine (or it will get gummy).

To take a break from refining (for example, at night while you're sleeping, see Warnings), turn off the grinder, put the covered bowl into an oven that's preheated to 65ºC (150ºF) but turned off, and leave it there overnight. It shouldn't solidify but if it does, take the cover off and turn the oven on to about 65 to 80ºC (150-175ºF) until the chocolate melts. (Be careful not to let the bowl itself melt, though.)



, This is likely the most difficult part of the process, but it ensures that the chocolate will be shiny and have a ""snap"" to it, rather than being matte and soft enough to melt in your hands. However, the great thing about tempering is you can redo it as many times as you need to (to get it right) and the chocolate won't be ruined. The most important thing is that you do not let any moisture in the chocolate, or it will be ruined.


Melt the chocolate carefully. You can accomplish this in the oven if you are using larger quantities of chocolate, or you can use a double boiler on the stove. It's your choice, just make sure that the chocolate does not burn (keep stirring). Always melt more than 1.5 pounds (680g) of chocolate, as any less and tempering could prove difficult.
When the chocolate is melted to a temperature of around 45 to 50ºC (110 to 120ºF), transfer it to a dry, cool bowl and stir until the chocolate temperature drops to about 38ºC (100ºF). Use a candy thermometer to gauge the temperature. The chocolate in the bowl should remain at the same temperature while you work with chocolate outside of the bowl.
Pour about one third of the contents out of the bowl onto a hard, non-porous counter top or other surface (granite or marble works best). Spread the chocolate out with the spatula, and then bring it all back together.
Continue doing this until the chocolate is about 30ºC (85ºF), which should take about 10-15 minutes. By the time the chocolate cools down to that point, the chocolate should be a thick, gooey mass.
Add some of the 38-degree Celsius (100-degree Fahrenheit) chocolate from the bowl to get the chocolate workable again. Gently work the chocolate around.
Return the chocolate back into the bowl with the 38-degree Celsius (100-degree Fahrenheit) chocolate. Stir it gently, and try not to create bubbles.
Check the chocolate's temperature. You want it around 32ºC (90ºF), but never over 33ºC (92ºF). Anything higher than this and you may need to temper the chocolate again.
Alternatively, you can purchase a tempering machine on the Internet for $300-400 USD.

, Pour the chocolate into the molds, being careful not to spill.


Some people find it effective to use a large syringe to place chocolate in the mold, but you may find it easy enough to just pour with a steady hand.
When all of the chocolate has been added to the molds, you may either freeze, refrigerate, or let the chocolates harden at room temperature. There's no right way to do it; choose whatever method works best for you. However, you might be influenced by room temperature if you live in a warmer climate, in which case finding a cooler spot for hardening the chocolate will be essential.

, The molded chocolate should have a glossy appearance and should snap cleanly in two.


If you are unsatisfied with your chocolate, you may re-temper the chocolate as long as the chocolate remains dry and you haven't burned it.

, The balloon should not be blown any larger than 6-8 inches (15-20cm). Tie off with a knot. Then spray each balloon with a vegetable spray; this will make it much easier to remove the set chocolate bowl at the end.

,, Either place into the microwave to melt or use a double boiler (bain marie). For more information, see How to melt chocolate or How to temper chocolate.


If you do use a microwave to melt it, do not overcook the chocolate.

, The balloons will burst if the chocolate is too warm.


Even though you've allowed for cooling, the balloon can still pop, so it's recommended that when you dip the balloons, you work quickly and don't leave the balloon in for too long at any point of the dipping process.

, To do this:


Hold the balloon by its knot at an angle. Dip into the chocolate to the level you'd like the bowl; only one portion of the bowl will be touching the melted chocolate at this stage. Then, tilt the angle the other way and dip again. Do this angle changing a few times, then to create a smooth coat on the chocolate, simply turn the balloon around slowly in the melted chocolate.
Take the balloon out and allow any excess chocolate to drip back into the melted chocolate.

, Aim to make a circle.

,, Place the chocolate balloons in a cool, dry place to set.


If you find the room is too warm, either take to another room or place in the refrigerator for around 10 minutes to half an hour. Don't have anything strong-smelling in the refrigerator at the same time or it might cross-contaminate the chocolate. Also be aware that some chocolate may bloom if refrigerated but since this is such a short time, it should be okay.

, First, remove the balloon and bowl from the cookie sheet. If the base is stuck, gently slide a knife under to remove it. Then stick a pin into the balloon at the top or cut a little peace at the knot and allow the air to expel slowly. Don't rush this part or the bowls may blow apart (Tip: place a piece of cellophane tape onto the balloon where you puncture it with a pin - this will reduce chance of popping the balloon). Then, ease the bowls out from the base of the balloon––you may need to peel off some of the balloon.

, Suitable additions include small fruits such as strawberries or cherries, a fruit salad for dessert, small cookies, truffles, little chocolates, candies, etc. You might even scoop in some mousse, cold custard or ice cream.


If using the bowls as a gift, such as filled with truffles, wrap in clear cellophane and tie with a pretty ribbon bow.

Pour the mixture into your mold.",How to Make Gummy Bears2," Making candy is as much science as art. To get perfect, store-boat texture and taste in your gummies you'll need a few harder-to-find ingredients as well as high-end gelatin (known as 250 bloom). Most ingredients are weighed out to prevent measurement errors instead of being scooped. Weigh them out in advance and have them on hand to be quickly mixed in -- timing in candy making is key.


70g Gelatin, 250 bloom
140g Water
225g Sugar
22.5g Sorbitol Powder
245g Glucose syrup
15g Tartaric acid, or citric
12g Essential Oil, any flavor

, You can mix them together with a whisk or, like classic candy makers, in a water bath. To do the second, warm a large bowl of water up so that it is hot, but not boiling. Mix the 70g gelatin and 140g water in a Ziplock bag and let it rest in the water bath for 30 minutes.









The bag should be free of lumps or streaks when it is fully mixed.

, Stir the ingredients well so that they're properly mixed up, but not boiling or bubbling. If you have a candy thermometer, get them to 150 degrees Fahrenheit.








, With the heat still on, mix in the gelatin and water mixture from earlier. Stir until it is all completely mixed, then turn the heat off and move quickly to the next step.








, This might be essential oils, like cherry, citrus, etc, or tartaric/citric acid for sourness. You can also add 1/3 cup of well pureed-fruit like strawberries, or fresh lemon, lime, or orange juice.









This is also the time to add any food coloring., You can use a light coating of cornstarch to prevent them final gummies from sticking, but many gummy-making pans are already non-stick. Simply pour the mixture into the mold then freeze for 4-5 hours, or until the gummies are firm and completely set.

, To make citrus gummy bears you simply need to use some orange and lemon juice instead of a processed Jell-O packet. To do so, mix the following ingredients in the saucepan, turn on the heat, then add 3 tablespoons of gelatin. Continue like normal after the gelatin is added:









1 cup orange juice
1 tablespoon lemon juice
2 tablespoons honey

, This incredible, fruity gummy is a big hit. Make sure the berries are thawed before adding. Simply mix the following ingredients, then add 3tb gelatin slowly as you heat up the mixture like normal.









⅔ cup pureed strawberries/blueberries/raspberries
⅓ cup water
1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
2 tablespoons honey, For creamy, mouth water gummies, consider ditching water for something more flavorful. Even almond, soy, rice, coconut or oat milks works well and imparts a distinct creamy texture and feel to the common gummy. To make them, whisk half the milk in with the gelatin. Then heat it up like normal, whisking in the other half right at the end before it comes off the heat.Adding a touch of vanilla or almond extract, or even some cinnamon, to the mixture can take it to new heights.
This substitute works with basic gummies as well as the pureed fruit versions.

You can melt the shortening faster if you chop the butter/shortening into small pieces before adding it.

, You want it to be warm to the touch, but not hot. It should be roughly 110℉. This promotes yeast growth without killing it. When in doubt, remember that if it is too hot for you, it is too hot for the yeast. Similarly, if you wouldn't enjoy a nice warm bath in it, neither will the yeast., The top will be foaming and frothing as the yeast grow and produce carbon dioxide. If you have no bubbles or frothing than your yeast has died, and you'll have to start over., A cup at a time, add the flour and mix the batter with a dough hook, wooden spoon, or your hands until it is a nice, firm dough ball., Kneading may seem complex, but it is simply a way of mixing the ingredients and toughening up the dough for cooking. Take the dough ball and pull one side up, folding it onto the top of the dough ball, and then push down into the fold with the heel of your hand. Turn the dough a quarter turn either direction, pull up another side, press with your hand, and repeat. You should knead for 2-3 minutes.

When done, your dough should be spongy but consistent, holding its shape without being too tough to press., Put the dough in a metal, nonstick bowl. Use a damp cloth or a piece of plastic wrap to cover the top and put the dough in a warm, dry place for 30 minutes. This allows the yeast to do their job. When you are done, the dough should be roughly twice as big as normal.

If you cannot cook the dough in 30 minutes, you can place it in the refrigerator to rise instead, where it will take roughly 2 hours.

, The bigger you want your ears, the bigger the dough will have to be. Start with four equal parts, using a sharp knife to cut your dough into 4 even pieces in the middle., You want quarter inch thick ""ears"" so that they fry quickly and evenly. You can use your hands to stretch them into elephant ear shapes if you like, but try and keep them at an equal thickness the whole way through. The flour will keep the ears from sticking, so add a pinch to the pin and the countertop before you begin.

If it is hot or humid out, chill the dough for 15-20 minutes before working with it, as it will be easier to maneuver when cold.

, The oil has to be hot enough to cook the outsides of the ear quickly, but not so hot that the outsides burn before the insides are cooked. If you do not have a high-heat thermometer, heat the oil on medium-high for 3-5 minutes and drop a small 1x1"" test piece into the oil. It should cook in 1-2 minutes on each side., The outside should be a gentle golden brown and the inside lightly flaky. When in doubt, try out a smaller test ear before frying the whole thing., It is easiest to have a small plate next to the oven already covered with paper towels. Drop the ear onto the plate to drain any excess oil, then flip it when it is cool enough to touch., If you don't have cinnamon sugar, whisk together 3 tablespoons (44.4 ml) powdered cinnamon with 6 tablespoons (88.7 ml) sugar to make your own. Other fun toppings include:

Jelly or jam
Powdered sugar
Nutella
Chocolate sauce
Fresh fruit

"
"
Remove your puff pastry from the fridge or freezer and begin working immediately.,
Sprinkle a generous coating of cinnamon sugar on the rolling surface.,
Flatten the dough with a rolling pin to 1/8 - 1/4 of an inch thickness.,
Use a pastry brush to coat the top side in egg wash. An egg wash is simply a cracked egg whisked together so that the yolk and white are combined.,
Generously sprinkle the top of the pastry dough with the remaining half of cinnamon sugar.,
Roll up one-half of the pastry towards the middle.,
Roll up the other side until the two rolls meet in the middle.,
Roll the whole thing in plastic wrap and put in the fridge for 15 minutes.,
Preheat the oven to 450ºF while the dough chills.,
Remove the roll and cut it into 3/4-inch slices.,
Cook the pastries for 4-5 minutes on one side, or until golden brown, then flip them.,
Try out some variations on the recipe.",How to Make Elephant Ears2," You do not want to work with warm or room temperature dough. You can use store-bought dough, including pie crusts or biscuits dough in a pinch, or you can make your own puff pastry dough at home for the best results., Usually you use flour to keep dough from sticking to the surface, but a flour coating will make the palmiers heavy and unappetizing. Instead, mix 3 tablespoons (44.4 ml) of cinnamon and 6 tablespoons of sugar in a bowl, then use roughly half on your counter top., You want a big, rectangular piece of dough to make your pastries with. The back side of the pastry will be coated in cinnamon sugar after you've rolled it out., Use a brush to lightly coat the top of the pastry sheet in egg, as this helps it stick together and provides richness to the finished cookie. Leave a little bit of egg wash for later., Coat the top with the remaining mixture, which should stick naturally to the egg wash., Keep the roll as tight as possible for the most attractive final results. You do not, however, want to press or mash the pastry. A nice tight roll, like you making a scroll, is the goal., The finished pastry will look like a classic scroll, with two tight rolls meeting in the middle. Lightly press them together and coat the top with any remaining egg wash., The dough needs to be chilled right before it goes into the oven, so do not skip this step. The tighter you can get it while still keeping your two rolls circular the better your cookies will look in the end., Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper or a silicone liner to prevent the cookies from sticking to the pan when they come out. Because the sugar in the ears will caramelize and harden as they cook, you cannot skip the parchment paper.

, You want to cut perpendicular to the roll, so you get identical slices with each cut. Cut down the pastry roll to make small, individual cookies, each with the definitive double rolls, and place the final pastry, cut side down, on your parchment paper. As soon as you're done, get the pasties in the oven.

You may want to cut off the ends first if they are uneven or misshapen, though they will still taste great.

, Keep your eye on the cookies as they bake and flip them once they turn golden brown. The final side should take much less time, usually only 2-3 minutes. Remove, transfer to a wire baking rack to cool, and enjoy!, There is a variety of changes you can make to elephant ears, as they are a simple recipe with a lot of customization, but some to try include:

Skip the sugar and sprinkle lightly with salt, pepper, and Parmesan cheese for a savory recipe.
Dip half the ear in melted chocolate soon after removing from the oven and let the chocolate harden on the outside.
Add a pinch of orange zest, cardamom, chai spice, and/or vanilla extract to the cinnamon sugar mix for a spiced ear.

Decide whether or not you want to freeze your marshmallow pops.,
Enjoy your marshmallow pop.",How to Make Marshmallow Pops1," The bigger the marshmallow, the more delicious your treat. You can start with an ordinary-sized marshmallow, a smaller marshmallow, or even a jumbo-sized marshmallow. As long as it can be firmly placed on the wooden skewer, the process will work.


Place a marshmallow onto a wooden skewer. You should poke the skewer about halfway up the center of the bottom of the marshmallow.
If you have a large marshmallow, a popsicle stick can work instead of a skewer.;
, Just fill a pan with chocolate or caramel and melt it in the oven or microwave until you've created a warm, gooey liquid that is perfect for dipping. This will be the sweet coating you place over the marshmallow pop. When you're done melting the substance, pour it into a bowl.

, Carefully lower the marshmallow into the liquid and turn the skewer until all sides of the marshmallow are completely covered with the chocolate. You may end up with a little extra chocolate on the top of the skewer under the marshmallow.


If you'd like to add additional toppings to your marshmallow pop, like sprinkles or tiny chocolate chips, you should sprinkle them over the marshmallow as soon as your remove it from the liquid, so that they stick to the pop.

, If you want the coating around the marshmallow to be hard, then stick them in the freezer. It could take a few hours for them to harden -- just keep checking until they are as hard as you would like them to be. And if you don't want to freeze them, set them aside for at least ten minutes so they cool off a bit before you enjoy them.


If you're just waiting for your marshmallow pops to cool off, you can place them in a tall glass like flowers in a bouquet so you don't smear them by laying them down flat.

, Once your marshmallow pop has hardened in the freezer or just cooled off, hold onto your skewer and bite into your marshmallow pop. Enjoy the rich and gooey taste and take pride in a job well done.

Remove the skewer and serve the s'more.",How to Make a S'more1," You can make your s'mores over any sort of fire. Keep in mind, however, that the fuel you use may also influence the flavor of the marshmallow. If you are working outdoors, make sure to follow safety precautions by having water or fire extinguisher near by, and to avoid windy days.


If you are making a campfire, be sure to use clean, dry wood, and to properly rein in the fire with a ring of stones. Do not use accelerators.;
, You will end up with two square-shaped graham crackers. This will be enough to make one s'more. One of the halves will be for the bottom of the s'more, and the other half will be for the top.

, You will need a piece of chocolate that is just a bit smaller than your graham cracker. If you have a large piece of chocolate, then break it into smaller squares.

, Take a piece of chocolate and set it down on one of the graham cracker squares. The other square should have nothing on it.

, Carefully insert a clean skewer into the side of the marshmallow. Hold the marshmallow just over the flames and let it roast to your liking. Be sure to rotate the marshmallow so that it cooks evenly.


If you are camping and wish to use a stick, be sure to shave the tip into a fine point; this will make it easier to skewer the marshmallow and get rid of any bark.
If you are using a metal skewer, make sure that it has a heat-resistant handle so that you don't burn your hand.
You can tell if the marshmallow is done if it is golden-brown in color. You can continue roasting it, set it on fire, or remove it from the fire at this point.

, Without removing the marshmallow from the skewer, place it on top of the chocolate.

, Press down on the graham cracker slightly. The hot marshmallow will melt the chocolate and help fuse everything together.

, Wait a few seconds before serving the s'more. This gives the marshmallow some time to cool down so that it doesn't burn your mouth.

Place the marshmallow and chocolate on the graham crackers.,
Heat your s'more.,
Take the baking sheet out of the oven.,
Put s'more and serve.",How to Make a S'more2," You can make s'mores in an oven in two ways: baking and broiling. Baking will take more time, but you will be less likely to burn your marshmallow and chocolate. Broiling will take less time, but you will have to watch your marshmallow and chocolate so that they don't burn.


If you choose to bake your marshmallow, preheat the oven to 400°F (205°C).If you choose to broil your marshmallow, set the oven to ""broil,"" and let it heat up., You will end up with two graham cracker squares. One will be for the top of the s'more, and the other will be for the bottom.

, You will need to heat the entire s'more in the oven.

, The marshmallow will go on one square, and the chocolate will go on the other square. The chocolate should be just a little bit smaller than the graham cracker. If the chocolate is too big, then break it into smaller pieces.

, Do not put your s'more together just yet; you will be doing that once everything has heated up. Instead, place the baking sheet into the oven. The chocolate will melt a little, and the marshmallow will get toasted.


If you are using an oven, heat your marshmallow for three to five minutes.If you are broiling your marshmallow, it may take anywhere between a few seconds to one minutes., Once both the chocolate and marshmallow have baked to your liking, remove the baking sheet and set it down on a heat-resistant surface. Be sure to use an oven mitt or a potholder to protect your hand against being burnt.

, Take the graham cracker that has the marshmallow and flip it over onto the graham cracker with the chocolate. Press down on the graham cracker gently, mushing the chocolate and marshmallow together. Remove the s'more from the baking sheet and serve.

Add fruit to your s'more.,
Substitute the chocolate for gourmet chocolate.,
Consider using marshmallow or chocolate spread instead.,
Use other candy instead of chocolate.,
Try roasting the entire s'more.",How to Make a S'more4," You can make your s'more more flavorful by adding a slice or two of fruit to it. Strawberries and bananas taste great when paired with chocolate, but you can also use other types of fruit too, such as raspberries.


When making a fruity s'more, add the strawberry or banana slice on the graham cracker, before the chocolate.
Consider using chocolate spread instead of hard chocolate. It will help ""glue"" the fruit to the graham cracker and prevent it from slipping out.

, Instead of using plain old milk or dark chocolate, consider using chocolate filled with caramel, mint, or peanut butter instead. You can also use chocolate with ground nuts in it as well.


For a cool, wintery spin, use mint-filled chocolate instead of regular chocolate. Switch out the regular graham crackers for chocolate graham crackers.
For a unique, salted-caramel flavor, use caramel-filed chocolate and add a strip of fried bacon. If you do not like bacon, you can use salted-caramel chocolate instead.

, Marshmallow and chocolate spreads come in a jar, and might be easier to spread across a graham cracker. Most chocolate spreads will also have a slight hazelnut flavor.


Consider using chocolate sauce instead of chocolate.

, You can substitute the chocolate for other candies, such as peanut butter cups or chocolate-covered wafers. You can also add candy to your s'more.


If you like peanut butter, switch the regular chocolate out for a peanut butter cup. Consider adding a banana for more flavor.
For an extra creamy flavor, skip the chocolate and replace it with dulce de leche. Use cinnamon graham crackers instead of regular ones.
For a unique twist, add a strip of red or black licorice on top of the chocolate just before you set the marshmallow down.

, Assemble the entire s'more first, then wrap it in a lightly-oiled piece of foil. Fold over the ends of the foil packet to seal the s'more inside. Heat the s'more packet in the coals of a campfire for two to three minutes.Be sure to turn the packet often, then take it out of the fire using a pair of tongs.

As you wait for the water to boil, mix the flavored gelatin and the packets of unflavored gelatin (or Agar) together in a heat-safe bowl.Try to use a bowl or pitcher that has a pourable edge and can hold at least 4 cups of liquid.The flavored gelatin alone won't be firm enough to keep your worms intact. The addition of the unflavored gelatin will ensure your worms keep their shape and don't melt or fall apart.;
, Make sure the powdered gelatin and flavoring is completely incorporated into the water--there should be no lumps or granules on the bottom of the bowl.Set the bowl aside and allow it to cool for about 15 minutes.
Do not allow the mixture to set. It doesn't need to cool completely--it should still be warm after 15 minutes.

, The cream will make it so the worms aren't see-through. The addition of the green food coloring will turn your worms a more realistic brown color. Stir the mixture thoroughly.


Add the food coloring gradually to achieve the color you want. You will likely end up using about 15 drops, but feel free to experiment with the shade.
If the mixture becomes too green, balance it out by adding a few drops of red food coloring.

, The straws should fit tight in the container--if there is too much room, they will slump over and the gelatin mix won't stay put.Try a tall vase or drinking glass or an empty milk carton. If you don't have anything big enough to fit all the straws, try packing them in a few drinking glasses.


If the container is too big or the straws won't stand upright, use a rubber band to hold them tightly together.You can also use a piece of bread to ""plug"" the straws and keep them upright. Tear a slice of bread to the size of your container and put it in the bottom, setting the straws on top.The bottom of the straw should be flat on the bottom of the container.
Make sure the flexible part of the straw is extended and is the end that is facing down.

, Pour the mix from the bowl over the tops of the straw ends. You don't need to fill them completely, just enough to make decent worm lengths. Some of the mixture will escape from the bottom of the straws, but if they are packed tightly and standing upright, there will still be plenty in the straws.If your bowl doesn't have a pouring lip, it may be easier to transfer the mix to a pitcher that allows for more precise pouring.
You can even inject the mixture into the straws. Use a clean syringe with a thin rubber tube attached to it. Fill the syringe with the jello mix, attach the tube and squirt into each straw, refilling as needed.

, Your worms need to be chilled a minimum of 8 hours, preferably overnight.Do not place in the freezer or you'll get a mushy consistency and no worms.

, Place the cookies in a large freezer bag, taking care to squeeze out all the air before sealing. Pound the cookies with a rolling pin (or a glass bottle of wine or olive oil if you don't have one). Crush the cookies until they are fine crumbs and resemble dirt.Place the crumbs in the container in which you plan to serve the worms. If you want to add ""mud,"" alternate layers of chocolate crumbs with a layer of chocolate pudding. End with a layer of dirt on top.
If you decide to add pudding, you may want to wait until your worms are ready. That way you can layer worms throughout the container without messing up your alternating layers.
You can serve in a clear bowl, or try a clean flower pot or a plastic pail to add a little authenticity to your wormy dessert.

, There are a few different methods you can use to squeeze your worms out of the straws. You may end up damaging some of the worms, but you should have plenty to work with.


Squeeze them out with your thumb and forefinger. Pinch one end of the straw and apply pressure down the length of the straw, pushing the worm out the other side.Force the worms out with the blunt blade of a knife or the flat end of a wooden spoon. Using a similar movement as you would to curl ribbon, running the flat end from the top of the straw to the bottom.Run warm (not hot) water over each straw for a second or two and let the worm slip out. Do not get water into the tip of the straw or it can affect the worm inside.Use the end of a bike pump's nozzle to ""shoot"" the worms out the other end with the force of the air being expelled.
Place half of another straw over the top of one end and blow (provided you're in healthy condition, nobody wants cold germs).

, Toss your worms in the dirt--some should be buried, and some should stick out of the top so your guests can see them.


If you don't plan to serve immediately, you may want to leave the worms in the refrigerator on a parchment-lined tray. This will keep them in top condition until it's time to serve.

, Make a hole in the center of the candy. Use your thumb and forefingers to burrow a hole in the center of the candy. Then, use pressure to make the circle bigger, while the candy remains the same thickness around the rope you've made. Once the rope is long enough, twist it into a figure eight and bring both of the halves together.

, Hold the candy in both fists. Keep your front hand stable while your back hand pulls back gently. Rotate your hands around the candy and keep on pulling until the strands are nice and long. Keep pulling the candy at least 10-14 times.

, Enjoy this yummy pulled candy while it's in good shape.

;
, Add the three ingredients to a medium pot and stir together. To combine the ingredients thoroughly, you will need to heat them. Heat the syrup over medium-high to high heat, stirring constantly, until it comes to a boil.








, After the syrup begins to boil, reduce the heat to medium and continue stirring for roughly five minutes.









You may want to use a candy thermometer to monitor the temperature of the candy as it cooks. Clip the thermometer to the side of the pot, positioning it so that the tip does not touch the bottom of the pan but dips into the liquid candy. The temperature at this point should be about 230 degrees Fahrenheit (110 degrees Celsius)., Remove the pot from the heat and pour in the vanilla extract. Stir the candy thoroughly using a heat-resistant, non-stick spatula, such as a silicone spatula, until it appears blended.








, Dump the powdered sugar, powdered milk, and salt mixture into the liquid candy. Use the same heat-resistant, non-stick spatula to rapidly stir the two mixtures together until the dry ingredients have been completely blended into the wet. The new mixture should be smooth and should not have any visible clumps.








, Line a standard half-sheet size baking pan with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat. Pour the candy into the pan, scraping the sides of the pot with your spatula to remove the sticky candy clinging to the side. Allow the candy to cool for roughly 15 minutes, or until it is cool enough for you to handle without burning yourself. You do not want it to cool completely, though.








, At this point, the candy should be solid enough to be the consistency of dough. Separate the candy into three equal parts so that you can create the three distinct layers for your candy corn. Place each piece of dough into a different bowl.








, Add 2 to 3 drops of yellow food coloring to one bowl and 2 to 3 drops of orange food coloring to another bowl. Leave one bowl of dough uncolored. Knead the dough that needs to be colored until the color is distributed evenly throughout the entire piece. There should be no streaking.









You may want to wear disposable plastic gloves to prevent your hands from getting stained. Do not wear the same pair of gloves to knead each colored batch. Instead, change your gloves in between each color. If you do not wear gloves, wash your hands after kneading the first color and before working on the second.
You may need to chill the dough if it becomes too sticky after coming into contact with the warmth of your hands. If you suspect that it has become too soft, chill it in the refrigerator for 20 minutes.

, Lay out a large piece of parchment paper or wax. Roll each batch of dough into a long, slender strand. Each strand should be approximately the same length and thickness. To create easy-to-work-with pieces, the strands should be about 1/2 inch (1.27 cm) thick and 22 inches (55.88 cm) long, but you can make the rope as thick or thin as you like. Thicker ropes will create larger candies and thinner ropes will create smaller candies.








, The yellow strand should be on the bottom, the orange in the middle, and the white on the top. Press the dough together. You can either use your fingers or you can apply pressure using a rolling pin. Lay a piece of wax paper or parchment paper over the candy strands to prevent them from sticking to the rolling pin. Gently roll the pin over the strands, just enough to press them together without flattening them.







, You can also try a pizza cutter or another smooth-edged cutting tool. Create a zig-zag pattern across the dough so that half of the triangles are colored traditionally, with a white tip and a yellow base, while the other half are inverted, with a white base and a yellow tip.









If you need help gauging how and where to make the cuts, you can measure out where to start your cuts using a ruler and a non-toxic pen or pencil. Decide how big you want each base to be and plan out your cuts. For instance, if you want a 2-inch (5-cm) base, use your ruler to measure 2-inch (5-cm) sections along the bottom of the candy rope, marking each spot with your pen on the parchment paper. Be careful not to mark too close to the candy. Along the top, measure out 2-inch (5-cm) sections, placing the marks so that they fall out in the exact center of the marks on the bottom row. Cut the candy into triangles by making connecting cuts between both sets of marks, alternating back and forth between the top and bottom rows.

, If it becomes gummed up with candy residue as you work, clean the knife off before you continue cutting.








, Separate the candies so that they are no longer connecting or touching one another. Do not stack them, since stacking them will cause them to stick together. Allow them to dry on parchment paper until no longer sticky. The process should only take one or two hours.








, Since only half of the candy corn has the traditional color pattern, you may want to make that half the candy corn you share with others. The other half will be just as delicious, though.

Heat 2 cups (473 ml) water in a pot, bringing it to a boil.,
Stir in the 4 cups (946 mg) of sugar in 1








Stir the solution until the water is clear.,
Remove the solution from the heat and allow it to cool for 15-20 minutes.,
Add color or flavoring if you don't want plain rock candy.,
Pour the solution into the glass or jar where you plan to grow your rock candy crystals.",How to Make Rock Candy1," Get an adult to help you if you're not allowed to use the stove--boiling water can be extremely dangerous if you spill it on yourself.Use purified water if possible. The sugar can attach to impurities in the tap water and create a crust that will prevent water from evaporating and prevent the crystals from growing on your string instead.If you don't have access to a stove, you can use a microwave instead. Combine the sugar and water in a microwave-safe glass and heat it for two minutes on high. Stir the sugar water and microwave for another 2 minutes. Stir the mixture a third time and the sugar should dissolve almost entirely into the water.Make sure you handle the pot or microwave-safe glass with hot pads or oven mitts so you don't burn yourself.;
, If the solution is cloudy or you find the sugar stops dissolving, turn the heat up so the water reaches a vigorous boil.Hot water has a higher saturation point than cool water, so turning up the heat should allow you to mix in the rest of the sugar., You don't want any undissolved sugar to remain on the bottom of the pot. If undissolved sugar ends up in the jar or glass where you grow the rock candy, crystals will attach to the undissolved sugar and not to your string or stick.If you have undissolved sugar that didn't mix with the boiling water, you may want to pour the solution through a strainer and only retain the liquid.
The solution you have made is a super-saturated solution, meaning the water has absorbed more sugar than it would have absorbed at room temperature. As the solution cools, the water saturation point of the water will become lower, and it will no longer be able to hold the amount of sugar. The dissolved sugar will be unable to stay in liquid form, and will instead crystalize on the string or stick you provide., Try to coordinate the color to the flavor--blue with blueberry, red with strawberry, purple with grape--so the flavor is clear. Make sure you stir the solution thoroughly so the flavor and color is evenly distributed.








You only need a few drops of flavoring, but try to make the solution dark with color for the best results.Try mixing in drink mix, like Kool-Aid, for color and flavor.
Try adding a splash of fruit juice for lemon, lime, orange, or other fruity flavored candy.
Try different extracts like peppermint, strawberry, vanilla, or even banana.

, The glass or jar should be tall and cylindrical and made of glass--plastic may melt when you pour in the hot solution. Fill the glass almost to the top.









Make sure the glass is clean and contains no dust particles. Even dust can give the sugar crystals something to cling to, and you only want them to settle and grow on your string or stick.Cover the glass with a piece of wax or parchment paper to prevent dust from settling on the top of the solution."
"
Tie one end of a string around the middle of a pencil and tie a paperclip to the other end.,
Dip the string in the glass of sugar








You must make sure the string is completely dry before you proceed to the next step and be very careful not to knock off any of the seed crystals when you place the string in the solution.You can skip this step or try to speed it along by wetting the string and rolling it in granulated sugar (just make sure the string is completely dry before you put it in the glass and the sugar isn't falling off), but making seed crystals will make your rock candy grow faster and increase your chances of success in growing crystals.,
Lower the string into the glass of sugar/water solution, resting the pencil on the top of the glass.,
Place the glass somewhere safe, where it will remain undisturbed.,
Wait one week for crystals to form.,
Carefully remove the string from the solution and lay it on wax paper to dry.",How to Make Rock Candy2," The paperclip will act as a weight and keep your string hanging straight down so it doesn't touch the sides. The string should be about 2/3 as long as the glass is deep--it should not be long enough that the weight will touch the bottom of the glass. This will give your crystals plenty of space to grow.Touching or hanging too close to the bottom or sides of the glass could make your crystals smaller or misshapen.









Use a string made from natural fiber, like twine or cotton. Fishing twine or nylon string are too smooth and it will be difficult for the sugar crystals to find crevices to cling to and grow.You can also use a washer or screw to weight the string, or even another piece of rock candy, which may help your crystals grow faster.The pencil should be long enough that it can rest on the top of the glass without falling in. You can also use a butter knife, skewer, or popsicle stick instead. A butter knife or popsicle stick may be more stable, as they can lay flat on top of the glass and won't roll.

,, The string should hang straight down and never come in contact with the bottom or sides of the glass.Cover the solution with a paper towel. You don't want to seal the glass with something that will keep the air out, like plastic wrap, as evaporation is an essential part of this process.









As the water evaporates, the remaining solution becomes more saturated with sugar, and the water must force the sugar out. The sugar molecules will collect on the string, forming your rock candy crystals.Tape the pencil to the jar to keep it from rolling or moving while your crystals form., For the biggest crystals, look for a cool, dark space, where the water will evaporate slowly, giving the crystals lots of time to grow.If you want to grow crystals quickly, but don't care if they get big, put the glass in a sunny spot so that the water evaporates quickly.Vibrations can negatively affect your crystal growth. Keep your glass off the ground (and away form the vibrations of people walking on the floor) and away from sources of music or noise, like a stereo or television., Don't touch or tap the glass, or you may disturb the crystal growth and even cause some to fall off the string. After a week you should see big, smooth crystals on the string., Snip the paperclip off with scissors.


If the rock candy is stuck to the glass, run some hot water on the bottom of the glass. This should loosen the sugar enough so that you can pull your candy out without damaging it."
"
Wet a skewer or popsicle stick with water and roll it in granulated sugar.,
Hold the skewer in the middle of the glass so that it is not touching the sides and the tip does not touch the bottom of the glass.,
Pinch the dry end of the skewer with the clothespin and rest the clothespin across the top of the glass.,
Place the glass somewhere safe, where it will remain undisturbed.,
Wait one to two weeks for your rock candy to be ready.,
Finished.

",How to Make Rock Candy3," The granulated sugar will become seed crystals, which give the dissolved sugar something to cling to and a point at which to start crystallizing.The seed crystals make it easier for the rock candy to grow and may speed up the process by giving crystalizing sugar an easy target for attachment.









Allow the skewers to dry completely before proceeding to the next step. If the sugar isn't firmly stuck to the wood, it may fall off in the glass and the crystallization will occur on the sugar on the bottom of the glass and not on your skewer., If the skewer touches the glass, it may impede the crystal growth, or your stick of rock candy may get stuck to the bottom or sides.








Try to keep the tip of the skewer about 1 inch (2.5 cm) from the bottom of the glass., The skewer should be pinched in the middle of the clothespin, as close to the spring as possible.You can use an extra large clothes pin if the glass has a wide mouth.









Your skewer should be held securely by the clothespin and still be in the very center of the glass.
Cover the glass with a paper towel. You can tear a little hole for the skewer to poke through the towel.

, Music, television, or lots of activity can cause vibrations that may disturb your crystals or cause them to fall off the stick. For the best growth, store the glass in a cool or room-temperature spot away from noise and lots of foot traffic., Resist the urge to touch or tap the glass, as this could knock your crystals off the stick. When you are happy with the amount of crystals (or they just don't seem to be growing any bigger), carefully remove the skewer and rest it on wax paper to dry.


If there is a crust on top of the surface of the water, use a butter knife to gently break through the crystals, avoiding the crystals near your skewer.If the rock candy is stuck to the glass, run some hot water on the bottom of the glass. This should loosen the sugar enough so that you can pull your candy out without damaging it.,"

Before you make candy of any kind, read through the entire instructions for the individual recipe.,
Check the temperature before making candy.,
If you don't already have one, purchase a candy thermometer of good quality.,
Avoid changing the ingredient amounts in a recipe.,
For the heat source, choose the burner that is wider than the cooking pan you're using.,
Know how to test the hardness of candy.",How to Make Old Fashioned Hard Candy1," You need to be thoroughly aware of what the recipe requires before starting because candy needs precise temperature control and precise actions at the times that the recipe states. Most importantly, remember that candy not attended to is candy that burns!

, Candy should not be made when the weather is high in humidity or rainy or it has a hard time setting. Check the room temperature––it should be around 60ºF-68ºF (15.5ºC-20ºC), with low humidity.


If you have no choice about cooking in sub-optimal temperature conditions, you may be able to compensate by cooking the candy 1 to 2 degrees higher than recommended by the recipe.
Altitude will affect the outcome; if you live at high altitude, you may need to make adjustments in accordance with the usual recommendations for high altitude cooking.

, You need to be happy about working with great precision when making candy––it's a science as well as an art.


For more details on selecting a candy thermometer, see How to choose a candy thermometer.
Never touch the base of a saucepan with a candy thermometer. The pan must always be long enough that the thermometer does not reach the bottom when hung on the pan lip.

, They are precise because they work. Even doubling ingredients in a candy recipe can result in a failure.

, This ensures more even heating.

, This can be done manually or using a thermometer. The thermometer is easiest, but it's handy to know how to test the temperature manually, which you can learn to do before using a recipe by reading How to test candy hardness stages.

;
, Pour the water into a small saucepan, then stir in the sugar and corn syrup. Turn the heat up to medium and allow the sugar to dissolve.










Make sure that you use light corn syrup, or your candy won't end up clear or take color well.

, Make sure that the bottom of the thermometer does not touch the bottom of the saucepan. If you don't have a candy thermometer, don't worry; you can still make candy., Turn the heat up to high, and wait for the mixture to come to a boil. Wait until it reaches the hard-crack stage, between 300 and 310°F (149 and 155°C). Do not stir the mixture during this time.








If you don't have a candy thermometer, you can test whether or not the candy is ready by dropping some of it into a glass of ice water. If the candy turns hard, it's ready.

, While not necessary, a little bit of extra flavor and color can take your lollipops to the next level. Be careful while doing this, however, as the mixture may splatter.









#* Use clear flavoring extracts and oils. They will allow the color of your candy to show up better.Make sure that you use gel food coloring; liquid food coloring will not mix well into the candy.

, If you are using a baking sheet sprayed with cooking spray, leave about 3 to 4 inches (7.62 to 10.16 centimeters) between each puddle to allow for spreading. If you wish to add some edible flowers, fill the molds half-way first, place the flowers face-down into the melted candy, then fill the molds the rest of the way.Use the tip of a lollipop stick to push the flowers into the molds, if needed.

, Give the lollipop half a turn after you press it into the candy. Make sure that the sticks go about halfway up the melted candy.









, If you used powdered sugar molds, your candy will have a frosted look. If you don't want that, run the candy under warm water for a few seconds to wash the powdered sugar layer off.








Consider sprinkling some sprinkles onto your lollipops before they harden. Gently press the sprinkles down into the melted candy to help them stick."

,


Right before the liquid reaches exactly 300ºF/150ºC, add the food coloring and flavoring to the mixture. Doing so will allow the boiling action to stir the coloring and flavoring into the mixture.

, (If you do not have a candy thermometer you can fill a glass with really cold water then take a drop of the candy liquid and if it solidifies in the shape of a ball and floats to the surface, then its ready for next step.) Remove the mixture immediately at 300ºF/150ºC, or it will burn!


After you remove the sugar from heat, the temperature will continue rising but that is not a problem provided that you took it off the heat at 300ºF/150ºC.

, Mix quickly.


Mix food coloring to make fun shades. Try adding the color after stirring in flavor and stir lightly for a swirled effect.
Mix flavors or Kool Aid or pour over dried fruit for an added texture.

Collect sugar packets wherever you go.,
Consider collecting in themes.,
Make a place to house your sugar collection.,
Consider removing the sugar.,
Trade with friends.",How to Collect Sugar Packets," They're free when you purchase a coffee or drink at most cafes and restaurants.;
, Many specialty cafes and clubs have their own sugar printed. You might like to consider making themes using brand names. Some people try to collect sugar packets with animals on them, or shapes, or logos etc.

, Make sure you have somewhere to put them that is not in plain sight of the kitchen. You don't want someone to accidentally mistake them for sugar that can be consumed with the next hot drink! Your storage and display place should be vermin-proof and easily viewable. perhaps make a wooden box with a perspex top that can open on hinges. Get someone to help you make this if you are not good with woodworking. Alternately, consider using a trading card book with plastic pockets to keep the sugar packets neatly together., To reduce the possibility of attracting vermin and having sugar spilled everywhere; you might consider emptying the sugar from the packets. Slit the top of the packet carefully, pour the sugar out and keep the packet. These can be kept more easily, such as in a stamp album or similar book and they will last a lot longer too. This really depends on you though, as to whether you feel your collection is best with the sugar, or without it.

, If you want to trade sugar and sweetener packets with friends who are also collecting, grab two. Always ask if you want to take more, however, as you must remember that these come at a cost to the place providing them. There are many places online where you can find trades.

Remove the pan of sugar from the oven.,
Break up the cubes.,
Store the cubes.",How to Make Homemade Sugar Cubes1," You can use any type of sugar except powdered sugar. Choose raw sugar, brown sugar, or plain granulated sugar.;
, Pour it over the sugar evenly and let it sit for a few seconds.

, Try to remove the clumps of sugar and make a smooth mixture. If clumps of sugar remain, continue mixing to remove them. The sugar is ready when it retains it shape when lightly pressed.

, You can use a bread pan, a loaf pan, or any type of glass or metal pan that is oven safe.

, Pack the sugar into the base of the pan very tightly with a spatula or another tool that is stiff and flat. The height should be similar to a commercial sugar cube, around 1.27cm/1/2 an inch.


If you want sugar pieces that aren't shaped like cubes, pour the sugar into oven-safe candy molds or muffin tins.
If you have candy molds that aren't oven safe, you can still use them. Pour the sugar into the molds and use a spatula to flatten the tops. Instead of putting the molds in the oven, cover them loosely with parchment paper and leave them on the counter overnight. They'll be hard by morning.

, Using a knife, cut the sugar sheet into cubes of the size you want. Try to cut neat, even squares. Do not forget this step; if you do, you will end up with a sugar block, rather than sugar cubes.

, Set a timer for 1 hour.

, After one 1 hour, take the pan out and let the sugar cubes cool for at least 10 minutes.

, Pull the sugar cubes out of the pan and break them apart with your hands or something smooth like a knife. If cut properly, they will break fairly easy.

Mix the sugar and water in a pot.,
Heat over a stove burner set to ""high."",
Cook sugar to the ""hard-crack"" stage.,
Remove from heat.,
Stir in flavor and coloring.,
Pour the liquid into each of your molds or muffin tins.,
Cool the jawbreakers in the refrigerator.,
When the candy has completely cooled, remove and serve.",How to Make Jawbreakers1,"


Stir until the sugar is uniformly moist.
If you can, use filtered water for your jawbreakers. While unfiltered tap water will work fine, the tap water in some areas has a subtle aftertaste that can very slightly affect the flavor of the final product.;
,


As the ingredients heat, they will start to boil and blend together into a syrupy solution. Stir frequently — the sugar can easily burn if it's allowed to stick to the bottom of the pot.,


As you boil the syrupy mixture, the water evaporates, making a thicker and thicker syrup. Your goal is to heat the mixture until almost all of the water is gone — this is called the ""hard-crack"" stage.
There are several ways to determine when you've reached the hard-crack stage:

Use a candy thermometer — the syrup should be at 300-310o F (149-154o C)

Use a cold water test — carefully drop a small dollop of the syrup into a bowl of cold water. Let it cool for a few moments, then take it out and examine it. The syrup should have formed hard, brittle threads that crack when bent (hence ""hard-crack."") If it's still soft, it needs to cook longer.,


Don't let your syrup cook past the hard-crack stage — this will cause it to start caramelizing. Though the rich, complex flavor of caramel is great for some recipes, it's not typically used for jawbreakers.,


Add between 2/3 tablespoon to 1 tablespoon of liquid flavoring and stir thoroughly to combine. The more flavoring you add, the stronger your candy's flavor will be.
You may also add a few drops of food coloring at this point if desired. However, this will not affect the taste of the candy.

,


Though there's no ""right"" way to make jawbreakers, pouring your liquid more thickly will usually give a harder texture. Thin candies will be more brittle, making them easier to bite into.

,


Depending on the thickness of your candies, it can take anywhere from half an hour to two hours or longer for them to cool completely.Be patient — the cooler they get, the closer they'll get to the rock-hard jawbreaker texture.

,


To get the candies out, twist each muffin tin or candy mold like you'd twist an ice tray to release its contents.Enjoy!

Gather your equipment, and preferably one to two pounds of chocolate.,
Fill one of your bowls with ice water.,
Place your chopped chocolate in the dry, stainless steel bowl.,
Heat the chocolate slowly until it reaches a temperature of 110°–115°F.Once the chocolate is fully melted it should feel warm to the touch.,
Add the remaining 1/3 of untempered chocolate to the melted chocolate and stir.,
Start test for temper or crystallization at 90°F by dipping a spoon into the chocolate.,
Check for tempering.",How to Temper Chocolate1," Chop your chocolate into small pieces, or use chocolate disks, sold by many manufacturers at gourmet stores or online from professional chocolate suppliers. The more chocolate you use, the easier the process is to manage.


Try to chop your chocolate as uniform as possible. Chocolate that's uniformly chopped will melt evenly and lower the risk of scorching. If you want, you can use a serrated knife to cut the chocolate into even chunks, or you can look for chocolate chips that are evenly molded.
Set aside approximately 1/3 of the chopped chocolate for later use. It will not be used in the initial double-boiling.;
, Fill it just full enough so that your other bowl — your bowl with chocolate — will rest nicely inside without spilling the water.

, Melt it gently over a pot of very gently simmering water by resting the bowl on the top of the pot of water. The bowl should be bigger than the pot and should not be submerged in the water, but resting on the edge of the pot.


Do not bring the water underneath the chocolate to a boil. Also, don't rush the melting by turning up the heat on the stove. Trying to melt the chocolate too soon will cause it to scorch, ruining the taste and the tempering process.
Be careful not to allow any water to get in the chocolate, or it will seize. This is very important.

, Place the bowl of melted chocolate into the bowl with ice water, and begin to stir slowly but constantly. Once it begins to thicken and reaches a temperature of 95°–100°F, crystallization or ""tempering"" is occurring, and you can remove it from the cold water.

, Incorporate the two forms of chocolate so that the final mixture is smooth.

, It should set up hard, firm, and shiny with 2 to 3 minutes, in a 65°-72°F environment. If it appears spotty or dull, you need to continue stirring, applying heat or cold as necessary to keep it soft and workable, but not too thin.


It should feel cool to the touch; a good test spot for temperature is to place a dot on your lower lip. If it feels cool, the temperature is probably about right.

, When the chocolate sets quickly, uniformly, with good shine and no spots, it is ready to use. You can fill molds, make bark, dip dried fruits, biscuits, cookies, or anything else with it. You can flavor it with fat-soluble oils (mint, lemon, orange, etc.) as well.

Finished.

",How to Make Homemade Sugar Cubes2," This method works best if you choose silicon ice cube trays with cute shapes, such as hearts, stars, animals or something quirkier than the same old cube. Silicon trays are the best because you'll be able to remove the sugar cubes much more easily, with less likelihood of damaging them., You can make more than 1/2 a cup's worth but this is a good amount for a beginner to play with.

, Continue adding water a teaspoonful at a time until you have mixed together a paste of sugar and water. Don't make it too gooey or wet, or the sugar will dissolve.


At this stage you can mix in a few drops of food coloring to make colored cubes.
Consider adding a few drops of vanilla, almond, or lemon extract to make flavored sugar.

, Fill the molds about halfway only.

, Press down into the molds with the back of a spoon to make an even surface and to pack the sugar down so that it sticks together.

, Set the tray aside in a dry spot to let the water evaporate. If it's humid in your kitchen, the cubes might not set.

, Remove each piece of sugar by carefully pushing from the base of the ice cube tray and tapping gently into the palm of your hand. Store in an airtight container or use straight away.

Try making layered jawbreakers.,
Add popping candy for an interesting twist.,
Make your own custom liquid candy flavorings.,
Add sticks to make lollipops.,
Experiment with different-shaped molds.",How to Make Jawbreakers2,"


Today, many jawbreakers (like, for instance, Everlasting Gobstoppers) are multilayered — if you cut the candy in half, you'll be able to see the rings made by the different layers. With a little extra work, you can get a similar effect in your homemade jawbreakers.
To do this, start by making a batch of jawbreakers according to the step above. Next, prepare a second recipe's worth of syrup, but give it a different color and flavor than you used for your first batch.
When the syrup is cold enough to handle, roll your cold jawbreakers in it, giving each an even coat. Put the coated jawbreakers on a piece of parchment paper and put them in the fridge to cool.

,


To give your jawbreakers a little extra ""bite,"" try stirring a generous pinch of popping candy (like Pop Rocks, etc.) into your syrup as you add the flavoring and color. When the jawbreakers are finished, the popping candy will provide a satisfying fizz as you enjoy them.

,


It's worth noting that, if you're willing to experiment, you don't need to use commercial liquid candy flavorings. There are a number of ways to make your own flavorings for use in jawbreakers and other candies — nearly any sort of dense, strongly-flavored oil, syrup or liquid can potentially work.
One cheap, easy way to make your own flavoring is to add just enough water to an individual packet of Kool-Aid powder to produce a liquid. Stir this into your mixture earlier in the cooking process than you normally would to allow the extra water to boil off.
Another trick that works well for fruit flavors is to add a splash of fruit juice (plus a little grated zest if you have it) — as above, give the extra liquid a chance to boil off if you use this method.

,


The jawbreaker recipe above is very similar to that used for a wide variety of other hard candies. In fact, if you just dip a popsicle stick in each jawbreaker as it hardens, you'll have a set of lollipops once they cool — try it!
Keeping the sticks upright while the candy cools can be a challenge, so try carefully laying them on their sides. When the candies cool, just turn them 90 degrees to get your lollipops.

,


The shapes of your jawbreakers are only limited by the molds you have handy — try using differently-shaped molds to make exciting new designs!
Getting perfectly round jawbreakers like you'd see in a store can be quite tricky. Even round molds can leave a noticeable seam around the edge of the jawbreaker. Professional candy makers use a process called ""panning"" which involves rolling the jawbreakers in round vats of ingredients for long periods of time to produce their round shape.Though this is beyond the reach of most amateurs, if you're serious about making jawbreakers, you may want to invest in specialized panning equipment.

Place the chocolate pieces in a completely dry, stainless steel bowl, and then onto the steaming pan.,
Melt the chocolate, stirring, until it is just at 110°F.,
Introduce the remaining 1/3 solid chocolate into melted chocolate and continue stirring.,
Begin ""tabling"" the chocolate on a smooth, cool surface such as marble.,
Stirring constantly, wait until the chocolate gets to a temperature of 87°–91°F.",How to Temper Chocolate2," A serrated knife works well here, although you can skip the cutting altogether if you decide to buy chocolate chips or coins.


Set aside approximately 1/3 of the chopped chocolate for later use. It will not be used in the initial double-boiling.

, You want steam to be coming from the pot, but boiling water can cause the chocolate to scorch or melt too quickly.

, Make sure the bowl with the chocolate rests on top of the pan, keeping any moisture or water away from the chocolate. Water that is introduced to chocolate can cause it to seize.

, Do not melt beyond this point or the chocolate will scorch.

, Heat until the mixture becomes smooth again.

, Take the chocolate off the heat and spread 2/3 of it over a cool surface. Next:


With a spatula, work the melted chocolate by scraping and stirring it across the cool surface. This process will smooth and cool the chocolate.
Continue tabling until a temperature of 80°–82°F is reached. Return the cooled mixture to the reserved mixture and put the whole mixture on top of the light heat again.

, Take chocolate off the double boiler. Use the chocolate in molds, biscuits, cookies, dipping, etc.


Is the chocolate sticky to the touch even after a little while? Sticky chocolate has not been properly tempered.The chocolate should set and be firm after 2 to 3 minutes.

Mind a note on different types of chocolate.,
Know how the fats in cocoa butter crystalize.",How to Temper Chocolate3," Different kinds chocolates have different kinds of cacao concentrations, as well as cocoa butter concentrations. Knowing which type of chocolate you're working with is essential to tempering correctly.


Dark chocolate (no milk content) tempers ideally at 88-90°F (31-32°C)
Milk chocolate tempers ideally at 86-88°F (30-31°C)
White chocolate tempers ideally at 80-82°F (27-28°C)

, There are several different stages to crystallization of cocoa butter fats. Melting and tempering good chocolate is all about getting the crystals to stage V of the process:


Stage I — 17 °C (63 °F) — Chocolate is soft, crumbly, and melts too easily
Stage II — 21 °C (70 °F) — Chocolate is soft, crumbly, and melts too easily
Stage III — 26 °C (79 °F) — Chocolate is firm, snaps poorly, and melts too easily
Stage IV — 28 °C (82 °F) — Chocolate is firm, snaps well, but melts too easily
Stage V — 34 °C (93 °F) — Chocolate is glossy, firm, snaps well, and melts near body temperature
Stage VI — 36 °C (97 °F) — Chocolate is hard and takes too long to form

Understanding the basics of trading.,
Inspect your candy before trading.,
Purchase more candy.,
Search for potential traders.,
Inspect their goods.,
Be fair.,
Accept rejection.",How to Trade Candy," You do not need to understand more than the basics of market forces to excel on the market. Understanding the core of the market will help you to decide on what your next move is. The relationship between supply, demand and price is a good starting point. These two principals are the basis for any market:

Relationship between supply and demand. As supply goes up, demand lowers and so the prize. Be careful not to overload your trading market with goods. It will cause an inflation in goods. When demand goes up, there is generally a shortage of supply. Use this principle to your advantage. By limiting the supply of candy on the market, you increase it's price. Rare candy has high demand and accordingly high price.
Inferior goods. Inferior goods are goods that become less popular when the traders have more value to spend. Stocks full of common candy are not as popular when traders have loads of valuable trading goods. Inferior goods are very popular when traders don't have a lot of valuable trading goods. Use this to your advantage when deciding between buying quality over quantity.;
, You should see if your candy appears stale, melted, or unappealing. Check the expiration date to ensure that it's still safe to consume. To increase your chances of receiving a good trade, you should make sure that your candy is in good condition and looks delicious. If it appears bad in any shape, don't try to trade it, people may feel disgusted by its poor appearance.

Bad candy will not only spoil your reputation but also potentially harm people. They could become severely sick from eating expired or damaged food. In order to maintain your social status and attract more trading partners, be sure to have a stock full of excellent quality candy.

, In order to attract the attention of potential trading partners, you should have a variety of different types of candy.

Purchase inexpensive, popular kinds, with respect to inferior goods.
Everyone has personal preferences. If they can find their favorite treat in your stock, they will be eager to trade with you.
Avoid buying candy in huge quantities unless demand is high. If you aren't sure about what people like, try purchasing small amounts of different types. Once you've figured out the popular types, you can buy larger amounts.

, You can do this by asking people directly, or by asking people over the internet. Before trading, get to know the person and determine how generous they are. You can also gain information by talking to the person's friends, but be sure to be subtle in order to avoid increasing suspicion. Generosity affects the amount of candy you get in return, so you should avoid trading with greedy people.

Be nice when approaching people. You should maintain a confident attitude, but be careful not to appear cocky. Politely request to trade with them, simply saying something along the lines of, ""Hey, I saw that you have some candy I like. Do you want to trade for some of mine?"" or ""Would you like to trade some candy?"" Appear friendly rather than demanding; otherwise, people may refuse to trade with you.

, Before trading, it's important to see what they have to offer. You can determine whether the candies are in good condition and check for types that you like. You can also determine what you are willing to give in exchange. It's best to come up with a trade before approaching a trader. You'll not only appear decisive and confident but also be able to come to a quick agreement with them., When trading with someone else, make sure that you offer an appropriate amount of candy in exchange for what you want. Rather than being greedy, you should be generous so that people will be more willing to trade with you in the future. This could also create strong bonds and possibly open ways to other trading partners. Be respectable and understanding as both of you try to come to an agreement. Once you've completed the trade, smile and thank them. Gratitude goes a long way, and people might even give you free candy if they like you enough.

If you sense that a trade isn't fair, speak up rather than remain silent. If traders feel that you're meek and unwilling to defend yourself, they might try to exploit your weakness and cheat you out of your candy. Be polite but firm when speaking to the trader, and try to work with them so that there is mutual benefit.
Speak your mind. If you suddenly want to back out of a trade, don't be afraid to express it. Politely say something along the lines of, ""I'm sorry, but I've changed my mind. Maybe we could trade another time?"" Be careful not to do this too frequently; otherwise, people may grow irritated and refuse to trade with you.

, Not everyone is going to be interested in trading with you, so be prepared to be turned down. Rather than growing angry, kindly say, ""That's okay. Maybe we could trade another time."" By being mature about the situation, you will leave a good impression of yourself, and people might want to trade with you in the near future. Whining and begging will only give you a bad reputation and decrease the chances of people wanting to interact with you. It will also annoy the person and perhaps others around them."

Chop the white chocolate into fine pieces.,
Boil water in a double-boiler.,

You could also use your hands to break the chocolate into pieces or a box grater to grate the white chocolate into shreds.
This is only necessary if using bars of white chocolate or white chocolate wafers. If you are using white chocolate chips, you can melt the chips as they are without breaking them into smaller pieces.;
, Fill the bottom half of a double-boiler with around 1 inch (2.5 cm) of water. Heat the water over medium-high heat until it begins to boil.









Note that the double-boiler method is the preferred method of melting white chocolate. White chocolate has a very low burning point of about 110 degrees Fahrenheit (44 degrees Celsius). This method grants you the greatest level of temperature control, so it is usually the most successful.
There should be plenty of room between the surface of the water and the bottom of the double-boiler's top half. The water should not come in contact with the top portion of the double-boiler even after it starts to boil.
Test the water level by placing the top half of the double-boiler in place after the water starts to boil. Remove the top half after about 30 seconds to check for moisture. If water splashed onto it, reduce the water level in the bottom half and try again.
If you do not have a double-boiler, you can create something like it with a simple saucepan and metal bowl. Choose a small to medium saucepan and a shallow bowl that fits over the saucepan snugly. If possible, use a bowl with a lip that can fit over the side of the saucepan so that the bowl itself fits into the saucepan instead of simply sitting on top. Make sure that the bowl does not touch the bottom of the saucepan or the surface of the water inside the saucepan., Reduce the heat to low. Add the chopped white chocolate to the top portion of the double-boiler and replace the top portion so that it sits above the water. Stir the white chocolate continuously until it melts.









Remove the white chocolate from the heat after most of it has melted but while a few lumps are still present. The chocolate will continue to melt after being removed from the heat as long as you continue to stir it, and pulling it off early prevents it from overheating.
When white chocolate overheats, it becomes lumpy and grainy. You may not be able to return it to a usable state if that happens.
If you cannot melt the remaining lumps of white chocolate after removing it from the heat, simply replace the top portion of the double-boiler and heat the chocolate for 30 to 60 seconds longer.
Do not allow any liquid to get into the white chocolate as it melts. Liquid will cause the chocolate to seize up and become lumpy. If possible, you should even avoid letting steam from the bottom half of the double-boiler from getting into the white chocolate. You should also make sure that the spoon used to stir the chocolate remains dry throughout the process. Metal spoons are better than wooden or plastic spoons since they are less likely to retain moisture.Do not cover the double-boiler as the chocolate melts since condensation will build on the lid. If this condensed water drips down into the white chocolate beneath it, the chocolate could be ruined.
If you do need to add a liquid ingredient to the white chocolate, like an extract or food coloring, it is best to add the liquid to the white chocolate before you begin melting it. This will allow the temperature of the liquid and chocolate to remain the same, minimizing the risk of seizing the white chocolate up.

, If the white chocolate does become seized and lumpy, you might be able to save it by stirring in a small amount of butter or shortening.









Remove the white chocolate from the heat before attempting to rescue it.
Add the butter or shortening into the lumpy white chocolate 1 tsp (5 ml) at a time to avoid overdoing it. You will probably end up needing about 1 Tbsp (15 ml) per 6 oz (170 g) white chocolate.
You could also use flavorless vegetable oil, warm milk, or warm cream. Make sure that all liquid ingredients are added only if warmed to the temperature of the white chocolate first. Adding cold liquids will likely worsen the problem.
Use re-emulsified white chocolate with other ingredients to make sauces, frostings, and batters. It is difficult to use it on its own for coating candy or creating decorations since the texture and shine will be different. You might be able to use it on its own for drizzling over cookies, however.

Chop the white chocolate into fine, even pieces.,
Adjust the power on the microwave.Instead of microwaving the white chocolate at full power, you should reduce the power to medium or 50 percent.,
Warm the white chocolate in the microwave for 30 seconds.Microwave the white chocolate in a microwave-safe bowl for 30 seconds and stir.,
Continue in 30-second intervals as needed.,
Restore the chocolate, if necessary.",How to Melt White Chocolate2," Cut up wafers or bars of white chocolate using a sharp kitchen knife. The pieces should be even in size, measuring about 1/4-inch (6.35-mm) to 1/2-inch (1.27-cm).









You could skip this step if you start out with white chocolate chips instead of larger pieces. Chips are already small enough to melt as they are without additional chopping.
For large bars, chunks, and wafers, you could also break them into pieces using your hands or shred them down to size using a box or hand grater.

,









Reducing the power on the microwave ensures that the chocolate will not become too hot, too fast. Leaving the microwave set at full power can cause delicate white chocolate to overheat quickly, resulting in a lumpy, grainy mess.
Note that microwaving white chocolate is not the recommended melting option. It is more difficult to monitor the temperature of the chocolate in the microwave than it is with a double-boiler. White chocolate burns at about 110 degrees Fahrenheit (44 degrees Celsius), and it is easy to burn it in the microwave if you do not watch it carefully.

,









The white chocolate will continue to melt from its own heat upon being stirred.
Do not cover the bowl since this can cause condensation. Condensed water can ruin the chocolate if it drips down into it.
Even if it does not look melted, you should check the temperature of the white chocolate before continuing to microwave it. The chocolate will retain its shape without being stirred, so merely looking at it is not a good indication of how warm it is.
Generally speaking, the white chocolate should be no warmer than the inside of your bottom lip. If you want to gauge how warm the chocolate is, you can test it by touching the chocolate with clean hands and comparing the temperature to the warmth of your bottom lip.

, If the white chocolate still will not melt after stirring it for about a minute or so, you can continue microwaving it in 30-second intervals at 50 percent power.









Stir the white chocolate in between intervals to give it a chance to melt outside of the microwave.
This tends to be necessary for large batches of white chocolate but not for small amounts.
To be on the safe side, you can even microwave the white chocolate in 15-second intervals instead of 30-second intervals.

, White chocolate that seizes and becomes lumpy or grainy might be able to be salvaged with the addition of butter or shortening.









Add about 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of butter or shortening for every 6 oz (170 g) of white chocolate. To be on the safe side, add it in 1 tsp (5 ml) at a time and stir in between each addition.
Warm milk, warm cream, or flavorless vegetable oil can also be used to re-emulsify white chocolate instead of butter or shortening. Make sure that these liquid ingredients are warmed to the approximate temperature of the white chocolate before you stir them in.
Even if you manage to salvage seized white chocolate, your uses for it may be limited. Salvaged white chocolate can often be used as a drizzle or as an ingredient in batters, frostings, and sauces, but it is generally not suitable for uses like candy coatings or elaborate chocolate decorations.

Cook oysters thoroughly.,
Freeze any oysters you do not want to use right away.,
Find out if your state recycles shells.,
Obtain a license.,
Get a map of state harvesting grounds.,
Gather your gear.",How to Collect Oysters," Legal harvesting of oysters must take place during approved times of year. Your state or other legislating bodies may set seasons for harvesting oysters.Your local department of natural resources or fish and wildlife management agency will publicize when these seasons are. The exact dates of the seasons can vary from year to year, and are determined based on a number of factors, including:

The number of tides
The condition of beaches and of the seawater
The number of people expected to go harvesting
The average harvest size;
, Nevertheless, oysters are safe to harvest and eat all year round. However, oysters reach their peak condition during winter and early spring.

, It is best not to harvest oysters within three days following a heavy rain (1 inch or greater).Runoff from soil can contain bacteria and other contaminants. In some locations, it is expressly forbidden to harvest oysters following rainfall. Instead, plan to harvest oysters during clear weather.

, The best time to harvest oysters is during the day, and when the tide is lower than 2 feet.This makes it easier to find oyster reefs, and to remove clusters from them.


Pay attention to water conditions when harvesting oysters so that you don’t become trapped as the tide comes back in.

, Even when you're going to an approved collection site during ideal weather conditions, you should double-check the area before you start harvesting the oysters. Oysters feed by filtering seawater, which means they can collect all sorts of pathogens and pollutants.If you notice dead oysters or fish, foul smelling water, or any other warning signs, seek another harvesting ground.

, Some harvesters like to use a flat-bottomed oyster boat. However, all you really need to do to collect oysters is wade into the water and approach a reef.Be careful, however, since the mud near oyster beds (sometimes called “gumbo mud”) can be very thick and sticky.


Make sure to wear good footwear when wading to collect oysters, to protect your feet from sharp oyster shells, thick mud, and debris.

, Whether you are wading in the water or standing in an oyster boat, rake your oyster dredge across the reef.The toothed portion of the dredge will help knock oysters off of the reef, which will then be collected in the basket portion. When your dredge seems full, empty it on deck or into a collection bucket.

You can also simply use a hammer or similar tool to knock clusters of oysters off of their reef.Make sure to wear thick gloves when handling oysters. This will protect your hands from their shells and any sharp tools you may be using to handle the clusters.

, Oyster reefs will contain both larger, older oysters, and smaller, younger oysters. Many locations will set a minimum size (often 3”) for oysters that can be collected.These minimums are designed to prevent over-harvesting and to preserve oyster populations. Larger oysters are also more desirable.

, Using a hammer, screwdriver, or other tool, separate individual oysters from each cluster. Remove any smaller oysters and carefully place them back in the water.You should also remove any dead oysters and discard them by placing them back in the water.


Live oysters, if open, will close their shells when lightly tapped.

, Oysters which are alive and large enough can be kept. Many harvesters prefer to use a floating bucket (attached to the harvester with a cord), since it will keep oysters moist in the water and allow you to keep your hands free., Each state or local area may set a limit (by number, weight, or volume) on the amount of oysters each person is allowed to collect.There may be fines or other penalties for illegally harvesting oysters in your area., While you are collecting oysters, you must keep them moist and in the shade.Put them on ice if you will transport them in a cooler or bucket, but do not allow them to freeze. Refrigerate them as soon as possible (within 4 hours). Once you bring them home, cover them with a clean wet towel and put them in your refrigerator until cooking. Do not keep your oysters in an airtight bag or other container, as this will kill them prematurely.


Keep the oysters on a low level of your refrigerator, below any cooked food or food that will be eaten raw.

, Cooking oysters that are already dead (or eating them raw) can be hazardous to your health., Many people like to eat oysters raw or lightly steamed. However, this will not kill potentially harmful pathogens.No amount of cooking will remove chemicals or biotoxins that the oysters may have collected from seawater, so always only harvest oysters from approved locations.


Oysters can be prepared a variety of ways: roasting, steaming, baking, grilling, frying, stewing, etc.
Cook oysters according to recommended temperatures and times. For instance, they should be boiled or simmered for at least 3 minutes, fried at 375 degrees Fahrenheit for at least 3 minutes, or baked for 10 minutes at 450 degrees Fahrenheit.Use fresh or refrigerated oysters within two days. Discard and do not eat any old oysters.

, Shuck oysters and freeze them in small batches in their natural juices, or in any liquid you have cooked them in. They can remain in your freezer for up to a year, but are best if used within 3 months.


Thaw frozen oysters in your refrigerator for 24 hours prior to using them.
Remember to thoroughly reheat any cooked oysters or oyster dishes.

, Young growing oysters need older shells to attach to. Returning undesired oysters to the water and leaving cast off shells on the beach helps ensure that young oysters have a good surface to grow on. In some areas, there may even be opportunities to recycle shells after harvesting. The Oyster Recovery Program maintains a list of these states and information about how to participate.In some cases, you may be required to shuck on the beach, and leave the shells there., Exact licensing requirements will vary from state to state, but having a fishing or shell fishing license is usually required to legally harvest oysters.Contact your local department of natural resources or fish and wildlife management agency to find out more about licensing costs and requirements.


Licenses can often be purchased directly from the relevant agency, or from vendors such as bait and tackle shops. In many cases, these agencies also allow you to easily purchase a license online.
You may be required to carry proof of your license while harvesting oysters.
Make sure to learn about all harvesting requirements (such as size limits) when you obtain your license.

, States will generate a list of approved harvesting locations. This list helps harvesters stay away from areas that are potentially contaminated, polluted, or hazardous.Your local department of natural resources or fish and wildlife management agency may even have an online or print map of these harvesting grounds available for you to use.

, In some locations, you may only be allowed to use hand equipment (no mechanical means, such as a power dredge) for harvesting oysters.Basic equipment includes:An oyster dredge, hammer, or other tool to break off clusters
Heavy duty gloves
A collection bucket (such as a floating bucket)
Ice to keep oysters cool
A screwdriver or other shucking tool

",How to Bread Fish," A basic breading involves fish, flour, egg, and coating. If you're using frozen fish, defrost it thoroughly. It's also good to rinse the fish in cold, clean water to remove any scale-bits or other stuff that might be stuck to it. If you're using crackers or need to make your own bread-crumbs, take some time to crunch them up as thoroughly as possible. The smaller the crumb, the better the crust will be eventually. Beat 1-2 eggs into a bowl with a small amount of milk or water to smoothen out the mixture. For a basic breaded fish, prepare the following ingredients:









Fish fillets of your choice. A white fish like tilapia or cod is usually better for breading.
Flour
Bread crumbs or cracker crumbs, seasoned
1-2 eggs, beaten
Milk or water;
, Pour cracker crumbs or other breading into one bowl, your flour into another bowl, and the beaten egg into yet another. It's usually helpful to have them in the order they'll be used. To one side of your skillet, line up the flour, then the egg, then the coating, which should be closest to the skillet.









Take a minute to season your coating, if it isn't seasoned already. A pinch or two of salt and pepper are good additions, as well as cayenne pepper, seasoned salt, dill, or Old Bay seasoning. Use the kind of flavors you like and season the coating to your taste. Alternatively, you can season the flour.

, Take your fish fillets and dredge them in the flour thoroughly, using your hand to work flour into the nooks and crannies. This step is important to filling in the gaps in the cracker crust, working with the breading to form a nice and even coating.








, Don't drop it in to the egg mixture and soak it. Instead, dip it quickly and take it as cleanly and quickly as you can to the next ""station"" with the coating in it. Dip the fish into your seasoned coating and use your other hand to spread the coating over the fish evenly.








, To fry your breaded fish, heat a half-inch or so of cooking oil on medium-high heat and fry the fish in it, turning once, about 3-5 minutes on each side. Turn the fish over when the crust has turned a golden brown color. It won't take long, so watch carefully.









Wait until the oil is hot enough (about 350 degrees) before adding the fish. It should feel hot with your hand 3–5 inches (7.6–12.7 cm) above it, and spit when you throw a drop of water into it. Avoid over-loading the frying pan with too many pieces of fish, or you'll drop the temperature considerably. Frying at a lower temperature results in oily and soggy fish.
Alternatively, you can bake the fish. To bake your breaded fish, place your breaded fillets into a baking dish or onto a baking sheet. Bake at 375 °F (191 °C) for 15-20 minutes, turning halfway through., Breaded fish goes well with a squeeze of lemon, tartar sauce, malt vinegar, or all of the above. Prepare with fried potatoes for a classic fish-and-chips, or opt for a healthier option and serve with wild rice and green vegetables.








, Fish is versatile and amenable to all sorts of breading and combinations. You can use crunched up potato chips, potato flakes, cornmeal, or even corn flakes cereal, depending on what's available. Experiment some to see what you like best.








Skip the crumbs and dip twice in flour. If you're out of bread crumbs and don't feel like crunching up a bunch of crackers, feel free to do two coatings in seasoned flour instead of the regular one coating.
The breading of choice for a southern-style fish-fry is definitely cornmeal. It makes a golden brown super-crunchy crust that's hard to argue with. If you've got some cornmeal or corn-flour on hand, give it a try.

, Typically, when deep-frying fish, people will skip the egg batter and elect to head straight from the flour mix to the fryer. If you're doing a big batch, or just want to make the clean-up process easier, consider putting your seasoned flour AND your other breading mixture into a paper or plastic bag, adding your fish fillets, and closing the bag securely. Shake the bag until the fish are coated evenly and put immediately into the deep fryer.








, The batter used for deep-fried fish in Europe and elsewhere is commonly a wet batter, rather than a dry breading, and is delicious and easy to make. To create a wet batter for dipping fish into, mix together:









One half-cup of flour
One tsp. baking soda
One-half tsp. salt
Half-can or bottle of beer
Seasoning, to taste

, If you're cooking a stronger fish like catfish or salmon in breading, or don't particularly like the taste of fish, adding a bit of lemon juice to the beaten egg can help to mask it slightly. Consider adding a squeeze of lemon to the egg when cooking for picky fish eaters.

Mix your breadcrumbs in with seasoning in a small bowl.,
Melt 4 tablespoons of butter in the microwave.,
Coat the fish in the butter mixture, then the breadcrumbs.,
Cook the fish for 12-15 minutes.,
Try out several variations on the dish to suit your liking.",How to Bake Cod2," Try and purchase fillets that are roughly the same texture. This ensures that they all cook at the same temperature and you don't end up with any undercooked of dry pieces., The foil will prevent the fish from sticking to the bottom. In the event that you don't have foil, lightly brush the bottom of the pan with olive oil or cooking spray.

, Take 1-1/2 cups of bread crumbs (regular if you want smooth-textured cod, panko for extra crispy) and mix in 1 teaspoon sea salt, cracked black pepper, 1/3 cup chopped parsley, 1/4 cup chopped green onions, 1 teaspoon garlic powder, and any other desired spices. Toss the mixture so that the ingredients are mixed in evenly and set aside.


This breadcrumb mixture is easily customized, as the only ""essential"" ingredients are the breadcrumbs and the salt.
If you want new seasonings, you can't go wrong with a teaspoon of chili powder, paprika, and/or cayenne for a hotter fish. For an herb mixture, try 1 tsp dried oregano, rosemary, thyme, and/or basil.

, Chop the butter in small cubes to help it melt faster, and work the microwave in intervals of 30 seconds or less. You don't need the butter to be hot, just melted into a liquid. Mix in the juice from 1 large lemon once it is melted.

, Dip each fillet in the butter, coating both sides, then move it to the breadcrumb mixture. Lightly press the fish into the breadcrumbs so that it is coated completely, then set in the baking dish. Once all the fish is in the pan, pour any remaining butter mixture over the fillets.

, The fish should be flaky and moist when removed. and it will feel firm. If the inside is shiny and translucent, cook them for another 2-3 minutes. Garnish with a lemon wedge and a sprig of fresh parsley and serve., Cod has a mild flavor that makes it easy to adapt. This means you can customize the dish to your liking with a few easy tweaks.


For a low-cal version, cut the butter and breadcrumb mixtures in half. Simply drizzle the butter on top of the fish and sprinkle your breadcrumbs only on the top of the fish.
Toss 2-3 chopped tomatoes, 4 cloves of garlic, and one sliced onion with a tablespoon of olive oil and surround the fish with the vegetables when cooking for an easy side-dish to go with the fish.
Substitute breadcrumbs for 1/2 cup of flour for a lighter coating on your cod."

Rabbits, cottontails in particular, can be killed with an air rifle or small ""toy"" 50-lb crossbow.,
If you merely wound the animal, kill it as quickly and painlessly as possible.,
Cut off the lower half of each leg.,
Peel back the skin at the neck.,
Starting at the neck or just below the rib cage, cut through the belly as far as you can.,
Remove the guts, keeping the liver and kidneys, if desired.,
Chop the rabbit into pieces for easier cooking.

,
Pan-fry the meat.,
At this point, if there's anything left, de-bone the rabbit and prepare it according to your favorite recipe.",How to Eat Wild Rabbit," If you're in an area where guns are tolerated, a .22 works well, with good accuracy. Typically, cottontail (""bunny"") rabbits don't run away to escape; they ""hide"", often in plain sight behind the nearest bush, giving you a clear shot. Head shots are best, especially with anything more powerful than an airgun, as even a .22 will destroy meat, making rabbits more difficult to butcher. There are also ways to trap them.;
, A crossbow bolt, BB, or a bullet through its brain works, as well as beheading it.

, Also cut off the head.

, Grab one of the front legs by the muscle, and peel off the skin. This is similar in manner to removing a sock from a foot. If you're not going to use it, compost it, as with other parts that you won't eat. A quick, strong pull on the tail will usually suffice to get the white piece of fur off it, if it didn't come off with the rest (it usually doesn't).

, Then cut between the hind legs to expose the end of the small intestine.

, The organ meats are tasty, but can be quite ""gamey"" as well, depending on the animal's diet (for that matter, the whole animal is sometimes unpalatably gamey, but still edible).


(Keeping the liver, a real delicacy!)
Remove the greenish gland embedded in the liver, making sure not to puncture it, so the bile doesn't taint the meat.

,, This can be done with or without flouring or breading it first, but pan-frying is a first step to many rabbit recipes. It, of course, can be eaten at this point without further preparation, especially if you're hungry; and if the meat is too gamey, you may want to find out now before putting it into a stew.

,


For example, pan-fry the rabbit in some wine, then some water. Let it cook for 45 minutes, adding the water gradually over the cooking time. Just be sure that it never runs out of water or it may burn. When done, turn off the heat and cover the rabbit pieces with lemon tree leaves (5-10 leaves). Leave the rabbit covered in lemon leaves with the pot closed, for 5-10 minutes, so that the aroma of the lemon gets into the meat. Then remove the leaves (they are not edible). Delicious!

Refrigerate the carcass as soon as possible.,
Skin the snake.,
Rinse the meat, and cut it into pieces with a sharp knife or poultry shears.,
Dip the segments in a bit of egg white (milk would also do) before dredging them in a pepper and sweet cornmeal mix (or cornbread mix with some extra black pepper).,
Heat about 3/4"" (2cm) of canola, vegetable, or peanut oil in a heavy frying pan until quite hot.,
Drain and cool.,
Serve your fried snake bits warm, and provide napkins - this is finger food.,
Eat the snake meat.",How to Cook a Snake," It can also be frozen. The meat's integrity remains intact, and the coloration of the skin is unaffected.;
, Cut off the head, strip off the skin, and remove the guts of the dead snake.

, Make the cuts between and at the same angle as the ribs to avoid cutting the ribs. If the ribs are severed, they may be difficult to remove from the meat after it is cooked. Some people prefer to soak the ready-to-cook snake pieces in saltwater for a day or two to remove any remaining blood or ""gaminess"" from the meat.

, Shake off the excess.

, Add the snake pieces one at a time to avoid from dropping the temperature in the pan too quickly. Use tongs to keep your fingers away from the sizzling hot oil, watch for dangerous splatters, and use a screen if necessary to prevent a mess. Turn the snake pieces just as the batter begins to turn golden - by the time it starts to brown the snake will be overcooked. There's not much meat on the bones, and the muscles are thin and lean.

, Remove the snake pieces before they're quite done - they'll continue to cook after removal from the pan - and set them on paper towels to drain and cool.

, Accompany with most anything you'd serve with fried fish.

, There should be a line of muscle along either side of the spine; this is the thickest piece of meat on the snake's body. The ribs are quite firmly attached to the spine, so scrape your teeth over them firmly to remove the rest of the meat from the ribs.

",How to Cook Ribs in the Oven3," Remove ribs from the packaging and pull off the membrane, which is usually attached to the underside of the rib cage. Season the ribs with salt, pepper, and other spices that you like.









The membrane becomes tough when cooked, so it's important to remove it. Slide a knife underneath it and gently pull it up, working carefully to remove all shreds of the membrane.

, Leave enough foil hanging over the edges to fold over and cover the pan while the meat is cooking.









The pan should have at least two inch sides, and be large enough for all the meat to fit in one layer. Stacking the meat will cause it to cook unevenly, and very thick layers may result in some of the meat not being cooked thoroughly.

, The water will create steam to keep the meat moist, while keeping the bottom of the pan and foil from scorching. This also reduces the actual temperature in the tent you'll create with the foil.








,,, An alternative to foil is a turkey baking bag. Using a baking bag will make clean-up easier and produce an evenly cooked product. Follow the directions on the cooking bag box. The addition of water isn't necessary as the bag acts as an ad hoc pressure cooker. If all that is available to you is foil, lay some wax paper or parchment down to make a barrier between the ribs and the foil, especially if you like to use B-B-Q sauce. the foil is reactive and the paper prevents sticking and any adverse foil-acid reaction.








, Unfold the foil, then return it to the oven, raise the temperature to 375F / 190C degrees and allow to cook 10 to 15 more minutes. This will allow the ribs to brown and will cook off some of the juices in the pan.

Overcome your squeamishness.,
Investigate the possibilities.,
Know which animals are probably the most suitable.,
Know the law.,
Learn the signs of healthy roadkill.,
Avoid getting rabies.,
Butcher the carcass.,
Cook the meat thoroughly.,
Bless your roadkill.",How to Eat Roadkill," While eating roadkill isn't going to seem like an attractive option for many people, if you're the slightest bit curious, at least learn about it and then make up your mind. Roadkill has been consumed by people in impoverished situations or for ethical, environmental, and pragmatic reasons for as long as there have been roads and human vehicles to knock over animals.Eating roadkill offers an affordable means of obtaining meat, and with an average of about one hundred million roadkills in America alone every year, it's a plentiful food source.It can be a chance to eat meat you'd never normally contemplate, like bear or squirrel meat. And for a growing number of people around the world, it's an environmentally responsible and considerate way to dispose of animals killed on our many roads.Even vegetarians and vegans have been known to enjoy a feast of roadkill.Finally, for those who are still feeling squeamish, there are people who argue that knowing how to eat roadkill is an essential survival skill for those times when disaster strikes or you're hopelessly lost and hungry. As one commentator has stated: ""As long as the meat is reasonably fresh and well cooked, it will not matter one iota how the animal met its end.""


By removing roadkill, you're possibly saving another life or more. Roadkill begets roadkill as scavenger animals come along to enjoy the meal and themselves turn into additional roadkill victims.If you're still revolted, consider the thought that it is waste that is more unpalatable than responsible adults making a decision based on common sense and diligence to eat meat that's offered for free.;
, The best thing you can do at the start is to get to know people already foraging for roadkill and learn off them. They can show you how to find the roadkill opportunities in your area and they can teach you the signs of what to look for to assess the safety or otherwise of the roadkill for consumption. Look for adverts in local papers or ask around for skill-sharing workshops which are enthusiastically promoted by those who believe in the value of eating roadkill.Such workshops teach you about how to spot good roadkill, how to skin it, how to cook it, and how to store it.

, Roadkill animals that are considered edible include:


Badger, hedgehog, otter, rabbit, pheasant, fox, beaver, squirrel, deer (venison), moose, bear, raccoon, opossum, kangaroo, wallaby, possum, rabbit, etc. Reptiles can also be eaten, but they might be fairly squashed.
Rats may carry Weil's disease and are therefore best avoided.The gray area is eating cats and dogs; for some, this is too squeamish as these are pets (especially when they have their collars on); but for others, they're not really concerned.On balance, it's probably the kindest to pull the pet off the road and to alert the owners to come and collect it.

, It's important to check the laws of your state, province, region, or country as to roadkill collection and eating. In some American States, for example, it isn't legal to eat roadkill, while in others, it is legal but sometimes the ownership of certain animals vests in the local wildlife departments and must be distributed through them first, or you may need a permit.There may also be local or temporal bans based on increased risk of certain diseases etc., that might have flared up. It's a good idea to stay knowledgeable about the rules and disease risks.

, Roadkill is safe to eat in many instances but there are risks of rotting, rabies, and disease. You can avoid these risks by knowing what signs to look for and using common sense:Look for freshness. Obviously, if you have witnessed the animal being hit, it's fresh. In terms of coming across roadkill, signs of freshness include clear eyes, fleas still active on the fur or hide of the animal and general signs of it looking fresh. Rigor mortis sets in quickly, so stiffness of the body does not mean that the animal is not fresh.
Use the temperature as a guide. Roadkill in winter is likely to remain fresher longer than roadkill in summer.
Avoid roadkill that has maggots, fly, or other scavenging insect infestations, as this indicates a lack of freshness. However, the presence of fleas is a good sign and means that the animal is probably still edible.
If the animal's eyes are milky, clouded, or white, it is less fresh but may still be edible.
If it stinks of rotting flesh, trust your nose but be aware that there will be some stench just as a result of the impact, as wind, excrement, etc. is forced rapidly through the body. This odor may release when moving the carcass too, so odor isn't the sole indicator of the state of the meat.
Look for whole roadkill. Roadkill that has to be scraped off the road because it has been flattened or is so crushed up as to be unrecognizable is not worth it and won't be healthy for you to consume. Avoid roadkill in the middle of roads. Instead, look along the side of roads, on the shoulders and beyond, where bodies often end up from impact or after crawling away from the hit point..
Except in a survival situation, don't eat roadkill you aren't sure is fresh. Why risk your health? If the roadkill seems to be in good shape, you could still use the hide.

, Although rabies dies quickly once the host is dead,it's advisable to wear gloves when handling, gutting, and skinning warm-blooded animals and to ensure that you don't have open wounds that could be infected. The cooking process kills rabies but it is probably a good idea to boil known rabies carriers first (foxes, skunks, raccoons, etc.)., Field Dress a Deer or other large animal to cool it promptly so it doesn't spoil. (You'll need an easily-cleaned place such as the back of a truck to put it.) Whether the animal is a big, like a deer, or small, like a squirrel, or even a bird, like a turkey, you'll need to skin and gut it before cooking. You could tan or even stuff the skin for a unique souvenir or practice for making a proper hunting trophy in the future.The organs are often just thrown away, but the heart and liver are often eaten. Organs spoil quickly, so do not eat them unless the meat is absolutely fresh.

, This step is vital to ensure that you kill off pathogens or parasites (such as worms) that might be present in the meat. Use a temperature that's higher than usual to ensure that the meat is well cooked.(Always beyond ""well done"".) Use a Meat Thermometer. Make it a part of the occasion; have a backyard party while the meat cooks well.


It would be most fitting to cook your roadkill on your engine. Don't risk skimping on thoroughness of cooking, though.

, For many promoters of eating roadkill, it is an indictment on our fuel-driven, human-centric society that so many animals die each year on our roads for the sake of humans going from A to B for purposes we find important but that completely disrupt the lives of animals and their normal foraging, hunting, mating, and migration patterns. Following this line of thinking through, by eating roadkill you're making the most of a terrible outcome from the animals' perspective, and the least the animal deserves is your compassionate blessing.

Bake the ham.,
Mix the glaze.,
Remove the ham from the oven 30 minutes before it's finished baking.,
Score the ham.,
Apply glaze to the ham.,
Return the ham to the oven and continue baking it until the glaze begins to turn brown and shiny.,
Finished.

",How to Glaze a Ham," The cooking time will vary depending the ham's size and whether there is a bone. If the ham is already fully cooked it only needs to be warmed through.;
, If the glaze requires cooking to thicken it, mix and cook it well before you must remove the ham from the oven.


Sweet glazes are best with hams that have been wet cured and are not salty. Sweet glazes can be made from brown sugar, pineapple chunks, fruit juices, honey, maple syrup and even carbonated beverages or dark liquors like bourbon.
Tangy glazes should be used on salty hams. These glazes include sweet ingredients, but also include savory ingredients such as mustard, pepper, hoisin sauce or vinegar.

, If you are cooking a raw ham, ensure that it's fully cooked before removing it. A ham is fully cooked when the internal temperature is 160 °F (71.1 °C) (71 Celsius).

, Scoring not only looks attractive, but allows the glaze to penetrate the rind (skin) and flavor the meat. Some cooks choose to remove the rind and score the layer of fat beneath.


Make a series of diagonal cuts 1 inch (2.5 cm) apart across the entire top surface. Turn the ham and make diagonal cuts in the other direction, forming a grid of diamond shapes.
If you wish, press a whole clove into the ham in the centers of the diamonds or at the places where the lines intersect.

, Use a basting brush, or a spoon if your glaze contains chunks of fruit. Make sure you put enough glaze on for it to soak into the scoring and flavor the meat.

, This indicates that the glaze has caramelized and the flavor has taken on a nutty, caramel flavor.


Watch the ham while it is in the oven to ensure the glaze doesn't burn.

10 grams (about 2 teaspoons) of powdered gelatin
1 cup of milk
1/2 tablespoon of vanilla extract
1/4 cup of powdered sugar
a saucepan
a large mixing bowl
a whisk
a hand mixer;
, Measure and pour ¼ cup of water into your saucepan. Then, measure and add 10 grams of gelatin to the pan. Don’t turn on the heat. Just let the gelatin and water sit in the pan for about 10 minutes, so that the gelatin can absorb some of the water.








, After 10 minutes, turn the heat to medium, and then start stirring the gelatin and water. Stir the gelatin and water over the heat until the gelatin dissolves and the mixture looks uniform.









After you have finished stirring the gelatin and water, switch off the heat and allow the mixture to cool down to room temperature again.

, While you are waiting for the gelatin and water mixture to cool, measure out one cup of milk and pour it into your large mixing bowl. When the gelatin and water have cooled, add them to the milk. Then, whisk the ingredients together until they are well combined.








, Next, measure out ½ tablespoon of vanilla and add it to the milk mixture. Then measure out ¼ cup of powdered sugar and add that to the milk mixture. Whisk the vanilla and powdered sugar in with the milk mixture until there are no lumps.









Keep in mind that you can always use a different kind of extract if you want a different flavor For example, you can try lemon, maple, almond, or coconut.

, After you have mixed the vanilla and powdered sugar in with the milk mixture, place it in the refrigerator and leave it to chill for about 1 to 1 ½ hours. Stir the mixture about once every 15 minutes to prevent the ingredients from separating.









Try chilling your beaters for the mixer as well. Chilling your beaters may help to speed up the mixing process and prevent separation., When the ingredients are cool, begin mixing them with your hand mixer. Make sure that you go all around the edges of the bowl as you mix. Keep mixing the ingredients until they resemble whipped cream.









Your whipped cream should begin to form soft peaks when it is ready., Powdered sugar is ideal because it is easy to mix in with the cream. However, if you do not have powdered sugar or if you don’t want to use powdered sugar, then there are some alternatives. Keep in mind that you may have to adjust the amount that you use if the substitute you are using is sweeter than powdered sugar, such as stevia or another sugar substitute.Brown sugar or granulated sugar. Use ¼ cup.

Stevia and other sugar substitutes. Use 1/4 teaspoon of stevia or other sugar substitute to replace the sugar.Honey. Use ¼ cup of honey, minus one teaspoon. Also, use two tablespoons less milk than you normally would to make the whipped cream., If you want to add a flavor to your whipped cream, there are many options. You can add a teaspoon of almost and kind of flavoring extract to replace the vanilla or try one of these variations:



Chocolate. Add a tablespoon of cocoa powder or some melted chocolate to the whipped cream mixture before you mix it with the hand mixer.

Lemon. Fold 1/2 of a tablespoon of freshly grated lemon zest into the whipped cream for a burst of citrus.

Cinnamon. Sprinkle a teaspoon of cinnamon into the whipped cream before you start mixing it for added flavor and warmth.

Maple bacon. Add 1/4 cup of chopped bacon and a tablespoon of maple syrup to the whipped cream for a savory-sweet treat.

, Nuts make a nice easy addition as well. Try folding in ¼ cup of chopped nuts when you are almost ready to serve your whipped cream. Chopped pecans, walnuts, chopped macadamias, and almond slivers all make great additions., Try adding a couple of tablespoons of espresso powder to your whipped cream before you whip it. Measure out and add the espresso powder to your whipped cream right before you start mixing it with your hand mixer.Or, try adding one tablespoon of cocoa powder and one tablespoon of espresso powder for some chocolate coffee flavored whipped cream.

, Mint is a great choice if you want to keep your whipped cream tasting sweet, but you can also try other chopped herbs. For example, you could add in some fresh basil, lavender, or thyme for a somewhat savory whipped cream.Make sure that the herbs are finely chopped before you add them to your whipped cream.

Stop.",How to Make Chantilly Cream1," You'll need an extremely large stainless-steel mixing bowl and a large balloon whisk to properly whip cream by hand. A bit of patience and strong arms (or a friend who'll lend a hand) are nice to have, too.


A balloon whisk helps to incorporate lots of air into the cream as you whip, creating an airier, lighter product.
Chef Leslie Bilderback recommends what she calls a ""ludicrously oversized bowl"" because the more surface area the cream has, the faster it will whip.
Always chill your mixing bowl ahead of time. A stainless-steel mixing bowl is your best choice because it'll hold the chill longer, but you can also use porcelain or glass. To keep your cream extra cold while working, you can also set the mixing bowl inside a larger bowl that you've filled halfway with ice.;
, Begin whipping the cream in a wide, circular motion. As you whip, lift the whisk out of the cream with each pass. By doing this, you'll bring more air into the cream, and it'll whip more quickly.


Whip as quickly as you can; the faster the better.

, After whipping your cream for about 30 seconds, you should see lots of little bubbles--the cream should resemble foam. Continue whipping and notice when you get to the point that you can see and to feel your cream begin to thicken.

, It depends on your arm strength and how successfully you maintain good whipping technique.

, When you get to the point that the cream starts to hold it's shape, you've reached the soft peak stage. This is the point at which you'll add sugar and/or flavorings to your cream.


If you're working ahead and won't be serving your cream for a while, stop whipping now and put your bowl in the refrigerator until you're ready to finish.

, It should only take an additional minute or so to move from the soft-peak to the stiff-peak stage. To test it, take a scoop on the end of your whisk and turn it upside-down. The peak on the scoop should hold firm and not soften back into itself.

, If you over whip your cream, you will end up with butter. If you see it the mixture starting to separate, you've gone too far.


You do not to have to whip your cream by hand. You can use a mixer with a whisk or whip attachment; however, since this is a classic French recipe, you may prefer to use this classic method of whipping by hand.

,, Shake thoroughly to mix. Label the jar with the date.

, This should take about 24 hours. If you find it takes longer than 36 hours, the starter was no longer active (meaning that the bacteria has died). The buttermilk may or may not be tasty if it takes longer than 36 hours but it can still be used for baking.

, This happens because the bacteria have fermented the milk, and the lactic acid is causing the milk proteins to thicken. Refrigerate immediately.

Whip.",How to Make Chantilly Cream3," Combine a cup of heavy cream with two ounces of chocolate. Choose dark or milk chocolate based on your preference. Chop up the chocolate or simply buy chocolate chips and use those.


In a pinch you could use cocoa powder, but the cocoa butter in the chocolate acts as a stabilizer and helps the whipped cream hold its shape.

, Put the mixture in the microwave for about 30 seconds on high and then stir. Continue to heat the mixture--15 seconds at a time--and stir until the chocolate melts completely. The mixture will start out looking grainy but will smooth out eventually.


If you use dark chocolate, you'll need to blend the mixture particularly well to avoid flecks. Use an emulsion blender to get the smoothest consistency.

, Pour the mixture into the larger bowl that you'll use to whip the cream and place in the refrigerator for about four hours.

, Whip until soft peaks form and add sugar if you like. A good guideline to follow is 2 tablespoons of sugar for every cup of cream. You can stop right here or continue to whip until the cream forms stiff peaks. Serve immediately.

Crack a second egg onto the sidewalk.,
Discard the eggs when you're finished.",How to Fry an Egg on the Sidewalk," The hotter it is, the more likely your egg will fry. If possible, choose a day when the temperature is 100 °F (38 °C) or hotter. Make sure the sun is out, too, since you'll need its rays to completely heat up the metal pan or tin foil you're using.


On cloudy days, even very hot ones, the metal won't get hot enough to cook an egg.
Eggs will be more likely to firm up in dry weather than humid weather.;
, You'll want to let it heat up for at least 20 minutes, to make sure it's as hot as it can get. Once it's that hot, be careful not to touch it with your bare hands!

, If the surface is hot enough, hopefully the egg will begin to cook. Keep in mind that the egg itself will cool down the temperature of the surface you crack it upon, so even if the pan has reached 158 degrees, the egg still might not start to fry.


Try to keep the yolk intact, so you can better observe whether or not it begins to cook.
If you use an egg straight from the refrigerator, it'll cool the surface down more than if you use a room temperature egg.

, Observe whether there are differences between the state of the sidewalk egg and the egg you cracked onto a metal surface. Does the egg on the metal surface seem to be cooking?Most people who try this experiment have found that the sidewalk egg doesn't cook at all, while the egg on the metal surface cooks slightly.

, Since the eggs probably didn't get fully cooked, you definitely don't want to eat them! Throw out the eggs. Make sure not to leave a mess on the sidewalk, since egg whites can leave a permanent mark.Be careful when you touch the hot pan! It might not be hot enough to cook an egg, but it can still burn your finger.

Leave room for your milk to expand.,

Put the milk container in the freezer.,
Store for up to 2-3 months.,
Consider freezing in ice cube trays.,
Thaw your milk in the fridge.,
For quicker thawing, soak in cold water.,
Don't use heat to thaw the milk.,
Serve within 5-7 days of thawing.,
Shake before serving.,
Alternatively, use a blender.,
Don't be put off by a slightly different texture.",How to Freeze Milk," When milk freezes, it takes up a little more space that when it's liquid.If your milk's container is filled to the brim, this can cause it to burst in the freezer, making a huge frozen mess (this is especially true for hard glass jugs). Luckily, this is easy to prevent — just pour off about a cup of milk so that you have a few inches of room at the top of the container. Doing this gives the milk plenty of room to expand.


On the other hand, if you've already drunk more than a cup or two of your milk, you can usually skip this step.;
, Once you freeze your milk, the expiration date on the jug becomes basically meaningless unless you thaw it again right away. For this reason, it's a wise idea to label your container with both today's date and the number of days remaining before it expires. You can write this directly on the container with a marker, or, if you prefer not to mark your container, you can use a piece of masking tape as a label.


For example, if it's August 24th and the milk expires on August 29th, we might label the container with the text ""Frozen: Aug. 24 — five days to expire"" so that we'll know how long we have to drink the milk when we thaw it in a month or two.

, You're all ready to freeze your milk — simply set your labeled container in a freezer with a temperature below 0o F/C. If you can't fit the entire container in the freezer, consider dividing the milk into several smaller containers. Within about a day, the milk should be frozen solid.


When the milk is frozen, you may be able to see the separation of the milk and the fat. Don't worry — this is a normal part of the freezing process and is perfectly safe.

, Most sources recommend leaving your milk in the freezer for a maximum of either two or three months.Some sources even recommend freezing milk for up to six months.The general consensus seems to be that milk can last a very long time in the freezer but that it will gradually absorb the flavors and odors of other items in the freezer over time, becoming less appealing to drink.


Note that richer dairy products, like eggnog, buttermilk, and cream generally have similar shelf lives to ordinary milk (or slightly shorter) when frozen — usually on the order of one to two months or so.

, As an alternative to freezing your milk in its container, you may want to consider pouring a portion into ice cube trays. This is an especially good choice for people looking to use their frozen milk in baking projects, as it allows you to quickly add semi-standard portions of milk to your recipe rather than having to chip away at a single solid block of milk or wait for it to thaw.


Frozen milk cubes are also good for adding to glasses of fresh milk — they keep it cold, but won't dilute it when they melt like ordinary ice cubes.

, The trick to thawing frozen milk is to use a slow, gradual process, never a quick one. For this reason, the easiest way to thaw your milk is usually simply to transfer it from the freezer to the refrigerator. The slightly warmer temperatures of the refrigerator will allow the milk to thaw to a liquid state little by little.


This can take some time — depending on the volume of your frozen milk, it's not uncommon for it to take up to three days to thaw completely in the refrigerator.

, If you're in a hurry to thaw your milk, try filling your sink with cold water (not hot water) and submerging your frozen milk container in it. Use a heavy object like a cast iron pot to hold the milk underwater as it thaws. This process will be quicker than thawing the milk in the refrigerator but will still usually take several hours, so be patient.


The reason that water thaws milk more quickly than the refrigerator has to do with the way that energy is transferred between the milk and its surroundings at a molecular level. Liquids transfer heat energy into ice much more effectively than air, making them a much quicker method of thawing., Never try to thaw your frozen milk quickly with heat. This is a sure-fire method for ruining your milk and undoing your hard work. Heating the milk can cause it to thaw unevenly or even burn, leaving you with a very unappealing finished product. Listed below are just a few tips for avoiding this situation:


Don't leave your frozen milk out at room temperature.
Don't thaw your milk in the microwave.
Don't thaw your milk in hot water.
Don't thaw your milk in a pot or pan on the stove.
Don't thaw your milk in the sun.

, Assuming your milk was fresh when you froze it, its ""freshness"" should be almost the same after thawing it. Thus, most thawed milk is good for drinking and using in cooking projects for about a week after thawing. Though its appearance and consistency may be slightly different, it should still be safe to consume.


Note that if your milk wasn't fresh when you froze it, it won't be fresh thawed, either. In other words, thawed milk that was only a day or two from spoiling when you froze it will be in roughly the same state when it's thawed.

, During the freezing process, the fat in the milk can solidify and separate from the liquid. This effect is more pronounced in milk with high-fat contents. To redistribute the fat throughout the milk, shake the container a couple of times during the thawing process to mix the milk and fat back together.


You may also notice that the milk has developed a yellowy color — this is a normal part of the freezing process and not a sign that the milk has spoiled.

, It's worth noting that you don't have to shake the milk by hand to redistribute the fat. Using a mechanical solution like a blender or food processor, for instance, allows you to quickly and easily agitate the milk for a smoother, more even texture. This can also help you break up any ice chunks remaining in your milk, which can be a surprise if they aren't discovered before you start drinking.

, Thawed milk can sometimes have a different ""feel"" than ordinary milk — it's sometimes described as being slightly chunky and watery by comparison.Though thawed milk is perfectly safe to drink, these qualities can make it difficult for some to drink.


On the other hand, thawed milk is usually an excellent substitute for fresh milk in cooking and baking projects where its altered texture is difficult or impossible to detect.

Reconstitute the eggs by mixing the powder with water.",How to Dehydrate Eggs for Powdered Eggs," If you plan on using the whites and yolks separately when you reconstitute the eggs, you'll need to separate the eggs before dehydrating them.;
, Use a fork or whisk to beat the eggs, regardless of whether you are using whole eggs or separated whites and yolks.


Alternatively, you could beat the eggs thoroughly by placing them in a food processor or blender and mixing them on medium speed for about a minute.If you separated the whites and the yolks, beat the egg whites until stiff peaks form and the egg yolks until they become thick and foamy.

, Pour the mixture into a nonstick skillet and cook for several minutes, stirring often, until the eggs are set but still soft.


Use a nonstick skillet and do not cook the eggs with any added oil or butter. Fats will lower the shelf-life and make the powdered eggs go rancid quicker.
Similarly, you should not add any milk, cheese, or other ingredients to the eggs before dehydrating them.
Break the eggs up with your spatula as you cook them. Smaller pieces will dehydrate quicker and more evenly.

, Cook the eggs in boiling water for 10 to 12 minutes. Cool the boiled eggs, peel them, and chop the whites and yolks into small pieces. You can either separate the whites and yolks or keep them together.


To hard boil eggs, place the eggs in a saucepan and cover them with about 1 inch (2.5 cm) of cold water. Place the saucepan on the stove over medium to medium-high heat. Once the water reaches a boil, turn off the heat and place a lid on the saucepan. Allow the eggs to finish cooking in the hot water for 10 to 15 minutes.
You can determine whether or not the egg is hard boiled by spinning it on its side on a hard table or counter. An egg that spins fast is hard boiled. An egg that spins slowly is soft boiled.
Cool the eggs in cold water as soon as you remove them from the saucepan. Doing this sooner makes it easier to remove the shell.
If you plan on dehydrating the whites and yolks separately, separate them before you chop them into pieces.

, Place plastic, rimmed dehydrator discs into each dehydrator tray you expect to use.


This is especially important if you are working with raw eggs since the shallow rim will prevent the liquid from running off the side of the tray.

, Roughly half a dozen whole eggs should fit on each standard dehydrator tray. Each tray should also be able to hold one dozen egg whites or one dozen egg yolks.


When working with raw eggs, simply pour the beaten egg mixture into each tray. A thin layer is preferable to a thick one.
When working with cooked eggs, evenly spread the cooked egg pieces out over the tray, keeping them in a single layer.

, Place the trays in your dehydrator and set the machine to a high heat, between 135 and 145 degrees Fahrenheit (57 and 63 degrees Celsius). Dehydrate the eggs until they look like coarse, dry crumbs.


For raw eggs, the process will usually take around 8 to 10 hours.
For cooked eggs, the process will usually take around 10 to 12 hours.
If you notice any grease lingering on otherwise dried eggs, you should dab it off with a paper towel and let the affected eggs dry a little longer before moving on.

, The ideal temperature for oven drying will be about 115 degrees Fahrenheit (46 degrees Celsius), but many ovens only drop to roughly 170 degrees Fahrenheit (77 degrees Celsius).


If your oven's lowest temperature is above 170 degrees Fahrenheit (77 degrees Celsius), this method may not work for you.
Note that the oven method is generally messier and more difficult than the dehydrator method. If you can get access to a dehydrator, it is highly recommended that you do so., Pour or spread out the prepared eggs onto nonstick baking sheets with shallow rims. You can usually fit between 6 to 12 whole eggs per baking sheet.


Do not coat the baking sheet with any additional oils since fats will cause the end product to spoil faster.
Pour raw eggs into each baking sheet in a thin layer.
Evenly spread out small pieces of cooked egg over each baking sheet, keeping the eggs in a single layer.

, Place the baking sheets in your preheated oven and cook the eggs until they become brittle and crispy. Depending on the temperature of your oven, this can take anywhere from 6 to 12 hours.


Stir the eggs every two hours or so to promote even drying.
If some eggs appear to dry faster than others, you can remove them early to prevent them from burning. Let the rest of the eggs continue dehydrating.

, Place the dried eggs in a clean blender or food processor. Mix on a high setting for a minute or two until a fine, consistent powder forms.


You must grind the eggs down into a fine powder; crumbs are not small enough. If you do not grind the eggs down thoroughly, they will become grainy when you try to reconstitute them.
You could also grind the eggs down using a seed grinder or mortar and pestle. Doing so can take more time and energy, but the results will be the same.

, Place the powdered eggs in sanitized glass jars equipped with tight lids.


You can usually pack the jar to the very top without leaving any empty headspace.
If possible, use a container with non-permeable sides, like a glass jar. It is also ideal to use a container that you can vacuum seal after packing it.

, A pantry or cupboard will usually work, but a food storage area in a cellar might be even better. Storing the eggs in a refrigerator will also work.


If the eggs have been thoroughly dehydrated and stored properly, they are usually safe for several months to about two years.
If any moisture or fat remains, or if the eggs are not stored in an airtight container, the shelf-life is drastically reduced. Under these conditions, powdered eggs may only last one week at room temperature or three to four weeks in the refrigerator.
For longer storage, place the powdered eggs in a freezer. Frozen powdered eggs can last for five years or more. Make sure that the container you use is freezer-safe, however.

, Mix 1 Tbsp to 2 Tbsp (15 to 30 ml) warm water with 2 Tbsp (30 ml) powdered eggs. Stir the two ingredients together thoroughly, then let it sit for about 5 minutes, or until the eggs thicken and set.


Once the eggs have been rehydrated, you should be able to use them as you would use regular eggs.
Cook the eggs after rehydrating them. Raw powdered eggs should always be cooked, and pre-cooked scrambled powdered eggs will usually need to be cooked again for the sake of texture. Pre-cooked boiled eggs may not need to be cooked again, though.

Soak the macaroni in hot water.,
Process the tomatoes in a blender.,
Heat the oil and butter in a large pot.,
Sautee the onion and pepper until softened.,
Add garlic, oregano, red pepper flakes, and half of the parsley to the pot and cook.",How to Make American Chop Suey1," Take 1 pound (454 g) of elbow macaroni or another tube-shaped pasta, and place it in a large bowl. Pour enough hot water over the pasta to cover it, and add salt to taste to season the mixture. Let the pasta rest in the water while you work with other ingredients.Hot water should reach a temperature between 130 and 135 degrees Fahrenheit (54 to 57 degrees Celsius). It should be too hot to touch comfortably.
While you should let the pasta sit in the water, make sure to stir it twice during the first 10 minutes that it’s soaking. That will keep the macaroni from sticking together.;
, Pour 2 28-ounce (794 g) cans of whole peeled tomatoes into the pitcher of a traditional blender or into a bowl that you can fit a hand blender into. Blend the tomatoes until they are almost entirely smooth and then set aside for use later.If you don’t have a blender, you can use a potato masher to pulverize the tomatoes into a thick, smooth puree.

, In a Dutch oven or 5 quart (4.7 L) saute pan with straight sides, place 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of extra-virgin olive oil and 2 tablespoons (28 g) of unsalted butter, and heat on medium-high. Swirl the pan regularly until the butter is almost completely melted.While the combination of olive oil and butter usually provides the best flavor, you can use only one if you prefer. For example, opt for 4 tablespoons (60 ml) of olive oil or 4 tablespoons (56 g) of unsalted butter.

, Once the olive oil and butter are heated, add 1 large onion and 1 large green pepper, both finely diced, to the pan. Continue heating the onion and pepper over medium heat until they are softened but aren’t browned. It should take approximately 7 minutes. While the onion and pepper are heating in the pan, make sure to stir them frequently so all of the pieces cook evenly.

, Once the onion and peppers are softened, stir 4 cloves of garlic that have been minced, 1 tablespoon (3 g) of dried oregano, 1 teaspoon (5 g) of crushed red pepper flakes, and ⅛ cup (29.5 g) of finely minced fresh parsley leaves into the pot. Allow the ingredients to cook for approximately 1 minute until the mixture becomes fragrant.Make sure to stir the contents of the pot while you’re cooking them for that minute so nothing sticks to the bottom and it all cooks evenly.

Crumble the ground beef in the pot and brown.,
Mix the tomatoes into the pot and simmer.,
Drain the macaroni and add it to the pot.,
Add in the Worcestershire sauce and chicken stock and mix until well combined.,
Cover the pot and heat until the noodles are mostly cooked.",How to Make American Chop Suey2," Push the onion and pepper mixture to the side of the pot to make room, and add 1 pound (454 g) of ground beef. Use a wooden spoon to break the beef into small pieces and cook it on medium-high heat until it is no longer pink, which should take approximately 4 to 7 minutes.If you prefer a leaner cut of meat, you can replace the ground beef with ground turkey.

, Once the ground beef is browned, pour the tomatoes that you pureed in the blender into the pot with the beef mixture and stir to combine. Keep the pot on medium heat and bring it to a gentle simmer., As the beef and tomato mixture simmers, use a colander in the sink to drain the macaroni of the water that it’s soaked in. Next, add it to the pot with the beef and tomato mixture, but don't stir or mix the noodles into the rest of the ingredients yet.Shake the pasta well while it’s in the colander to ensure that it’s as dry as possible.

, Before folding the pasta into the beef and tomato mixture, add 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of Worcestershire sauce and 1 cup (237 ml) of low-sodium chicken stock to the pot. Use a spatula to fold the liquids and the pasta into the beef and tomato mixture until all of the ingredients are well combined., Once the ingredients are all well mixed, cover the pot with a lid and cook on medium-high heat to bring the mixture to a hard simmer. Allow it to cook until the macaroni is nearly cooked through, which should take approximately 5 minutes.If you don’t have a lid for your pot, you can press a sheet of foil over it or lay a cookie sheet across the top.
To know how long the pasta should cook, consult the package’s instructions. You should cook it for approximately half the recommended cooking time.
You can also finish off the dish in the oven. Make the sauce as directed above, but add the Worcestershire sauce to it directly and leave out the chicken stock. Cook the macaroni halfway, and mix with the sauce and half of the mozzarella in a casserole dish. Top with the rest of the mozzarella and half of the Parmesan. Bake at 375 degrees Fahrenheit (190 degrees Celsius) for 30 minutes. Garnish with the remaining Parmesan and herbs.

Remove the pot’s lid and stir to combine.,
Mix in half of the mozzarella and stir.,
Sprinkle the remaining mozzarella and half of the Parmigiano-Reggiano over the dish.,
Cover the pot and cook for several minutes.,
Allow the pot to rest with the lid on for 5 minutes.,
Remove lid and sprinkle the remaining cheese and parsley for serving.",How to Make American Chop Suey3," After the pasta is almost cooked through, take the lid off the pot and stir the ingredients. Taste the American chop suey and add salt and pepper to taste.The mixture will be very soupy and thin at this point. Don’t worry; it will thicken up shortly.

, Once you’ve seasoned the chop suey, add half of the 1 pound (450 g) low moisture whole milk mozzarella cheese that you’ve cut into 1/2-inch cubes to the pot. Use a spatula or wooden spoon to stir the cheese into the mixture to incorporate quickly.Avoid over stirring the cheese into the American chop suey. That can cause the mozzarella to stretch and stick to the spoon, causing a big mess.

, Spread the rest of the cubed mozzarella over the top of chop suey. Follow up by sprinkling half of the 3 ounces (85 g) of Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese that’s been roughly grated over the pot as well.Don’t stir the cheeses into the mixture. You want it to form a topping over the dish.

, Place the lid back on the pot, and turn the heat to a low setting. Allow the American chop suey to come to a light simmer and cook for approximately 3 minutes., After the dish has finished cooking, take the pot off the burner. Leave the lid on, but let it rest for another 5 minutes or until the cheese has melted completely over the top of the chop suey.Allowing the dish to rest for a few more minutes gives the pasta an opportunity to soak up any excess liquid in the pot. That helps give the chop suey a thicker consistency and ensures that the macaroni is cooked to al dente.

, Once the dish has rested for several more minutes, remove the lid. Spread the remaining Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese and the chopped fresh parsley that you set aside earlier over the American chop suey as a garnish and serve hot.When you serve the dish, you should have extra Worcestershire sauce on the table so guests can add more if desired.

Sautee the ingredients and combine in a greased casserole dish.,

Uncover the casserole and add the topping, then broil to finish it.",How to Make a Casserole1," Casseroles are made by combining a variety of starches, meats, vegetables, and other ingredients, sometimes raw and sometimes cooked, into the dish and baking them in a casserole dish. Casserole dishes are traditionally square or rectangular baking pans, usually made of Pyrex, aluminized steel, or earthenware. Often, casseroles are quite hearty, topped with cheese or breadcrumbs.;
, Most casseroles use as their base some variety of starch, which will form the most substantial content of the casserole. Typically pre or par-cooked before being added to the casserole dish, using starches as a base is a good way to stretch a little bit of protein or vegetables into a full meal. While casseroles are amenable to any variety of ingredients, most tend to use the following:



Potatoes. Pre-cooked potatoes can make an excellent base for breakfast or dinner casseroles, or as a topping to shepherd's pie in it's mashed form. If you want to use potato in your casserole, you can purchase frozen hash browns or parboil peeled and quartered raw potato until fork-tender. It goes especially well with beef, or other red meats.

Pasta. From egg noodles to mostaccioli, pasta makes a perfect base for a casserole. Mixed with any variety of sauce or cheese, pasta casseroles can be made both sweet and savory, perfect for any time of the year. Lasagna is the classic of the genre, but experiment with different pastas to find what you like best.

Rice. Common in both Middle Eastern and Midwestern American cuisine, rice-based casseroles go particularly well with chicken or other poultry. Basic white rice is good to start with, but wild rice, jasmine rice, or even black rice can make casseroles surprising and complex.

Other grains. Why stop at rice? Quinoa, barley, wheat berries, oatmeal, or any combination of whole grains can make a substantial and healthy casserole, especially when combined with rice. Egyptian koshari, which can be made as a casserole, features pasta, lentils, and rice as an idiosyncratic base for its spices and flavors. Why not?

, For most casseroles, you'll sauté the proteins and vegetables briefly in a skillet, then finish them off in the casserole dish, topped with breadcrumbs or cheese. For that reason, you can almost think of a casserole like a stir fry that you bake at the end.



Chicken and other meats should be cooked through before being added to the casserole dish. Casserole recipes that feature a lot of liquid, however, will sometimes call for raw meat to be added to cook everything at the same time. It's possible to do both.

Carrots, onions, and other root vegetables make excellent additions to any casserole. Because everything is cooked together, casseroles are an excellent way to spice up somewhat bland vegetables.

For vegetarians, green or brown lentils make an excellent substitution for the meat in most casserole recipes. Commercial meat substitutes, like seitan or tofu-based meat alternatives are amenable to the casserole as well.

, For lots of casseroles, a sauce or egg mixture will be added to the ingredients to keep everything bound together. In Midwestern cuisine, this often takes the form of Cream of Mushroom soup, but béchamel, curry, whipped egg, pasta sauce, or other ingredients are likewise common, depending on the ingredients used.

, Meats should be cooked through and vegetables should have the crunch taken off, but should still be somewhat firm before being added to the casserole dish. Before adding ingredients, it's a good idea to grease the pan with butter or oil.


Depending on the casserole, you might like to layer the ingredients into separate layers, as with a lasagna or a moussaka, or mix the ingredients.

, Depending on the topping you use and the kind of texture you're looking for, it's common to cover your casserole with aluminum foil or a lid, and bake between 350 and 425 F.


The cooking time will vary, depending on the ingredients and the amounts. For casseroles in which all the ingredients are cooked ahead of time, and you're just trying to melt cheese, you only need 10 or 15 minutes in the oven to finish the job. If you want to cook rice in liquid, you're looking at a cooking time closer to 45 minutes or an hour.

, If you want a cheesy or crunchy top to your casserole, don't add it ahead of time, or it'll be a soggy mess. Wait until you've cooked the casserole through, then remove the cover, add your topping, and broil the casserole to finish it. Common toppings include:


shoestring potatoes
French onions
parmesan cheese
potato chip crumbs
cracker crumbs
mashed potato

Make baked macaroni and cheese.,
Make tuna casserole.,
Make lasagna.",How to Make a Casserole2," One of the easiest and most delicious simple casseroles to make is a baked macaroni and cheese. By varying the ratio of cheese-to-macaroni, you can make yours gooier or more firm, depending on how you like it.



Boil half a box of macaroni for a square-shaped casserole dish and a full box for a rectangular dish. Cook until al dente, then rinse with cool water to stop them from cooking and put them in a greased casserole dish.

In a skillet, heat 2 tablespoons (29.6 ml) of butter over medium heat, then whisk in about two tablespoons of flour and brown it to make the roux, while it clumps up. Keep stirring it, or it'll burn quickly. When it browns, add 2 cups of whole milk, a little at a time, whisking vigorously, to integrate the flour and thicken things.

Add salt and pepper to taste after the milk has been added, and let the roux thicken. When it bubbles, add about 8 oz. of shredded sharp cheddar cheese, or whatever kind of cheese you like, melting the cheese in. Cheddar is most common, but mix it up by adding half cheddar and half pepper jack, or mozzarella. Use your favorite kind.

Pour the cheesy mixture over the noodles in the casserole dish. Common additions might include sautéed mushrooms, ground beef or sausage, raw tomato slices, onions and garlic. Bake at 350 for 15 minutes, then top with breadcrumbs or parmesan cheese and broil to finish.

If you like your mac and cheese creamier, add more milk at the beginning, and use fewer noodles. If you like it firmer, make less sauce, enough to just coat the noodles and add a significant amount of breadcrumbs to the top.

, Tuna casserole, or tuna-noodle casserole, is Midwestern cooking at its commonest. Using egg noodles, canned tuna, and cream of mushroom soup, it's a quick and hearty meal that you can derive from cheap pantry ingredients.



Boil two cups of egg noodles until al dente, and rinse them in cool water to stop the cooking.

In the casserole dish, mix one can of cream of mushroom soup with a half cup of water, one drained can of solid white albacore tuna, and a cup and a half of frozen peas. Salt and pepper to taste.

Alternative additions might include cheddar cheese, chopped pimento or black olive, frozen carrots, or using canned salmon instead of tuna.

Bake at 400 degrees for about half an hour, then remove to add breadcrumbs and parmesan cheese for a topping. Broil to finish.

, To make a basic lasagna, you can layer cooked lasagna noodles, mozzarella, parmesan, or ricotta cheese (or, better yet, all three) and marinara sauce in a casserole dish and bake until the cheese is melted and warm and delicious.



Sauté any additional vegetables and meat you'd like in your lasagna before adding sauce to the skillet. Spinach, mushrooms, eggplant and sausage are all common additions. Layer noodles, then sauce mixture, then cheese until you fill the pan. It's common to top lasagna with a beaten egg and parmesan cheese to create a nice golden crunch on top.

Lasagna should be baked covered at 375 F for 25 minutes and then remove the cover and bake an additional 25 minutes. Before cutting into it, let it stand for 15 minutes.

Make turkey with wild rice casserole.,
Make a chicken biryani casserole.",How to Make a Casserole3," A great way to revitalize leftover poultry is to cook it up as part of a casserole with fragrant wild rice and vegetables. One of the great things about cooking a rice-based casserole is that you have the option of cooking the rice in the oven, alongside the other ingredients, or you can use pre-cooked rice in the casserole if you've got it on hand. This option is available for any rice-dish you make in the oven.Sauté two strips of chopped bacon in a skillet over medium heat. Add half a white onion, chopped, and a few cloves of minced garlic, to your taste. When the onion is translucent, stir in two chopped carrots (about a cup), a stalk of chopped celery, and about a pound of turkey breast, cut into bite-sized chunks. Brown the turkey, cooking about 2 or 3 minutes.

In your casserole dish, add a cup of wild rice, or whatever kind of rice you like, with 2 1/2 cups of water, a can of condensed cream of mushroom soup, and a sprinkling of a half-teaspoon each of marjoram, thyme, and rosemary. Add a teaspoon of salt and pepper to taste, then mix in the chicken mixture and stir thoroughly. Bake covered at 375 for about 30 minutes. Remove when the rice is cooked and the liquid has mostly evaporated.

Additions or substitutions might include chicken or other poultry for turkey, and the addition of frozen peas, water chestnuts, pimento, fresh chopped mushrooms, green beans, or asparagus. Add whatever you like, and remove what you don't. Cream of chicken soup would also be perfectly effective to use as a thickener, or you could leave out the soup altogether and use a cup of cream or milk.

, Most commonly associated with Indian cuisine, biryani is actually a Persian dish, originally. While not traditionally prepared as a casserole, mixing curried chicken and cooked basmati rice in a casserole dish can be a nice change of pace from the cream of mushroom tradition. It smells delicious and tastes even better.To make the rice, fry half a small white or yellow onion in butter (or clarified butter, called ghee) with a bay leaf, two cracked cardamom pods, and a tsp. of whole cloves (5-10 cloves). Add three cups of basmati rice and stir in the spicy butter until it becomes translucent, then add about 6 cups of water and cook over low heat, covered, for about 40 minutes, or until all the water is absorbed. Remove from the heat and set the rice aside. If you don't have the whole spices, substitute two tsp. of powdered spice.

To marinade the chicken, marinade 6 or 7 chicken drumsticks and thighs in a mixture of coconut milk (about a quarter cup) with chopped cilantro and mint (about a half-cup of each), a tablespoon of dried cumin, a tablespoon of dried coriander, and half a bulb of chopped garlic. Make little slits in the chicken, then rub with the marinade and let sit in the refrigerator overnight.

To make the curry, fry a whole chopped white onion in butter or ghee and add 5 cloves of minced garlic and a two-inch piece of ginger, chopped. Add 5-7 whole cloves, a cinnamon stick, a tsp. of turmeric, a tablespoon of dried cumin, tablespoon of dried coriander powder, and a tsp. of gram masala. Stir the onion and dried spices together for about a minute so it doesn't burn, then add a cup of coconut milk, two cups of water, and stir everything together thoroughly to mix. When it boils, add the chicken, then cover and cook over medium-low heat for 30 minutes until the chicken is cooked through.

To assemble, line the bottom of the casserole dish with half the rice, then top with the chicken and curry sauce. Add the rest of the rice on top, cover with foil, and bake at 350 F for about 40 minutes. Check about halfway through the cooking time to make sure the rice isn't drying out.

Make green bean casserole.,
Make summer squash casserole.,
Make broccoli-cauliflower casserole.,
Make roasted winter squash and quinoa casserole.",How to Make a Casserole4," A savory staple of many a Midwestern American holiday meal, green bean casserole is a creamy baked side dish made with few ingredients. If there was ever a recipe that cream of mushroom made necessary, it is this.



To mix it up, mix together about 4 cups of cooked green beans, cut into bite-sized pieces, and one can of condensed cream of mushroom soup.

Stir in about a half cup of milk, a few dashes of soy sauce, to taste, and salt and pepper to taste.

Line the mixture in a greased casserole dish and bake at 350 F for about 20 minutes until it gets warmed through and bubbling. Top with about a cup of fried French onions and let them brown in the oven for about five minutes. Serve hot.

, Summer squash like yellow crookneck or zucchini have a tendency to be pretty bland on their own, but baked up with cheese and crunchy topping can take them to the next level.



Cut up about 4 cups of squash (roughly 2 medium squash) and sauté them over medium heat in some olive or coconut oil and half a chopped onion, then combine with ¾ of a cup of water, 2 beaten eggs, a cup of shredded cheddar cheese (or whatever kind of cheese you prefer), and salt and pepper to taste.

Mix the ingredients thoroughly and spread into a casserole dish. Top the mixture with crunched up cracker crumbs, or breadcrumbs if you prefer, dotted with a tablespoon of butter. Bake at 400 F for 20 minutes, or until golden and firm.

Additions or substitutions might include cherry tomatoes, fresh dill, basil, or other summer herbs, and bacon. The same recipe would also work for winter squash that had been par-baked, and would be great combined with other root vegetables like sweet potato and carrot.

, To liven up cruciferous vegetables, you can't go wrong with cheese. Thickened with a simple roux and baked under breadcrumbs, it's a delicious, if not super-healthy, way to eat your broccoli. Start by chopping a head of broccoli and about half a head of cauliflower into bite-sized pieces, or by defrosting a package of each, if you want to use the frozen variety.



Sautee half an onion over medium heat in butter, then add two tablespoons of flour to start the roux.

Stir vigorously, browning the flour, then add about two cups of milk, whisking to thicken. When it bubbles and gets thick, add a quarter-cup of parmesan cheese and a half a package (about 4 oz) of cream cheese.

Season with a teaspoon each of thyme, oregano, and dill. If you like a little kick, this works great with about a quarter teaspoon of cayenne, as well.

Toss the broccoli and cauliflower in the cheese mixture and spoon into a casserole dish. Top with breadcrumbs and a sprinkling of parmesan cheese, then bake at 350 F for about 40 minutes.

, A common complaint about vegetable casseroles is that the cheese and cream outweighs the nutritional benefits of the vegetables. While cream-of-mushroom and other varieties of cheesy casserole may taste good, there are perhaps more nutritional ways of preparing vegetables. Mixing quinoa--a perfect protein, as well as a delicious and hearty grain--with hearty roasted butternut squash fits the bill of healthy and tasty casserole.



Roast one medium-sized butternut squash at 400 F, after slicing it in half and scooping out the seeds. Drizzle a little olive oil on top of the squash and roast in a roasting pan for about 20 minutes, until soft. If you'd prefer chunks of squash, rather than mashed, you can peel the squash and chop it into bite-sized chunks before roasting.

In a hard-bottomed pot, sauté half an onion, chopped, with 2-3 cloves of minced garlic in olive oil. When the onion is translucent, add a teaspoon of dried sage, or a tablespoon of fresh chopped sage, and one cup of quinoa. Stir to coat the quinoa, then add a cup and a half of water.

Bring the quinoa to a boil, then simmer over medium-low heat, covered, for about fifteen minutes, until all the water is absorbed. Add salt and pepper to taste, then stir in a cup and a half of chopped spinach or kale, a quarter cup each of dried cranberries and chopped walnuts, and two beaten eggs.

In a greased casserole dish, combine the quinoa mixture with the roasted squash. If you want, you can add a half cup of shredded swiss cheese, on top or mixed in, or leave the cheese off entirely if you wish. Return to the oven and bake for about 40 minutes.

Garnish the noodles with sesame seeds and serve.",How to Make a Salmon Noodle Bowl," Add approximately 4 cups (946 ml) of water to a large pot. Place it on the stove, and heat it over medium-high to high heat until it comes to a full boil.If you like, you can add a pinch of salt to the water to help season it before you add the noodles.;
, When the water has come to a boil, add 6 ounces (170 g) of whole wheat spaghetti noodles. Allow the noodles to cook according to the instructions on the package until they are soft.You can substitute soba buckwheat noodles for the whole wheat spaghetti if you prefer.
In most cases, it will take approximately 8 minutes to cook the spaghetti noodles properly.

, Once the spaghetti is cooked, use a pair of tongs to lift the noodles out of the pot. Place them in a colander and shake well to remove all the excess water. Leave the cooking water in the pot on the stove.Be careful when transferring the spaghetti from the pot to the colander. The noodles will be very hot, so it’s easy to burn yourself.

, After you’ve removed the noodles from the pot, place ½ pound (227 g) of fresh asparagus that have been cut into 2-inch (5-cm) pieces into the same boiling water. Let the asparagus cook for 2 to 3 minutes, or until it is cooked through but still has some snap to it.You can substitute your favorite vegetables for the asparagus if you prefer. Broccoli, green beans, and carrots are ideal substitutions.

, When the asparagus is finished cooking, drain the vegetable in the colander, shaking well to remove the excess moisture. Next, rinse the asparagus in cold water to stop the cooking process., Add 3 ½ tablespoons (52 ½ ml) of toasted sesame oil, ⅓ cup (79 ml) of lime juice, ½ teaspoon (3 g) of kosher salt, and ½ teaspoon (1 g) of freshly ground black pepper to a small bowl. Use a whisk to mix the ingredients until they’re fully combined.Be sure to use toasted sesame oil, not untoasted. The toasted oil has a bold, nutty flavor that really adds to the dish.
For the best tasting noodle bowls, use fresh lime juice.

, Place a large, nonstick skillet on the stove over medium-high heat. Spray the surface lightly with cooking spray to grease it, and let the pan heat for 3 to 5 minutes.You can substitute a drop or two of canola oil for the cooking spray. Swirl it through the skillet to ensure that it’s fully coated, though.

, When the skillet is hot, place 1 pound (454 g) of salmon fillet that’s been skinned and cut into 1-inch (2.5-cm) pieces into the pan. Allow the salmon to cook for 2 to 3 minutes on the first side, and then turn it over to cook it for another 2 to 3 minutes on the other side. Set the salmon aside for the moment.The salmon should be be cooked through, so the time will depend on the thickness of the pieces. Thicker pieces may require 3 to 4 minutes on each side to cook completely.

, Add the cooked spaghetti noodles, tender crisp asparagus, and the sesame oil dressing to a large bowl. Stir the ingredients together well to ensure that they’re thoroughly mixed., After you’ve mixed the noodles, asparagus, and dressing, mix 1 ½ cups (185 g) of cucumber that’s been cut into medium pieces and 1 avocado that’s been pitted and sliced to the bowl.

Other vegetables to consider include bell peppers, onions, and shredded carrots.

, Right before you’re ready to serve the noodle bowls, add the cooked salmon to the bowl. Toss the mixture well so the salmon is evenly distributed throughout the noodles.If you’re preparing the noodle bowl mixture ahead of time, store the noodles mixture and the salmon in different containers in the refrigerator. Combine them just before you plan to eat.

, To serve the noodle bowls, divide the noodle mixture between 2 to 4 bowls. Use 1 teaspoon (3 g) of sesame seeds to garnish the bowls, and enjoy.Store any leftover noodles in an airtight container in your refrigerator. They should keep for 3 to 5 days.

Combine the tortellini and sauce and place it in the dish.,
Top the tortellini with cheese and bake it.",How to Make Baked Tortellini1," Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (176 C). Get out an 8x8-inch (20x20 cm) baking dish. Drizzle a little bit of olive oil in the pan and use a pastry brush or piece of paper towel to spread the oil around the pan. This will keep the baked tortellini from sticking to the dish.You could also use a casserole dish of a similar size if you don't have an 8x8-inch (20x20 cm) pan.;
, Get out a large mixing bowl and add 2 cups (515 g) of marinara or pasta sauce. You'll also need to add 1/3 cup (75 g) of mascarpone cheese, 1/4 cup (5 g) of chopped fresh Italian parsley leaves, and 2 teaspoons of chopped fresh thyme leaves. Use a whisk to combine the sauce.If you don't have fresh parsley and thyme, you can substitute dried herbs. Just use 1/8 of a cup (3 g) of dried parsley and 1 teaspoon of dried thyme.

, Bring a large pot of salted water to boil. Add 1 pound (454 g) of store bought cheese tortellini and stir the pasta. Cook the tortellini according to the manufacturer's instructions. This should take around 2 minutes. Carefully drain the cooked tortellini.If you'd like your pasta even softer, cook the tortellini a little longer. For pasta with more of a bite, cook it a little less.

, Add the drained and cooked cheese tortellini to the mixing bowl with the sauce. Use a large spoon to completely combine the ingredients. Pour the saucy tortellini to the prepared baking dish.Try to mix the ingredients while the pasta is still hot. If you let the cooked tortellini sit for too long, it will begin to clump together.

, Slice 2 ounces (56 g) of smoked mozzarella into thin pieces. Lay these over the tortellini and sprinkle 1/4 cup (25 g) of freshly grated Parmesan cheese over the mozzarella. Tear off a piece of aluminum foil and cover the baking dish. Bake the tortellini for about 30 minutes. The sauce will begin to bubble and the cheese will melt once it's finished cooking.Let the baked tortellini sit for a few minutes before you scoop it out to serve.

Try tater-tot hotdish from the American Midwest.,
Make Mediterranean moussaka.,
Make Southwestern black bean casserole.,
Make southern hash-brown casserole.",How to Make a Casserole5," It doesn't get any more Midwestern than tater tots and ground beef. It also doesn't get any easier or more nostalgic. Childhood comfort food at its finest.



Brown a pound of lean ground beef over medium-high, seasoning to your taste. If you like it a little spicy, add some chili powder or cayenne. It's also common to add garlic and onions.

Add a can of condensed cream-of-mushroom soup, when the meat is cooked, and add two cans of whatever vegetables you like. Green beans are common, as well as peas, corn, or some combination of the above. Frozen vegetables are likewise fine.

Spoon the ground beef mixture into a casserole dish and top with a bag of frozen tater-tots, then bake at 350 degrees for about an hour, or until the tater tots are golden brown and crispy. Serve it up with tabasco, and it's winter in Minnesota.

, Moussaka is a lot like lasagna, but with potato and eggplant instead of noodles, and meat sauce and béchamel instead of marinara and mozzarella. It's delicious.



Start with a basic meat sauce, made with a pound of browned ground beef, garlic, and onions, spiced with cinnamon and oregano, as well as salt and pepper to taste. Add a half cup of red wine, a half can of tomato paste, and some lemon zest. Simmer uncovered for about 20 minutes, then turn off the heat.

Peel 2-3 small-to-medium eggplant, and 2-3 medium-sized potatoes, then slice into equal rounds, about a quarter-inch thick. Boil the potato rounds in salted water for about 7 minutes, until fork-tender, and grill the eggplant slices, or sauté them in the skillet to cook them through. It's usually best to salt the eggplant and allow them to sit for about 15 minutes before cooking them, to release some of the moisture.

In a skillet, make a roux by whisking about a half-cup of flour in about a half stick of butter over medium heat, then thicken with 3-4 cups of milk, whisking vigorously. In a separate bowl, beat two eggs, then slowly add them to the hot mixture, once thickened, to temper it. Add nutmeg and salt, to taste.

Layer the bottom of a casserole dish with potato rounds, eggplant rounds, and meat sauce, alternating however you wish. Top the mixture with some parmesan cheese, if you wish, and the white sauce, then bake at 350 for about 45 minutes, until the top is nicely browned.

, For a tortillas-and-black beans variant on lasagna, you can mix up a spicy casserole with hearty black beans, chorizo, and chili sauce.



Brown up a pound of chopped chorizo in a skillet over medium-high heat, then remove. If you don't like chorizo, regular sausage would be a fine alternative.

In the same skillet, sauté a chopped onion and 2-3 cloves of minced garlic, adding two teaspoons of ground cumin and one of cinnamon, when the onions become translucent.

Add about three cups of cooked black beans to the skillet, with a cup of chicken stock, and return the chorizo to the mix. Reduce the heat and simmer for about 10 or 15 minutes, testing for salt.In a casserole dish, spoon some green chili sauce on the bottom, then layer several corn tortillas in a layer on top. Spoon some of the black bean mixture over the tortillas, then add a sprinkling of shredded monterey jack cheese, or the cheese of your choice. Continue alternating layers until the dish is full, and top with extra shredded cheese. Bake covered for 20 minutes and uncovered for another 20, at 350. Serve with sour cream.

, It may not be healthy, but it's the cornerstone of a country breakfast. Next to fried eggs and a bowl of hominy grits, it's hard to beat cheesy hash-brown casserole.



In a mixing bowl, combine a cup of sour cream, a half cup of melted butter, a can of condensed cream-of-mushroom soup, 2 cups of shredded cheddar cheese (or your favorite cheese), and a teaspoon each of salt and pepper. Mix together thoroughly, then stir in two pounds of shredded potatoes. It's common to use the frozen kind for this dish, but if you shred up your own, rinse the shredded potato in water and squeeze them out thoroughly before adding.

Spoon the mixture into a casserole dish, and top with the secret weapon: crumbled corn flakes cereal. Bake uncovered for 40 minutes, or until golden brown and bubbly.

Make rice pudding in a casserole dish.,
Make baked oatmeal.,
Make bread pudding.",How to Make a Casserole6," Casseroles and starches don't always have to be savory. Baked rice pudding makes a wonderful finish to a meal that's spicy and light on starch. To make rice pudding:


In a casserole dish, combine a cup of cooked white rice (or brown rice, if you prefer the texture), with two cups of milk and one of water, two beaten eggs, a half-cup of brown sugar, and a quarter cup each of chopped walnuts, and raisins (or whatever fruits and nuts you prefer). Season with cinnamon, nutmeg, a pinch of salt, and a half teaspoon of vanilla. Bake at 325 F for 30 minutes, or until golden brown. Check for doneness with a kitchen knife in the center, which should come out clean.

, Oatmeal can be prepared the night before and popped into the oven in the morning for a wonderfully warm and comforting breakfast. It's perfectly amenable to whatever fruits, nuts, and additions you like in your oatmeal.



In a mixing bowl, combine a cup of raw oats, two cups of milk, and a cup of water. Mix in a half cup of brown sugar and a teaspoon of cinnamon. Add whatever nuts and dried fruits you like, or leave them out entirely. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight.

In the morning, spoon the oatmeal into a casserole dish and bake at 350 for about half an hour, or until golden brown, with the edges bubbling. Halfway through the cooking top, remove the oatmeal, and top with slices of fresh fruit and a sparkling of cinnamon-sugar. Sliced peaches, apples, or pears are all appropriate.

, A great way to liven up stale bread is to mix up a bread-based casserole. While bread-puddings can be sweet or savory, the desert variety is the most well-known, particularly in southern cuisine and BBQ cooking.



In a casserole dish, tear up at least 6 slices of stale bread, or about half a loaf. In a separate bowl, beat 3 eggs and mix in 2 cups of milk, a half cup of brown sugar, and a teaspoon each of vanilla and cinnamon. Add a quarter cup each of chopped nuts, or dried fruits that you enjoy. Pour this mixture over the bread, and bake at 350 for about 45 minutes, or until springy. Test with a kitchen knife in the center, which should come out clean.

To make a savory bread pudding, substitute your favorite shredded cheese for the sugar, and dried sage, oregano, and rosemary for the cinnamon.

Add a meat.,
Use a different pasta.,
Bake the tortellini while it's frozen.,
Change the cheeses.,
Add a breadcrumb topping.",How to Make Baked Tortellini2," If you'd like to add a little extra protein to the dish or just want to satisfy the carnivores in your house, add cooked meat to the tortellini before you bake it in the oven. Try one of these meats in your baked tortellini:


Ground turkey
Ground beef
Pork sausage
Bacon or pancetta

, You could also use purchased stuffed ravioli or different flavors of tortellini. You can find flavorful pastas like mushroom-stuffed ravioli or spinach-filled tortellini. Try a few different kinds to see what you like.


Keep in mind that larger pastas, like stuffed raviolis, make take longer to bake. Adjust your cook time according to the manufacturer's instructions.

, If you're really pressed for time or just want to assemble the tortellini ahead of time, don't bother with boiling and draining the tortellini. Stir the frozen tortellini directly with the sauce and put it in the baking dish. Bake the frozen tortellini as directed, but add an extra 10 minutes to the cooking time.If you want to make the tortellini ahead of time and wait to bake it, just assemble it and refrigerate it until you're ready to bake. If the tortellini defrosts, you may not need to adjust the cooking time at all.

, To adjust the flavor of the tortellini or just cut calories, swap out the mascarpone and smoked mozzarella cheeses. For example, use part-skim ricotta cheese instead of the mascarpone cheese. You can also substitute low-fat mozzarella cheese for the smoked mozzarella cheese.


To add a rich flavor, consider crumbling in a little fresh goat cheese. Since it's so flavorful, you'll only need to use a little bit.

, If you enjoy a little crunch with your baked pastas, mix up a crispy breadcrumb topping that's combined with Parmesan cheese. Stir together 1/4 cup (25 g) of fine dry breadcrumbs and 2 tablespoons of freshly grated Parmesan cheese. Sprinkle this topping over the tortellini before you bake it.You can also use panko breadcrumbs if you want more of a crunch. Panko breadcrumbs are larger so they stay crispy as they cook.

Cool and store the beans.,

Put beans and water in the pressure cooker.,
Heat to high pressure.,
Count on a much quicker cooking time.",How to Cook Red Kidney Beans1," Dried beans are among the most nutritious and affordable foods you'll find in your local grocery store. However, they require a little extra work before you can start cooking them. Start by pouring your beans out on a flat surface and looking for any that are shriveled or discolored. Discard these beans (and, if you find them, any small rocks).


Next, drop your beans into strainer and rinse them gently under a little running water. This helps to remove any small imperfections or dirt particles you may have missed.
The process for cooking beans is basically the same no matter how much you're cooking at once. The rest of this section will assume you're cooking 1 pound of beans (about 3 cups dry or 6-7 cups when cooked), which will feed four or five people easily.;
, Drop your rinsed and sorted beans into a large stove pot, cover them with an inch of water, and set them in the fridge overnight. They will soften slightly and absorb some of the water by the next day. They may appear larger and somewhat wrinkled. This is normal.


This isn't essential, but it's always a good idea if you have time. Letting the beans soak will shorten their cooking time, help them cook more evenly, and make them slightly easier to digest. In addition (there's no nice way to say this), soaked beans tend to cause less flatulence.

, If you let your beans soak overnight, pull them out of the fridge, drain them, and re-cover them with an inch of water. If you didn't soak your beans, transfer them directly to the stove. Heat on ""High"" until the water reaches a moderate boil.


If needed, you can keep the water from foaming or boiling over by adding a dash of vegetable or olive oil.
If you are using the garlic, onions, and other optional ingredients above, add them to the water as soon as you begin heating the pot.

, As soon as the beans reach a healthy boil, turn the heat to ""Low."" The boiling should reduce to a gentle simmer. Stir gently. Leave the beans on the stone with the lid on (but tilted to allow the steam to escape).

, Dry beans almost always take a long time to cook. You may stir the beans occasionally every 15 minutes or so, but don't expect them to be anywhere near done before at least an hour or so. At this time, you may check the beans by taking one in your hands and crushing it (after it has cooled, of course). Don't eat red kidney beans that are raw or obviously undercooked. This can cause a temporary condition similar to food poisoning (see ""Tips"" below).


If the beans are even a little ""crunchy,"" they aren't done. You want beans that are completely smooth and soft — this texture should be almost ""creamy.""
Be patient. A batch of dry beans can take anywhere from one to four hours to cook completely. Resist the temptation to crank up the heat — this will just make them cook unevenly.

, As soon as you notice the beans start to lose some of their ""crunchy"" texture, add a few teaspoons of salt to the water. This will give the beans a pleasantly savory taste.


Make sure that you don't add the salt before this point. Adding it before the beans have started to break down will lengthen the cooking time and make the beans cook unevenly., Continue stirring and tasting the beans every 10 to 15 minutes. When the beans all seem to have a soft texture without a hint of ""crunchiness,"" they're ready to eat! Let the beans cool in their cooking liquid, then serve or transfer to the fridge (keeping the beans in their liquid).


If you think the beans are especially watery, you can drain some of the liquid, but try to avoid pouring it all off. Leaving the beans in their cooking liquid helps maintain their texture and flavor (plus, the liquid itself is flavorful and full of nutrients).You can even use it as a nutritious base for soups.

, Cooking in a pressure cooker (or a slow cooker, crock pot, etc.) is basically the same as the stove top process, but with a few minor changes. You'll want to start with exactly the same steps as you'd use above: sort and wash the beans, then cover them with water and let them soak overnight if you have time.

, If you soaked the beans overnight, drain the soak water and add the beans to the pressure cooker. If not, add the beans directly. Cover the beans with about an inch of water. Don't fill the cooker more than halfway., Secure the lid and place the pressure cooker on the stove over medium-high heat. Once it reaches high pressure, reduce the heat to low to maintain the pressure. If you are using an electric pressure cooker, simply set it to the high pressure setting.


If you are including the garlic and optional vegetables, add them before securing the lid.

, Pressure cookers cook beans very quickly compared to ordinary stove top cooking. Most recipes call for anywhere between 22 and 30 minutes of cooking time.You may want to check for done-ness after about 20-22 minutes and adjust the cooking time accordingly.


When the beans are done, release the pressure under cold running water, then drain and rinse the beans."

Check whether the beans are plain or flavored.,
Rinse plain beans.,
Heat the beans in a saucepan or microwave.,
Alternatively, add plain beans to other recipes.",How to Cook Red Kidney Beans2," Compared to dry beans, canned beans are a mixed bag. Some cans contain beans that are ""plain"" except for the preservative fluid they are sitting in. Other cans contain beans that are sitting in a sauce. Some cans even contain beans that are meant to be heated and eaten on their own. A quick check of the label should tell you which type of beans you have.


When in doubt about how to use canned beans, check the back of the label. Many will include sample recipes and serving suggestions.

, Plain canned beans usually come in a clear, slimy brine. This works well for keeping them fresh and it's perfectly safe to eat, but it can taste unpleasantly ""artificial."" All it takes to get rid of this gross substance is to pour the contents of the can into a strainer and rinse them with cold water for a few seconds.

, Canned beans come pre-cooked, so all you need to do is heat them up. If you're using plain beans that you've just rinsed, add a small amount of water to the container you're heating the beans in. If you're using beans in a sauce, you can usually just heat the beans in their liquid without any extra work. If you're using a microwave, be sure to heat the beans in a microwave-safe container like a ceramic or glass bowl (rather than a metal or plastic one).


If you're camping, you can cook a can of beans-in-sauce directly in its can. Simply open the top of the can and carefully place it over your campfire. This is easiest if your fire pit has a metal grate, but if it doesn't, you can just balance the can on a rock near the edge of the fire. Be careful — it will get very hot.

, Since canned beans are already cooked, it's easy to use them in other other recipes. If these recipes require cooking, add the beans at the end of the cooking process so they don't over-cook. For cold recipes, you can usually use canned beans as-is.



In the section below, you'll find a few recipe suggestions that you can use red kidney beans in. Except where noted, you can use cooked dry beans or plain canned beans interchangeably.

The protein and fiber in the beans pair with the carbohydrates in the rice to make a meal that's completely satisfying on its own. However, you can also serve with gumbo, jambalaya, or spicy sausage for a true Deep South feast!, This popular, spicy stew is perhaps the most famous recipe for using red kidney beans in the world. Traditionally served with meat (""con carne""), chili can be served in virtually endless ways. Try it with an assortment of veggies for a vegetarian treat or pair it with a serving of cornbread for a classic American frontier dish.


If you're using dry beans for this recipe, you'll want to cook them until they're most of the way done on their own, then transfer them to the chili pot with the liquid ingredients. This prevents them from over- or under- cooking. If you're using canned beans, add them near the end of the cooking process.

, Bean soup is delicious, nutritious, and easy to make — all you need are beans, water, and your favorite vegetables and seasonings to make a full-fledged meal. You can also add ham (or ham flavoring) for a classic combination, though sausage, chicken, beef, and other meats work just as well. There's no ""right"" way to make bean soup, so feel free to get creative! Here is a great recipe to get you started.If you're using dry beans, you can add the other ingredients to the pot the beans are cooking in as soon as they're most of the way cooked.
If you're looking for inspiration, a can of diced tomatoes makes a great addition to almost any bean soup. Plus, it will do wonders for the presentation, turning the greyish water to a pleasant brownish-orange.

, Have a few different types of canned beans handy? Drain them, wash them, and toss them together with a little olive oil and salt for a low-calorie salad that's also a great source of protein and fiber. You can try adding chopped red onions, tomatoes, and corn to add tangy flavor, but the great thing bean salad is that it's usually great on its own, too!

, Making a hummus-like bean dip out of red kidney beans is so easy it's criminal. Just add the beans with a little salt, pepper, and olive oil to a blender or food processor and pulse until you have a creamy spread.


If you're going for a more ""hummus-y"" taste, add a little tahini and lemon juice — these are essential ingredients in traditional hummus. Garnish with cayenne pepper and parsley before serving.

Boil water.,
Cook the ravioli.,
Stir the pot.,
Know when your ravioli is done.,
Drain the ravioli.",How to Cook Ravioli2," Fill a pot with 2–6 US quarts (2,000–6,000 ml) of cold water (per pound of pasta). Then, bring the water to a boil. Make sure that the pot is large enough to hold all of the pasta that you're making.Be sure to place a lid on the pot. This will help retain the steam—the heat and the moisture—and make the ravioli cook more quickly.
Most ravioli recipes call for 4–6 US quarts (4,000–6,000 ml) of water to each pound of ravioli. Extra water quickly recovers the boil when the pasta is added; gives the noodles room so that they don’t stick to one another; and dilutes the starch that they release, so they don’t end up with a “gluey” texture. Feel free to use less water, however, as long as there's enough to submerge the ravioli., Once the water begins to boil, put the ravioli into the pot. Follow the boiling instructions on the package. If there are no instructions on the package: cook at a boil for 4-6 minutes, or until the pasta begins to float. When a piece of pasta floats to the surface, it's ready.Salt the water to taste. As a rule of thumb, add one teaspoon of salt for each quart of water that you use. Consider adding olive oil to the water to keep the pasta from sticking: again, about a teaspoon of oil per quart of water.

, Use a ladle or stirring spoon to swirl the water periodically as the pasta cooks. Separate any ravioli dumplings that are sticking together.

, The ravioli should puff up and become whiter as the dough cooks. Some people like their pasta soft and fully-cooked. Other people like their pasta slightly harder and undercooked, or ""al dente"". Ravioli dough contains eggs, unless stated otherwise, so it is important to cook it thoroughly to avoid salmonella poisoning. Remember that larger ravioli will quick more slowly, and smaller ravioli will cook more quickly.If the ravioli begins to look bloated, or begins to come apart, then it may be slightly overcooked.
Taste your ravioli throughout the cooking process. This is the best way to tell when it's ready. Nibble on the edge of a ravioli piece to discern whether it's done. If the ravioli is still at all cold or frozen, keep cooking. If the ravioli tastes doughy or floury, it may not be done.

, If you have a colander or a pasta strainer, place it into the sink or any area that will allow the water to drain. Pour the contents of the pot—ravioli and water—into the strainer so that the water flows away, but the pasta remains. Pour slowly, and be careful not to lose any pasta.


If you don't have a pasta strainer, pour the water out of the pot while keeping the pasta within. Tilt the pot sideways so the water trickles out the top. Hold the lid of the pot over the opening to hold back the pasta. Leave a tiny crack between the lid and the rim of the pot so that the water can slip through, but the ravioli cannot.
Pour the water into the sink to dispose of it, or use it to water your garden. If you drain the pasta into another bowl or pot, you can carry the extra water outdoors and reuse it.

Let the ravioli cool.,
Serve ravioli with your favorite sauce.,
Consider food and drink pairings.",How to Cook Ravioli3," It should be ready to eat within five minutes. Eat it as soon as it doesn't burn your mouth. Place the ravioli into a large bowl, and serve!

, Common choices include tomato sauce, marinara, pesto, and alfredo. Consider heating the sauce in a saucepan for several minutes, on a low heat, before serving.


You can pour the sauce over the ravioli, or you can keep the sauce in a separate bowl. The latter option will allow each diner to portion their own sauce.

, Consider serving ravioli with cooked vegetables, chicken or fish, fresh bread, and an Italian wine. Have fun with it, and don't be afraid to make the meal a cultural experience!


Eat ravioli with a fork. Serve it with a ladle or a large spoon.

",How to Cook Pinto Beans1," Place in a colander and wash under a running tap.









Remove any obvious debris, such as small stones or twigs.
Remove any beans that don't look up to standard.;
, Pre-soaking the beans helps to break down the oligosaccharides that contribute to increased flatulence.Either slow or quick soak the pinto beans:









Quick soak: Place the pinto beans into a saucepan. Fill with 2-3 cups of water per 1 cup dried beans. Bring to the boil for 2 minutes. Remove from the heat, cover with the lid and let stand for 2 hours before cooking.
Slow soak: Add the beans to a saucepan and water, at a ratio of 2-3 cups water per 1 cup dried beans. Place the lid on the saucepan and put into the refrigerator to soak overnight (minimum 8 hours).

, Never cook beans in the water they've soaked in or you re-introduce the oligosaccharides that contribute to increased flatulence. Always drain the pre-soaked beans and use fresh water for cooking.









Equally important, never add seasonings or salt to the cooking beans. This can change the cooking time and can toughen the beans. Always add seasonings after the pinto beans have been cooked.

, Add either broth or water, at a ratio of 3 cups liquid to 1 cup dried beans. Add the beans, then pour over the water or broth. The liquid should cover the beans by 1-2 inches (2.5-5cm).








, Reduce to a gentle simmer. Cook for 1 1/2 to 2 1/2 hours. Check the water level frequently and top up if needed (always maintain the level of water above the beans). The beans may need an occasional stir with a wooden spoon.









The beans are ready when they're at a consistency suitable for mashing. Remove a bean and press it with a fork to see if it mashes well. If it does, the beans are ready.
Cooking time may vary depending on the size and age of the beans, the humidity and other unknowns. Generally, pinto beans require at least 1 1/2 hours and can even take up to 4 hours to fully cook.

Try other navy bean recipes.",How to Cook Navy Beans," Mixed in with your dry navy beans may be stones or discolored kernels . Discoloration is usually a sign that the bean isn't fit for consumption, so you should remove these along with stones from the good beans.Canned navy beans can be prepared more easily than dry beans. You'll only have to cook these lightly for a short time with your ingredients and then the beans will be ready for eating.For the purposes of providing a guided example, the process of making navy beans on the stove top is provided. However, you may find making your beans in a slow cooker to be a preferred method.;
, Get a large pot or bowl and place the good beans inside of it. Then run cold water over the beans to remove any impurities or bacteria from the surface of the beans. When you've finished this, you can use a strainer to remove the dirty water from the beans in your bowl/pot., Put your rinsed beans back into the bowl/pot and cover them completely with cold water. For every pound (.45 kg) of beans, you should use eight cups of cold water. Then allow the beans to soak for a minimum of eight hours or overnight.









When you soak navy beans, enzymes inside the bean are broken down. This will decrease gas., First you'll need to strain your beans from the cold water they've been soaking in. Then put the beans into a pot and cover them with six cups of hot water for every pound (.45 kg) of beans. Turn on your stove and bring the water to a boil and then simmer the beans for 1.5 to 2 hours.









You can adjust the time you simmer your beans to adjust the tenderness of your beans. Shorter simmer times will yield firmer beans, longer times will result in more tender beans.
While simmering, it's likely a foam will form on the top of your water. Add 1 - 2 tablespoons of butter or olive oil to the water to cut down on foam.
Wait until the beans are completely cooked before adding any salt. Adding salt earlier interferes with the re-hydration process and can result in ""tough"" beans., Use a sharpened knife to cut a small onion, stalk of celery, several cloves of garlic, and tomatoes. These will be used to give flavor and variety in your simple navy bean dish. You can cut up these ingredients very finely to create a smoother consistency, or you could leave larger pieces for a chunkier end result.


Roma tomatoes or cherry tomatoes work well in this dish. Heirloom tomatoes can add a delicious, rich flavor to it., All you need is a few slices for your dish, though if you're a fan of this kind of meat, you can always add more. If you're not a fan of pancetta or bacon, you could add chopped chicken or sausage.









Whatever meat you add, be sure you saute it until it is cooked throughout. Thicker, chunkier pieces of meat will require more time than thin pieces.
Continue cooking your ingredients, lowering the heat if necessary, until the onions and bacon are well browned., Coat your saucepan with a thin layer of olive oil. Then turn on your stove top and set it to a medium-high heat. Add your onion, celery, and garlic to the pan and allow the ingredients to cook for 3 - 5 minutes.








If you notice your garlic start to brown, turn your heat down or begin the next phase of this dish. When cooked too long/burned, garlic can become bitter.

, These will cook down in the heat of your pan. The tomato juice and flavor will also infuse through the rest of your dish. You can also create more nuanced flavors by adding spices and seasonings, like rosemary or thyme., By cooking your beans with your ingredients, the beans will take on the flavor of the dish. This will only take about a minute or so. After a minute has passed, if you want to further tenderize your beans, you should add enough water to cover the beans with at least an inch (2.5 cm) of water.You can add as many or as few beans as you desire to this dish.

, If your beans are already cooked to your desired tenderness, you might not want to re-simmer the beans with the ingredients for very long. However, for further tenderness, you should first bring your ingredients to a boil. Then lower the heat until the mixture is at a simmer and allow it to simmer until the beans are tender.








During this process, you may need to add water to the mixture if you notice it getting too low., When the beans are tender they are ready to serve. You may want to add some accents to the dish to improve its presentation. You can do this by topping it with some freshly chopped parsley, or even a sprig of parsley.

, There are many ways you can prepare your navy beans. With 15 minutes of prep time and about 4½ hours of slow simmering, you could make homemade navy bean soup.Pork is a popular accent meat for navy beans, and you might consider making ham hocks with your navy beans in a slow cooker.Many recipes are available online for free.

This may result in fluffier rice, although some milling processes leave little excess starch to remove.If you don't have a strainer, simply tilt the saucepan carefully so only the water drains, using a wooden spoon if necessary to keep the rice in.

, Some people prefer to soak the rice beforehand to reduce cooking time and improve the texture, but you can skip this step and still achieve an excellent result.


Use twice as much water as rice by volume and soak for 20 minutes. Drain the water afterward.

, Use twice as much water as rice by volume or slightly more.


Optionally, add salt and oil for flavor.

For the best results, soak beans in a pot full of cool water overnight at room temperature.It's a good idea to sort through the beans before hand and rinse them off, to remove any dust, sediment, or tiny pebbles that might have gotten mixed in. Rinsing them in a colander is usually fine.
Without soaking and cooking thoroughly, kidney beans contain phytohaemagglutinin, also known as kidney bean lectin, which causes gastric distress.To avoid this, they need to be cooked at least 30 minutes, at boiling.If you don't have the time to soak beans overnight, you can also do the speed-up method. Bring dry beans to a boil, then turn off the heat and let them soak for about 2-3 hours. Discard the soaking water and cook normally.;
, Beans are probably most commonly cooked by boiling them in a pot of clean water, on the stove top, for a few hours. There are a variety of ways to cook beans, however, depending on what you have available.


Another traditional and speedy method is cooking kidney beans in a pressure cooker. Soak the beans normally and lock the lid in place, then follow the instructions for your particular pressure cooker.
Canned kidney beans do not need to be cooked. You can add them into any recipe that calls for beans without cooking them.

, After soaking the beans, rinse them thoroughly in fresh water and cover the beans with enough clean water to cover them by approximately 2-3 inches. Then, cover the pot and bring the water up to a boil, immediately lowering the temperature and uncovering the pot when the water starts to boil. Cook beans at a very gentle simmer. You want a pot of beans to barely be moving, so they'll cook evenly and as thoroughly as possible.


Cook the pot with the lid on, but slightly ajar, if you want a creamy pot of beans, and cook uncovered for firmer beans.
Check the beans after 45 minutes, pulling a few out and squeezing them between your fingers, or try to chew one. After a while, they should be soft and creamy. When they've reached the desired consistency, remove them from the heat.
Stir the beans periodically to turn them over, ensuring that they'll cook evenly and thoroughly, and make sure the level of the water stays above the level of the beans as much as possible.
Beans cooked a rolling boil will cook, but they'll split very quickly and become mushier and mealier than beans cooked more slowly and more gently. If you want, you can continue cooking beans for as long as you want, to get the texture you're looking for. Mushy beans are great for dips, curries, and lots of other dishes.

, As kidney beans cook, you'll notice a grayish-reddish foam start to appear on the top of the pot. That's the lectin cooking off, and the best thing to do with it is periodically skim it off with a spoon and discard it by rinsing it down the drain.

, It's very important to cook dried beans unsalted, or the beans will take much longer to cook, and might not actually cook at all. While some varieties of beans will take longer than others, some varieties (like garbanzo beans) will never get fully cooked if they're cooked in salted water.


At any point in the cooking process, you can add chopped aromatic vegetables. If your recipe eventually calls for onion, garlic, carrots, or other vegetables, you can add them to soften them up at any time. If you'd like the vegetables firmer, add them later in the cooking process. Softer, add them earlier.
It's also common to add a ham hock or a pork bone of some type to a pot of beans, for added flavor. This is especially common for rice and beans, described in the next section.

, Beans are somewhat variable in their cooking time. It's usually common to have to add a little bit of water while the beans simmer away, to keep them cooking evenly. This may result in there being some water left over when the beans are done.


The general rule of thumb is to add three cups of water for every cup of dry beans you add to the pot. This should theoretically end with a pot of cooked beans and no water.
It's also common to save most of the liquid in the pot, which can make for a nice gravy. Depending on what you're making with the beans, you won't always have to strain it.

, Red beans and rice are a classic Cajun dish that's spicy, hearty, and cheap to make. It's perfect for all kinds of add-ins as well, meaning that it's an easy recipe to tweak for your tastes. For a basic version:


Sauté one small minced red onion, two cloves of garlic, two celery stalks, and a chopped bell pepper in a pot with some olive oil. Stir in about a pound of cooked kidney beans. Alternatively, you could add these vegetables to the kidney beans while they're cooking, as described above.
To this mixture, add 2.5 cups of water, a cup of white rice, and one ham hock, if desired. Bring the mixture to a boil, reduce the heat to low, and simmer for 20 minutes, covered, until the rice is done. Season with salt, pepper, cayenne, and hot sauce, to taste. Garnish with chopped cilantro.

, Kidney beans make for an excellent and simple chilled salad, which is a great side at any barbecue or cookout. After cooking kidney beans ahead of time, try the following bean salad recipe:


Mix one cup of kidney beans with one cup of garbanzo beans, one cup of black beans, a cup of chopped bell pepper, and a half cup of chopped green onion.
Dress the beans in three tablespoons of red wine vinegar, two tablespoons of olive oil, a teaspoon of sugar, a teaspoon of lemon juice, and salt and pepper to taste. Let sit in the refrigerator overnight, then mix thoroughly, and serve cold.
Any oil-based commercial salad dressing would make for a fine substitution for the vinegar and olive oil, if you prefer. Italian salad dressing works nicely.

, As you cook a pot of kidney beans, add onions, garlic, and other aromatic vegetables to start the base for this delicious and simple Indian recipe. Rajma is a staple, commonly served with roti or other flat breads. After cooking a pot of kidney beans, in a separate pan:


Sautee a minced white onion, three cloves of garlic, and a one-inch piece of grated ginger in some ghee. To this, add three small tomatoes, chopped, a teaspoon of cumin seeds, and a tablespoon of ground coriander, a half teaspoon of turmeric powder, and a teaspoon of red chili powder.
Add your kidney beans directly into the tomato base. Add 2-3 cups of water, or use the liquid from the cooked beans to help thicken. Cook over low heat, uncovered, for 30-40 minutes. Season with salt, pepper, and a teaspoon of garam masala. Serve with rice, roti, or naan, and top with chopped cilantro and lime.

, A super-common use kidney beans in the United States is to use them in a chili. Whatever variety of chili you favor, kidney beans make a wonderful addition (except in Texas, where it's frowned upon). To make a basic chili:


Brown one pound of lean ground beef in a pot, adding one minced white onion, three cloves of minced garlic, and 3-4 tablespoons of red chili powder. Cover with 3-4 cups of water, and add 2 cups of cooked kidney beans. Simmer on low, uncovered, for 1-2 hours. Salt, pepper, and hot sauce to taste.
Other good additions include garbanzos, black beans, corn, and macaroni noodles. Chili goes well with tortillas, corn bread, and baked potatoes.

, Basic vegetable soup can be lived up with the addition of kidney beans. If you're trying to make a supper that'll clear out the cabinet, a vegetable soup is a great option, and one that you can whip up with a variety of ingredients. For a basic version, try this:


In a pot, Sauté a minced onion and some garlic in olive oil. Add 1-2 chopped carrots, and a cup of chopped white potato. Add 2-3 cups of chicken/vegetable stock, or water, and simmer. Add whatever vegetables you have on hand: canned, frozen or fresh green beans, corn, and a cup of kidney beans. Season with chopped basil, salt, and pepper to taste.

, Salted and spiced with a bit of cayenne pepper, kidney beans make for a nice side dish all on their own. Kidney beans are high in Vitamin C, folate, fiber, potassium and protein.Need a quick meal? Cook up a pot of beans and a pan of corn bread. Easy and tasty.

Drain and rinse the chickpeas.,
Cover the chickpeas with fresh water in a large saucepan.,
Simmer the chickpeas until softened: by setting the saucepan on your stove and bringing it to a boil over medium-high heat.,
Drain, rinse, and use as desired.",How to Cook Chickpeas1," Place the chickpeas in a large saucepan or stockpot and pour cold water over them. The water should cover the chickpeas by 3 to 4 inches (7.6 to 10 cm).


As the chickpeas absorb the water, you may need to add more. In fact, chickpeas can nearly double in size, so you may end up needing twice as much water as you have chickpeas.
Soaking is important for two main reasons. First, soaking dried chickpeas softens them, thereby cutting down the amount of time they need to cook. Second, the soaking process breaks down many of the gas-inducing sugars in the beans, thereby making them easier to digest.;
, Stir 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of baking soda into the water until it dissolves.


Baking soda is not strictly necessary, but it can be beneficial. The molecules in baking soda attach themselves to gas-inducing sugars in the chickpeas known as oligosaccharides. By binding to these sugars, baking soda can break them down and partially remove that gut felt odorous, gas producer from the structure of the chickpea.
On the other hand, baking soda can leave behind a salty, soapy flavor in large amounts, so if you decide to use it, you should only use a little.

, The chickpeas should soak in the cold water for at least 8 hours.


Cover the pot of chickpeas with a clean dish towel or lid as they soak. You can leave them out at room temperature; refrigeration is not needed.

, If you only have an hour or so to work with, you can soak the chickpeas faster by rapidly boiling the beans in a stockpot of hot water.Place the chickpeas in a stockpot or large saucepan and cover with 3 to 4 inches (7.6 to 10 cm) of water.
Bring the contents of the pot to a boil over high heat on the stove. Let them continue boiling rapidly for 5 minutes, with baking soda included.
Remove the pot of chickpeas from the heat, cover loosely, and let the chickpeas soak in the hot water for a full 1 hour.

, Pour the water and chickpeas through a strainer to separate them. Rinse the chickpeas for 30 to 60 seconds under running water while in the strainer, gently sifting them so that all the chickpeas get washed with the water.


Any dirt or debris in the soaking water can adhere to the chickpea skin as the chickpeas soak, so it is important to drain the water and rinse the chickpeas well. The sugars that broke down into the water can still cling to the sides of the chickpeas, too, which is another important reason to dump the water and rinse the beans.
Rinsing the chickpeas can also help remove the aftertaste left behind by baking soda.

, Transfer the chickpeas to a clean saucepan or stockpot and fill the pan with enough water to cover the beans.


If you want to make the beans more flavorful, add about 1/4 tsp (1.25 ml) of salt to the contents of the saucepan for every 2 qt (2 L) of water used. The beans can draw the salt in as they cook, thereby flavoring the inside of the chickpea as well as the outside.
As a general guideline, use about 1 qt (1 L) of water for every 1 cup (250 ml) of soaked beans.

, Then reducing the heat to medium or medium-low, until the water simmers, then simmering in water for 1 to 2 hours.


For dishes that require firm beans, like stews and soups, only cook the beans for about 1 hour. For dishes that require softer beans, like hummus, cook for about 1 1/2 to 2 hours.

, Once finished, pour the chickpeas and water through a strainer and rinse the beans, still inside the strainer, under running water for 30 to 60 seconds. Serve immediately, add to a recipe calling for chickpeas, or save for another time.

Place the ingredients in a small slow cooker.,
Cover and cook until soft.,
Drain and rinse well.,
Serve or use as desired.",How to Cook Chickpeas2," Place the chickpeas in a strainer and rinse them for 30 to 60 seconds under cold running water.


By rinsing the chickpeas now, you clean off any surface debris or dirt clinging to the dried beans. This is also a good chance to pick out any small stones or dark brown chickpeas that accidentally got mixed into the batch.

, Combine the water, chickpeas, and baking soda in a 2 1/2 qt (2.5 L) slow cooker, stirring slightly to make sure that the baking soda is evenly dispersed and that the chickpeas are all submerged under the water.


Note that a pre-soaking is not needed when you cook the chickpeas in a slow cooker. Since the chickpeas will cook so slowly, they do not need to be softened beforehand.
The use of baking soda is still recommended, however. Since you are skipping the pre-soaking step here, the sugars do not have the same opportunity to break down as they do with the traditional boiling method. The use of baking soda, which helps break apart gas-inducing sugars, can make the chickpeas a bit easier to digest once finished.
If you decide not to use the baking soda, you can add 1 tsp (5 ml) of salt to the water, instead. The salt will not break apart the sugar, but it will add more flavor to the chickpeas, which will absorb the grains of salt as they take in water. As a result, the inside of the chickpeas will be seasoned as well as the outside.

, Cook on high heat for 4 hours or low heat for 8 to 9 hours.If you want slightly firmer beans, cook them on high for only 2 to 3 hours., Dump the contents of the slow cooker into a strainer to separate the water from the beans. Rinse the beans, still inside the strainer, under running water for 30 to 60 seconds.


The water the beans cooked in can contain a lot of dirt and stripped sugars, so it needs to be dumped out. The chickpeas must also be rinsed since some of the debris in the water can end up clinging to the surface of the chickpeas.

, You can use the chickpeas immediately, add them to a recipe calling for the bean, or save them for another time. Any recipe that calls for boiled chickpeas can use slow cooker chickpeas, though.


Note that slow cooked chickpeas tend to be very tender, so you might be better off using them in a recipe that calls for soft, tender chickpeas rather than one requiring firmer beans.

You could also grease the baking sheet with shortening or cover it with a layer of aluminum foil or parchment paper.

, Pour the contents of the can through a strainer to separate out the liquid. Rinse the chickpeas, still in the strainer, under running water for 30 to 60 seconds.


You could also drain the liquid from the beans using the lid of the can. Partially crack the lid open just enough so that liquid can escape but chickpeas cannot. Tip the can over a sink and let the liquid drain out through this gap. Drain out as much liquid as possible before opening the lid all the way.
You can also add water to the drained can and swish it around to help rinse the beans. Place the lid over the can so that there is a small gap and pour out the rinsing water through this gap. Note, however, that proper rinsing through a strainer is still the recommended method.

, Lay the chickpeas out in between two layers of clean paper towels. Gently roll the chickpeas around with the top paper towel to remove any remaining, excess water and to peel off loose skins.


Be careful as you press on the chickpeas, however, since you do not want to accidentally crush them by using too much force.

, Dump the chickpeas into a medium mixing bowl and drizzle the olive oil over them. Gently toss the chickpeas around with a mixing spoon or clean hands to coat them all in the oil.


The oil will add flavor to the chickpeas, but it will also help them to develop a pleasant color and texture while roasting in the oven.

, Transfer the coated chickpeas to the baking sheet, spreading them out in a single, even layer.


Make sure that the chickpeas are kept in a single layer. The beans need equal exposure to the heating elements in order to cook evenly.

, This should take about 30 to 40 minutes in your preheated oven.Pay close attention to the chickpeas as they cook so that you can remove them if they appear to be burning.

, Sprinkle the salt and garlic powder over the toasted chickpeas and toss them gently with a flat spatula to coat evenly. Serve and enjoy as a healthy snack.


You can experiment with other spices and spice mixes, as well. For instance, you can season the chickpeas with paprika, chile powder, curry powder, garam masala, or even cinnamon.

Make sure that the strainer is made from very fine mesh. If the gaps between the wires are too large, you could end up losing an unfortunate amount of rice as you rinse it.
Note that you may not always need to rinse the rice, and this is somewhat of an outdated practice. Rinsing is a cleaning process and is a necessary step if you suspect that the rice has been imported or handled roughly in bulk storage. If the rice is a fortified, domestic product, however, you probably will not need to worry about rinsing it.;
,


You can soak the rice up to 3 hours, if desired, but 45 minutes will often be enough.
If you prefer a more flavorful rice, you could substitute some or all of the water with chicken broth or vegetable broth. Substitute the broth in equal amounts for the water.
Soaking is beneficial because it reduces the stickiness of the rice. It also helps the rice expand into long, thin grains.

, Sprinkle the soaked rice with salt, if desired, to draw out more flavor from the rice as it cooks.


Give the contents of the rice cooker a quick stir with a wooden mixing spoon to distribute the salt more evenly.

, If your rice cooker has a brown rice setting, use that. If it only has a timer, set the timer for 30 minutes.


The rice cooker must remain covered for the duration of the cooking process.
Check the rice after the first 30 minutes. If the grains still seem tough and the content of the basin are still somewhat soupy, cover and set the timer for another 10 minutes.
Understand that each rice cooker varies by make and model. In order to cook the rice as best as possible, you need to read the instructions that come with your rice cooker and set the timer and other settings according to what you read there.

, After the timer goes off, let the rice stand for another 5 to 10 minutes so that it absorbs any remaining water in the basin.Leave the cover on as the rice continues to sit.

, If you want to flavor the cooked rice, you could add about 2 Tbsp (30 ml) of butter or margarine or 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of soy sauce. Stir well to coat the rice evenly.


You could also wait until after you place the rice in serving dishes before seasoning it. That way, everyone can season the rice according to his or her own tastes.

, Transfer the rice to serving dishes or set it aside for use in other recipes that call for cooked brown rice.

Note that you may not always need to rinse the rice, and this is somewhat of an outdated practice. Rinsing is a cleaning process and is a necessary step if you suspect that the rice has been imported or handled roughly in bulk storage. If the rice is a fortified, domestic product, however, you probably will not need to worry about rinsing it.

, Transfer the rice to your rice cooker and let it soak for about 45 minutes in 2 2/3 cups (580 ml) warm water.


Soaking is beneficial because it reduces the stickiness of the rice. It also helps the rice expand into long, thin grains.
You can soak the rice up to 3 hours, if desired, but 45 minutes will often be enough.

, As the rice soaks, add the quinoa to a fine mesh strainer and rinse for 30 to 60 seconds under room temperature running water.


While rinsing rice does little more than clean it, rinsing quinoa has added benefits. Rinsing the grain removes a protective coating known as “saponin.” This coating can cause the grain to have a bitter flavor note, so removing it prevents much of this bitterness from coming through.
As with rice, you need to make sure that the strainer you use is made from a fine mesh to prevent the grains from falling out as you rinse them.

, Stir into the water and rice so that the grains of quinoa and grains of brown rice are evenly distributed throughout.


Both the quinoa and the rice grains should be submerged under the water in the rice cooker basin.

, If your rice cooker has a brown rice setting, use that. If it only has a timer, set the timer for 30 minutes.Cover the rice cooker before starting it and leave that cover on for the duration of the cooking process.

Soaking is not necessary for making brown rice porridge. Since the cooking time is already lengthy, soaking the rice will not make much noticeable difference in the amount of time it takes. Moreover, rice porridge needs to hold together, so removing the starches that cause stickiness through soaking will not be of any benefit.
If you prefer a more flavorful rice porridge, you could substitute some or all of the water with chicken broth or vegetable broth in equal amounts. The broth works well for the recipe suggested here, but if you plan to add sweet garnishes like dried apricots or raisins, water is still your best option.

, If your rice cooker has a porridge setting, use that. If it only has a timer, set the timer for 6 to 8 hours.


The rice cooker must be covered throughout the entire cooking process. Some high-tech rice cookers will not even let you set the timer if the machine senses that the lid is open.
If you plan to serve the rice porridge in the morning, throw the rice and water into the rice cooker before going to bed and let it cook overnight. It should be ready by the morning.
Know that each rice cooker varies by make and model. Some have specific settings for porridge while others do not. Regardless of the rice cooker you use, follow the instructions meant for your particular machine to determine the accurate way to set it and cook the rice porridge.

, Pour the oil into a large skillet and heat over medium-high heat until the oil becomes glossy.


If you do not want to add any of the optional vegetables, this step is not necessary.

, Add the vegetables to the skillet and cook for about 3 to 4 minutes, or until the mushrooms and carrots are tender-crisp and the garlic is fragrant.


Stir the vegetables continually with a wooden spoon or heat-resistant spatula.

, Once the porridge has finished cooking, open the rice cooker and add the cooked vegetables. Stir well so that the vegetables are evenly distributed throughout the porridge.


You may want to consider draining the oil from your skillet before adding the vegetables. Doing so will make the dish healthier, but letting the oil remain could add extra flavor to the porridge.

, Spoon the brown rice porridge out into serving dishes and garnish with soy sauce, chopped green onions, or hard-boiled egg slices, if desired.


Divide the eggs into halves and give each of the four servings a half an egg.
If you would prefer a sweeter rice porridge, you could skip the above-mentioned stir-ins and toppings and garnish the porridge with honey, dried apricots, or raisins, instead.

Rinsing the black-eyed peas removes dirt and stray hulls.;
, Make sure that the water covers the black-eyed peas completely, but do not fill the pot so high that it will boil over when heated. Cover with the lid of the pot.

, Heat the beans and water over medium-high heat until the water reaches a steady boil. Continue boiling for 2 to 3 minutes.


Most beans are soaked in cold water for several hours, but black-eyed peas can be soaked in hot water to reduce the amount of time it takes.It is not essential to soak your black-eyed peas, so this step can be skipped if you are short on time. Soaking the beans causes them to become softer, however, and it also helps to reduce the risk of digestive upset.

, Allow the black-eyed peas to sit in the warm water for 60 to 90 minutes.

, Pour the contents of the pot through a colander to remove the stale water. Rinse the black-eyed peas once more with cool water.

, For the most traditional flavor, use salty country ham.


Black-eyed peas can technically be prepared using nothing more than salt and water. The taste of the beans can be rather dull on their own, however, and it is more traditional to prepare them with pork and certain vegetables.
Smoked ham steak makes a good choice when cooking black-eyed peas using the alternative slow cooker method. A ham bone works, as well.
Use a sweetened ham, like a honey-baked ham, if you want a sweeter taste.
Bacon or pancetta are also popular choices to use when preparing black-eyed peas.

, The vegetables should be chopped into small pieces with a sharp kitchen knife.


Give the onions a rough chop until the pieces are roughly 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) in size. Use a tangier variety, like a white onion or yellow onion, for a heartier taste. Use a sweet onion variety, like a Vidalia onion, for a milder, sweeter taste. You could also use 1/4 cup (120 ml) dried minced onion flakes instead of the whole onions to save time.
Dice the tomatoes into 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) chunks, saving the juice. To save time, you can also use a 12-oz (375 ml) can of diced tomatoes. For a spicier twist, select a can a diced tomatoes with chopped green chili peppers.Place the garlic on your cutting board with the broad, dull side of the knife blade held against it. Carefully yet forcefully smack the knife down to break open the garlic and remove the skin. The garlic can be used this way, or you can also mince the garlic into fine pieces with a knife. Alternatively, you can use 1/4 tsp (1.25 ml) of garlic powder, instead.

, Heat the oil in a large stockpot over medium-high heat. Add the ham and cook for 4 minutes or until the edges begin to crisp up, stirring frequently.


This step is only optional. You can prepare the beans without crisping up the pork first.

, Add the pre-soaked black-eyed peas to the same stockpot you used to cook the ham. Stir the beans into the ham to coat with the flavored grease., Stir the ingredients together until thoroughly mixed.

, Use cold water.


There should be just enough water to cover the beans and vegetables, and the water level should not extend past three-quarters of the stockpot's height. The 4-cup (1-liter) measurement is merely an estimate.
If you did not pre-soak the beans, you will need to use twice as much water.

, Place the cover over the stockpot and heat the contents of the pot over medium-high to high heat, until the water begins to boil. Cook for 10 minutes.


Leave the lid slightly ajar to allow steam to escape slowly. Doing so relieves pressure inside the pot, lessening the odds of the water boiling over and creating a mess.

, Turn the heat down to medium so that the rapid boil slows to a steady simmer. Cook for an additional 1 to 2 hours.


You may not need to add more water. If the water level dips below the black-eyed peas, though, add another 1 cup (250 ml) of warm water.
Once the beans are done, they should have a soft, creamy taste, and the juice should be flavorful rather than watery. If the beans lose their shape, however, they have been overcooked.
Taste the beans after the first hour. If they are not done, continue checking every half hour after that.

, After the beans have finished cooking, remove the stockpot from the heat and add any salt and pepper you want. Stir the beans to thoroughly incorporate the salt and pepper.


Roughly 1/4 tsp (1.25 ml) of black pepper should suffice, but you can add more or less depending on how hot you prefer things.
If you used salted ham, additional salt may not be necessary. For low-sodium hams, however, you may wish to add 1/4 tsp (1.25 ml) or so.

, Fish out the bay leaves before pouring the beans into individual serving dishes using a ladle.

, Soak the black-eyed peas and chop up the vegetables.

, Toss the black-eyed peas, tomatoes, onions, garlic, ham, and bay leaves into the slow cooker. Add salt and pepper, if desired. Cover and cook on high for 90 minutesor on low for 3 hours.

, Turn off the slow cooker and dig out the bay leaves. Serve the black-eyed peas while still hot.

Serve the Chinese rice.",How to Cook Chinese Rice," Measure out the amount of rice you would like to use with a measuring cup. Place the rice in a bowl or saucepan and place the it in your sink. Run cool water over the rice until it is one inch above the rice line. Stir the rice with your hand or a wooden spoon. Drain the water from the saucepan and repeat until the water is clear., If you did not already use a saucepan to rinse the rice, add the rice to a 3-quart saucepan. It should be large enough to accommodate the rice plus double the amount of water. For example, if you measured out one cup of rice, you will use two cups of water. If you used three cups of rice, you will use six cups of water, and so on.

, Stir occasionally as you wait for the rice to boil. Once it boils, turn the heat down to the lowest heat possible and cover the pan with a lid.

, There is no need to stir or open the lid. Doing so will allow steam to escape, thus affecting how well the rice will cook. Check the rice sparingly or use a pan with a clear lid to check its progress., Once the 10-15 minutes are up, open the lid and use a fork to fluff up the rice. Place the cooked rice in a bowl until you are ready to use it later.

, Chinese rice generally uses white onion, as it has a mild flavor that blends well with rest of the ingredients. Grab a cutting board and sharp chef’s knife to cut up your vegetables. When you are finished chopping the onions, set them aside to use later.


Slice half an inch off the top of the onion and discard it.
Rest the onion on the flat surface you just created and cut it in half vertically.
Peel and discard the papery skin. You may also discard the outer layer if need be.
Lay the onion half flat on the cutting board and hold the root end, which will face away from you. Make vertical cuts into the onion, taking care to leave half an inch near the root. You can make the cuts wider since Chinese rice generally uses larger bits of onion.
Rotate the onion and begin cutting through it again, perpendicular to the first lines you sliced. As you cut, you will see that the pieces are perfectly chopped and the root end is holding the slices intact, thus making chopping easier. When you get close to the root end, simply discard it., It is important use red bell peppers, as they have a distinct flavor profile that resonates well with fried rice. Rinse off your cutting board and grab your chef’s knife to begin cutting the red bell peppers that will be added to your rice.


Cut off the top of the pepper. Pull out the seeds and the fibrous white bits.
Lay the pepper on the cutting board with the cut top down. Slice through the middle.
Cut the pepper into thin strips lengthwise. You can make these strips about half an inch thick for Chinese rice or whatever is your preference., If you would like to add broccoli to your Chinese rice, you may need to saute it in a pan until it is slightly soft. Broccoli takes a bit longer to cook than onions and peppers. This will ensure that the broccoli is soft when you are ready to cook with it and that your other vegetables won’t burn while you wait for it to soften.


Place a skillet on medium heat. Add enough vegetable oil so that it lightly coats the bottom of the pan. Avoid using more than what will simply coat the surface of the pan.
Add broccoli and stir occasionally with a wooden spoon. When it has softened a bit, add to a bowl and set aside.

, Set the bowl aside until you are ready to begin sauteing them.

, Combine 4 eggs, ¼ cup of milk, either full fat milk or 2% (it will thicken the mixture more effectively than skim milk), and salt into a small or medium-sized bowl. Use a fork or whisk to beat the mixture until it is blended and smooth. Adding milk is optional. This is suggested for thickening the mixture but is not necessary. , Place a medium to large size skillet on the stove and turn the heat to medium. Let the butter melt as the skillet heats up., Allow the eggs to set until you can see that the bottom of the mixture is a bit more solid. Use a wooden spoon to break up the mixture into pieces and stir the eggs around.

, The eggs will no longer be runny when they are finished cooking. After they have cooked, scoop them into a bowl and set it aside.

, You do not want it to be too hot or else you will burn your ingredients before it has a chance to cook.

, A wok is the best choice for cooking Chinese rice since its curved shape and high sides allow food to be cooked more evenly. This is because any food that takes longer to cook can go at the bottom of the wok where it is the hottest before adding the rest of the food that doesn’t take as long to cook., If you’re using a wok, you won’t need to use as much oil. A skillet will require more oil, as it has a wider surface at the bottom compared to a wok.

, As the wok or skillet is heating up, add onions, peppers and broccoli. Stir the vegetables frequently so that they do not end up burning.

, After the vegetables have been browning for about two minutes, add the eggs and rice. Stir it around as soon as you add it and stir the mixture frequently.

, After you have poured the rice in the pan, pour about 1/2 a cup of soy sauce and mix everything up. You may need to adjust how much soy sauce you add depending on the amount of rice you used and your taste preferences. Generally speaking, you may add a quarter cup of soy sauce for every cup of cooked rice you are adding to the pan.

, Keep mixing everything together until you see that the rice has gone from white to a brownish color, due to the use of soy sauce, and that the onions and peppers have fully cooked.

, Some people put it into a small round bowl, then flip the bowl upside-down onto the plate so the rice is served in a neat mound. You can serve this dish with either a fork or chopsticks, which can be found at grocery stores. Try serving Chinese rice with stir-fried vegetables or cooked chicken.

",How to Cook Cheese Rice," Start by placing the stock into a large saucepan and heat it on medium–high heat. For this recipe, you can use plain water, or the stock of your choice, such as:


Vegetable
Beef
Chicken or turkey
Mushroom;
, Add the rice to the pot as well, and continue cooking over medium–high heat. Bring the rice to a boil, then turn down the heat to low. Cook the rice for an additional 18 to 20 minutes on a low simmer.The best rice for this dish is Arborio, because it becomes creamy when it’s cooked.When you're cooking rice, you don’t have to wait for the stock to boil before adding the rice.

, Grate the cheese with a cheese grater. If you don’t have a grater, you can also cut the cheese into half-inch (1.3-cm) cubes. Keep the cubes small so they melt easily.


You can use any type of cheese you like for this dish, but a mild cheese like mozzarella might get lost in the rice flavor.
Good cheese choices for this dish include sharp cheddar, aged gouda, and blue cheese.
Alternatively, you can also use 4 to 8 ounces (113.25 to 226.5 g) of Velveeta, cut into small cubes., When the rice is ready, remove it from the heat. Stir in the cheese until it melts. Add salt and pepper to taste before serving. You can also add 1 teaspoon of parsley for extra flavor.For a Tex-Mex variation on basic cheese and rice, you can also add ½ cup (226.5 g) of warm salsa after the cheese has melted.This cheesy side dish will serve four people., Preheat the oven to 350 F (177 C). Grease the bottom of a glass baking dish with cooking spray or vegetable shortening. A 9-by-13-inch baking dish will work best.

, Place the water and rice into a large saucepan. Put on the lid and heat over medium heat. Bring the rice to a boil, then turn the heat down to low. Simmer the rice on low for 18 minutes, then remove it from the heat.There are many types of rice you can use for this dish, including long- or short-grain, and white, brown, or basmati rice.

, Place 1 tablespoon (14 g) of butter in a large skillet and heat it over medium–high heat. When the butter is melted, add the onion. Cook the onion for two to three minutes, stirring occasionally, until it becomes soft.You can also use margarine or cooking oil instead of butter.
For a meatier and more flavorful variation, you can add in 1 cup (110 g) of chopped mushrooms and one or two cloves of minced garlic in with the onions as well., When the onion is ready, add the cheese, the can of soup, the milk, and the pepper. Continue cooking on medium–high heat, stirring constantly, until the cheese has melted.


Instead of Velveeta, you can use 2 cups (250 g) of grated sharp cheddar cheese, or another cheese of your choice.Condensed cream of chicken soup can be used in place of the mushroom., Pour the sauce and broccoli into the saucepan with the rice, and stir to combine. Transfer the mixture to the greased baking dish.


To change the flavor and add more nutrients, you can also add two to three chopped celery stalks along with the broccoli.If you're using frozen broccoli, thaw it out before adding it to the rice.

, Melt the remaining tablespoon (14 g) of butter and drizzle it over the breadcrumbs. Stir the breadcrumbs to incorporate the butter, then sprinkle it over the casserole.

, Place the baking dish into the oven and bake the casserole, uncovered, until the breadcrumbs are a light golden brown, about 30 to 35 minutes.Let the casserole rest for five to 10 minutes before serving.

, Pour the stock into a medium saucepan and heat it over medium–high heat. Bring the stock to a boil, then turn down the heat so that it stops simmering, but continues to stay hot. You want the stock hot enough to continue steaming. For this recipe, you can use vegetable, mushroom, beef, chicken, or clam stock.

, Pour the oil into a Dutch oven and heat it over medium–low heat. Stir in the onions and cook them for about two minutes, until they're soft. Stir in the garlic and cook the mixture for another 30 seconds.Instead of onion, you can use 1 cup (160 g) of chopped shallots.

, Pour the rice into the onion and garlic mixture and stir to coat the rice. Then let the rice cook, without liquid, until the kernels start to pop and crackle.It will take about one to two minutes for the rice to start crackling.

, Add ½ cup of stock, along with a splash of wine. Cook the rice until all the stock has been absorbed before adding more liquid.


Continue cooking the rice in this way, by adding a half-cup of stock and a splash of wine at a time. This will take about 30 minutes. Remove the rice from the heat once it’s cooked and all the liquid has been incorporated.
It’s important to cook Arborio rice in this way because it helps the rice release its starches, giving it a creaminess and smoothness that’s characteristic of risotto., Only stir in ¾ cups of the cheese right now, and reserve the remaining ¼ cup. Stir to combine, and add more pepper and salt to taste if necessary.

, Divide the risotto into eight portions for a side dish or four portions as a main meal.Sprinkle each portion with cheese from the quarter-cup that you reserved.


To finish, you can drizzle each portion with a small amount of extra-virgin olive oil as well. ,"

Grab your materials.,

Prepare your jelly.,

Spread the jelly.,

Finish up your sandwich.",How to Make a Jelly Sandwich,"

It's the exact same materials you need to make a classic P&J (just without the peanut butter): one to two slices of bread, flavor jelly of choice, a butter knife to spread the jelly, and a plate and napkin to eat it once it's done.
Place the bread on the plate. One piece will make a quicker, smaller sandwich, while two pieces will make a larger, more filling one.;
,

Most kinds of jelly come in a jar. In order to open it, grab the lid and twist. For other kinds that may come in a bottle, you just flip open the lid and squeeze out your jelly.
At this point you need to place the jelly on the bread. If it's in a jar, you may need to use the butter knife to get it out. Just leave it in a little heap in the center of the bread for now, making sure you have a good jelly to bread ratio.

,

Using the butter knife, spread the jelly as evenly as possible over each slice of bread. It doesn't have to be perfect, but you don't want too much jelly all in one bite. Try to spread outwards from the center of the bread for the best results.
This step can sometimes get a bit messy. If you get any jelly on your hands or on the crust of the bread, you can wipe it up with your napkin.

,

If you are making your jelly sandwich with two slices of bread, place one of the pieces of bread on top of the other, making the sides with jelly meet. Try to align the crusts of the bread so that no jelly leaks out.
If you are making your jelly sandwich with one piece of bread, you can finish it off in two ways.

The first is to break the bread in half, then place one half on top of the other so that the sides with jelly meet. You want to align the two halves just like above. This method words best with harder bread.
The second is to fold the bread in half, aligning the sides with the jelly. This method works best with softer bread, as harder bread may crumble when folded.


The only thing left to do is enjoy your edible masterpiece!

Select healthy bread.,
Find High-quality proteins.,
Consider Cheese.,
Add dressing.,
Pile on Vegetables.,
Complete your sandwich with another slice of bread.,
Consider heating or toasting.",How to Make a Healthy Sandwich," While bread itself, in moderation, is very healthy, consider:


High-fiber whole wheat bread.
High protein bread.
Wraps and pita bread (they are thin and have fewer calories).
Reduced calorie bread.
Multi-grain bread.;
, Most (although not all) sandwiches benefit from tasty, high-quality protein. What is available and tasty to you may vary by region. Keep in mind portion control--a serving of meat should be about the size of a deck of playing cards. Consider for choices:


Classic deli meats: Turkey, chicken, ham, roast beef, corned beef, and others.
Vegetarian spreads: Hummus, peanut butter, cashew butter, tahini, vegetarian patties, Vegemite, and more.
Salads: Tuna fish salad, seafood salad, chicken salad.

, Although cheese can add a good deal of fat, it also contains a good deal of calcium.


Harder cheeses (such as Swiss and Cheddar) usually have less fat.
Softer cheeses (like Blue cheese) may have more fat, but if spread thinly, can add overall less fat than slices of hard cheese.

, Sandwiches usually taste best with a little condiment added--but it is optional.


Mustard, nonfat salad dressings, salsa, and nonfat mayonnaise all add little calories and lots of flavor.
Avoid high-fat salad dressings, whole real mayonnaise, and oil-based dressings.

, A sandwich is a great way to slip in a lot of vegetables into a meal. Make sure they are fresh. Consider:


Sliced tomatoes
Olives
Cucumbers or pickles
Onions: Sweet, hot, or red.
Peppers: sweet or hot.
Lettuce
Bean sprouts
Apples (especially good with ham)
Sauerkraut (With corned beef and blue cheese dressing is a classic Reuben Sandwich)
Herbs (Basil tastes lovely with toasted cheese and tomato)

, Or wrap your wrap.

, This is entirely optional. Heating or toasting a sandwich adds no calories, and can greatly enhance the taste. Do not toast lettuce--it doesn't taste very good. Add it after heating.

Decide whether you want to have a dairy or a meat version.,
Gather the basic ingredients, as well as the ingredients for your desired version.

,
Squeeze the moisture out of the sauerkraut.,
Butter half of the bread slices.,
Layer the beef or cheese.,
Butter one side of the other slice of bread.,
Melt another 2 Tbsp.,
Cook the sandwich until both sides are toasted.,
Serve hot.",How to Make a Kosher Reuben Sandwich," This depends on the type of meal you are having.;
,, Lay the sauerkraut on several layers of clean paper towels. Wrap the sauerkraut inside the paper towels and squeeze gently over a sink or bowl to get the excess liquid out. Squeeze out as much moisture as possible. If too much excess remains, it can seep into the bread, causing it to turn soft and mushy.

, Spread butter or margarine on one side of one slice to be used in each sandwich. Gently line the slices up butter-side down on a piece of wax paper. The buttered side will need to be on the outside as the sandwich cooks, so when you assemble the sandwiches, the non-buttered side needs to face up. If you do not use wax paper, you may end up losing too much of the butter after you lift the sandwich up.

,


If you are making a dairy version, layer the cheese, sauerkraut, and dressing. Evenly divide the corned beef and place it on the bottom of the sandwich. Lay one piece of Swiss cheese, sauerkraut, and roughly 2 Tbsp. of prepared Thousand Island dressing.
If you are making a meat version, layer on the corned beef, sauerkraut, and dressing. Evenly divide the corned beef and place it on the bottom of the sandwich. On top of the corned beef, lay the sauerkraut, and roughly 2 Tbsp. of prepared Thousand Island dressing.

, Place one top of the sandwich with the buttered side facing out. As with the first half of the bread, the buttered side must face out in order to come into contact with the hot skillet.

, of butter/margarine in a griddle. Add the butter/margarine and heat over medium until it melts completely. Note that you can also use a shallow frying pan or skillet if you do not have a griddle. By buttering both the sandwich and the griddle, you create more evenly toasted bread with a softer texture and a more buttery flavor.

, Once the cheese begins to melt and the sides along the bottom look golden brown, carefully flip the sandwich over and cook the other side. The other side should also be golden brown before you remove it from the pan.

, Remove the sandwich from the pan and slice in half before serving.

Garnish the soup with the croutons, bacon, and chives and serve.",How to Make Cheeseburger Soup," To toast the hamburger buns for the crouton topping, the oven must be hot enough. Set the temperature to 400 degrees Fahrenheit (200 degrees Celsius), and allow it to fully preheat.If you prefer, you can toast the buns in a toaster oven rather than a standard oven.;
, For the croutons, you’ll need 3 hamburger buns that have been cut into 1-inch cubes. Lay the cubes out on a baking sheet so they’re in a single layer.You can use any type of hamburger bun for croutons.

, When the oven is preheated, place the baking sheet with the bun pieces inside. Allow them to cook until they become crisp and golden, which should take approximately 10 to 15 minutes.When the croutons are finished toasting, let them cool on the baking sheet until you’re ready to garnish the soup.

, Place a large skillet on the stove. Turn the heat up to medium-high, and let the pan heat for 3 to 5 minutes., Add 4 slices of bacon that have been diced to the hot skillet. Fry it until the bacon is crispy and brown, which should take approximately 6 to 8 minutes.You can substitute turkey bacon for traditional pork bacon if you prefer.

, When the bacon is done frying, use a slotted spoon to remove it from the skillet. Place the pieces on a plate lined with paper towel to absorb some of the excess grease.Allow the bacon to cool until you’re ready to garnish the soup.

, Add 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of olive oil to a medium saucepan. Turn the heat to medium-high, and allow the oil to heat until it begins to shimmer, which should take approximately 5 minutes.You can substitute canola oil for the olive oil if you prefer.

, When the oil is heated, mix 8 ounces (227 g) of ground beef into the pan. Cook the meat until it is browned, which should take approximately 3 to 5 minutes.As you’re cooking the ground beef, make sure to break it up with a wooden spoon so it’s crumbled.

, Once the meat is browned, turn off the heat. Remove the excess grease from the pan, and set the beef aside until it’s time to mix it into the soup., Add ¼ cup (55 g) of unsalted butter to a large stockpot. Place it on the stove, and heat it over medium heat until the butter melts, which should take approximately 5 minutes.You can also use a Dutch oven to make the soup.
If you prefer, you can substitute margarine for the butter.

, Once the butter is melted, mix 2 cloves of minced garlic, a diced onion, 2 stalks of celery that have been diced, 2 grated carrots, and 1 teaspoon (5 ml) of Worcestershire sauce into the pot. Stir well to ensure that the ingredients are fully combined.You can adjust the amount of garlic based on how strong you want the flavor to be. If you aren’t a fan of garlic, cut it down to a single clove. If you enjoy a strong garlic flavor, add 3 cloves or more.

, When all of the vegetables and Worcestershire sauce are mixed, allow the mixture to cook on medium heat until the onions become translucent. It should take approximately 2 to 3 minutes.Be sure to stir the vegetables frequently as they saute to ensure that they cook evenly.

, After you’ve cooked the vegetables for a few minutes, sprinkle 3 tablespoons (27 g) of all-purpose flour into the pot. Whisk the flour into the vegetables and cook until it is lightly browned, which should take about 1 minute., When the flour has cooked into the vegetables, gradually pour 2 ½ cups (591 ml) of chicken broth and 2 cups (473 ml) of milk into the pot. Whisk the mixture as you add the liquids, and allow it to cook for 1 to 2 minutes, or until it thickens.You can use store-bought or homemade chicken broth for the soup.
Any type of milk will work in the soup, but whole milk will create the creamiest soup.

, After the soup base has thickened, mix in 2 russet potatoes that have been peeled and cubed. Stir well to ensure that the potatoes are fully incorporated and bring the mixture to a boil, which should take about 5 minutes.You can substitute Idaho potatoes for the russet if you prefer.

, Once the soup base comes to a boil, lower the heat to medium-low. Allow it to simmer until the potatoes are tender, which should take 12 to 15 minutes., When the potatoes are tender, mix the ground beef, 1 ½ cups (150 g) of shredded cheddar cheese, and kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste. Stir well to ensure that all of the ingredients are fully incorporated.Extra sharp cheddar cheese gives the soup a particularly strong flavor, though you can use mild or medium if you prefer.
You can substitute whatever type of cheese you like for the cheddar. However, make sure that it is a type that melts well, such as monterey jack, gruyere, or fontina.

, After you’ve mixed all of the ingredients, continue cooking the soup until all of the cheese melts. Stir frequently as it’s cooking to ensure that the cheese doesn’t stick to the pot.If the soup is too thick after the cheese has melted, you can mix in more milk until it reaches the consistency that you like.

, When the soup has reached the proper consistency, ladle it into individual bowls. Sprinkle some of the burger bun croutons, crisp bacon, and chopped chives over the soup, and serve while it is still warm.If you like, you can top the soup with other common burger toppings, such as chopped onions, diced tomatoes, and/or pickles.

Collagen, which is found in cartilaginous bones like the joints, neck, head and feet, renders gelatin. For chicken broth, use 2 chicken feet in addition to the other bones. For beef broth, use sections of a calf's foot. You can find these things at your local butcher, or you can ask your local farmer to bring you some. They freeze well.;
,


This will not affect the gelatin content of your broth, but will increase its flavor immensely.

,


Bone broth is a great way to make use of kitchen “waste”–onion skins, garlic skins, ends of carrots, potato peelings. If you’re making broth weekly, you can store these in the fridge. Otherwise, freeze them for later use. Whole cloves of garlic, halved onions, halved potatoes all add flavor to your broth.

, Let sit for an hour.


The vinegar helps to draw out the minerals from the bones.

, When the liquid starts to roll, turn down heat immediately to low. At this point, there will be a good amount of foam on the surface of your broth. Skim, skim, skim.


This foam contains surface impurities and will negatively affect the flavor of your broth.

,


Cook broth for 12 hours. A slow-cooker is a wonderful tool for broth-making!

,


This will add minerals to your broth and complexity to its flavor.

,


These keep in the fridge for 4-5 days. A layer of fat will form at the top of your cooled broth. This helps preserve your broth and can also be used to, say, fry an onion, or cook an egg.

Add olive oil to the eggs one drop at a time.,
Watch the eggs and oil to make sure the emulsion is successful.,
Continue to drizzle the oil slowly into the eggs once you know the emulsion is successful.,
Blend in as much of the lemon juice as you want.,
Add salt and pepper.",How to Make Mayonnaise With Olive Oil," Fresh eggs are the best, so if you have access to organic or free range eggs, use those.;
, You will need about 6.7 oz. (200 ml) for the 3 eggs.


Use an oil that you have used for dressings or marinades before, and you know you like. Each olive oil has a different flavor and that flavor can come out in the mayonnaise. Many chefs recommend extra virgin olive oil for the best taste.

, You want to use fresh lemon juice for a mayonnaise, nothing artificial or squeezed from a bottle.

, Sea salt is best if you have it, and freshly ground pepper will also provide your mayonnaise with a pleasing taste.

, While whisking it by hand takes more time and a little muscle, it can often provide better results. Electric mixers can put extra heat into the mayonnaise, which can cause the oil and the eggs to separate.

, This will keep the bowl from moving while you whisk. If you are going to use an electric mixer or blender, place it on a flat surface.

, Gently crack the egg open and allow the the runny egg white to run out of the shell while you transfer the yellow yolk to your hand or the other side of the shell when you open it. If you place the yolk in your hand, the egg white will run through your fingers.

, Once all of the yolks are combined, add 1 tsp (4.5 ml) of water to the eggs and continue to beat. The water will help the emulsion process as the oil is added.

, It is important to go slowly, or the oil will separate and not combine with the yolks.


Incorporate each drop of olive oil completely before you add another drop. If you are using a blender or a mixer, keep it running through the whole process.

Break apart the chocolate into pieces and place them into the top pan of the double boiler.

While you are letting this first layer set, you can start to prepare the white chocolate!, Use the same microwave technique as you did for the milk or dark chocolate to melt the white chocolate. Remember to be patient when you microwave and stir every 30 seconds so as to not scald the chocolate., Stir in the remaining ¼ teaspoon of peppermint oil into the white chocolate. Make sure that you stir the chocolate thoroughly so that the flavor is distributed throughout., Take the melted white chocolate and pour it into the pan. Because you allowed the milk chocolate to set, the layers won’t mix. Make sure that the white chocolate layer is around the same thickness as the milk chocolate, using a spatula distribute the white chocolate evenly.

, Immediately after pouring the white chocolate into the pan, unwrap the peppermint candies and put them into a plastic sandwich bag. Take a small hammer or a meat tenderizer and break the candy into small pieces. How big or small you want the pieces is up to you!, After you finish breaking the candy pieces, sprinkle them over the white chocolate. Spread them evenly over the white chocolate so that they are distributed over the whole surface of the chocolate.Make sure that you sprinkle the candy immediately, because the candy will only stick if the white chocolate is still soft.

, Cover the pan with plastic wrap and put the bark in the refrigerator for two hours. This will allow the chocolate to harden, and will ensure that the peppermint candy stays stuck to the chocolate., After you have let the bark harden in the fridge, take out the pan. Use a knife to poke the chocolate. If it’s fully hard, either it break apart into chunks or cut the bark with a knife. Then your delicious creation will be ready to eat!To break the chocolate into rough pieces, peel up the parchment paper and take the sheet of bark out of the pan.

Allow the mixture to cool completely.,
Drain the cranberries.,
Transfer the cranberries to a shallow bowl.,
Put about two tablespoons of sugar in a small bowl.,
Place three or four cranberries into the bowl of sugar.,
Allow the cranberries to dry for two or three hours.",How to Make Frosted Cranberries," The cranberries will need to soak overnight in the sugar syrup before you can frost them, so if you’re making these for a holiday gathering, keep that in mind. You can make several batches in advance, if you prefer – frosted cranberries will stay fresh for two to three days if stored in an uncovered container.

Avoid storing in airtight containers, since this will make them soggy.Soaking the cranberries overnight in sugar syrup will sweeten them up. Otherwise, they will be too tart.;
, Place the cranberries in a colander and rinse them thoroughly with cold water. Place them in a large mixing bowl. Carefully pick through the cranberries and discard any bruised, damaged or mushy ones. Use only firm cranberries for this recipe.Once you've picked through all of them, set the bowl of cranberries aside.

, Add one cup of sugar and one cup of water to a pot and place it over medium heat. Warm the water until you see steam starting to rise from the pot. Use a whisk to stir the sugar water, which will help break up any remaining sugar crystals., Keep your eye on the pot. Do not bring the water to a boil. The cranberries might burst if the syrup is too hot. Stir the syrup with the whisk until the sugar has completely dissolved. Remove the pot from the heat., Carefully transfer the contents of the pot into the large mixing bowl, right over the cranberries. The cranberries will immediately float to the surface of the syrup. Place a smaller mixing bowl or a plate over the bowl to keep them submerged.You may want to test the syrup out on a few cranberries before pouring it over all of them. The cranberries will burst if the syrup is too hot.

, Leave the submerged cranberries in the bowl until the syrup has completely cooled. Once cooled, cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap. Do not remove the plate first – wrap the whole thing up. Place the bowl in the refrigerator overnight., On the following day, remove the bowl from the refrigerator. Drain the cranberries in a colander. Reserve the syrup as it drains – don’t throw it away. You won’t need it for this particular recipe, but you can use this tasty simple syrup later on to sweeten holiday cocktails., Line a large shallow bowl with paper towels and pour the drained cranberries into it. Use additional paper towels to pat the berries dry.Keep patting them until all of the liquid is absorbed. The cranberries should feel tacky but not wet.If you leave any leftover liquid on the cranberries, the sugar will clump up when you try to roll them.

, Regular white sugar will work fine for this. However, consider using sugar that has a chunky texture, such as organic sugar cane or Turbinado. The larger sugar crystals will sparkle a little more than regular sugar. You can buy organic cane sugar or Turbinado in most grocery stores or in health food stores.
Cover a cookie sheet with parchment paper or foil right before you start rolling the cranberries.

, For best results, work in small batches of three or four cranberries at a time. Jiggle the berries around in the bowl until they are covered with sugar. Once they’re coated, place them on the covered sheet pan to dry.Continue working in batches until you’ve coated all of the berries with sugar. If you overcrowd the bowl with too many cranberries, the sugar will clump up and become unworkable. If the sugar does start to clump up, start over with a fresh bowl of sugar.
Continually add more sugar to the bowl as needed.

, The cranberries are ready when the sugar coating feels firm and slightly crusty. Place them in a Tupperware container. Leave the container uncovered, otherwise the cranberries will get soggy. Keep the container in a cool, dry place. Consume the frosted cranberries within two to three days."

Make your syrup.,
Glaze your cranberries.,
Coat the berries with sugar.,
Dry and repeat.",How to Make Glazed Cranberries1," In a medium saucepan, stir 2 cups (400 g) of sugar into 2 cups (473 ml) of water. Heat the mixture on the stovetop, stirring occasionally to dissolve the sugar. Remove from heat once it begins to simmer, before it reaches a full boil.White granulated sugar is fine, but if you’d prefer a hint of molasses, use raw cane sugar or natural brown sugar instead.
If your syrup reaches a boil, it’s not the end of the world. You’ll just have to wait a few extra minutes before moving on to the next step.
If, however, it's boiled so long that it has begun to reduce in volume, measure how much liquid is left and add the difference.;
, After you remove your syrup from the burner, give it a few minutes to cool down a little. While it sits, pour 2 cups (200 g) of cranberries into a medium glass bowl. Once the water has cooled off a little, pour it into the bowl. Seal the bowl with a lid, foil, or plastic wrap. Then place it in the refrigerator to chill overnight.You want to let the water cool off before pouring to avoid bursting the cranberries.
To eliminate this risk entirely, wait until the water cools off to room temperature.

, After your berries have chilled overnight, pour them into a strainer and let any excess moisture drain. Then dry your glass bowl with a towel or paper towels. Add a spoonful of sugar, then about a small portion of your berries. Toss them with a couple spoons or by covering the bowl with its lid and shaking it to coat the berries with sugar, which will stick to the glaze.

Once they are more or less evenly coated, transfer to them to a baking sheet. Then repeat until you have coated all your berries.
Working in small portions will help coat each berry more evenly. It will also prevent the sugar from clumping up due to too much moisture.

, Once you have coated all your berries, give the sugar a few hours to dry to the berries. Then give them a look-over. If there are any bare spots, or if you just prefer a sweeter treat, toss them again with more sugar.By now the glaze should be well on its way to dry, so it should only take another hour for the added sugar to dry to your berries.

Alternatively, you could grease the bottom and sides of the baking pan with butter, shortening, or nonstick cooking spray. Using parchment paper will make the pan easier to clean, though.;
, Place about 3 cups (355 g) of ice in a medium mixing bowl. Set it aside.


The ice may not be necessary, but it's still a good idea to prepare it. If the syrup climbs above the desired temperature while you heat it, you'll need to use the ice to quickly “shock” the temperature back down.

, Test the accuracy of your candy thermometer by dipping the tip into boiling water. The temperature should read 212 degrees Fahrenheit (100 degrees Celsius).


Even if your thermometer was accurate the last time you used it, you should still check it again before preparing this or any other confection since your temperature measurements must be precise.
You can still use a candy thermometer that no longer reads the correct temperature. Simply adjust the temperatures in the recipe by the same amount of variation.

, If you want to make chocolate malted nougat, you'll need to chop up and melt 2 oz (60 g) of chocolate before you begin working on the main part of the recipe.Chop the chocolate into small pieces and transfer it to a microwave-safe bowl. Microwave in 30-second intervals, stirring after each one, until the chocolate is completely melted and smooth.
Set it aside as you work on the main part of the nougat. The chocolate should cool slightly, but not enough to start solidifying.

, Place these three ingredients in a heavy, medium saucepan. Set the saucepan over medium heat.

, Heat the sugar mixture on the stove, stirring continuously, until the sugar granules dissolve and the mixture reaches a boil.


This will usually take about 10 minutes.
If the mixture reaches a boil but sugar crystals are still present on the side of the pan, cover the pan and continue boiling the syrup for 1 to 2 minutes. During this time, the steam should help wash the crystals away.
Alternatively, you can wash down the sides of the pan by scraping them with a wet pastry brush.

, Continue cooking the syrup mixture over medium heat until your candy thermometer reads the ideal temperature. For soft nougat, the temperature should reach the soft ball stage and read 238 degrees Fahrenheit (114 degrees Celsius).For hard, chewy nougat, the temperature should reach the soft crack stage and read 275 degrees Fahrenheit (135 degrees Celsius).This will usually take anywhere from 6 to 12 more minutes.
When preparing soft nougat, you can actually cook the sugar syrup up to 245 degrees Fahrenheit (118 degrees Celsius). Similarly, you can allow the sugar syrup to reach 300 degrees Fahrenheit (149 degrees Celsius) when preparing hard nougat.
If the temperature climbs above your ideal degree range, though, quickly stop the cooking process by sticking the bottom of the pan into your prepared bowl of ice.

, As the syrup mixture heats up to the indicated temperature, place the egg whites in a large heat-resistant bowl and beat them with an electric mixer until stiff peaks form.


For hard, chewy nougat that retains its on shape, beat the egg whites until stiff, glossy peaks form. If you'd prefer soft, fluffier nougat, you only need to beat the egg whites until they become frothy.Note that you can beat the egg whites before you start to cook the syrup if doing so makes you feel more comfortable. They should hold even if you don't use them immediately, and once the syrup reaches the correct temperature, you'll need to work quickly.

, Once your egg whites are ready and your syrup is hot enough, pour one splash or ladle-full of hot syrup into the egg whites. Mix it into the egg whites using your electric mixer.If using a stand mixer, set the mixer on low speed before you begin adding the egg whites. If using a hand mixer, begin mixing on low speed immediately after adding the egg whites.
Try to pour the syrup as close to the side of the bowl as possible without actually touching the side.

, Once you've blended the initial batch of syrup into the egg whites, pour the rest of the syrup in while continuing to beat the mixture at low speed.


Pour the syrup slowly, but try to keep a steady, continuous stream. Continue at slow speed until all of the syrup has been added.

, Once the syrup and egg whites are just barely combined, increase the speed of the mixer to medium and beat for another 2 to 3 minutes, or until the mixture seems thoroughly combined and stiff.


Stiff peaks should form regardless of whether you choose to make hard or soft nougat, but if you started with stiff peaks before you added the syrup, you should notice that the stiff peaks look less glossy during this stage than they did initially.

, Once stiff peaks form in the nougat, you should add any mix-ins you wish to use.


To create chocolate malted nougat, add your 2 oz (60 ml) of melted chocolate and 1/3 cup (80 ml) of malted milk powder. Blend in the ingredients using your electric mixer at low speed.
To create bars of chewy nougat with crunchy mix-ins like almonds, dried fruit, or toffee bits, simply add the desired ingredient to the nougat and stir or fold it in using a spatula. You can mix and match or stick to one mix-in, but try not to exceed more than 1-1/2 cups (375 ml) either way.

, Regardless of whether you added any mix-ins, pour the stiff nougat mixture into your lined baking dish. Use a spatula to even out the surface of the nougat.

, When preparing hard nougat, place another sheet of parchment paper over the surface of the nougat. Gently press on the nougat through the paper to smooth out the top.Do not do this if you're preparing soft nougat, however, since the parchment paper will be harder to peel away later.
Leave the parchment paper on the nougat until the mixture cools down.

, Allow the nougat mixture to sit out at room temperature until it cools. You'll likely need to wait for several hours.


Soft nougat can be cooled in your refrigerator, but you should always cool hard nougat at room temperature.
During this time, the nougat should set to its final consistency. Hard nougat will actually become too hard to press into. Soft nougat will become more firm, but it should not harden completely.

, If you prepared hard nougat, you can cut it into pieces once it cools.


Remove the nougat from the baking pan and peel off the parchment paper from both sides.
Use a sharp knife to cut the nougat into squares. You'll need to rock the knife back and forth to force it through the confection.

, Transfer the nougat to an airtight container and store it at room temperature for three days to one week.


For hard nougat, wrap the individual pieces of nougat in wax paper to prevent them from sticking together. You should also keep a layer of wax paper on the bottom of the container and in between stacked layers. Hard nougat should remain good for one week.
For soft nougat, use it immediately or spoon the entire batch into the container and seal tightly. Soft nougat will usually last for about three days.
Note that either type of nougat can remain good for about two months if stored in the freezer. Thaw the frozen nougat for one hour in your refrigerator before using it, though.

Gently warm the milk.,
Stir in an acid.,
Let stand.,
Strain, if appropriate.",How to Curdle Milk1," Pour the milk into a saucepan and place the saucepan on the stove. Gradually warm the milk up over medium heat until steam just begins to form.


While the acid you will use in this method may curdle the milk on its own when used in large enough quantities, heat dramatically accelerates the process, making the milk curdle faster and more noticeably. This is especially important if you plan to separate the solid curds from the liquid whey, as you would do when making cheese.
Note that you can also curdle milk using nothing but heat, as outlined in another method of this article. Doing so will produce smaller curds, though, so this method is recommended if you need larger curds.;
, Add an acidic ingredient like lemon juice, orange juice, or vinegar to the hot milk. Whisk it in to incorporate thoroughly.


Milk contains a protein called casein. Casein groupings are usually spread throughout milk evenly, but when milk becomes acidic, the negative charge keeping the casein groupings separate is neutralized. As a result, the casein proteins clump together, causing the milk to become grainy and curdle.Lemon juice is generally the preferred acid of choice, followed by vinegar. Both are more acidic than orange juice or other common kitchen acids.
The more acid you add, the larger your curds will be and the faster they will form. For smaller “grains” of curds, use a smaller amount of acid.

, Remove the saucepan from the stove and let the acidic milk stand, uncovered, for 5 to 10 minutes at room temperature. Do not stir the milk during this time.


If the milk has not curdled sufficiently enough for your recipe, you can let it stand longer or return it to the stove and heat it for a longer period of time.

, If you need the solid curds for cheese or another recipe, pour the contents of the saucepan into a cheesecloth. Wrap up the cheesecloth tightly and strain the liquid into a sink or large mixing bowl.


Depending on how watery the curdled milk is, you might need to let it drain for several hours to a day before all the whey separates from the curds.
If you do not need to strain the curdled milk, you can use it as is.

"
"
Boil the milk.,
Let stand.,
Strain, if necessary.",How to Curdle Milk2," Pour the milk into a saucepan. Place the saucepan on the stove and heat the milk on medium-high to high heat. Once the milk reaches a boil, allow it to boil for a full 1 to 2 minutes.


Note that high-fat dairy products, like cream, can be boiled with little to no problem. As a result, you may find that low-fat milk takes very little time to boil and curdle while whole milk will take longer.
Milk will not begin to curdle until it reaches a temperature of 180 degrees Fahrenheit (82 degrees Celsius). To maximize and speed up the curdling effect, let the temperature climb even higher. You can monitor the temperature using a clip-on instant food thermometer.
Stir the milk occasionally but not frequently. Stirring will spread the heat throughout the liquid, but it will also cause the milk to take longer to reach a boil.
Leave the saucepan uncovered.

, Remove the saucepan from the heat and let the milk stand at room temperature for 5 to 10 minutes. Do not stir the milk as it stands.


If you would like the milk to curdle more, you can let it stand for a longer period of time or return it to the heat and continue boiling it until larger curds form.

, If you need to separate the solid curds from the liquid whey, you can pour the curdled milk into a cheesecloth. Wrap the cheesecloth up and let the liquid drain out into a sink or large mixing bowl.


Understand that using heat only without using acid will produce softer, less-formed curds. This method is best used if you need grainy or soured milk rather than actual curds.
If you do not need to strain the curdled milk, you can skip this step and use it as is.

"
"
Heat the soy milk, if needed.,
Combine soy milk and the acid.,
Let stand.,
Strain, if necessary.",How to Curdle Milk3," Soy milk will usually begin to curdle even if you do not heat it, but to create the maximum amount of curds, you should pour the milk into a saucepan and heat over medium heat until it starts to steam.


Soy milk curdles more easily than standard whole dairy milk, but if you add an acid to the soy milk without heating it first, the resulting curds will be smaller and less firm. Moreover, they will also take longer to form. If you only need the soy milk to sour or become grainy and do not need actual curds, you can skip the heating portion of this method, though.

, Whisk in an acid, like lemon juice, to thoroughly incorporate it. You should notice some curds beginning to form already.


Lemon juice is the recommended acid of choice for curdling soy milk.
On average, you will need about 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of lemon juice for every 1 cup (250 ml) of soy milk. Note that adding more acid will cause more prominent curds to form while adding less acid will cause smaller curds or grains to form.

, Remove the saucepan from the heat, if applicable. Let the acid and soy milk combination stand at room temperature for 10 minutes.


If you heated the soy milk before adding the vinegar, you should notice curds beginning to form. If the curds have not reached the desired size or consistency yet, you can let the milk sit longer or return it to the heat for a few minutes.

, If using the soy milk curds for vegan cheese or another similar recipe, you should strain the curds through cheesecloth to separate them from the liquid whey.


Note that you may need to let the whey drain for several hours to a day, depending on how runny your curdled milk is when done.
If you do not need to separate the curds from the whey, you can use the curdled soy milk without straining it.

"
"
Use cornstarch or flour.,
Heat slowly.,
Add the acidic ingredient to the milk.,
Finished.

",How to Curdle Milk4," Whisk 2 tsp (10 ml) of cornstarch into the milk as you heat it. The addition of a starch will prevent the milk from curdling and make it thicker in the process.


Cornstarch is generally preferred over flour.
You will need to add about 1 tsp (5 ml) of cornstarch or flour for every 1/2 cup (125 ml) milk to ensure that the milk will not curdle in the presence of an acidic ingredient or high heat.For best results, whisk cornstarch into the milk while the milk is still cold. Heat the milk up and add your other ingredients afterward.

, If you need to heat the milk, bring it up to temperature over low to medium-low heat and stir it frequently to disperse the heat throughout the liquid evenly.


Dairy milk and soy milk should not be cooked above a temperature of 180 degrees Fahrenheit (82 degrees Celsius) if you do not want the milk to curdle.Monitor the temperature using a clip-on instant food thermometer. Attach the thermometer to the side of the pan. Make sure that the bulb touches the milk but not the bottom of the pan, since the temperature of the metal at the bottom of the pan will be hotter than the temperature of the milk.

, If you notice soy milk curdling when you add it to acidic coffee, try pouring your soy milk into the mug first before slowly pouring in the coffee. Add the coffee gradually to help temper the soy milk.In the case of coffee, it is also a good idea to let the coffee cool slightly before adding it to the soy milk. Doing so will make it even less likely that the coffee will curdle the milk.
Note that, while coffee is acidic, it is less acidic than vinegar or lemon juice. As a result, cool to lukewarm coffee is not likely to cause dairy milk or soy milk to curdle.
While dairy milk is less likely to curdle when poured into coffee, if you do have problems with dairy milk curdling in your coffee, you can use this same practice with dairy milk.

Line your pan with parchment paper, to keep the chocolate from sticking. Once it’s transferred into the pan, smooth it out as much as you can. Then, pop it into the refrigerator to cool overnight.While the chocolate is still warm, you can add any fun toppings you like. Sprinkle some crushed peppermint, some caramel, or even some mini marshmallows! Just remember, whatever you top the chocolate with will be going in your hot chocolate.

, After your chocolate has solidified in the refrigerator, it’s time to create your blocks. Carefully, turn the pan upside down to place the chocolate on a clean surface. The parchment paper will be handy here! Then, use a sharp knife to cut your chocolate into blocks.Make six lines going down the block, and six going across the block. Cut on those lines to get the proper sized chocolate blocks.
To cut your chocolate most easily, run the blade of your knife under hot water. This will make your cuts smoother and easier.

, After your chocolate is cut into blocks, carefully push wooden lollipop or candy apple sticks into the blocks. Make sure the sticks you choose are sturdy enough to hold the chocolate, and long enough so that it can be used to stir hot milk. You can also press spoons into the chocolate, so that you have a stirring spoon once the chocolate melts!, If you’re serving these at a party, place instructions next to them. If you’re giving them to friends, write a little note to put in the bag with them. Instruct them to place the chocolate into 8 to 10 ounces of hot milk to create delicious hot chocolate.If you’re serving them at a party, place them next to cups and a kettle of warm milk so they can easily create their hot chocolate.

, This is a perfect little holiday gift or party favor. Grab a square of clear cellophane and place your hot chocolate on a stick in the center. Then grab the four corners, and tie them around the stick. You can use some colorful ribbon to tie the cellophane, making the treat look festive and polished., To complete this little gift, add some hot chocolate toppings to the cellophane bag. Consider adding some crushed peppermint, some marshmallows, toffee, or anything else you’d enjoy in your drink! By putting it in the bag rather than in the chocolate, your recipients and guests can choose how much or little to add."

Sift your baking soda ahead of time to remove any chunks.,
Line a rimmed baking sheet with lightly buttered parchment paper.,
Measure your ingredients in advance.,
Combine the honey, corn syrup, and sugar in a very large heavy-bottomed pan.,
Add just enough water to wet the sugar, about 1/4 cup.,
Set the heat to medium-high and cook without stirring.,
Cook until the mixture is a light amber color or a candy thermometer reaches 300F/150C.,
Remove the pan from the heat to start cooling.,
Dump in the sifted baking soda and whisk the pot vigorously and quickly.,
Immediately pour into the prepared baking sheet and cool at room temperature for 1-2 hours.",How to Make Honeycomb1," This is very important -- the baking soda is added and whisked very quickly, and any chunks of powder might not incorporate if you're not careful. Use a sifter to complete sift the powder, or whip it up with a fork if you don't have a sifter., Smear a little butter on a paper towel and wipe down the pan and parchment paper to prevent the honeycomb from sticking as it cools. You can also use aluminum foil, or an ungreased Silpat (silicone) mat., This recipe moves very quickly, which is why everything, from the baking soda to the sugar, must be ready to add at a moment's notice. No matter which recipe variety you're using, get everything measured out before proceeding., Your recipe will quadruple in size as you cook it, meaning you need a very high-sided pot to pull the recipe off. Furthermore, it must have a thick, heavy bottom (at least 1/4""), otherwise the heat from the stove will be too close to the sugar, burning it.

, You just want the sugar to be damp, not swimming. There should be no dry patches of sugar. Make sure you wipe down any spare sugar crystals off the sides of the pot as well using a rubber spatula.

, Stirring will cause the candy to crack, but you want a nice, smooth caramel. Keep an eye on the candy as soon as the heat comes on -- this moves quickly. It should begin to boil within 3-5 minutes.

, If you have a candy thermometer, this is easy. Even if you don't, the recipe is forgiving enough that you should be fine. Simply cook, never stirring, until the mixture reaches the color of a slightly worn penny.

, While not strictly necessary, some recipes call for speeding up the process by plunging the bottom of the pan into a sink full of cool water. Whether you choose this strategy or not is up to you. But, whatever your strategy, do it quickly, and get to the next step., Spare no time between dumping in the baking soda and beginning to mix. While a large, long whisk is the best option, a slotted wooden spoon is equally effective. Stir until the whole thing is frothing and foaming.


As soon as you add the baking soda, be ready for the whole thing to bubble up like a volcano.

, Once the honeycomb is hard and crumbly it is ready to eat. Remove from the pan, snap or cut into bars or chunks, and enjoy!"

As an alternative, you can grind up lemon cookies in a food processor to replace your lemon cake mix.;
, Continue to knead the dough until it thickens up enough so that you can roll it out into truffle balls. Once it hardens enough, you should be able to roll out 2-inch (5.08 cm) balls with your hands. If your dough is crumbly and not holding together, add a teaspoon (4.9 mL) of butter until it holds.

, Use the palm of your hand to softly roll each of your truffles in a separate bowl of granulated sugar. Continue to roll them until the entire surface of your truffles are covered in sugar. Set them on a cookie sheet when you're done rolling them., Setting the truffles in the refrigerator will help them set and will make them harder. Allow the dessert to warm up to room temperature before eating them.

Turn off the heat and cook for 5 minutes.,
Submerge the eggs in cold water.,
Serve.",How to Cook Quail Eggs1," Place the quail eggs in a small saucepan. Add enough cold water to cover the eggs by 1 inch (2.5 cm).


Handle the eggs gently to prevent them from cracking. The eggs should remain in a single layer with some space between them; do not crowd or stack them.
While not strictly necessary, consider adding 1 tsp (5 ml) salt and 1 tsp (5 ml) white vinegar to the water. Doing so can help separate the egg from its shell, making the eggs easier to peel later.;
, Place the saucepan on the stove over medium-high heat. Allow the water to reach a steady boil.

, As soon as the water reaches a boil, turn off the heat and cover the saucepan. Cook the eggs for an additional 5 minutes in the hot water.Leave the saucepan on the burner while the eggs finish boiling. The residual heat from the burner will help cook the eggs more thoroughly. Leaving the heat on could overcook the eggs, however.

, Use a slotted spoon to transfer the eggs into a bowl of ice water. Cool the eggs for 3 to 4 minutes.


Dunking the eggs in ice water stops the cooking process. It also makes the eggs easier to peel.
If you don't have an ice bath, rinse each egg under cold, running water until the shells feel cool to the touch.

, Peel off the shell and enjoy the hard boiled quail eggs as desired.


To peel the eggs, lightly tap the shell on a hard surface to break it. Lift away the shell at its cracks.
You can serve the eggs plain with a little salt or celery salt for flavor. Alternatively, you can use hard boiled quail eggs in other recipes, like tea marbled eggs, pickled eggs, and kwek kwek.

",How to Make Honeycomb2," Before adding the water, mix the teaspoon of vanilla into it to ensure the flavor distributes evenly. Then cook the recipe like normal.

, This recipe adds a little tang and promotes a greater bubbling, leading to bigger, broader honeycombs. To make it, simply add 1 teaspoon white vinegar and a pinch (under 1/2 a teaspoon) cream of tartar along with the sugars, then cook like normal., This will make a slightly richer, salty-sweet treat that is nearly impossible to resist. To make it, all you have to do is substitute pure maple syrup for the honey -- no other changes needed. While cooling, sprinkle the tops with sea salt for a light garnish.This recipe is great when served with melted semi-sweet chocolate, as well.

, Once the honeycomb has cooled, set a shallow pan of water on high heat.

Pour the mixture over white chocolate and stir.,
Add the lemon juice and butter and continue mixing.,
Place the mixture into the refrigerator for two hours or until firm.,
Roll your batter into balls.,
Roll the truffles in powdered sugar and let set in the fridge.",How to Make Lemon Truffles2," Pour your lemon zest and whipping cream into a saucepan over your stovetop. Stir the contents until all of the ingredients are well-mixed. Continue to heat the mixture until small bubbles begin to appear around the edges of your saucepan, then take your pan off of the heat., Once the mixture begins to boil around the edges, pour it through a fine-mesh sieve over a bowl of your white chocolate. This process will start to melt the white chocolate so that you can fully incorporate it into your truffles. Use a spoon to break up larger chunks of white chocolate and whisk the ingredients until your mixture is smooth., Once your chocolate is fully melted, add 10 milliliters (2 teaspoons) of lemon juice and 7g (4 tablespoons) of butter to the bowl. Use a wooden spoon to crush down the butter and mix everything together. Stop mixing once the batter is smooth.

, Spread plastic wrap over the surface of your bowl before putting the batter into the refrigerator. Chilling your truffle mixture will allow the batter to set and become more firm.If you are making truffles for later, you can leave your batter in the fridge overnight.

, Remove the bowl from your refrigerator and use a spoon to scoop some of your truffle mixture onto a cutting board. Roll the dough into 2-inch (5.08 cm) balls by rolling the batter against the cutting board. If the balls are too sticky and the batter is coming off on your hands or cutting board, you can sprinkle powdered sugar onto your board to help you form the balls., Set aside a bowl filled with powdered sugar. Once you've formed the balls, you can carefully roll them in the sugar to coat them. After you coat them, the truffles are ready to eat. You can store truffles in the refrigerator for up to one week after you've made them, but let them warm to room temperature before you eat them.You can also freeze your lemon truffles if you need to store them for a longer period.

Make sure to remove lumps or large pieces because they can ruin the texture of your truffles., Add your dried coconut, coconut nectar, and coconut oil to the mixture. Mix it with the nuts until everything becomes well incorporated. At this point, your batter should start to thicken., Peel your lemon and squeeze out the juice. Use the peel to scrape off lemon zest. Add the 1 tsp (4.9 mL) ground vanilla beans and pinch of salt and continue to mix everything together. Whisk your bowl until the ingredients are all incorporated.

, Set aside some ground nuts or extra dried coconut and use that as a sweet coating over your truffles. When grinding nuts for the coating, do not grind them as much as you would to form the nut flour. Leaving larger pieces intact will add to the texture of your truffles.If you want saltier truffles, try adding a pistachio nut coating over them.

, Allow your vegan truffles to set in your refrigerator for at least 15 minutes before eating them. Once they have hardened, you can take them out and serve them."

Heat the oil.,
Crack the eggs.,
Slide the eggs into the oil.,
Cook until firm.,
Serve warm.",How to Cook Quail Eggs2," Pour the oil into a large nonstick skillet. Set the pan over medium heat for approximately 1 minute.


Let the oil get hot, but do not allow it to start smoking. When the oil starts to glisten, turn and rotate the pan to help spread the oil across the entire bottom.

, Carefully crack each of the quail eggs into separate ramekins.


Since quail eggs are so small, they can be difficult to crack without breaking the yolk. The easiest way to break open the egg is to saw off the end using a serrated knife; dump the contents of the shell into the ramekin afterward.

Alternatively, you can carefully peel off the end of the shell with your fingers and pinch the inner membrane to break the egg open. Pour out the contents from that hole.


If you decide to cook more eggs than called for in this recipe, work in small batches, preparing about four eggs in each one.

, Pour each quail egg out of its ramekin, allowing it to gently slide into the hot oil in the pan.


Place the edge of the ramekin as close to the pan as possible to minimize the drop distance and preserve the yolk.
Try to position the eggs so that they do not touch inside the pan.

, Cover the pan and cook the eggs for 1 to 1-1/2 minutes, or until the egg whites are firmly set.Do not touch the eggs while they cook.
Note that the yolk will not appear firmly set when the eggs are finished.

, Use a spatula to carefully lift each egg out of the skillet and onto separate serving plates. Season with salt and white pepper, and enjoy them while they're still warm.


Fried quail eggs can be served as a standalone dish, but they're more commonly served over other dishes, like slices of baguette, smoked salmon, or crab cakes.

Simmer the water.,
Meanwhile, crack the eggs.,
Slide the eggs into the water.,
Cook until set.,
Serve warm.",How to Cook Quail Eggs3," Fill a small frying pan with approximately 2 inches (5 cm) of water. Bring the water to a gently boil over medium-high heat.


As soon as the water boils, turn down the heat so that the water is just barely simmering. The water must bubble at a gentle pace before you add the eggs.

, As the water boils, crack each of the eggs into separate ramekins.


Open the eggs carefully to avoid breaking the yolk. Use a serrated knife to carefully saw through the shell and membrane at one end, then pour the inner egg into the ramekin through that opening.
Ideally, you should only cook three to four eggs at a time. For larger amounts, you may need to work in batches.

, Carefully pour each egg into the bubbling water. Space the eggs apart so that they do not touch one another.


Position the edge of the ramekin as close to the surface of the water as possible before pouring in the egg. Doing so will allow the egg to gently slide into the water, thereby preserving the yolk.

, Cook the eggs for about 1 minute, or until the whites are set and the yolk has reached your desired level of doneness.Use a spatula to carefully remove the finished eggs from the water. Transfer them to a plate lined with paper towels so that the water may drain.

, Serve the eggs immediately.


Poached quail eggs are typically served atop simple green salads or cooked green vegetables, but you can also enjoy them separately.
If you need to save the eggs for later, keep them in a bowl of ice water for up to several hours. Reheat the eggs in simmering water for 30 seconds, or until heated through, before serving.

Add the tea bags, honey, and whole cloves to the water, then bring everything to a boil over medium-high heat.You can vary the type of tea and the types of spices used according to your own tastes, but stick with deep or bright colored teas to create more pronounced marbling.

, While the tea boils, gently roll the hard boiled quail eggs over a hard surface, cracking the shells without peeling them off.


Alternatively, you could also crack the shells by tapping them with the back of a spoon.
The cracks must be deep enough to reach through the membrane and to the white of the inner egg, but the shells themselves should remain intact.

, Turn off the heat but leave the the saucepan on the stove. Use a slotted spoon to gently lower the eggs into the hot tea.


Cover the saucepan and allow the eggs to sit in the hot water for 20 to 30 minutes.

, Transfer the covered saucepan to the refrigerator and chill the eggs for at least 2 hours, if not overnight.Longer steep time will usually result in more pronounced marbling. Notable marbling should occur after 2 hours, but the effect will be more pronounced after 8 hours.

, Drain the tea, dry the quail eggs, and peel away the shells using your fingers. Serve the marbled eggs cool or at room temperature.


The tea itself should add flavor to the eggs, but if desired, you could still serving the eggs with a sprinkling of Kosher salt, soy salt, or another type of dipping salt.

, Place the saucepan on the stove over medium heat. Let it reach a boil, reduce the heat to medium-low, and continue simmering the mixture for 2 to 3 minutes.Afterward, remove the saucepan from the stove and set it away from the heat. Let it cool for 5 to 10 minutes, or until it drops close to room temperature.

, Place the eggs in a sterilized 1-qt (1-L) jar. Pour the cooled vinegar mixture over the eggs.


You must use a jar that's been cleaned and sterilized with boiling water. If harmful bacteria gets introduced into the mixture, the pickled eggs could become tainted and dangerous to eat.

, Seal the container and place it in your refrigerator. Keep it there for at least 24 hours.

, Spoon the pickled quail eggs out of the vinegar mixture and enjoy them slightly chilled.


You can enjoy the pickled quail eggs as snacks, appetizers, or side dishes.
Store leftovers in the pickling liquid. Keep the container sealed and in your refrigerator, and use the eggs within two weeks.

Heat a small amount of fat in a non-stick pan.,
(optional) Crack the eggs into a separate container.,
Add the eggs to the pan.,
Wait for the bottoms of the eggs to solidify.,
Flip the eggs.,
Flip the eggs again.,
Serve.",How to Cook Over Easy Eggs1," Set the stove to medium or medium-low. Drop a little of your preferred fat into the pan (use no less than one tablespoon to keep the pan slick). You're ready to proceed when you hear a quiet sizzling.









There are many different types of fat you can use here. Just a few include:



Butter or margarine
Canola or olive oil
Bacon grease (convenient if you just cooked bacon for your breakfast in the same pan)



;
, Grab a bowl, cup or ramekin big enough to hold your eggs. Break the flat side of each egg on the rim of the container and let the contents drain into it. To save time, do this while waiting for your pan to heat up.


Don't crack the eggs directly into the hot pan. If you do this, it's easier to break the yolks or cook your eggs unevenly. You also have less control over where they will lie in the pan., Pour your eggs from the container into the hot pan. Immediately lift the handle so that the eggs slide to the far side of the pan. Wait about 10 to 15 seconds so the bottoms of the eggs have a chance to set together, then slowly lower the handle so the pan sits level on the stove. Jiggle the pan slightly to keep the eggs from sticking or carefully move them with a spatula.









Setting the eggs together at the far side of the pan keeps the whites together in a single thick ""clump"" rather than having them run all over the pan. This keeps the eggs from cooking unevenly.

, Now, let the eggs cook without disturbing them for a minute or two. You want the bottoms of the whites to be fully set (but not hard) before you proceed. Depending on your pan and the level of heat you're using, this will take anywhere from about 45 seconds to two minutes.









Keep your eyes on the edges of the whites — they are thinner than the center, so they will solidify first. When you notice that the edges are solid, you can proceed even if the whites in the middle are still a little liquid.

, When the edges and bottom are solid but the white around the yolk is still clear, slip a spatula under the eggs. Lift them away from the pan and turn them over with a single quick twisting motion of the wrist. Set them down as gently as possible so you don't break the yolks. It is OK if you accidentally ""fold"" one of the edges under the center. This doesn't affect the finished product much.









If you're bold, you can also flip the eggs with the pan itself. To do this, push the pan away from you and jerk the far edge up sharply. Bring the pan up to meet the egg as it turns. This is tricky, so use a spatula if you're not an experienced chef.

, The second side of the egg should not cook for very long. Count to 10, then slide the spatula under the eggs and re-flip them. The ""top"" side of the egg should now just be barely set.


Cooking this side of the egg for only 10 seconds is crucial. You want the tops of the eggs to solidify just enough to contain the yolks while keeping them runny.

, Congratulations! Your over easy eggs are done. Transfer out of the pan to a plate and serve with toast, bacon, hash browns, or other breakfast favorites.

Check a web directory for nearby people who share kefir grains.,
Join an Internet discussion forum for kefir hobbyists.,
Buy kefir grains from a commercial source.,
Manage your kefir grains properly.",How to Buy Kefir Grains," Fresh kefir grains are the preferred choice for people who prepare kefir regularly. These grains can be continually propagated with minimal effort, so you only ever need to buy them once. Powdered cultures, consisting of dormant yeast and bacteria, are a more convenient option that can be stored easily and do not have to be monitored. However, the powdered form does expire and needs to be repurchased periodically.;
, If you know anyone living in your area that makes kefir, he or she will almost certainly be willing to give you some kefir grains at no cost. Kefir cultures grow aggressively, so anyone maintaining one will be constantly sloughing off excess. Asking a friend to give you this excess is the easiest way to obtain fresh kefir grains.

, There are several Internet directories that maintain lists of people (and their location) who have volunteered to donate or sell their kefir grains. Project Kefir and the International Kefir Grains List are 2 such directories. If someone on the list lives near you, contact them to ask about obtaining some of their kefir grains.

, There are numerous groups and discussion forums for people to discuss kefir preparation. Many of these forums will have a page where members can list kefir grains available for donation or sale.

, There are plenty of retailers that sell kefir grains, many of whom will ship the grains to your door. Health food stores may carry kefir grains, and specialty culture stores will stock several varieties. Cultures for Health, a company based in Oregon, USA, specializes in bacterial and yeast cultures for making cheese, yogurt, pickles, kefir, and more.

, Once you buy kefir grains, you need to manage them well to keep them alive. The best way to do this is to keep them in a jar at room temperature, adding fresh milk to the jar each day. They can also be stored in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks.

Cook the underside of the eggs as normal.,
Add water and cover.,
Steam over low heat for a minute or two.,
Serve and enjoy.",How to Cook Over Easy Eggs2," This method allows you to get over easy eggs without having to flip them, making it perfect if you've had problems with flipping in the past. The first few steps are exactly the same as in the traditional method. See below:









Heat cooking fat (butter, grease, etc.) in a pan over medium or medium-low heat.
Crack the eggs into a separate container before transferring them to the hot pan.
Tilt the pan to gather the eggs at one end. Once they set, lower the pan flat and let them cook for about one to two minutes.

, Pour a tablespoon of water per egg into the edge of the pan. Cover it with a good-fitting lid. The water will turn into steam and cook the top side of the egg. This will give you the characteristic film over the yolk that over easy eggs are known for without any flipping.









If you're cooking on a flat griddle instead of a pan, pour the water right next to the egg, then set a raised lid over both the egg and the water. The lid will hold the steam next to the egg.

, Steaming doesn't cook the top sides of the eggs as quickly as contact with the pan, so you'll need to allow a little extra cooking time. The eggs are cooked to over easy when they're covered with a thin white film but the yolks are still liquid.









Be sure to reduce the heat to low hear to prevent the bottoms of the eggs from over-cooking from the heat of the pan.
If, after a minute or two, the eggs don't seem cooked, try turning off the heat and letting the residual heat warm them a little longer., You don't need to flip the eggs a second time with this method. Simply remove the lid (carefully, as to avoid steam burns) and transfer the eggs to a plate.

Season the eggs with salt and pepper.,
Eat the eggs over toast.,
Use hot sauce.,
Try unconventional herbs and spices.",How to Cook Over Easy Eggs3," Over easy eggs have a rich, almost creamy flavor on their own, but this doesn't mean they need to be eaten plain. Salt and pepper are extremely common condiments for eggs, complementing the natural egg-y flavor perfectly. Don't serve eggs without a pair of shakers at the table.









Some chefs like to season their eggs with salt and/or pepper in the pan. If you want to do this, sprinkle the seasonings on while the bottom sides of the eggs are cooking (before flipping them for the first time).

, Toast — white or wheat — goes great with eggs. Its crispness perfectly compliments the naturally soft texture of eggs. Best of all, when you're eating over easy eggs, you can use the toast to soak up the runny yolk. Alternatively, make an egg sandwich with your other favorite breakfast ingredients.









Substitute crisp fried hash browns for toast whenever desired.

, Eggs have a natural mild flavor, which makes them great candidates for spicy condiments. Hot sauces (e.g., Tabasco, etc.) drizzled over a serving of eggs can transform them from a run-of-the-mill dish into something with a little more pizzazz. Just be sure not to use too much.

, If you're willing to get a little adventurous, you can try seasoning your eggs with ingredients that you won't typically see at your neighborhood diner. The following herbs and spices each give their own unique taste to egg dishes. Try adding a small amount to your eggs at first — if you like the taste, feel free to add more!









Dill
Cayenne pepper (use a light dusting)
Basil
Sundried tomatoes
Sturgeon or whitefish

",How to Make Pickled Eggs," The following guidelines will help improve the taste of your homemade pickled eggs.

Try to get farm fresh or free range eggs. The higher quality of the eggs, the better the yolk will taste. Visit your local farmer's market to buy farm fresh eggs.



 


Since the eggs will be stored in the refrigerator before eating, you should choose eggs that are fairly fresh. However, make sure they are at least a few days old, since peeling fresh eggs can be difficult.






Choose small to medium eggs. The spices will penetrate the eggs more easily, resulting in a better taste.





;
,, Make sure there are 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5cm) of water above the eggs.

, This will help to keep the eggs inside their shells if they break.

, A roiling boil may crack the eggs.

,,

Some people prefer to hard boil the eggs by placing them in boiling water for 15 to 20 minutes. This depends upon your taste preference, since some people believe slightly softer yolks taste better.






Remove any eggs that cracked during the boiling process. These will not pickle well and should be used or eaten immediately.







,,, Place the lid with inside out beside it.

, Remove it and allow it to cool on the counter.

,,, Allow them to sit submerged for approximately 5 minutes.

, Crack it against the counter and peel it carefully. Repeat with the other eggs.

,,, Add 1/2 cup (0.1l) of apple cider vinegar and 1/4 cup (49g) of granulated sugar.


You can also substitute canned beet juice for part of the water to increase the intensity of the brining color.

, If this is your first time making pickled eggs, try 1 tbsp. (18g) of salt, 3 tbsp. (18g) of pepper flakes and 6 peppercorns.


For curried pickled eggs, try 1 tbsp. (6g) of yellow curry powder, 1 tsp. (2g) of mustard seeds, 3 cardamom pods and 1/2 cup (100g) of sugar.
You may choose to increase the amount of vinegar in your pickling brine to a ration of 1 cup water to 1 cup vinegar.

,, You can use a fresh beet or a canned beet.

, Allow the mixture to simmer for 10 minutes.

, Strain it through a mesh sieve.

, Fill the container as full as you can.

,, The eggs will be good for 1 to 2 weeks.

,"
"
Collect all of the materials listed below that you will need for the project.,
Choose a location to drop your egg.,
Establish your hypothesis of whether you think your created chamber will keep the egg safe from cracking once it is dropped.

,
Open the shoe box and pad all sides of the box with facial tissues and cotton balls.,
Open the egg carton lid and remove two eggs from the bottom carrier tray.,
Place 'cartoned' egg in the padded egg chamber.,
Hold box at the top of the stairs and ask a friend to time and signal you to go.,
Open box and check to see if the egg is broken.

,
Repeat the experiment 2 more times.,
Buy a presentation board and creatively display your experiment.",How to Build an Egg Drop Project,";
, It is recommended to use a stairwell where you can drop the egg chamber from at least the height of 12 feet (3.7 m).

,, Tape or glue may be used to keep the materials in place.

, Cut the bottom of the egg carton the carton where the two eggs once were held.  Dispose of or cook one of the eggs. Place the 2 bottom tray 'cups'- one on top of and one the bottom of the second egg and tape shut.

,  Seal the box shut with tape on all four sides.

, Have the friend record the amount of time it takes for the egg to hit the floor.

,, Record all results.

, Make sure to include all of the steps of the Scientific Method (Problem, Hypothesis, Materials, Procedure, Observations, and Results).  Include pictures of you completing the project on your board.

Select an appropriate container.,
Check that the egg beater or whisk and the bowl are free of oil or grease.,
Proceed to beat the egg whites and cream together.,
Use as required.",How to Beat Egg Whites and Cream," A metallic, glass, or ceramic container will work well, but be sure that they are cold. If you can chill them for 15 minutes beforehand, so much the better. If the bowl is not cold, the egg and cream mixture will not thicken or whip up.;
, Again, if the implements being used have oil or grease on them, the egg and cream mixture will not thicken or whip up.

, Whisk quickly and firmly.

Purchase a quart of fresh cream.,
Purchase sour cream starter culture.,
Prepare a jar and ventilated cover.,
Pour the quart cream into a heavy saucepan.,
Heat the cream to 145 °F (62.8 °C).,
Hold the cream at a steady temperature for 45 minutes.,
Cool the cream to 77 °F (25 °C).,
Dissolve the starter culture in the cream.,
Pour the cream into the jar and cover it.,
Store the jar in a warm spot for 16 to 18 hours.,
Store the sour cream in the refrigerator.,
Make it again using your sour cream as a base.",How to Make Sour Cream," Since you're going to the trouble of making sour cream, use the freshest cream you can find. Full-fat, organic heavy whipping cream is best. Pasteurized heavy cream ends up with a consistency closest to store-bought sour cream. If you prefer a thinner consistency or are looking for a low-fat option, you can use half and half instead.Unpasteurized raw cream is also a great base for sour cream. The result will be lighter than the sour cream made with pasteurized heavy cream.
Avoid ultra-pasteurized cream or half and half. This product produces inconsistent results when cultured.;
, Sour cream is produced by mixing cream with a bacterial culture that thickens the cream and gives it a slightly sour flavor. Sour cream starter culture contains milk as well as live, active cultures. It can be found in natural food stores or online and comes in packets (usually four or more to a box) with enough culture to make up to a quart of sour cream. Extra packets of culture can be stored in the freezer for up to 12 months.Live, active cultures in sour cream starter culture include lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris, Lactococcus lactis biovar. diacetylactis and Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. cremoris.
Once you have made sour cream with a starter culture, you can use that sour cream to make more. The process is similar to making sourdough bread with a sourdough starter.
If you do not want to track down sour cream starter culture, you can make a version of sour cream a tablespoon of cultured buttermilk per cup of cream. The consistency and taste will be more similar to that of buttermilk.
You can also make kefir cream, another type of cultured cream, using kefir grains.

, Sour cream should be stored in a clean glass jar. During the culturing period, it needs a ventilated cover to allow air to flow through the jar while also keeping out bugs and other contaminants. A tight-weave cloth, such as cheesecloth, makes a fitting lid when secured with a rubber band. For storage, you will need a regular airtight lid.


Be sure the jar is clean and sterile. If you've used the jar before, boil it for five minutes and let it completely dry before using it for sour cream.
If you don't have cheesecloth, a paper coffee filter also works as a lid.

, It's important to use a heavy saucepan made of copper or stainless steel. Using a heavy saucepan will allow you to control the temperature of the cream more easily than if you used a lighter aluminum pan.


If you don't have a heavy saucepan, you can also use a double boiler.
Or make a double boiler by filling a large pot with a few inches of water. Set a smaller pot inside the large pot so that it rests on the water. Pour the cream into the smaller pot.

, Turn the burner to medium heat to slowly heat the cream to the correct temperature. Take care not to let it get too hot. Use a candy thermometer to monitor the heat and make sure it reaches 145 °F (62.8 °C).


Heating the cream kills competing bacteria so that the bacteria in your starter culture can thrive in the cream. Heating ensures that the resulting flavor and texture will be delicious.If you don't heat the cream, the end product will be much thinner than regular sour cream.

, Keep the burner turned to the correct level so that you can hold the cream at 145 F; try not to let it drop too low or exceed this temperature. Holding the cream steady is necessary to ensure that the cream ends up thick and rich.

, Turn off the heat and remove the pot from the burner. Use a candy thermometer to monitor the temperature of the cream. It should rapidly drop once you remove it from heat.

, Put the entire contents of one packet of starter culture into the pot with the cooled cream. Use a spoon to stir the starter culture together with the cream until it fully dissolves.


Make sure the cream has sufficiently cooled, so that the live bacteria in the starter culture don't get killed when mixed with the cream.
If you're using cultured buttermilk instead of starter culture, stir in a tablespoon of cultured buttermilk per cup of cream. If you're using kefir grains, stir in the kefir grains.

, Secure the cheesecloth over the jar with a rubber band.

, In order for the starter culture to do its job, the cream must be stored at a temperature between 74 and 77 degrees Fahrenheit. This is just warm enough to keep the culture alive and thriving. A warm spot in your kitchen is usually the perfect place.


Don't store the culture in direct sunlight, since it may overheat the jar and kill the bacteria.
Check the jar every few hours to see if the consistency of the cream has begun to set. If not, the temperature may be too warm or too cold. After 16 to 18 hours, it should be the consistency of store-bought sour cream or slightly looser.

, Replace the cloth with a tight-fitting lid and store the sour cream until use. It will keep in the refrigerator for one to two weeks.

, Reserve a cup of your homemade sour cream, which contains the same live, active cultures as a starter mix. Using three cups of heavy cream, following the instructions for heating and holding the cream at a high temperature. Cool the cream, then stir in the cup of reserved sour cream. Follow the instructions for culturing the cream. Refrigerate it once it sets.

Cut a hole in the bread.,
Fry the bread.,
Add the egg.,
Fry the egg.,
Serve.",How to Make Eggs in a Basket1," In the middle of the bread, cut a hole with approximately a 2-inch diameter. An alternate way to prepare the bread is to cut a square into the bread with a knife.


Choose any bread you like. White, wheat, sourdough, baguette, rye - anything you'd like will make a tasty dish.
You can make a hole with a glass, a jar, or the top to cooking spray. Press the item into the bread and the hole should be easily removed.
To make a treat for the kids, you can also use fun-shaped cookie cutters to cut out the shape in the middle. Suggest that they use the remaining cut-out piece to dip in the yolk.
For a romantic breakfast, use a heart-shaped cookie cutter to cut out the center. If you don't have a cookie cutter, try cutting a heart with a knife.;
, Add butter to the frying pan. While the butter is melting in the pan, spread more butter on both sides of the bread. Place the bread in the pan. Fry the bread on medium until it begins to brown.Flip the bread over. Allow this bread to cook until it is a golden brown.


You can butter the removed ""hole"" and fry it along with the egg for an added treat. Many people dip this bread into the yolk.
You can also use vegetable, coconut, or grapeseed oil instead of butter.

, Before placing the egg in the hole, add more butter to the pan in the open hole of the bread. Crack the egg open and drop the egg into the hole.


If you would like less whites in the dish, separate the egg whites from the yolks. Place the yolk in the hole and add a small amount of whites. This will cause the egg to cook faster.Add ham or bacon to the egg, place a piece of cheese on top of the bread, or you can add spices, such as salt, pepper, or paprika for a slight variation.

, Let the egg cook for an additional minute or two. Then, carefully flip the bread to fry the other side. Make sure the egg whites are fully cooked. The whites should not be runny or jiggly.Before you flip the bread and egg, lift the edge of the bread up with a spatula. Make sure the egg has solidified and started to brown before you flip it over.The egg will start to set into the bread when it is done.
If you like runnier eggs, cook for less time. If you like harder yolks, cook for longer.Try spraying the top of the uncooked side with some cooking spray or adding butter before flipping to make sure it doesn't stick.
If you wish, season with salt and pepper, or even paprika and other spices, as you cook eat side of the egg.

, Place your eggs in a basket on a plate. You can eat it with a fork or like a piece of toast.

, Butter the bread on both sides and fit into the ramekins or muffin pan. Press them gently into the ramekins, allowing the edges to fold over each other.


Since this recipe is baked instead of fried, it is a healthier, calorie friendly variation. To cut calories and make a healthy dish, choose bread with less calories and carbs.
To cut even more calories, do not butter the bread. Instead, place it in the ramekins as is.
Another variation is to cut holes into a loaf of French bread instead of placing bread into the ramekins.Baking eggs into a French loaf is not a healthier, lower carb, calorie friendly option.

, Break one egg into each ramekin or muffin tin. Place into the oven and bake for approximately 20 minutes, or until the egg whites are cooked. If you would like harder yolks, cook for longer., After letting the ramekin or muffin tin cool, remove the bread bowls and place onto plates. Use a knife to loosen if the bread has stuck to the pan.


Sprinkle seasonings such as salt, pepper, paprika, or garlic on top for flavor. Other options include topping with shredded cheese, bacon or ham, tomatoes, or avocado.

Sauté the vegetables.,
Cook the eggs.,
Serve.",How to Make Eggs in a Basket3," Cut fresh brussel sprouts into halves or small slices. Grate or slice a sweet potato into small slices. Sauté the vegetables in coconut oil for about 3-5 minutes.


Add seasoning if desired. Salt, pepper, garlic, cumin, paprika, curry powder, chili powder, or anything else you'd like.
For the no-carb version, you will be using vegetables instead of bread. Choose two vegetables of different nutrient contents. Try brussel sprouts, sweet potatoes, kale, broccoli, cauliflower, spinach, or any other of your favorite vegetables.

, Reduce the heat and hollow out holes in the vegetables for the eggs. Crack an egg or two into the holes. Cover the pan and let cook. The eggs will be steamed, which takes about 5 minutes. Keep a check on the eggs until they reach your desired level of doneness., Use a spatula to remove the egg and vegetable dish from the pan and place on a plate. Sprinkle with seasoning if you wish.


You can also sprinkle a light amount of cheese or bacon into the vegetables while you are cooking, or add cheese and bacon on top. If you are doing this, make sure to choose high quality, nitrate-free, center cut bacon and all natural cheese.

Select the larger rings from the onion to become the egg “mold.” Typically, these will be found the closer to the center of the onion. Refrigerate the rest until the next time you need onions.

, Just a light dusting will do the trick. Don’t over season as you will be adding more seasoning after the eggs have cooked.

, By cracking the egg into the bowl first, you can remove any shells or avoid having a bad egg drop into your onion rings.

, Place the skillet over medium heat and give it a few minutes to heat up before adding food.

, Allow the rings to cook and brown lightly before adding the egg. If possible, you may want to turn the rings over a few times so both sides cook evenly.


The onion may start to brown. Add the eggs right before the onion turns to a darker shade of brown (because it may burn while the egg cooks if you add the egg too late).

, Gently allow the egg to slide from the bowl into the middle of the ring.

, Cook a small amount of your selected pasta to discern its quality. Good quality pasta will not stick together when it cooks. If your spaghetti is sticking together as you cook it, change brands.

, It may be a personal taste but there is a real difference in both taste and texture between fresh pasta and dried pasta. Fresh pasta will likely have a softer texture and breaks more easily, especially under the weight of heavy sauces. Fresh pasta is best for pastas with fillings, such as tortellini, ravioli etc. Dried pasta is best for non-filled pasta such as spaghetti, penne and rigatoni.

, Thick and chunky sauces are best for thick and substantial pasta types, such as penne, conchiglie, rigatoni or fusilli. Light and delicate pasta should only be graced by light sauces or even olive oil with fresh garlic and herbs. Use your common sense.

Select a large saucepan with a tight fitting lid.,
Measure the rice.,
Measure the water.,
Bring the saucepan to a boil.,
Leave to rest.",How to Cook Brown Rice1,"


A large saucepan is better for cooking rice than a smaller one as it has a greater cooking surface. This allows the water in the saucepan to heat more evenly, leading to a greater level of consistency in the cooked rice.
A tight fitting lid prevents steam from escaping when cooking.;
, One cup of uncooked rice will yield approximately three cups of cooked rice. Rinse the rice thoroughly in a sieve or strainer until the water runs clear. Add to saucepan.


For softer rice, soak the grains in cold water for 45 minutes to an hour before cooking. This allows the water to penetrate the outer bran layers.







Optionally, you can heat a little oil in the saucepan over medium heat and fry the rice for a moment before adding the water. This helps build flavor, but is definitely optional.

, Add 2 1/2 cups of water for every cup of brown rice. Lightly salt the water with about a teaspoon of salt. Stir once.


Other liquids, such as vegetable or chicken stock are also good for cooking rice and adding flavor.
It is important to accurately measure the correct amount of water or broth for the amount of rice you’re cooking, otherwise your finished product might turn out burnt or mushy.

, Then reduce the heat to low and simmer, covering the saucepan with a lid, until the rice is tender and the majority of liquid has been absorbed. Cooking time will vary according to the stove used.

Brown rice usually takes between 40 and 50 minutes to cook, however, you should begin checking it after 30 minutes to prevent it from burning.






Simmer the rice on the coolest burner on your stove, or on a simmer ring. The rice should be bubbling very slightly.







, Once the rice has finished cooking and all the water has boiled off, leave it to rest, with the lid on, for a minimum of five minutes. The rice will firm up as it cools slightly, allowing you to serve long, fluffy, unbroken grains of rice.


After the resting period, remove the lid and fluff up the rice with a fork - it should be light and fragrant!
Serve immediately, or let the rice cool for half an hour then refrigerate for future lunches.

Add less traditional vegetables to your pasta, such as freshly sautèed asparagus, fennel, or leeks.,
Microwave the fresh vegetables.",How to Add Vegetables to Pasta," For best results, add the vegetables to the water approximately 5 minutes before the pasta is done. This will minimize your cooking time because you prepare everything at once and has the added benefit of eliminating another dirty pan.


For additional flavor, you can sauté approximately 1 to 2 tsp (5 to 10 ml) of olive oil and 1 to 2 cloves of minced garlic while the pasta is cooking. Pour it atop the dish and mix well just before serving.;
, Choose an assortment of vegetables you enjoy, and set the slow cooker on low. Place the vegetables inside and let them sit for 1 to 3 hours, depending on how tender you prefer. Once they are done, pour them atop a bed of cooked pasta, which you can coat with some butter or olive oil.

, Remove the pasta from the water just before it is completely cooked, and drain in a colander. Toss the noodles into the pan with your vegetables, and sauté another minute. Make sure to mix the pasta and roasted vegetables well before serving.

, This can help keep the salad colder longer, which is a great trick for outdoor events. It can also save on preparation time.

, Stir the pieces with a few ounces of low-fat ricotta cheese, and you'll have a healthy alternative to the traditional version.

, This will thicken up your sauce and may add a bold flavor, depending on the vegetables you choose.

, Sauté them in a frying pan until tender, and then cut them into bite-sized pieces to add to your dish.

, Use enough water to cover the bottom of the container the vegetables are in. Set the timer for approximately one minute, and check the vegetables for doneness. Prepare your favorite pasta dish, and combine vegetables and pasta together.

, Spread the pasta across a shallow dish. A deep pile of pasta may heat unevenly.


If the pasta is dry, add a splash of milk or extra sauce to keep it moist. This is especially important for lasagna., The pasta is usually ready in 20 minutes, but check after 15 just in case. The foil should help trap moisture, slowing the drying process.


Optionally, add a sprinkle of Parmesan under the foil 5 minutes before the pasta is done., Stick a metal fork into the center of the pasta dish and wait for 10 to 15 seconds. If the tip of the fork is hot to the touch, the pasta is ready. If not, return the pasta to the oven."

Avoid using the microwave for cream sauces, wine and butter sauces, or other sauces likely to separate.

, If the pasta already includes sauce, just stir it to distribute it evenly. If the pasta is plain, stir in a little sauce or olive oil. This will help keep the pasta moist.

, A full power microwave will likely turn your pasta to mush. Reduce it to 50% power or below.

, Place the pasta in a microwave-safe container, preferably a round one to avoid uneven heating at corners.Cover it with one of the following two methods:


Cover with plastic wrap, but leave one corner open for steam to escape.This traps heat, warming the pasta more evenly.
Cover with a damp paper towel. This steams the pasta as it heats up, adding moisture to dry or sauce-light noodles.

, Heat the pasta for about 1 minute, then check on its progress and stir. If necessary, continue heating for 15–30 seconds at a time.


If your microwave does not have a turntable, stop and rotate the dish halfway through.

Heat water in the base of a double boiler.,
Place the sauce in the top of the double boiler.,
Add cream or milk to cream sauces.,
Add butter or reduced cream to wine sauces.,
Heat slowly, stirring occasionally.,
Add an egg yolk in emergencies.",How to Reheat Leftover Pasta Without It Separating or Drying Up5," This is by far the best method for cream-based sauces, such as Alfredo. The indirect heat ensures a more even, slower cooking method, reducing the chance of separation.


You can make your own double boiler out of two pans, or one pan and a glass, heat-safe bowl.
If a double boiler is not an option, use the stovetop method instead, over very low heat.

, If possible, heat the sauce separately, then pour over cold pasta or heat as described above. If the sauce and pasta are well mixed, just add them both to the container. Leave it here until the water begins to simmer.Reheating the pasta and sauce together shouldn't cause any major problems, but the risk of chewy or mushy noodles is a little higher.

, A cream sauce separates so easily because it is an ""emulsion,"" or suspension of fat and water. A fresh splash of cream or whole milk helps keep these together, reducing the chance that the sauce becomes an oily mess., Wine sauces are also emulsions, but the acidity can cause cream to curdle. To avoid these, mix in a little melted butter instead. Another option is reduced cream, meaning cream heated in a separate pan until some of the liquid has evaporated., The lower the heat, the less likely your sauce is to separate. Stir gently, to avoid breaking apart the ingredients. Eat while the sauce is hot.

, If the sauce ""breaks"" apart while reheating, take it off the heat and transfer a couple spoonfuls to a bowl. Rapidly whisk an egg yolk into the bowl until smooth, then transfer the mixture back to the sauce.If you're heating the pasta as well as the sauce, the egg yolk method gets messy. Try a small handful of flour instead, to thicken the sauce and cut the greasiness.
If you end up with lumps of cooked egg while whisking, discard that bowlful and try again with less liquid and faster whisking. If the lumps are small, just strain out the lumps and use the remaining liquid.

Season and enjoy.

",How to Cook Better Brown Rice," This is a good idea to do with most brown rice types, long grain, short, basmati, parboiled, etc. since it washes away any possible pesticide residue. It also helps lessen the formation of starchy bubbles when cooking. NOTE: do not soak the rice, only do a quick rinse lasting less than 2 minutes or else the rice would become overly soft when cooked.;
,, For every cup of rice your wish to prepare, bring 10 cups of water to a rapid boil (example: 2 cups brown rice = 20 cups of water.) This will yield around 6 to 7 dried cups of cooked rice.

, Prepare a pasta strainer in your sink.

, Stirring is not required.

,, However steam only if the rice grains still feel a little hard, otherwise steaming could overcook the rice and turn it to an undesirable mushy texture.

Once the water is clear, leave the rice in the bowl and set it aside.

,
Combine the rinsed rice and cold water to soak.,
Drain the water from the rice.",How to Cook Basmati Brown Rice1," Measure 2 cups (470 ml) brown basmati rice, and pour it into a medium-sized bowl of cold tap water., Use your hand to swish the rice around until the water becomes cloudy-looking and foam appears on the edges.While rinsing it can wash away some of the rice's nutrients, brown basmati rice is typically imported and may be processed with talc, powdered glucose and rice powder. Rice connoisseurs, therefore, recommend rinsing it.
Doing so will also get rid of some of the starch, which will help make your rice less gluey., Pour out the water through a mesh strainer or by tilting the bowl to the side. You can hold a plate over the bowl to keep the rice from spilling out as you drain the water., Add more cool tap water and repeat this process until the water is clear. This could require up to 10 rounds of washing the rice.,, Add 2.5 cups (590 ml) cold water to the drained and rinsed rice and let it soak between 30 minutes to 24 hours depending upon the method of cooking and how long you want to cook it. The longer you allow it to soak, the less time it will take to cook.


Additionally, basmati rice is known for its rich flavor, which can be lost during the heating process. Soaking it reduces cooking time, thus preserving more of its flavor.Soaking rice also improves its texture, making it softer and lighter., Use a mesh strainer to drain the water that has not been absorbed by the rice.


You can also use a colander, but the holes must be very small so the rice doesn't escape when you strain it.

Then, rinse the beans in cold water. You can use a colander to rinse them., Put the sorted beans into a bowl filled with two or three inches (5.1 or 7.6 cm) of water. The water should be at room temperature. Allow the beans to soak overnight. If you can’t soak them overnight, soak them for at least eight hours. Drain the bowl of all the water when the beans are finished soaking and rinse them in cool water one more time.Soak the beans in the refrigerator if your kitchen gets very warm.
Soaking the beans helps to remove indigestible sugars.

, You can also use a pressure cooker to cook the beans. Add four cups (946.4 mL) of water to the one cup (236.6 g) of beans. The water should rise an inch or two (2.5 or 5.1 cm) over the beans. If you choose to cook more than one cup of beans, then add four cups of water for each additional cup of beans., Reduce the heat when the water begins to boil. Let the beans simmer for about 45 minutes. If you have a pressure cooker, allow the beans to cook for three to five minutes., You can serve the beans as a side, or you can mix them into a salad, soup, or casserole. If serving as a side, add a small amount of butter and/or pepper to the beans for flavor. Fresh baby lima beans can last up to one week if stored in a refrigerated area, but cooked beans will only be good for one day even when refrigerated."

Scoop and serve.",How to Cook Basmati Brown Rice2," Add 2.5 cups (590 ml) water to a medium-sized cooking pot with a lid on the stovetop.


In order for the rice to cook properly, make sure you the lid has a tight seal so heat and steam aren't released.Always make sure your pot isn't too small because rice will triple in volume once cooked., As with pasta, salt is used to bring out the natural flavor in rice so it won't taste bland. It's not used to make it taste salty., Pour 2 cups (470 ml) rinsed and pre-soaked brown basmati rice to the pot and use a spoon to mix the rice with the water.This is the only time you'll stir the rice until it's done. Stirring it while it's cooking activates the starch and makes it either sticky or creamy., Turn the burner to high. Once the water comes to a boil, reduce the heat to low, cover and simmer for 15-40 minutes until all the water is absorbed.The time difference is largely based upon how long you soaked the rice.
If you soaked it for 30 minutes, your cook time will be closer to 40 minutes. If you soaked it overnight, your cook time will be closer to 15 minutes.
It's very important to turn down the heat and to simmer once the water boils. Rice that's cooked too fast on a high heat will be hard because the water will evaporate. The kernels will also break., Quickly remove the lid and use a fork to scoop out some of the rice. Immediately replace the lid. If the rice is tender and the water has fully absorbed, it's ready. If not, continue cooking another 2-4 minutes.


You may need to add more water if it's not tender but the water has fully absorbed. Start slowly by adding just a 1⁄4 cup (59 ml) of water.

, When done, take the pot from the burner and remove the lid. Place a folded kitchen towel over the pot, and promptly replace the lid.The towel will help to steam the rice, making it fluffier. It also absorbs extra moisture that would otherwise fall back onto the rice., Don’t lift the lid while you let the rice rest or you'll lose the steam necessary to fully cook it., Use a fork to fluff the rice while it's in the pot. Then let the rice sit uncovered for just a few minutes so it doesn't have a wet texture.Using a fork helps the remaining steam to escape and the grains to separate.

, Use a large spoon or a nonstick rice paddle spoon to scoop out the rice. Serve it now alone or as part of another dish.

Dish it out.",How to Cook Basmati Brown Rice3," There are a variety of rice cookers on the market, and they don’t all operate in the same way or have the same features.


For instance, some will have both white and brown rice settings. Others won’t have either.

, Use a wooden spoon or rice paddle spoon to mix 2 cups (470 ml) brown basmati rice and 3 cups (710 ml) of water into the inner pot of the rice cooker.Many rice cookers come with a dry measuring cup. However, they’re often only equivalent to to 3/4 of a standard cup.
Don’t use metal utensils when mixing or scooping because they can damage the non-stick coating of the inner pots.

, Generally rice cookers have two settings – cook and warm – so make sure you select cook. This will bring the water to a boil very quickly.


Once the rice has absorbed all the water, the temperature will rise past the boiling point of water (100˚C/212˚F). At this point, most rice cookers will then automatically switch to the warm setting.
This will typically take about 30 minutes.
The warm setting will hold the rice at a safe serving temperature until you turn off the cooker.

, As with the boiling method, don’t lift the lid while the rice is cooking or the water vapor needed to cook it will disperse., After it switches to warm, keep the lid closed and let the rice sit for 5-10 minutes to finish cooking., Carefully open the lid away from your face to avoid being burned by any excess steam. Use a wooden or rice paddle spoon to gently fluff the rice. , You can serve it now or save it for later in the refrigerator or freezer.


If refrigerating, put the rice into a bowl and cover with a lid or saran wrap. It should keep for 3-4 days. Don't leave it out for more than two hours before refrigerating.
If freezing, rinse it in cool water, place portions in zip lock bags and place them in the freezer. Thaw the rice in the baggies overnight in the refrigerator."

Those with spring valves generally have a bar or rod that rises; jiggler valves will rock and jiggle slowly at first and then rapidly; weight-modified valves will whistle and hiss as they lift up and down., Reduce the burner's temperature until the pressure cooker has stabilized and let the rice keep cooking.The total time from reaching high pressure until you're done should be between 12-15 minutes.


Again, the time depends upon the amount of time you pre-soaked the rice., Allow the temperature and pressure to drop naturally for about 10-15 minutes after turning off the heat. The safety-locking mechanism will disengage or an indicator will alert you that the pressure has dropped.Alternatively, put on oven mitts and place the pressure cooker in the sink. Run cold water over it to decrease the pressure. Then remove the valve and push the button/twist/press the lever to release water vapor and any remaining pressure.Either way, be careful while doing this and know from where the vapor will shoot out so you aren't burned., Use a fork to fluff the rice and serve now, or refrigerate or freeze for later use.

Swirl the rice around with a spoon for 1 minute.,
Drain the water out of the bowl.,
Repeat steps 2-4 until the water becomes clear instead of murky.,
Fill up bowl again and let rice soak for 30 minutes.",How to Cook Basmati Rice1," Use a measuring cup when dumping your rice into a bowl. Deviating from the quantity of ingredients will make your rice over or undercooked.If you want to make 2 or more cups of rice, maintain the same ratio of other ingredients.
You typically want to keep a 1:1.5 or 1:2 ratio of rice to water.;
, Use your sink to fill your bowl up with water. Don’t let it overflow or some rice may be lost.


The water should just cover the surface of the rice.

, Swirling your rice will remove the starch from it, which is the traditional method used to cook basmati rice. The water in your bowl should now look murky and cloudy.Removing the starch will prevent your rice from being overly sticky, which is popular among Japanese and Korean dishes., You can use a colander or a fine-mesh sieve to drain your rice.Make sure that all the water is drained out and you’re not letting rice fall into your sink.


If you don’t have a sieve or colander, you can tip your bowl on an angle to drain it.
Make sure you aren’t tipping the bowl too much or the rice may fall out.

, Continue to wash your rice and drain it, until the water in the bowl ceases to be murky. This indicates that you’ve washed away the rice’s starch and it can now attain a traditional basmati texture, once cooked.


This process will usually take 3 to 4 times before your rice is free of excess starch.

, Allowing the grains to soak will expand them, adding to the texture of the rice.Another added benefit to soaking is that the expanded grains are capable of soaking up more sauce from your dishes.

Simmer for 20 minutes.,
Serve.",How to Cook Arborio Rice1," Pour the water into a medium saucepan and set it on the stove over medium-high heat. Allow the water to reach a rolling boil.


Use a heavy-bottomed saucepan for best results. You'll need to avoid stirring the rice too often as it cooks, and if the saucepan is too thin, the rice can easily burn and stick to the bottom.
Vary the amount of water by 1/4 cup (60 ml) to change the consistency of the rice. Adding less water will create drier rice, but adding more water will create moister rice. Note that these changes may alter the final cooking time, as well.;
, Once the water begins boiling, add the oil (or margarine). If you also wish to add salt, do so now.


The boiling action may momentarily settle after you add these ingredients, but it should resume within 30 seconds. At that point, you can move onto the next step.

, Add the Arborio rice to the boiling water. Cover the pan and reduce the heat down to medium or medium-low.


After adding the rice, the boiling action should slightly settle. Stir the rice during this time while waiting for the water to begin boiling again. After it boils, reduce the heat as indicated.

, Let the contents of the saucepan simmer, undisturbed, until the rice absorbs all the water. This will usually take around 20 minutes when the water is at a gentle simmer.Avoid opening the pan since doing so will release steam. Similarly, avoid stirring the rice since doing so may break the grains.
When ready, the rice should be creamy but should still have some firmness or ""bite"" in the center of the grains (known as ""al dente"").

, Remove the rice from the heat and let it cool for another minute before serving it as a side dish.


You can serve the rice as it is, or sprinkle some Parmesan cheese and black pepper to taste.

Soak the beans.,
Replace the water.,
Add the bacon, if desired.,
Bring the pot of beans to a boil.,
Let simmer until tender.,
Add desired seasonings.,
Serve.",How to Cook Adzuki Beans1," Place the beans in a large stockpot and fill the pot with water. Allow the beans to soak in the water at room temperature for 1 to 2 hours.With most dried beans, it is recommended that you soak the beans before cooking them. Doing so softens the beans and also removes most of the water-soluble components responsible for digestive upset.
Note that with adzuki beans, however, you can often skip the soaking process without suffering adverse reactions. Soaking will make the beans slightly easier to digest, but it is not absolutely essential.
You can soak the beans anywhere from 1 hour to overnight.;
, Drain the water by pouring the contents of the pot through a colander. Rinse the adzuki beans several times under running water before returning them to the pot and adding fresh water.


The water will need to cover the beans by about 2 inches (5 cm).
Fill the stockpot with cold water so that the beans cook more evenly.

, If you want to add bacon to the beans, you can do so at this point. Cut the bacon into 1 inch (2.5 cm) pieces and place it directly into the pot of water and beans.Bacon gives the adzuki beans a smoky, salty flavor. As such, this works well if you intend to eat the beans on their own or want to add them to a hearty dish, like chili. It may not work so well if you intend to use them in a sweeter or milder dish.

, Cover the stockpot and bring the water up to a boil over high heat.

, As soon as the water reaches a boil, reduce the heat to medium and let the beans continue to simmer until they become tender enough to pierce with a fork.


If you soaked the adzuki beans beforehand, this should only take about 60 minutes. If you did not soak the beans or soaked them for less than an hour, you might need to wait closer to 90 minutes.
Tilt the lid slightly as the beans simmer so that steam can escape, thereby avoiding a build-up of pressure.
Periodically skim off excess foam that rises to the top of the water as the beans cook.
If necessary, add more water if too much of it seems to escape during the cooking process.

, The beans can be served or added to recipes as they are, but if you want something a little more flavorful, you can add salt, black pepper, garlic powder, chili powder, or your other favorite bean seasonings after turning off the heat and draining the beans.


You should drain the beans before adding your seasonings to ensure that the seasonings stick to the beans and do not get lost or diluted in the water.

, Drain the beans, if you have not done so in the seasoning step, and serve the beans while still hot.


You can serve adzuki beans in tortilla shells, in a bowl with a side of cornbread, or with cooked rice. The beans can also be added to casseroles, bakes, chili, and stew.
Alternatively, you can cool the beans and add them to fresh salads.
You can store cooked adzuki beans in airtight containers for five days in the refrigerator or six months in the freezer.

If you have nothing else that will work, you can hold the beans in your hands as you wash them. Keep a tight grasp so that they do not fall.;
, Turn on cold water from the tap. Set the green beans under the running water. If using a bowl or colander, move the beans around with your hands to make sure that they are evenly washed.


As you run water over the beans, remove visible dirt with your fingers.
The water you use to clean the beans should be water that is safe to drink. If it is not safe, use distilled or bottled water instead., You can remove extra bacteria from the beans by drying them with a towel after washing. Use paper towels to gently pat the green beans dry.Once the beans have been washed and dried, you can trim and prepare them for cooking.

Use or store the beans.",How to Cook Beans1," Pour the dry beans into a large bowl and pick through to remove any shriveled or unappealing beans. Cover the beans with two to three inches (5 to 7 cm) of water and leave them on the counter to soak overnight.Soaking the beans overnight (roughly 10 to 14 hours) reduces the cooking time required, helps them cook more evenly and makes them easier to digest by removing most of the sugar called oligosaccharide, which causes flatulence. If you’re in a rush you can speed up the soaking time by covering the beans in water, heating them to a boil for two minutes, then turn off the heat and allow them to sit undisturbed for an hour.Lentils, peas, and black-eyed peas do not need to be soaked before cooking.;
, Pour the beans into a colander to remove the soaking water. Rinse them under cold running water.

, Transfer the beans to a dutch oven or heavy cooking pot.


At this point you can add aromatics if you wish, such as half of an onion, garlic cloves, chopped carrots and/or bay leaves.

, Cover the beans with fresh water and place the cooking vessel on the stove top. Bring the water to a boil over medium-high heat for a few minutes.

, Reduce the heat to low and bring the beans to a very gentle simmer; you should barely be able to see the water moving.


Cover the cooking vessel with a lid that is slightly ajar for creamier beans used in soups, stews and burritos.
Leave the lid off the cooking vessel if you want firmer beans for salads and pasta dishes.

, Simmer the beans according to the recommended cooking time for the particular variety., Once the beans are just barely tender and nearly done cooking, you can add salt for flavor.


Avoid adding the salt too early as it can prevent the beans from becoming tender.

, You can now add your cooked beans to any recipe. If you wish to store them, measure out 1 1/2 cups (354.8 ml) of beans into a two cup storage container and the cooking liquid to cover, allowing 1/2 inch (1.27 cm) of headspace. Seal and store in the refrigerator for one week or in the freezer for up to one year.

Add 1 3/4th cups of water inside of a deep saucepan or pot.,
Add a teaspoon of salt to your water.,
Place your pot on a stove top and bring your water to a boil.,
Add your cup of rice to the pot.,
Stir rice until it comes back to a full boil.,
Turn your stove to low once the water starts boiling again.,
Cover the pot and let rice cook for 15 minutes.,
Let stand for 5 minutes and fluff with fork before serving.",How to Cook Basmati Rice2," If you are using 1 cup of rice, use anywhere from 1 ½ to 2 cups of water. Adding more water will make your rice more fluffy, while less water will make it taste tougher.


Don’t add too little water or your rice may not fully cook or come out burned.
If you use more than one cup of rice, make sure to adjust the amount of water you’re using.

, Adding salt to your boiling water will season the grains of rice, and allow your water to boil at a higher temperature, and thus more thoroughly.


Water typically boils 212 Degrees Fahrenheit, but when you add water it boils at 216 Degrees Fahrenheit.Adding salt after your rice is cooked could make it too salty., Set your stove to medium or high and wait until large bubbles break the surface of the water in your pot.


Though it depends on the amount of heat your stove is able to produce, your water should boil in anywhere from 5-10 minutes., While the water is boiling, add your rice to the pot of water. This should stop the pot from bubbling. Do not touch the heat settings on your stove.


Make sure to not drop the rice from too high up, to avoid splashing boiling water on yourself.

, Using a wooden or heat safe spoon, stir your rice until the water starts to boil again.


It should only take a couple of minutes for your water to return to a full boil.

, Once the water comes to a fierce boil again, lower your stove top settings to low. You should see the water in the pot simmer instead of large bubbles breaking the surface., Keep your stove’s heat settings to low as you continue to cook your rice. These directions are for typical basmati rice and not special varieties of basmati like wholegrain basmati rice, which takes longer to cook.Do not uncover the lid on your pot, because you’ll let the steam that’s cooking your rice out.
Do not stir the rice or it may become broken and mushy.

, Letting the rice stand for 5 minutes allows unfinished grains to fully cook, and the remainder of the water to evaporate. Afterwards, make sure to fluff it with a fork.


Fluffing rice with a fork separates the grains so there are no large clumps and the rice maintains a fluffy and light texture."
"
Fill a bowl with a 1:2 ratio of rice and water.,
Place in microwave and cook for 6-7 minutes on high, uncovered.,
Cover bowl with microwavable plastic wrap, leaving a vent on the side.,
Reduce microwave to medium (350W) and cook for another 15 minutes.,
Let stand for 5 minutes and fluff with fork before serving.",How to Cook Basmati Rice3," In a single, microwaveable bowl, add one cup of rice, and two cups of water. If you want to make more rice, make sure to add more water at the same ratio.For example, for 2 cups of rice you’d use 4 cups of water, for 3 cups of rice, 6 cups of water.
Make sure you have a big enough bowl.

, Amount of time you keep your rice in the microwave depends on its wattage.


For a 750W microwave keep your rice cooking for 6 minutes.
For a 650W microwave keep your rice in for 7 minutes., Covering your bowl with plastic wrap will steam it and completely cook it.Do not poke holes on the top of the plastic wrap.
Make sure to use wrap that can be microwaved.

, Refer to your microwave’s instruction manual to see how to reduce its settings to medium. Not reducing the settings could result in overcooked or burnt rice.


Do not stir your rice at any time during the cooking process., Your rice should not be completely cooked. Fluff with your fork to break up the rice before serving it.


Be careful when taking the bowl out of the microwave. It will be hot.

Only prepare 1 cup (250 ml) of dry Arborio rice at a time when using the microwave method.
You can add 1/4 cup (60 ml) more water if you prefer creamier rice or 1/4 cup (60 ml) less if you prefer drier rice. The cooking time should remain the same, more or less, but it's best to keep watch and remove the rice early if it appears finished before the full amount of recommended time.

, Loosely cover the dish and place it in the microwave. Cook it for 5 minutes on 100 percent power.If covering the container with its lid, open any top vents or leave the lid slightly ajar to prevent too much steam and pressure from building.
If the container does not have its own lid, cover it with a sheet of microwave-safe plastic wrap.

, Reduce the microwave power setting to 50 percent and continue cooking the rice for another 15 minutes.


Note that cooking times may vary depending on microwave wattage, so you'll need to watch the rice closely during the last few minutes. Remove the rice once you see that all of the liquid has been absorbed.
Check the texture of the finished rice to verify doneness. The grains should be moist, but they should also have a firm ""bite"" in the center.

, Remove the dish from the microwave and let it rest for another minute. Fluff the rice with a fork before serving it.


You can serve the rice plain or toss it with additional margarine, Parmesan cheese, or black pepper.

Gradually add the remaining liquid.,
Stir in the cheese and pepper.,
Serve with additional cheese.",How to Cook Arborio Rice3," Pour the broth into a 3-qt (3-L) saucepan and set it over medium-high heat. Allow the broth the reach a steady simmer.


As soon as the broth reaches a simmer, drop the heat to medium-low or low. It should continue to steam throughout the remainder of the process but should no longer simmer.

, Pour the oil into a separate, heavy 4-qt (4-L) saucepan or stockpot. Set the pan on the stove over medium-low heat.


Allow the oil to heat up for 30 to 60 seconds before continuing. It should not create smoke, but it should become warm enough to spread over the bottom of the pan with ease.

, Add the chopped onion (or chopped shallot) to the hot oil. Cook, stirring frequently, for about 4 minutes or until it becomes soft.


In addition to softening, the onion should also become slightly translucent and more fragrant.

, Add the garlic to the oil and onion. Cook while stirring for another 30 to 60 seconds, or until the garlic becomes more fragrant.Note that the garlic may also begin turning golden-brown, but you should not allow it to darken beyond that stage. Burnt garlic can easily ruin the flavor of the dish.

, Add the dry Arborio rice to the onion and garlic. Sprinkle everything with the salt, then stir well to combine.


Continue stirring for 2 to 3 minutes. The rice should be well-coated with oil and salt, and the edges should begin turning translucent. Note that the center should remain opaque, however.

, Add 1/2 to 3/4 cup (125 to 185 ml) of the warm broth to the rice, immediately followed by a splash of white wine. Cook for several minutes, or until the rice absorbs the liquid.Stir frequently while the rice continues to cook. Make sure that any rice gathering along the sides of the pan get turned back into the center of the mixture.
When it's time for the next step, the rice should begin sticking together. Drag the spoon along the bottom of the pot; the resulting trail should hold its form for at least several seconds before collapsing again.

, Add the remaining broth in 1/2 to 3/4 cup (125 to 185 ml) increments, following each addition with another splash of wine.


Stir and cook after each addition, allow the liquid to absorb in between each one, as well.
After 25 to 35 minutes, nearly all of the liquid should be used and absorbed. The rice should be creamy and tender, but it should still be ""al dente."" In other words, it should have some firmness or ""bite"" in the center of the grains.

, Remove the saucepan from the heat. Add the Parmesan cheese and black pepper to the risotto, then stir to combine.


Cover the saucepan with a lid and allow the risotto to sit for another 5 minutes off the heat.

, Transfer the risotto into individual serving dishes while it's still warm. If desired, enjoy the dish topped with additional Parmesan cheese.

Boil the water, salt, and butter.,
Add the rice and let it simmer.,
Combine the milk, sugar, vanilla, and cinnamon.,
Add the cooked rice and continue simmering.,
Serve with additional cinnamon.",How to Cook Arborio Rice4," Combine the three ingredients in a medium saucepan. Set the pan over medium-high heat and allow the water to reach a boil.


It's best to use a heavy-bottomed saucepan. You will not be able to stir the rice much as it cooks, and thin pans are more likely to burn the sitting rice.

, Stir the Arborio rice into the boiling water. Reduce the heat to low, and allow the rice to cook at a simmer for 15 minutes.


When you add the rice to the water, the boiling activity should settle. Wait for the water to return to a boil before reducing the heat.
Do not stir the rice as it simmers. Instead, gently agitate the pan by moving it from side to side every few minutes. Doing so should help prevent the rice from burning.
Continue cooking the rice until it absorbs all of the moisture. Test for doneness by sampling the rice; it should be ""al dente"" at this point, meaning that it still has some firmness in the center of the grains., Add these four ingredients to a separate medium saucepan. Set the pan over medium heat and bring it to a steady simmer.


You can either do this step while the rice cooks or wait until after it finishes cooking. If you wait until after, remove the pan of rice from the stove while the milk mixture heats up.

, Transfer the cooked rice to the simmering milk mixture. Reduce the heat to medium-low, and cook the mixture for 10 to 15 minutes.When ready, the rice should absorb most of the milk. The resulting pudding should be thick and glossy.

, Transfer the rice pudding to individual serving dishes. Garnish the top of each serving with a light dusting of cinnamon. You can serve the pudding warm, at room temperature, or chilled.

Soak the beans.,
Drain the water.,
Place the beans in a pressure cooker.,
Cook until tender.,
Serve.",How to Cook Adzuki Beans2," Place the adzuki beans in a medium to large saucepan or bowl and fill the container with enough water to cover the beans. Let the beans soak overnight at room temperature.


Strictly speaking, it is not essential to soak adzuki beans. You can cook them in a pressure cooker without pre-soaking them, but pre-soaking will reduce the cooking time and can also help strip away any water-soluble components responsible for digestive upset.
If you want the beans to keep their color, shape, and aroma, do not soak them before cooking them.

, Pour the beans and water through a colander to drain them. Rinse the beans under running water several times.


Rinsing the beans after draining them will remove more of the water-soluble fibers still clinging to the outer skin of the beans.

, Transfer the drained beans to a pressure cooker and add 2 cups (500 ml) of cool water. Cover the pressure cooker and set it to cook on high pressure.

, If you soaked the beans, this should only take 5 to 9 minutes. If you did not soak the beans, this can take 15 to 20 minutes.Drain any excess water when done by pouring the contents of the pressure cooker through a colander again. Note that there should not be much water left after the beans finish cooking, though.
When ready, the beans should be tender enough to pierce with a fork.

, Serve the adzuki beans alone while still hot or add them to your favorite bean dish recipe.


If serving the beans warm, you can serve them with tortilla shells, cornbread, or rice. You can also add them to casseroles, bakes, chili, and stew.
If you decide to let them cool, you can enjoy the beans mixed into a green mixed salad.
If you have leftovers, you can store the cooked adzuki beans in an airtight container for five days in the refrigerator or six months in the freezer.

Use or store as needed.",How to Cook Adzuki Beans3," Place the adzuki beans in a medium saucepan or glass bowl and fill the dish with water. Let the beans soak at room temperature overnight.


In many applications, it is not essential to soak adzuki beans. For bean paste, however, you should soak the beans to soften them and to remove water-soluble elements that can cause digestive upset.

, Drain the beans by pouring the contents of the saucepan through a colander. Rinse several times under running water and add them back to the saucepan along with fresh, cool water.


Rinsing the beans after soaking them will help clean off any dirt or water-soluble fibers still clinging to the outer skins.
Make sure that there is at least 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) of water above the beans when you return them to the saucepan.
Keep in mind that the beans will roughly double in size by the end of the cooking process, so make sure that the saucepan is big enough to contain them.

, Transfer the saucepan to the stove and turn the heat on high. Let the beans come to a boil, uncovered.


Turn off the heat after the water begins to boil. Cover the saucepan and let the beans sit for 5 minutes on the stove with the heat off.

, Pour the contents of the saucepan through your colander again to drain off this initial bit of cooking liquid.


There is no need to rinse the beans this time.

, Return the adzuki beans to the saucepan and pour just enough water into the pan to cover the beans. Turn the heat on high and let it reach a boil.

, After the water reaches a boil, turn the heat down to medium-low and let the beans continue to cook at a simmer. You will need to do this for 60 to 90 minutes.


Keep the beans uncovered as they cook.
Periodically use a slotted spoon to push the beans floating on the top underneath the surface of the water.
Add water as needed throughout the cooking process. The water will evaporate, and as a result, the water level will decrease as the beans continue to cook. You need to have enough water to cover the beans.
On the other hand, adding too much water can cause the beans to move around too violently and break apart.
To test the beans for doneness, pick up one bean and squeeze it with your fingers. You should be able to mash it with your fingers very easily.

, Add the sugar in three separate batches, stirring after each addition. Turn the heat up to high and cook until the beans reach a paste-like consistency.Stir the beans constantly after adding the sugar.
Let the beans continue cooking on high heat even after they reach a boil.
Turn off the heat with the paste reaches the right consistency, but do not remove the saucepan from the stove yet.

, After the sweet adzuki bean paste cools slightly, sprinkle the salt in and give the mixture a final mixing with a wooden or plastic mixing spoon.


The paste should still be warm, but not so warm that it is burning-hot to the touch.
The consistency should thicken further and become more solid as the bean paste cools.

, Pour or spoon the bean paste into a separate container. Cover loosely and let it cool to room temperature on the counter.


Do not leave the anko (bean paste) in the pot as it finishes cooling.

, You can use your finished sweet adzuki bean paste in your favorite Asian desserts and snacks, including mochi, anpan, daifuku, dango, dorayaki, manju, taiyaki, mooncakes, and chalboribbang.


Any bean paste that is not used immediately should be kept in an airtight container and placed in a refrigerator for up to a week or a freezer for up to a month.

Repeat if necessary.",How to Clean Green Beans2," If you are cleaning beans fresh from the garden, the best way to remove dirt is to soak the beans. Fill a bowl or basin with cold water. There should be enough to cover the beans., Place the beans in the bowl, and let them soak for one to two minutes. Use your fingers to rub away dirt. You can also move around the beans with your fingers. Before you drain them, let any dirt or soil settle to the bottom of the bowl., After a minute or two of washing, pour the beans into a colander. The water will drain from the bottom. If you do not have a colander, fold some paper towels, and set the beans on top. They will drain into the towel.


If you are not eating the beans right away, pat them dry with a paper towel. Make sure they are completely dry before storage, as damp vegetables may spoil faster in the fridge., There may still be dirt on your green beans. Fill the bowl with clean water, and rinse them again. Do this until all of the dirt has been removed from the beans.

Avoid produce washes.",How to Clean Green Beans3," Before cleaning the green beans, wash your hands with warm water and antibacterial soap for at least twenty seconds. This is especially important if you have been touching raw meat or eggs. Always wash your hands between handling meat and working with produce., If you are cutting the green beans with a knife, make sure that you are using a different cutting board than you are for raw meats. This will help prevent cross-contamination and food-borne illness caused by bacteria, such as E. Coli and Salmonella., If you see mold on the green bean, toss the bean out, as well as any other beans that the mold might have spread to. Do not try cutting away the mold and eating the rest of the bean, as this might be risky with green beans., Many commercial produce washes are unnecessary when washing green beans. They are not any more effective at cleaning green beans than water is."

",How to Add Rice to a Crock Pot Recipe,"


While many recipes can have rice added to them, not all recipes will pair well with the addition of rice. A chicken and vegetable recipe would pair great with rice whereas an apple crisp cooked in the crock pot would not pair well with rice.;
,


There are many different kinds of rice, each with its own suggested cooking time. White converted rice will cook much more quickly than brown rice. Wild rice takes the longest to cook.

,


Unless your recipe states differently, rice should be added to the crock pot at the end of the cooking time. Rice left to cook in the crock pot for hours tends to become mushy and tasteless. Always add sufficient water or liquid to cook the rice. Follow the guidelines below.
White converted rice should be added to the crock pot with about 2 hours left of cooking time; add an additional 1 1/2 cups (360 ml) of water or other liquid per 1 cup of rice to the crock pot. Cook on low heat.
Brown rice should be added to the crock pot with 3 hours left of cooking time; add an additional 1 1/2 cups (360 ml) of water or other liquid per 1 cup of rice to the crock pot. Cook on low heat.
Wild rice should be added to the crock pot with 3 hours left of cooking time; add an additional 2 cups (480 ml) of water or other liquid per 1 cup of wild rice to the crock pot. Cook on low heat.

,


Another option for adding rice to a crock pot recipe is to prepare the rice on the stove top and add it to the crock pot during the last few minutes of cooking time. Simply prepare the rice according to the directions on the package. The rice can even be made ahead of time and refrigerated until you're ready. If the rice is cold, simply add it to the crock pot with 30 minutes left of cooking time.

Prepare your green beans.,
Salt a large pot of water.,
Place your pot of water on the stove to boil.,
Prepare an ice bath.,
Place your green beans into the boiling water a few at a time.,
Remove the green beans from the pot.,
Place your green beans in the ice bath immediately.,
Wrap the green beans in a paper towel.",How to Blanch Green Beans1," Rinse your beans thoroughly with water and snap the ends off of each bean.









Only snap about a quarter inch off of the ends. Try to leave as much of the bean intact.
Snapping too much off the ends leaves the inside of the bean exposed. This can cause a loss of flavor and crunch when boiling them in water.;
, Salting is crucial for seasoning the beans as well as preserving their natural taste.









Though you do not have to include salt in your water, doing so will help prevent nutrients and flavors from seeping out of your beans.Salted water has a higher density than the water inside the beans. This helps keep most of the taste concealed in your beans rather than having them leak into the boiling water.
Salt your water liberally. The general rule of thumb is that blanching water should be ""ten times saltier than the sea."" If you have trouble judging by taste, simply add a couple of tablespoons of kosher salt for every quart of water in your pot.Salting your beans generously helps maintain that bright green color, which is great if you intend on presenting a colorful dish.It also ensures that the beans will be seasoned evenly.
Don't worry about your beans tasting too salty. They will only be in the boiling water briefly and won't soak up as much salt as you think., Make sure the water volume is at least twice as much as the amount of beans you intend to blanch.









Though you may be blanching only a few green beans, using a big pot is ideal because it minimizes the length of boiling time. The goal of blanching is to cook the beans as quickly as possible to avoid losing crunch and color.Keep your water at a steady boil. Pay attention to the bubbles in your pot. Small bubbles forming at the edges of the pot are just air bubbles from the water and don't necessarily mean your water is boiling. When big bubbles begin to steadily stream from the bottom of the pot, your water is ready to go., An ice bath is essential for the second main step of blanching, which is ""shocking"" your beans in cold water to stop the cooking process.








Fill a large bowl with water that is cold or at room temperature. Grab some ice cubes from your freezer and distribute them evenly throughout the water.
Avoid preparing your ice bath early in your cooking process. The goal of shocking your beans is to stop the cooking that is still taking place inside the bean. Leaving your ice bath out at room temperature may decrease the effectiveness of shocking your beans.
Don't prepare the ice bath after the cooking process. Shocking needs to occur immediately after beans have been boiled so that they do not become overcooked in their own steam.Also avoid preparing an ice bath while your beans boil. Since it is a quick process, you can easily lose track of time and overcook your beans.

, Let them sit in the water for about 2 minutes.








Don't overcrowd your beans. Steadily distributing them will ensure even seasoning and cooking.
Taste a green bean a minute or so after boiling. It should taste crisp yet cooked.If your green beans are tender, you have overcooked them., Use tongs or a strainer to carefully scoop them out of the boiling water.









Don't feel rushed. Although blanching requires speed, it also requires care. You don't have to scoop out all of your green beans in one go.

, As you scoop out the beans from your water, immerse them evenly in the bowl of ice water.









Avoid setting your beans down on a surface before shocking them in water. The longer your beans sit, the more they continue to cook.Keep your beans in the ice water until they have cooled down completely. Removing them before they have fully cooled allows cooking to continue from the inside out, which can result in a mushy final product.Also avoid keeping the beans in the ice bath for too long. If you can't feel any more warmth with your fingertips, the beans are likely cooled. Keeping the beans in the water for too long risks making them heavy and soggy., Allow them to fully dry before eating or mixing them with other foods.









Pat your green beans while they are inside the paper towel. This will help speed up the drying process.Skipping the drying process risks making the beans soggy and defeating the purpose of blanching, which is to achieve a crispy texture.

Prepare the rice.,
Rinse the rice if needed.,
Soak the rice.,
Steam the rice.",How to Make Sticky Rice1," Measure out the uncooked rice in a pot or steamer. If making more rice, be sure to leave room for an additional 1/2 to 1 cup of water per cup of rice.






;
, Rinsing or washing rice takes out nutrients as well as some of the starch components of the grains. However, it is optional for the taste. To wash, add water to the rice, rub the rice in your hands, drain the milky water, add new water, and repeat the process until the water is clear.









Whether or not rice requires washing will depend on where you live and where you have sourced the rice from. In most developed countries, rice does not require washing for the purposes of cleaning it.


, Add the water to the rice grains and leave it on the side to soak between 4 hours and overnight. The longer the rice is soaked, the more the texture will be.

, Drain the rice grains through a colander to get all of the water out. Use a Thai bamboo rice basket or a wire mesh rack over a steamer to cook the rice.









Wrap the rice in muslin, and steam on one side for 15 minutes. Turn the rice over, and cook for another 15 minutes. Do not overcook the rice or it will become mushy. It should be sticky, but not watery, and hold together well.

Blanch your green beans in the microwave.,
Use steam to blanch your green beans.,
Sauté your green beans in a skillet after blanching.",How to Blanch Green Beans2," Substitute a casserole dish and microwave for a pot and stove.









The steps are generally the same as blanching on the stove with a few minor tweaks. Instead of keeping your green beans whole, chop them into small pieces. Put salt on them directly instead of in the water.
Fill a casserole dish with 3 quarts of water. Place two cups of green beans into the dish and cover. Microwave the casserole dish for 5-6 minutes, stopping to stir at least twice throughout the cooking process. Shock and dry the beans as you normally would after boiling.
This technique is best for smaller quantities of green beans and for when you may not have access to a pot or stove. Know that microwaving may not be as effective as boiling when trying to achieve crunchier and brighter green beans., Replace your pot and water with a basket and steam.









Use a pot with a tight lid and a steam basket that holds food at least three inches above the pot. Put an inch or two of water in the pot and bring it to a boil. Place your green beans in a single, even layer so that the steam reaches all parts quickly.Cover the pot with the lid and keep the heat on high for about 3-4 minutes. Shock and dry the green beans how you typically would.
Steam blanching, while a nice alternative to water blanching, is not as efficient. It takes approximately 1 1/2 times longer to steam blanch green beans than to water blanch them.Using steam is typically advised for specific vegetables, such as broccoli or sweet potatoes. Though you can blanch all vegetables in steam, water blanching green beans is quicker and more effective.

, Though this is not a substitute for water blanching, it is a nice flavor supplement to your already crispy green beans.








After drying your beans, heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add oil and butter and Sauté the mixture for about 30 seconds. No exact measurements are required; just add enough oil and butter to fully coat your beans. Add the beans and continue to Sauté until they are coated in butter and heated through. Remove the beans from the skillet and add lemon zest, salt, and pepper.
For even greater flavor, mix red pepper flakes and garlic into your butter before sauteing your beans.

Alternately, pour light lemon squash over the rice instead of water as the sugar content of the squash combines with the starch content of the rice and gives an extra sticky finish.

,, There are two methods in making this type of rice: using a pot, and using rice cooker.









Rice cooker: Leave the water used to soak the rice in the cooker for about 15 to 30 minutes. Add a pinch of salt in the cooker and stir gently. Put the cooker on.
Pot: Add the rice and about 1 to 1 1/2 cups more water than rice. Leave it to soak for 20 minutes to 4 hours.
Add about 1/2 to 3/4 teaspoon of salt in the pot.
Bring it to a boil and immediately lower the heat once it reaches to that point.
Simmer the rice for about 10 minutes.

Avoid sweets.",How to Choose the Healthiest Salad Bar Options," Decide in advance if you want to eat a full plate of salad, a few small salads, or half of a salad with a meal. This will help you fill your portion with nutritious foods. Remember that your salad should be just as balanced as any plate of food you'd eat at a meal. You'll need to include:Complex carbohydrates
Healthy proteins
Good fats
A variety of vegetables;
, If you know you'll be going to a certain restaurant or cafe for lunch or dinner, get on their website to see the menu. Many restaurants with a salad bar will list some of their offerings, so you can get an idea of what to expect.

If the restaurant doesn't list their salad bar options, call the restaurant and ask them for details, especially if you're looking for specific foods.

, Try to eat healthy balanced meals before you go to the salad bar. This may help you feel more accountable and continue eating healthily. You'll also be less likely to fill up on unhealthy foods or large portions.If you have to wait a long stretch of time before eating at the salad bar, keep a few healthy snacks around, so you're not starving when you get to the restaurant.

, Instead of adding a little bit of everything on the salad bar, walk and look at the entire bar first. This will give you an idea of what is available and what looks the best to you. For example, you might have read that the salad bar offered spinach greens, but if they look wilted, you might want to eat a different type of green instead.

Putting a little bit of every kind of food can create food waste or cause you to over eat.

, If you're at a small salad bar, they may just offer iceberg lettuce and romaine lettuce. While iceberg lettuce is low in calories, it doesn't offer very many nutrients. Instead, pick romaine lettuce, spinach, or a spring mix which contain vitamins and minerals like vitamin C, folate, and lutein.Try to fill much of your plate with greens, since this will be the base of your salad.

, You'll probably find a variety of vegetables at the salad bar. Look for vegetables that aren't marinating in oil. You can add shredded or sliced vegetables in a variety of colors, so you get a range of vitamins and minerals. Just limit your intake of corn which is high in calories. You can add:Tomatoes
Bell peppers (in any color)
Fresh mushrooms (not marinated)
Shredded carrots
Broccoli florets

, If you want a little burst of sweetness, you can add slices or cubes of fresh fruit. Most salad bars will offer sliced melon, grapes, or strawberries. Just ensure that the fruit isn't floating in a sugar syrup. You should also avoid adding too many dried fruits. Dried fruits can be high in sugar and calories.For example, choose halved grapes instead of raisins. You should also avoid dried cranberries, since these are usually coated in sugar syrup to sweeten them.

, Salad bars offer a number of healthy proteins for any diet. Most bars will have slices of hard-boiled eggs, cottage cheese, or grilled chicken, which is low-fat and a good source of protein. If you're vegetarian, you can probably find cubes of tofu, black beans and chickpeas.Remember to plan how much protein you want to consume, so you don't overload your salad. You may want to stick to around 1/2 cup of protein.

, Look for an olive oil and vinegar-based dressing. If there are labels on the bottles, try to choose a dressing that only has a few ingredients. Choose a vinaigrette like lemon poppy seed vinaigrette, balsamic vinaigrette, or red wine vinaigrette to get maximum flavor with fewer calories.Regardless of the dressing you choose, limit your amount to 2 tablespoons.

, You may not think of carbohydrates at the salad bar, but several options are high in fiber and carbs. Beans (like garbanzo beans, kidney beans, or black beans), quinoa, rice, and corn can quickly load your salad with carbs. Decide which of these you'd like to include in your salad, so you don't overdo it.Limit the carbs to 1/2 cup, but don’t omit them completely. Having some carbs in your salad can help to make it more satisfying.
Avoid crackers and rolls if you are watching your carbohydrate intake or calorie count. These are less nutrient-dense than other carbohydrate options.

, Most salad bars will have crumbled bacon (or bacon bits), salami, or ham to choose from. Avoid these highly processed meats because they can be high in sodium and nitrates.

You should also avoid fried chicken strips at the salad bar, since these will be high in fat and calories.

, Once you've assembled a healthy salad, you don't want to overdo it with garnishes that offer little to no nutritional value. These are usually the crunchy items next to the dressings. Try to avoid these altogether on your healthy salad:Croutons
Shoestring fried onions
Tortilla strips
Candied nuts

, A little shredded cheese is a great way to add some calcium and flavor to your salad, but avoid piling it on. Cheeses like cheddar and parmesan are high in fat and calories, so choose reduced-fat cheese, if possible.For example, sprinkle just a little feta or blue cheese on your healthy salad. You can also tear up a stick of reduced-fat cheese, so you can track how many calories you're adding.

, You'll probably see a number of cream-based dressings (like ranch, thousand island, or blue cheese). These are usually high in saturated fats and calories since they're made with oil, cream, and cheese. You should also avoid Italian dressings that are made with lots of oil and cheese.Keep in mind that just because a dressing says it's ""Light"" or ""Low-Fat"" doesn't make it a healthy choice.

, If there are any sweets, such as pudding or Jello on the salad bar, then make sure to avoid these as well. These extras will add calories and sugar without much (if any) nutritional content. If you want to have something sweet after you finish your salad, then have some fresh fruit for dessert."

Top your salads with a portion of beans.,
Add a handful of nuts to your salad.,
Try salmon with your salad.",How to Keep Salads Cholesterol Friendly1," Beans are high in soluble fiber, which binds to cholesterol and prevents it from entering your circulation. Research studies have indicated that adding half a cup of cooked beans to your salad (when eaten once daily for two months) can substantially reduce your high cholesterol.When adding beans to your salad, plan to start with common varieties including black and pinto beans. These should all be in stock at your local grocery store. Once you’re familiar with these types of beans, you can branch out into less common types of bean including garbanzo and navy beans.


Other legumes will have the same beneficial effect of lowering bad cholesterol: try adding a handful of sprouts, a dollop of hummus, or a serving of falafel to your next salad.;
, Topping your salad with a moderately sized handful of nuts, such as almonds, pecans, or walnuts, can decrease your LDL (bad) cholesterol by 10%. If you’re not in the mood for nuts on your salad, consider substituting a handful of healthy seeds, such as sesame, sunflower, or flax seeds.In addition to providing healthy, unsaturated fats and delicious flavors, nuts are also a substitute for high-cholesterol croutons. Croutons, as with many other breads and grain products, are high in bad cholesterols.

, Unlike other types of fatty, unhealthy meat, salmon is actually quite healthy when added to a salad. Salmon is a fatty food, but its fats are good for your health: the fish is high in omega-3 fatty acids, which boost your heart health and can help lower LDL cholesterol.Salmon is a rich fish with plenty of flavor, so you won’t need to put a large amount on a salad in order to taste the fish.


Like most fish, salmon can be pulled apart into neat “flakes” once it’s been cooked. Cook your salmon—say, a quarter pound—and then flake off as much as you please on top of your salad.

"
Limit the amount of meat you put on your salad.,
Skip the creamy dressing on your salad.,
Hold the cheese.",How to Keep Salads Cholesterol Friendly2," Meat is high in fats and bad cholesterol, and should be put on a salad only sparingly, if at all. High-fat meats and fried meats—such as bacon—are among the least-cholesterol-friendly types of meat to put on a salad. Fatty meats are high in saturated fats and cholesterol, both of which raise the level of ""bad"" LDL cholesterol in your body.If you enjoy meats on your salad, opt for a leaner cut. Look at your local deli for lean cuts of meat (those that contain less fat), or purchase a package of cold-cuts that is marked “low fat.” Opt for lighter meats—such as turkey and chicken—over fatty pork and beef.

, Creamy, rich salad dressings tend to be high in fats—especially saturated fats—which will increase the levels of cholesterol on the salad.Avoid these fatty salad dressings; to check which dressings are relatively high in saturated fats, examine the nutrition facts label on the back of the salad-dressing bottle. Thinner, vinegar- and oil-based dressings—such as balsamic vinaigrette—will contain less bad cholesterol than rich, creamy dressings including ranch and blue cheese.


You can also skip the dressing altogether, and substitute a few cut-up pieces of fruit. Slice a sweet and juicy fruit (like an orange or a handful of strawberries) into bite-sized cubes and toss the fruit in with your salad.

, If you normally put shredded or crumbled cheese on your salads, you may want to reconsider. Many of the types of cheese commonly added to salads—such as feta, blue cheese, cheddar, mozzarella, and gouda — are high in saturated fats, which are directly linked to LDL cholesterol.If you’d still like to serve cheese on your salad, look at your local grocery store for cheeses marked “low fat,” as these will have fewer saturated fats and less cholesterol. Serve these cheeses in moderation on your salad.
You can also add a dollop of cottage cheese to your salad, as cottage cheese is low in cholesterol.

Innovate with your lettuce choices.,
Add a variety of vegetables to the salad.,
Include a sliced avocado with your salad.",How to Keep Salads Cholesterol Friendly3," Lettuce is the foundation of most types of salad, and many types of lettuce or lettuce-substitutes should be available at your local grocery store. When choosing a lettuce for your salad—romaine, iceberg, green leaf—be aware that they’re all cholesterol-friendly.Use the type of lettuce that you prefer, or change the types you eat for the sake of variety.


If you’re tired of the three mentioned types of lettuce, consider expanding to spinach leaves, spring leaves, kale, or a mix that combines multiple types of lettuce.
Spinach is a healthy and delicious lettuce substitute; it’s high in fiber (a cup of spinach contains 6 grams of fiber), which helps your body lower its levels of cholesterol., Nearly all garden vegetables are very low in fats and contain no saturated fats, making them ideal candidates for you to include in salads. It’s especially important that you include veggies that are high in antioxidants, which help lower your body’s cholesterol levels. When you’re shopping for salad ingredients at your local grocery store, look for veggies like: cabbage, carrots, onions (either raw or cooked), soy beans, and tomatoes.Many of these ingredients can be chopped and served on top of your salad, while others—including cabbage—can be used in the place of lettuce itself.

, Although avocados are a fatty food, they contain significant amounts of good, healthy fats—including oleic acid and monounsaturated fats—and do not contain high amounts of saturated fats. Consequently, avocados will help raise your levels of good cholesterol, and lower levels of bad cholesterol.Avocados are commonly served as a garnish on the top of a salad. Cut each avocado half into thin slices, and arrange these on top of your salad. Alternately, cut each avocado half into half-inch squares, and sprinkle a half-cup or so on top of your salad.

Make a tuna salad to encourage low cholesterol.,
Build your salad around grapefruit and green apples.,
Dress your salad with a light oil-based dressing.",How to Keep Salads Cholesterol Friendly4," Fishes like tuna have healthy fats and low cholesterol, so make a flavorful and healthy topping to a salad. Begin your salad with a base of mixed greens (spinach, romaine, etc.), and top it with a 2- or 3-ounce portion of tuna. For additional flavor and textures, add about 2 tablespoons each of healthy grains including sunflower seeds, dried cherries or raisins.Dress your tuna salad with a balsamic vinaigrette, or lightly garnish it with an oil-based dressing.

, These low-fat fruits are also high in fiber, which will help keep your cholesterol levels low. To make this minimalist salad, cut up and combine 2 ½ cups of grapefruit with 1 ½ cups of green apples. If you would prefer not cut up the grapefruit—which could result in a large amount of liquid in the salad—try pulling the slices into finely “shredded” segments.Mix in 2 or 3 tablespoons of diced walnuts for added flavor, texture, and heart-friendly omega 3 fatty acids.
Serve the salad immediately. If you find it tastes under-seasoned, salt and pepper the salad to taste.

, Oils commonly used to dress salads include extra virgin olive oil, canola oil, peanut oil, and flaxseed oil. Compared to thick, creamy salad dressings, these contain a higher percentage of healthy fats that help reduce cholesterol levels. They are still high-fat foods, so use a small amount with other flavorful ingredients. For example, mix ½ cup of olive oil with 2 tablespoons of lemon juice, ¼ teaspoon of paprika, 1/8 teaspoon of dry mustard, and 1 teaspoon of sugar.Combine all of these ingredients in a mixing bowl and beat together until well blended. The liquid ingredients may separate, so be sure to shake the dressing well before serving.

Go for leaner sources of protein.,
Add foods that have healthy fats.,
Go for an oil based dressing.,
Choose a variety of colors.,
Count out your toppings.,
You can choose to limit yourself to three to four higher-calorie ingredients.,
Measure your portion sizes.,
Make your own dressings.",How to Avoid Adding Unhealthy Ingredients to Your Salad," Most people know that one of the worst salad ingredients you can add is a high-fat, high-calorie dressing. The worst dressing offenders are those super creamy and rich dressings.Dressings that are creamy are not only high in calories and fat but many times have added sugars and preservatives. Adding these to your salads can take a healthy bowl of greens in the wrong direction.
Dressings to skip include: french, bleu cheese, ranch, creamy caesar, thousand island and honey mustard.
Dressings like bleu cheese dressing will add a whopping 145 calories per 2 tablespoon serving.
Although you should skip those high-fat dressings, grabbing a bottle of the low-fat or fat-free isn't a great option either. These may be lower in fat, but are generally higher in sodium, sugar and other additives. Manufacturers often add more sugar to make up for the flavor lost in reducing fat.;
, Ingredients that add a little bit of crunch are delicious, but when these items are high in fat or fried, that crunchy texture comes along with a lot of extra calories and fat, as well as sodium.


Whenever you fry something — whether it's pan fried or deep fried — excess oil soaks into the food adding fat and calories.In addition, foods that are high in fat will add a lot of calories as well.
You should aim for less than 2,300 mg of sodium a day — the amount contained in 1 teaspoon of salt. Too much sodium may increase your blood pressure.Limit or skip items like: bacon bits, fried chicken or crispy chicken, fried shrimp or fried cheese.
Items like bacon bits can pack about 140 calories per ounce plus over 900 mg of sodium., while some crispy chicken will add an extra 15 grams of fat per serving., High-fat ingredients aren't the only items that can push your salad in an unhealthy direction. You also need to watch out for those carbohydrates that are filled with extra calories with no nutritional value.Some of these items are also fried (like those crunchy noodles). Deep frying these items also adds extra fat and calories.
Limit items like croutons, sesame sticks, crunchy noodles, crackers or tortilla chips.

, You might be surprised to learn there can be a lot of sugar in some salads. Some ingredients contain a significant amount of sugar, which pushes up your salad's total calories.


A little bite of sweetness is tasty in a salad. But typical sweetened items contain a lot of sugar which will increase their total calorie content.Limit items like candied nuts or sweetened dried fruit.
Candied nuts, like walnuts or pecans, can ring in with about 180 calories per ounce., If you want to whip up a healthy and nutritious salad, you need to start with the right type of green. Although all lettuce is low-calorie, not all choices are nutrient-dense.


Nutrient-dense foods are those that are moderately low in calories and very high in a variety of vitamins, minerals, fiber, protein or antioxidants.
In regards to your salad greens, you want to choose a lettuce that's high in vitamins, minerals, fiber and antioxidants.
For example, iceberg lettuce is crunchy and low in calories. Unfortunately, it's also low in any valuable nutrition.Instead, fill up your salad bowl with really nutritious greens like: kale, spinach, Swiss chard, arugula, romaine, butter lettuce or watercress., In addition to your greens, boost the nutrient content of your salad by adding on even more nutrient-dense foods like fruits and vegetables.


Both fruits and vegetables are naturally low in calories and generally contain a wide variety of vitamins, minerals, fiber and antioxidants. Each fruit or vegetable can offer your salad extra nutrition.Fruits and vegetables can also add a lot of different flavor profiles and textures to your salad.
For example, roasted carrots or onions will add a nutty flavor to your salad, while sliced strawberries and blueberries will add a naturally sweet bite.

, Many people go wrong when it comes to the type of protein they add to their salads. Stick to leaner protein sources, like grilled chicken, lean steak, eggs, grilled or baked fish, beans, tofu, low-fat cheese, or lentils, to make sure your salad stays nutritious.


Instead choose leaner cuts of protein. These are lower in fat and calories but will help keep you feeling satiated longer.
Avoid high-fat protein sources or proteins with unhealthy fats (trans or saturated), such as bacon, sausage, dark meats, and full-fat cheeses.

, Fat does add more calories to your meals; however, not all fat is bad — in fact, fat is actually a necessary part of a healthy diet. Some foods contain healthy fats that can help boost the overall nutrition of your salad.


Some foods contain healthy fats like omega-3 fats. This particular type of fat has been show to support your heart and artery health.Try adding these heart healthy fats to your salads: nuts, salmon, mackerel, tuna, anchovies, avocado, olive oil or olives.
Note, that these foods although healthy, are still calorie-dense as well. It'll be essential to measure your portion sizes of these foods. For instance, one portion of fish is about 3-oz, while one portion of avocado is 1 oz.

, Since even a healthy salad can get out of control once the dressing goes on, choose a dressing that'll be a bit lower in calories. This can help make sure your healthy salad stays healthy.


The best bet for a salad dressing is to go with an oil-based dressing and limit your portion size to 2 tablespoons. If you use a heart healthy oil like olive oil or walnut oil, you'll also get in a dose of healthy fats.You can also try basing your dressings off of hummus or avocado. Blending these items in can help give you a creamy texture in addition to healthy fats.

, One easy way to make sure that your salad is not only healthy, but nutritious, is having a few different colors in your salad. Explore the colors of rainbow when it comes to your salad ingredients.


Fruits and vegetables come in a range of colors. What makes each fruit and vegetable a particular color is either a vitamin or antioxidant in that particular fruit or vegetable.In addition, fruits and vegetables that are particularly bright or very saturated in color may signify a very high level of a specific antioxidant. For example, carrots, blackberries, beets or raspberries are extremely high in a variety of antioxidants.
To make your salad super nutrient-dense, make sure your salads have at least three different colors of either fruits, vegetables or both. Three different colors means you have at least three different types of vitamins or antioxidants.
For example, you can have green spinach tossed with blueberries, roasted beets and topped with grilled salmon.

, Another quick trick to keeping your salads calories in check is by monitoring how many toppings or ingredients you use in your salad. Limit the total amount of toppings or ingredients you use to help keep your overall calories in check.


Another area that an otherwise healthy salad can get out of hand is when you put too many toppings on or use too many ingredients.
Even if you have a bunch of nutritious toppings (like grilled salmon, avocado, blueberries, and nuts), if you keep adding and adding, the total calories will continue to go up.

, For example, you might have a spinach salad topped with grilled salmon, feta cheese, roasted sunflower seeds and sliced avocado.

Naturally low-calorie toppings can count as ""free"" foods, meaning you can add as many of them as you like. These include: artichoke hearts, asparagus, bean sprouts, beets, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, carrots, cauliflower, celery, cucumber, edamame, eggplant, green onions, pea pods, peppers, radishes, tomatoes, and zucchini.

, Portion size is also an important part to keeping your salads healthy and calorie controlled. Always measure your portions of any of your salad ingredients.


If you're preparing salads at home, pre-measure all your toppings and ingredients. If you're out to eat, try to do your best to estimate appropriate portion sizes of all the items on your salad.
For protein (like grilled chicken, fish or steak), measure out a 3 – 4 oz serving, 1/2 cup or a piece the size of a deck of cards.For fruits, measure out 1/2 cup chopped, 1/4 cup of dried fruit (about the size of an egg) or about one small piece.For dairy foods, you're most likely going to be adding cheese to your salad. Measure out about 1 – 2 oz of cheese or about the size of a golf ball.If you're going to put some grains on your salad, like quinoa or brown rice, measure out about 1 oz or about 1/2 cup of grains.For vegetables, you'll want to measure about 2 cups worth of lettuce (about two big handfuls) or about 1 cup of more dense vegetables (like cucumbers or tomatoes) per serving., One of the best parts of making a salad at home is that you can control all the ingredients. This is especially true if you make your own salad dressings at home.


Salad dressings, especially the creamy store-bought versions, can be one of the highest calorie salad ingredients.
Cut back on your total calories, fat and sugar by making your own dressing at home. You'll have full control of exactly what ingredients, and how much you use, when you make your own.The healthiest and most nutritious salad dressings are the basic olive oil, vinegar or lemon juice plus spices.
However, if you do enjoy creamier dressings, try making your homemade dressings with low-fat Greek yogurt, pureed avocado, hummus or low-fat buttermilk. You get the same creamy consistency with less calories and fat.

, You can use a fork or a small whisk to do this. For a more lemony sauce, use freshly-squeezed lemon juice instead of white vinegar.

, Keep whisking it in until the dressing turns creamy. For a more traditional dressing, use 2 egg yolks instead. Keep in mind, however, that consuming raw eggs puts you are a higher risk for food-born illnesses.


To make the raw eggs safer: simmer them (still in shell) for 1 minute, then cool them in cold water.

, Start by cutting the bread down the middle, like making a sandwich. Next, use your knife to cut the bread away from the crust. Try to keep the bread intact as much as possible. Cutting the crust away will give the croutons a nice, even texture. It will also help them bake more evenly.

, Start by cutting the bread into slices. Then, stack several slices on top of each other, and cut them down into smaller pieces.

, You can do this in a small saucepan over the stove, or in the microwave. Be careful not to heat the butter so much that it begins to brown.

, Transfer the melted butter into a large bowl, and add the olive oil. Stir the two together using a fork. Make sure that the bowl is large enough to fit the croutons.

, Use a pair of salad tongs to scoop the crusts from the bottom of the bowl, and transfer them to the top—just like tossing a salad. Keep doing this until the croutons are evenly coated.

, Add the seasoning into the bowl, and continue tossing the croutons until they are evenly coated.

, Make sure that they are spread evenly across the sheet in a single layer. If you can't fit all of the croutons on the baking sheet, don't stack them. Instead, bake them in separate batches., Once they are done baking, pull them out of the oven and let them cool. Add them to your salad once they are completely cool.

, Pound about 1 pound (453.6 grams) of chicken breasts until they are 1/8 inch (3.18 millimeters) thick. Season them with 1 tablespoon of Caesar dressing, and salt and pepper (to taste). Grill the chicken for 3 to 4 minutes, per side. Let the chicken cool, then cut it into thin, bite-sized strips. Add the chicken to the salad., Peel, de-veined, and rinse 1 pound (453.6 grams) of medium-sized shrimp. Brush the shrimp with olive oil, then toss it with 1 tablespoon of shrimp seasoning (listed below); store any leftover shrimp seasoning in a jar. Spear the shrimp onto skewers and grill for 2 minutes on both sides. Let the shrimp cool, then add to the salad. For the shrimp seasoning, you will need:2 ½ tablespoons paprika
2 tablespoons salt
2 tablespoons garlic powder
1 tablespoon black pepper
1 tablespoon cayenne pepper
1 tablespoon onion powder
1 tablespoon dried oregano
1 tablespoon dried thyme

, Preheat your grill; high heat for an indoor grill, and medium high for a gas grill. Mix together some Worcestershire sauce, balsamic vinegar, and extra-virgin olive oil in a small bowl. Brush the mixture onto both sides of a 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) thick piece of beef sirloin (about 1½ to 2 pounds). Let the meat marinate for 10 minutes, then grill it for 4 to 6 minutes per side. Remove the steak from the grill and let it rest for 5 to 10 minutes. Cut the meat at an angle, against the grain, into thin slices. Garnish the salad with the sliced steak.Consider seasoning the steak further before grilling with steak seasoning, or a mixture of coarse-grained salt and pepper.

, Take 1 to 2 bunches of kale, and cut out the thick stalks from the centers. Stack several leaves and roll them up like a cinnamon roll. Cut the roll into thin slices, no wider than your finger. Unroll them and toss them into the bowl. Repeat this for the rest of the leaves., The highlight of a Caesar salad should be the dressing. If you add too many flavors, the salad will become overpowering. Limit yourself to one or two additions. Stick with milk flavors, such as white chickpeas, or tart flavors, such as capers.

, Instead of using Parmesan cheese, consider using another type of cheese, such as blue cheese or gorgonzola. For a more lemony flavor, substitute freshly squeezed lemon juice for the white vinegar."

",How to Make a Chip Butty," Make sure you have a good layer of butter on each slice of bread - chip butties are well known for being sopping with butter! Only real butter will do, no cheating with margarine.;
, Place a heaping layer of hot chips on your bread. Chips (called french fries in the USA) are what give the chip butty its name. The chips should make up the main portion of the sandwich.

, A chip butty should be enjoyed with a few dollops of ketchup or HP sauce; however, you can add an extra surge of flavour by adding cheese, sliced meats, tomato, or your favourite sauces. Salt & pepper would not be out of place on a chip butty, either.

Cut a fresh loaf of Cuban bread lengthwise.,
Brush butter on the outside of the bread.,
Spread the yellow mustard.,
Add cheese to both sides.,
Cover one side with dill pickles.,
Add a layer of ham slices.,
Pile on the roast pork.,
Heat a sandwich press or similar tool.,
Press the sandwich.",How to Make a Cuban Sandwich1," Cuban bread is long and thin, and turns crisp in the panini press without getting uncomfortably hard. You can find similar bread at a Latin bakery. The next best substitute is a long, soft French or Italian loaf (but nothing as narrow and hard as a baguette), followed by a hoagie roll.Cut it about 7 inches (17.8 cm) long, or to a size that matches your appetite.


Leave one long edge of the bread intact for a tidier sandwich.;
, This will stop it from sticking to the sandwich press. It's easiest to do this before adding the ingredients.If you're using nonstick cooking spray instead, spray it on the inside of the sandwich press.

, Spread about 2 tbsp (30 mL) of regular yellow mustard evenly over both sides of the bread.Almost all recipes include mustard, but you can serve it on the side if you're using extra-flavorful pork., Cover both halves of the bread with mild Swiss cheese.Many traditional recipes use an equal ratio of cheese, ham, and pork, but you can cut the slices thinner if you prefer.

, Slice two large dill pickles to make eight or ten long, thin slices (or buy them pre-cut into ""sandwich stuffers""). Lay these onto one side of your sandwich.

, Fold four slices of very thin ham over the pickles. You can use any ham you like, but the most traditional choice is a mild, sweet-cured ham such as York ham, bolo ham, or any honey-cured ham.You can even bake a ham with a home-made honey glaze.

, Now for the star of the show. Warm several slices of roast pork in a pan over low heat, then add it to the sandwich.For extra flavor, use pork marinated in Cuban mojo sauce, or drizzle on the sauce in the pan. The sauce's main ingredients are garlic and sour orange (or orange, lemon, and lime where sour orange isn't available).You can use pulled pork if you don't have any sliced pork.

, Although traditional Cuban sandwiches are made with a grill press called a plancha, most cooks outside of Florida have to make do with one of these options:


Sandwich press or panini maker
Waffle iron, with the metal plates flipped so their flat sides are inward (if possible)
Griddle or frying pan, with a heavy cast iron skillet or foil-wrapped brick to press the sandwich down

, Once the press is hot, put in the sandwich and press it down to about a third of its original thickness. Cook the Cuban sandwich until the bread is brown and slightly crisp, and the cheese is melted. This usually takes two or three minutes on each side.


Remember to butter the bread or add nonstick spray to the press surface if you didn't do it earlier.
If the sandwich is falling apart or a little too large for the sandwich press, wrap it in foil.

,
Place several very thin slices of fresh garlic in the olive oil.

,
Start preparing your bread by thinly spreading the soft margarine with a butter knife on the outside of each piece of bread that will be in contact with the pan, then sprinkle parmesan cheese on both sides of the bread evenly and completely, then run a spatula over the bread rubbing in the sprinkled cheese into the margarine as much as you can.,
Turn the bread over and put Turkey, Capicola Ham, Parsley, Basil, and oregano on the ham, then toss on a slice of Provolone Cheese.

,
Put your sandwich together making sure that the margarine and sprinkled cheese parts are on the outside of the bread.

,
Turn the heat up real low on the stove to slowly heat up the oil and garlic, and when the garlic starts to barely cook, place your sandwich on and let it cook so ever slow.

,
While the one side of the sandwich is slowly cooking, place thin slices of chopped or sliced garlic on the bread facing you and press into the bread with fingers or spatula.

,
When you see that the bread is getting lightly brown underneath, turn the sandwich over and cook the other side the same.

Substitute croutons for whole wheat toast.,
Swap bacon bits for freekeh.,
Replace noodles for whole grains in a pasta salad.",How to Boost Salads with Whole Grains2," Croutons are a popular add-on to many salads, but they can add calories without offering much nutritional value.If you want your salad to have a crunchy texture, substitute the croutons with diced pieces of toasted whole grain bread instead.

, Processed meats like bacon add a salty, smoky flavor to a salad, but they are high in fat and sodium.Try mixing in some cooked freekeh next time you are tempted to add bacon to your salad. This grain has a smoky aroma and taste and is full of fiber and B vitamins, making it a healthy addition to any salad., Next time you make a dish for a cookout, a potluck, or a picnic, skip the refined grains in your favorite pasta salad recipe.

Check for freshness.,
Store grains in sealed container in a pantry.,
Keep grains in the refrigerator during warmer months.,
Review the cooking tips.",How to Boost Salads with Whole Grains3," Because whole grains contain both the germ and the bran, they can become rancid over time. When buying grains from your local grocery store or specialty food store, make sure the package is secured and sealed. Also take a moment to check the expiration date. When buying in bulk, make sure the grains look and smell fresh.Amaranth, for example, will smell and taste bitter if it is not fresh.Brown rice that has gone bad will have an odor and will look oily., To keep your grains fresh and safe from pests, store them in a sealed container. Keep the containers away from heat, light, and water on a pantry shelf.Barley, amaranth, farro, kamut, oats, and quinoa can be kept for a year or more if they are sealed properly and kept away from sunlight.
Grains like oats and wild rice can last for several years if properly sealed and stored.
Buckwheat has a shorter shelf life of 2 to 3 months., Grains can absorb moisture from the humid air during warmer months, which may cause them to go rancid. Keep your grains in an airtight container and store them in the fridge or the freezer to keep them fresh during hot, summer days., Most whole grains can be prepared in a pot of boiling water, but some whole grains take longer to prepare than others. Be sure to review the labels on your whole grain products to see how long they take to prepare.


Quinoa, bulgur, and oats typically take 10 to 15 minutes to prepare.Whole oats or steel-cut oats, buckwheat, barley, and brown rice can be boiled in water for about 40 minutes.Denser, chewier whole grains like farro, wild rice, and spelt may need to boil for 50 to 75 minutes."

Start evaluating how much you were paying for food.,
Always buy in bulk where appropriate.,
Remember, meat can be expensive.,
Think about any kinds of creative, healthy, delicious but cheap foods that could be made in a large portions.,
Plan your purchases.,
Don't buy food you usually ended up throwing away anyway.,
Share your purchases in a food co-op.,
Try to only spend $50 or the equivalent or less a week on food regardless of the number of people you need to feed.,
Quit any of the junk food that you might be buying.,
Remember to use coupons or in-store specials.,
After cooking your meals in a large portion, pack them in a small single portion containers.,
Plan your meals out throughout the day instead of eating large meals.,
During Christmas, birthdays or Thanksgiving you might be invited to your family or friend's place for dinner.","How to Create Cheap, Healthy Delicious Meals"," Include what you spend at the grocery store or super market, restaurants, canteens, coffee shops etc. Unless you include everything you spend on food, you won't, overall, make any saving. Doing so will let you know how much you are currently paying and whether you are within your desired budget.;
, If there's a staple food such as rice, flour, potatoes etc, that you can buy cheaper in bulk, do so. Bulk buy items must be something you will use up before they can perish. If you're one of those smart shoppers, you would've paid much attention to the regular individual prices or stuffs that comes in bulks. Check the prices and buy bulk, if it's cheaper. To figure out the cost the divide the cost of the article by its size or volume. For example: Divide $8 by 12 ounces to figure out the cost of a can of coffee. The cost per ounce will tell you what the actual price is. Compare this with the bulk price per ounce. Take care to ensure your household will consume the bulk food within its use by or sell by date, otherwise this can compound the problem and create more waste.

, Consider only buying meat once every 9 or 10th day and make it last. Meat can be purchased in bulk and then portioned up into smaller serves, wrapped in cling film and frozen for future use. It's best to do this before freezing the meat to ensure its not frozen and then refrozen (which may create food poisoning conditions)

, Very often most recipes are better if made in a large quantity as opposed to cooking for one. There's a lot of food that can be made in large portions, be made cheaply and can last for a couple days in the fridge for a future lunch or leftover dinner, or put into a freezer safe container for a future time. Some examples are:


Chilli
Fried rice (which stores well in the refrigerator but does not freeze well)
Homemade soups, casseroles and stews.
Stir-fry

, If you buy food that you could sometimes have some extras left over for next time, consider how you can use those for the next days meal. Good ideas would be:


Tomato soup with basil and a garlic bread as a side.
Vegetables with tips and milk
Pasta with tomato sauce and water

, If you do buy some food but usually ended up at least a good solid half of it away then don't think about buying that as you'll lose valuable money that goes out the drain.

, If you may only consume, for example, half a block of cheese before it goes moldy, shop and share the bill with someone who can use the other half.

, If you spend too much money on food a week you'll risk getting too much that you could use.

, That includes any soda, chips, and everything else that comes along with that category. A lot of the times they can actually be a lot more expensive than healthy food in the long run.

, Those things can actually help you save money. Granted, you'll only save bits here and there but you can save up to $20 or more easily enough if you take advantage of them.

, Doing so will help you make sure you don't don't overuse more than what you should.

, This will help you not feeling hungry throughout the day and at the same time if you incorporate this with the single portion step, it will help you not eat more than you really should.

, This is a good opportunity to catch up with them and possibly get free food out of the entire thing so don't feel bad to eat and save some money out of this opportunity if arises.

,


Adding vegetables such as mushrooms, chopped green and red peppers, etc. in between each individual Spiedie gives it more flavors.

, Leave the handle hanging over the edge, allowing easy rotation.


If you are a person who doesn't like charred grill lines, placing tinfoil on the grill and cooking on that helps reduce the char lines.
Cooking on tinfoil helps keep moisture on the Spiedies by preventing the sauce from dripping in between the grill.

,


Rotate the Spiedies every so often to prevent burning and even cooking.
When cooking the Spiedies, make sure you pay attention, if they end up over cooked, they have the tendency to dry out.

,


When taking the Spiedie of the skewer, a good way to do it is using the bread or bun to grip the Spiedie as you pull the skewer out.

Select your type of wrap.,
Choose a low-calorie condiment.,
Select a source of lean protein.,
Add in some vegetables.,
Use Vietnamese rice noodles.,
Go vegetarian with quinoa or tabbouleh.,
Make a lower calorie classic.,
Consider keeping ingredients separate until ready to eat.,
Roll your wrap tightly in tin foil or plastic wrap.,
Keep your wrap cold.",How to Create Nutritious Wraps," When you're making a wrap, there are a variety of items you can use to wrap up your tasty ingredients. Try to keep calories to 100 – 180 calories per item so your entire wrap doesn't get too high in calories. Mix it up and experiment with all the different ways you can wrap your food. You can try:


Tortillas or wraps. These are the traditional wraps used in these types of recipes. They are very thin bread generally made from either corn or wheat. Try to go for 100% whole wheat or whole grain as these tortillas/wraps will have more fiber and protein.Flatbreads or lavash bread. Both of these are similar to tortillas, but may be slightly larger or thicker. Again, choose 100% whole wheat or whole grain items.
Pita bread. Pita bread can not only be stuffed with ingredients, but can also be used to wrap items too. Whole grain is the preferable choice here as well.
Lettuce. If you're looking to watch calories or your total carbs, consider using lettuce as a wrap. It's crunchy and naturally low in calories and carb-free.Try butter lettuce, iceberg lettuce, kale, Swiss chard or romaine lettuces.
Spring roll wrappers. These are also low in calories and carbohydrates.It may take some practice to use them, but they offer a fun twist on your traditional wrap.
Seaweed. Just like with sushi, you can use sheets of seaweed as a wrap too. Plus, seaweed has a variety of benefits, including fiber, minerals, and phytonutrients.;
, Wraps can be a healthier or more nutritious choice than a sandwich. Don't waste more than 50 calories on the total amount of condiments you add to your wrap; however, adding a ton of high fat condiments, sauces or dressings will defeat the purpose. Stick to lower calorie condiments like:


Mustard. There are tons of flavors of mustard — spicy, yellow, dijon — but all are naturally low in calories.Mustard is high in sodium, however, so look for low-sodium options.Go for 1 – 2 tablespoons.
Mayo with olive oil. Although mayo gets a bad rap about being high in calories and fat, try the mayo made with olive oil. It's lower in calories than regular mayo and has some heart healthy fats. Use 1 – 2 tablespoons (29.6 ml).Hummus. Bean dips, lentil dips or hummus may not be your most traditional condiment, but it can add some moistness to your wrap in addition to giving you a boost of fiber and protein. Smear on 2 – 4 tablespoons (59.1 ml) of hummus. Salsa. If you like a little kick to your meals, try adding salsa to your wraps. Check the ingredients to make sure there is no added sugar. Add about 2 – 3 tablespoons (44.4 ml) of your favorite salsa.
Hot sauce. Another spicy kick you can try out is hot sauce. It's low in calories but adds a lot of flavor to your meal. Stick to 1 tablespoon or less, unless you like it super spicy!Low-fat dressings. Using a dressing in a wrap is common; however, they can get high in calories. Look for low-fat dressings or yogurt-based dressing for less of a calorie hit. Keep your serving under 2 tablespoons.

, Protein is an essential nutrient to include at each meal. Always aim to have 3 – 4 oz of protein in every wrap. Plus, it'll help keep you feeling satisfied throughout the day. Choose a lean protein to add to your wrap to manage your overall calories.You can try:


Poultry and red meat. These are the most common wrap fillings. Choose all natural and low-sodium deli meat, sliced chicken or turkey or lean red meat. They will typically have fewer additives and sodium. Choose three to four slices of deli meat or a piece of meat the size of your palm.
Scrambled eggs. If you're feeling like a little breakfast, try adding scrambled or hard boiled eggs to your wrap. They're high in protein and healthy fats. One to two eggs will meet your 3-4 oz serving size.Sliced cheese. If you're avoiding meat or just want to change it up a bit, try adding some sliced cheese to your wrap. It's another great source of protein and also high in calcium. Aim for two to three slices.Beans or lentils. If you want to skip the meat, try filling your wrap with 1/2 cup of beans or lentils. They're not only high in protein, but also high in fiber.Tofu or tempeh. Another great vegetarian source of protein is tofu and tempeh. Both made from soy beans, they're a great alternative to meat. Slice up 3 – 4 oz or a block about the size of your palm.
Seafood. Besides tuna salad, you can add grilled fish or seafood to your wrap. They're still high in protein and some seafood (like salmon) are also high in heart healthy fats. Measure out 1/2 cup of tuna salad or 3-4 oz., It's important to get an adequate amount of vegetables in each day. By stuffing in 1 cup of these nutrient powerhouse veggies to your wrap, you can help meet your daily goal of four to six servings.Try:


Salad. Wrap up a Greek, Cobb or Caesar salad in your wrap.
Sliced raw veggies. Vegetables can be bulky. Slicing them into thin strips helps them fit evenly in your wrap.
Roasted vegetables. Make a vegetarian meal by filling your wrap with roasted or grilled vegetables. Top with some cheese and hummus for extra protein.

, Perfect for spring roll wrappers or lettuce, rice noodles are low in calorie and filling.Toss 1/2 cup of cooked rice noodles with your favorite Asian dressing or sauce. Divide the rice noodles in half and layer each half into a butter lettuce leaf.
Top each lettuce leaf with 1/4 cup of cooked ground pork seasoned with salt and pepper.
If desired, top your lettuce wraps with 1 – 2 tablespoons shredded carrots, a few leaves of cilantro and a sprinkling of toasted sesame seeds.

, Put a Mediterranean spin on your wrap by adding in some quinoa or tabbouleh. These whole grains are high in fiber and protein and can help keep you satisfied longer.Lay out a whole wheat pita bread and top with 1/2 cup of premade tabbouleh.
Top with 2 tablespoons of a shredded parsley and basil. Then sprinkle on 2 tablespoons of feta cheese.
Tucking the ends of the tortilla in, roll up until the wrap is completely closed. Slice in half and enjoy.

, A very common and tasty wrap is the buffalo chicken wrap; however, it's usually filled with fried chicken strips and high-fat blue cheese. Try this version for a lower calorie wrap:


Smear a 12"" whole wheat tortilla with 1 tablespoon of light mayonnaise and top with 3 – 4 oz of sliced grilled chicken strips and 1/4 cup of packed down and shredded romaine or iceberg lettuce.
Drizzle on 1 – 2 tablespoons of buffalo sauce, 1/2 ounce of blue cheese and two to three diced cherry tomatoes.
Tucking the ends of the tortilla in, roll up until the wrap is completely closed. Slice in half and enjoy.

, The one downside to packing lunches is the possibility of opening up your lunch to find a soggy sandwich or wrap. Experiment with these tricks to keep your sandwich crunchy and fresh:


Pack your wrap components separately. If you're unsure of how to keep your wrap from getting soggy, pack everything separate. This is a sure way to keep your ingredients fresh and crunchy.Put juicy or ""wet"" ingredients in the center. Put juicy tomatoes, pickles or marinated proteins in the center of your wrap. You may want to consider sandwiching them between lettuce leaves to keep their moisture contained.Mayo is higher in fat and can keep your wrap from getting super soggy; however, other condiments — like dressings or vinaigrettes — can make your wrap soggy. Use very little or consider keeping them on the side if possible.

, If you're packing your wrap to-go, make sure you tightly wrap it up so it stays in a formed roll and the ingredients do not spill out.


Plastic wrap is a great tool to use. You can keep your wrap fresh and tightly rolled together by fitting the plastic wrap snugly around your wrap.
Aluminum foil is another material that you can use to keep your wrap contained. Foil is especially good if you're keeping your wrap warmed.
Parchment paper also works well. But you'll need to secure the ends with some tape to make sure it doesn't unfold in your lunch box.

, If you're bringing your wrap to work or packing it up for a picnic, it's important to make sure that it stays cold. If your wrap, or any food, gets too warm and stays warm, you could get sick.If your wrap contains meat, vegetables, salads (made with mayonnaise) you'll want to keep the temperature under 40°F (4.4°C)if possible. If it remains between 40 – 140°F (4.4 – 60°C), this is the ""danger zone"" where bacteria can grow.Include at least two cold sources when packing your wrap. You can pack in two freezer packs or a freezer pack and a bottle of frozen water.Refrigerate your wrap as soon as you're able or make sure to plan on eating it before your cold sources melt or get too warm.
Foods that do not need refrigeration are whole fruits and vegetables, peanut butter, unopened canned tuna or chicken, pickles, mustard and hard cheese."

Boil the chicken broth.,

Add the carrots and celery.,
Meanwhile, heat the oil.,
Sauté the garlic, onion, and hotdog.,
Add the seasonings and shredded chicken.,
Combine the two mixtures.,
Stir in the evaporated milk.,
Serve hot.",How to Cook Sopas1," Pour the chicken broth into a large stockpot. Place it on your stove over medium-high to high heat and let it reach a rolling boil.


Use chicken broth to make the soup more flavorful. If you don't have chicken broth, you can use water. Cooking the chicken in the water will allow some of the flavor to seep into the liquid, creating a mild chicken stock in the process.;
, Add the chicken to the boiling broth. Cover the stockpot and allow the chicken to simmer for 20 minutes, or until the meat is fully cooked and tender.


If you have mildly seasoned leftover chicken from another meal, you can skip this part. Simply shred or dice the leftover chicken and boil the broth in preparation for the macaroni.

, Remove the chicken from the broth and allow it to cool slightly. When it is cool enough to handle, use two forks to separate the chicken into thick shreds.


Alternatively, you can chop the cooked chicken into small, bite-sized cubes instead of shredding it. Either option should work well, so it's mainly a matter of personal preference.
Set aside the prepared chicken, keeping it warm by covering it with a loose sheet of aluminum foil.

, If the chicken left any fat in the broth, use a strainer spoon to scoop away the bits of floating fat. Retain the remainder of the broth.


You'll use this leftover broth to cook the macaroni and vegetables. Doing so should result in more flavorful sopas.

, Place the macaroni in the stockpot of boiling broth. Allow it to cook for approximately 3 minutes.


Elbow macaroni is the most conventional option, but any small pasta can be used. Check the cooking time for the pasta you use and adjust accordingly to prevent it from becoming undercooked or overcooked.

, Place the chopped carrots and celery in the stockpot with the broth and elbow macaroni. Boil everything together for another 5 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender and the macaroni has reached an “al dente” state.The pasta should be tender enough to bite into at this point, but it should still retain some firmness. If you allow the macaroni to completely cook during this stage, it will be mushy and overcooked by the end of the entire process.

, While the macaroni and vegetables are cooking, pour the olive oil into a separate skillet and set it on your stove over medium to medium-high heat.


Ideally, the macaroni-vegetable mixture should finish at the same approximate time as the aromatic-hotdog mixture, but you'll need to start them both at the same time to accomplish this task. If either one finishes before the other, remove the pan from the heat while the other mixture continues to cook.

, Place all three chopped ingredients in the hot oil and cook, stirring frequently, for 2 to 3 minutes.


The onion and garlic should both become more aromatic. Allow the onion to turn slightly translucent. The garlic should deepen in color but should not be allowed to burn.

, Place the shredded chicken in the skillet with the hotdog and aromatic vegetables. Add the salt, pepper, and fish sauce. Stir to combine, then cook for another 3 to 4 minutes.

, Drain the fat from the chicken mixture, then scoop the entire chicken mixture into the stockpot with the macaroni, vegetables, and broth.


Stir well to combine the ingredients evenly. Reduce the heat to medium, if necessary, so that the sopas can cook at a gentle simmer instead of a rolling boil.

, Mix the evaporated milk into the rest of the soup. Cook for another 2 minutes, or until everything has heated through., Remove the stockpot from the heat and ladle the soup into individual serving bowls. Enjoy it while it's still hot.


For an added splash of color and flavor, consider serving the sopas with a garnish of chopped green onion.

Serve hot.",How to Cook Sopas2," Place the butter in a skillet and set the pan on your stove over medium to medium-high heat. Allow the butter to melt and spread over the bottom of the pan.

, Place the chopped onion and minced garlic in the melted butter. Sauté for 2 to 3 minutes, or until the garlic deepens in color and the onion starts to turn translucent.


Cooking the onion and garlic ahead of time releases more of their flavors, which can give your finished sopas a deeper taste. If you're in a hurry, though, you can skip this portion of the process and add the garlic and onions to the slow cooker in their raw forms.

, Place the carrots in the bottom of the slow cooker, followed by the chicken. Spoon the onion and garlic on top.


If desired, cover the bottom and sides of the slow cooker with nonstick cooking spray or a slow cooker liner before adding your ingredients. Doing so is not strictly necessary but may make the cleanup process easier.
When using previously frozen chicken, make sure that the chicken has completely thawed before adding it to the slow cooker.
Do not add the macaroni and cabbage during this step. These two ingredients need to be added near the end of the cooking process. Adding them at the beginning would cause them to become too mushy and soggy., Combine the chicken broth, fish sauce, pepper, and salt in a separate bowl, then pour the mixture over the rest of the contents in the slow cooker.


Only add enough broth to cover the solid ingredients by 1/2 inch (1.25 cm).
Do not add the milk during this step. Like the macaroni and cabbage, it needs to be added to the slow cooker near the end of the cooking process. Adding it now would cause the milk to curdle.

, Cover the slow cooker and cook the soup base for 6 to 7 hours on low or 3 to 3-1/2 hours on high.


Do not stir the soup or otherwise open the lid while it cooks. Doing so would release some of the necessary heat trapped inside, thereby increasing the required cooking time by as much as 30 minutes.

, After the initial cooking period ends, remove the chicken and transfer it to a cutting board. Use two forks the separate the chicken meat into hearty shreds.

, Return the shredded chicken to the slow cooker. Add the macaroni, shredded cabbage, and milk to the slow cooker, as well, stirring to combine.

, Cover the slow cooker and cook the soup for another 30 minutes. Switch the heat to its “low” setting, if necessary.


Note that most pastas should cook adequately well within 30 minutes. If you're using a quick cooking pasta, it may be ready within 18 to 20 minutes. On the other hand, some whole grain pastas may require as much as 35 to 40 minutes., Turn off the slow cooker and ladle the soup into individual serving bowls. Enjoy the soup while it is still hot for the best flavor and texture.


If desired, you can serve each portion with a light garnish of chopped green onion.

",How to Thicken Soup," Melt butter in a pan, add flour while whisking until the mixture forms a paste and the flour is cooked. This paste is called a roux. Then whisk in 2% milk until you have a thick sauce (about the consistency of pancake batter). This is called a Bechamel sauce. Add to the soup.;
, Make a sauce from 1/2 tsp melted butter or olive oil mixed with 1 1/2 tsp flour for every cup of soup. Pour the soup over the mixture and stir constantly until the soup thickens. This method requires at least another quarter of an hour to cook in order to remove the flavour of ""uncooked flour"". This is the same as thickening with a roux, except that the flour is cooked in the soup, and not before adding.

, There's a lot of starch in potatoes, and this will help create a thicker consistency. This is best added to a soup immediately upon grating. Cook for another 5–10 minutes to ensure that it is cooked and to produce a thickened consistency.

, This requires a lot of care and tending; reheat gently and stir constantly until the soup thickens. Evaporated milk can be used in place of cream. The resulting soup texture will be lovely and rich.

, Adding these to the soup about 10–12 minutes before the soup is due to be served will make a soup considerably more substantial. The addition of rice is especially enjoyable with pumpkin or squash soups; blend if wished to maintain a smooth consistency.

, Mix cornflour, rice flour, or potato flour with water until you have formed a thick paste. Whisk this into the soup until the soup thickens. You can also use wine, stock, or other liquid in place of the water for making the paste.

, Add a little of the hot soup to the beaten mixture before adding it all into the soup pot. This is called ""tempering"" - it heats the eggs a little before you drop them into scalding liquid (which risks creating ""egg drop soup""). Keep it at a simmer - it must not be boiled or the egg will solidify.

, This method will thicken the soup without as much additional cook-time as the flour method. Put about a tablespoon of starch in a container and add just enough cold water to make a thick slurry or paste. Whisk this into the soup and bring to a boil. It is important to add water to the starch and not starch to water (as this will cause it to be lumpy), and to use cold water (adding hot water will cook the starch before it is mixed in to the soup).

, Use a can of beans with a mild flavour (but not kidney beans, as they are overpowering). White beans are best. Drain and rinse the beans, then blend with a cup of the soup broth in a blender or food processor. Add the puree to the remainder of the soup, simmering over low heat until it thickens.

, The best way to do this is to remove vegetables from the soup and puree them, then return them to the soup to thicken.

, Either white or brown bread is fine, provided it is dried. Process the crumbs in your processor, then add to the soup. Drop in a little at a time until the desired consistency is reached. The soup will thicken with cooking.

, In a pinch, use instant potato flakes to achieve the required consistency for your soup, tasting as you go.

Find a pot large enough for the soup.,
Determine what ingredients you have on hand to decide what kind of soup you will make.,
Decide if you will use dry beans or grains.,
Make Your Stock.,
Finish your Stock.,
Start your soup: Add dry beans (soaked) and hard grains with the meats, or at the beginning of making a vegetable soup.








,
Add vegetables in the order of their hardness.,
Cook at a simmer until the meat is very tender or until hard vegetables and grains are tender.,
Add soft foods at the end.,
If you want a pureed soup (namely, a soup without any lumps), remove any meat bones and use a blender, hand puree tool, or food processor.,
Add cream if you want a creamed soup.,
Serve with any garnishes you want.








",How to Make a Soup Without a Recipe," A two quart (1.89 liter) pot is minimum, but 4-8 quarts (3.7 liters - 7.6 liters) would be best.






;
, Basic ingredients include meat, vegetables, grains, legumes, or fruit. Other potential ingredients include spices, herbs, acid (like vinegar or lemon juice), and fat (like butter or cream). Some basic soup styles include savory, sweet, or sour; hot or cold; heavy or light; cream or clear (consommé). Divide your ingredients into those for the stock, and those for the finished soup.








, Dry beans require pre-cooking, either by an over-night soak, or a 2 hour soak in water that is first brought to a boil, then turned off and covered. You can speed things up by using canned beans. Grains such as buckwheat or brown rice need up to an hour to cook (see the package for cooking time).








, For the stock, start with water, and flavor it with vegetables, cooked or raw meat, fresh fish parts, canned stock or dry cubes, or even just plain onions. After your stock is made, you'll have to add new ingredients to make the finished soup, so make sure you don't use everything in the stock.








, After your stock has simmered for a while (half hour to an hour for vegetables only, 1+ hours for stock with meat); remove all of the stock ingredients and discard them. Filter the stock through a cheesecloth or strainer, if necessary. If you've used meat, and you have the time, cool the stock to separate any extra fat - put the stock in the refrigerator and wait for the fat to rise to the top and solidify, then scoop off with a spoon.








,, For pure vegetable soups, add the vegetables at the beginning of boiling. For meat soups, add the vegetables at least half an hour after beginning to boil the meats. Wash, peel (if desired), and cut vegetables into uniform bite-sized pieces before adding them to the soup








, Remove all meat bones. You may cool the soup now and finish cooking later, or even on the next day. If you do, skim off any hardened meat fat before re-heating it.








, Soft foods such as pasta and risoni don't need a lot of cooking and will disintegrate if they're overcooked. Leave them for the last few minutes of cooking.








, (Warning: Hot liquids are very unpredictable in blenders. Be sure to start slowly or else the liquid may explode out the top and burn you!) Take small batches of the solid foods and whirl them with a bit of the stock. Return it to the pot or a separate bowl temporarily. Then return all the pureed soup to the pot and keep it warm.








, Add up to a cup of milk, cream or half-and-half to the soup, and let it become hot. Do not boil it.

Use almond oil to make lip balm.",How to Make Almond Oil," The almonds should be dry and fresh. Make sure your blender is clean and ready to go., You should start off at low speed so that the almonds are blended slowly and carefully; blending them at high speed at first will make the blending process more difficult.

, As you start to blend the almonds, you may find that they start to form a shape that resembles a ball; they'll start to build up on the sides of the blender. Just stop the blender to scrape off the build up and return it to the rest of the almonds. You may need to do this several times in the blending process, so be vigilant as you blend them., As they get more and more blended, you can turn your blender up to medium or even high speed. This will help the process along., Once the almonds have been blended into a rich, creamy paste, then you can add a teaspoon of olive oil to speed up the blending process. If you find that the almonds are still not blending as smoothly as you'd like them to, then you can add another teaspoon of oil.

, Once you've finished blending the almonds, you can place them in a container, such as a glass jar or Tupperware, and keep them at room temperature for about 2 weeks. This should be enough time for the oil from the almonds to separate from their meat.

, To get the most out of the oil, you can try tipping the container and letting the oil drip into a separate container. You can also use a sieve or a strainer to separate the oil from the almonds.

, You can use the oil to treat your skin or hair or for aromatherapy purposes. You also don't have to throw out that leftover nut meat, either. You can use it in cooking, or even just mix it with a bit of canola oil and salt and spread it on toast., An oil press can be a bit pricier than a blender, but it can blend your almonds extra thoroughly if you're willing to splurge a bit. You should mount the press on a table or another sturdy surface., Simply turn the crank nice and slow to start to get the roasted almonds to produce oil. Unlike in a blender, you won't have to worry about the oil creating build-up on the sides of the device.

, Simply place a cup below the almonds and wait for the oil to be released into the cup. It'll be easier to crank the press the longer you do it.

, You can use the oil right away and won't need to wait a few weeks from the oil to separate from the nuts as you would when using a blender. However, the oil may look a bit cloudy, but that doesn't mean it will be less effective. If you'd like your oil to be more clear, just place it in a container and leave it out for a day for the particles to settle to the bottom of it., Almond oil can be used as a daily moisturizer. It can help soften skin that is dry or rough and it can also provide the skin with extra protection. You can take care of your face using almond oil without using a single chemical. To use the almond oil, all you need to do is to wet your hands with warm water and then massage about 1/2 a teaspoon of almond oil into your face.You don't need to wash the oil off; treat it like a natural moisturizer and let it absorb into your skin.

, Another thing you can use the almond oil for is a facial mask to take care of your skin. All you need is to mix the ingredients to make the mask in a small container to create a paste that you can apply all over your face with your fingers. Apply the mask in the morning and then let it sit for 30 minutes before you wash it off with warm water. Here are the simple ingredients you'll need to make the paste:1 tbsp. almond oil
1 tbsp. honey
1 tbsp. lemon juice

, A facial scrub can help clear your skin and exfoliate your face, removing dead skin cells and any dirt or grime. All you need to do is to add about 1 teaspoon of salt or sugar for every teaspoons of almond oil and stir the ingredients together until you've made a solid paste. Just gently use the pads of your fingers to rub the oil over your face and then wash it off with warm water.Be gentle while using the scrub. If you rub your face too much, then your skin could get a bit irritated.

, If you want to use almond oil as conditioner, all you have to do is to take about a teaspoon of it and rub it into your wet hair. Use a comb to really get it through and then cover your hair once you've fully conditioned it. Wait about 30 minutes for the oil to work its magic and then wash your hair with shampoo to get it out.


If you do this at least once a week, you'll be on your way to healthier hair in no time.

, You can also use almond oil as you would use any other hair oil. Simply place about half a teaspoon of it in the palm of your hands, rub it into your hair, and comb it to thoroughly coat your hair. You can use almond oil to keep your hair looking sleek and to protect it from split ends.


Don't apply it more than once every day or two or your hair may get too oily.

, If you want to use your almond oil to care for your lips, then all you have to do is gather a few simple ingredients to make your own lip balm at home. All you need to do is to melt the ingredients in a double boiler on the lowest heat possible, remove them from the heat, and then pour them into the balm tubes and let it sit for 24 hours before you can use it. You can use the following ingredients:1 tbsp. shea butter
1 tbsp. coconut oil
1 1/2 tbsp. almond oil
1 1/2 tbsp. beeswax
.15 oz lip balm tubes

Spread Marmite very sparingly.,
Mix Marmite with butter (or another spread) to dilute the taste.,
Take small bites.,
Take big drinks with each bite.,
Try not to smell Marmite before you eat it.,
Pair Marmite with strong-tasting foods to minimize its taste.",How to Eat Marmite1," In Britain and other places where Marmite is popular, it's often eaten as a spread on toast, crackers, and other baked bread products. Since Marmite has such a strong salty, yeasty taste, it's usually eaten in small quantities even by its fans. If you're using your Marmite as a spread, rather than using a full spoonful of it like you might for jam or peanut butter, instead, use a tiny pea-sized amount (like you would for toothpaste).


Ideally, when you spread this tiny amount of Marmite on your bread, it should leave a paper-thin layer of Marmite — just enough to discolor the bread. You don't want any noticeable ""thickness"" to the Marmite, as this will give a seriously overpowering taste.;
, One of the most common ingredients to combine with Marmite is butter, especially when the Marmite is being used as a spread. Butter's rich, smooth taste pairs well with the strong, salty flavor of Marmite. If you hate Marmite, try applying a generous helping of butter to your bread before or after you spread on the Marmite — the more you use, the less you'll taste the Marmite.To many, this makes Marmite much more palatable.

, Getting used to eating Marmite is like the old saying about how to boil a frog — if you drop a frog into a pot of hot water, it will jump out, but if you drop it into a pot of lukewarm water and slowly increase the heat, it won't know anything's wrong until it's too late!Rather than trying to wolf down your Marmite in a few huge bites, instead, take small nibbles to begin. Gradually, as you make progress, the strong, salty taste should become more bearable.


If you're having a hard time swallowing even small bites of your Marmite spread, try moving each bite carefully to the back of your mouth so that you can swallow it without much chewing. This should minimize the amount you have to taste the Marmite, but be careful — you'll need to take small bites to be able to swallow them without choking.

, To keep the overpowering taste of Marmite under control, try taking a drink after each bite of Marmite you take. The drink will act as a chaser — the more you sip, the less you'll taste the Marmite and the quicker the taste will leave your mouth.


Plain, ordinary tap water is a good zero-calorie chaser, but if you really hate the taste of Marmite, you may want to consider a stronger-tasting beverage. After each bite, try drinking a swig of your favorite soft drink, or, if you're old enough, a stiff cocktail. The strong flavors of these beverages should help ""drown out"" the Marmite taste.

, The senses of taste and smell closely interact with each other to produce the ""effect"" that you experience when eating food. The way something smells can affect the way it tastes to you (and vice versa).If you hate the taste of Marmite, there's a very good chance you won't care for its smell, either. In this case, try your hardest not to smell the Marmite as you eat it. Usually, the taste, though still strong, will be a little less intense if you make an effort to hold your breath until the Marmite has been swallowed (or nearly so).

, Perhaps the single easiest way to make Marmite more manageable is to simply not make it the central feature of your dish. Pairing Marmite with other foods (especially ones with distinctive, powerful flavors of their own) can make it much more palatable. Though you may never enjoy Marmite by itself, you may even find that you enjoy it when paired with other foods or used as a minor ingredient in a large recipe!


There's no ""wrong"" way to eat Marmite — any food you enjoy it with is fair game. Just a few foods that some Marmite fans enjoy pairing their favorite yeasty spread with are eggs, cheese, meat, seafood, apricots, marmalade, and more!In the next section, we'll explore a few more flavorful Marmite combinations. Feel free to use any of them as you see fit, or make your own!

Add Marmite to soups and stews for savory flavor.,
Pair Marmite with cheeses.,
Use Marmite as a glaze for roast meats.,
Use Marmite sparingly on spaghetti.",How to Eat Marmite2," In small quantities, Marmite can give soups, stews, and other hearty liquid dishes a rich, savory flavor (and also works great as a browning agent). For instance, try mixing a spoonful of Marmite into a pot of French onion soup in place of beef stock — the flavor of the finished soup goes great with bread and cheese, just like ordinary Marmite.In general, you can usually get away with substituting Marmite mixed with water, your favorite vegetables, and a little oil for beef broth. This can allow you to make great-tasting vegetarian versions of all your favorite carnivorous soups and stews., Many Marmite fans agree: the spread pairs deliciously with a wide variety of cheeses. Sharp cheddar is an especially great choice — the salty, yeasty flavor of the Marmite enhances the ""sharpness"" of the cheese, making for a bold-flavored (but tasty) combination. Try adding a few slices of cheese to standard Marmite and butter toast for a satisfying breakfast., Though it may sound odd, Marmite can be a tasty ingredient to include in glazes and sauces for meat dishes. Used correctly, Marmite can give the outer ""crust"" of roasted meats, poultry, and seafood a rich, distinct ""umami"" (savory) flavor. Try painting a light mixture of melted butter and Marmite over a whole roasted chicken for a savory treat — you should only need a spoonful or two to cover it.


If you use Marmite as a meat glaze, you may want to forego sprinkling salt from the salt shaker on your meat, especially if you need to be careful about your sodium intake. Marmite has a very high salt content — it's more than 10% salt by mass!, Believe it or not, some people not only eat their spaghetti with Marmite — they love it. If you're willing to experiment, try adding a half teaspoon of Marmite to al dente noodles along with a small helping of olive oil! You may want to avoid using fine tomato sauces or cheeses to top your dish until you're positive that you enjoy it!


Note that some fans of this recipe describe the flavor as being similar to the British snack food ""Twiglets""."

Hard boil two eggs.,
Prepare the vegetables.,
Make toast.,
Plate your ingredients with Marmite in the middle.,
Enjoy the Marmite experience to the fullest!",How to Eat Marmite3," If you've recently gained an appreciation for Marmite and you're looking to expand your repertoire, try this Marmite-centered sampler dish, which works as a hearty meal on its own and scales easily for larger groups. Start by boiling a few eggs in a pot of water until they're hard boiled. Depending on the size of the eggs, this should take about eight to ten minutes.


Run cold water over the eggs after they're done cooking. Cooling them down halts the cooking process and prevents them from overcooking., Next, let's get our vegetables ready for the Marmite. Wash a bell pepper, a handful of cherry tomatoes, a cucumber, a carrot, and a few clumps of broccoli under running water. Cut each into small bite-size pieces. Any shapes that look appealing are fine, but, for efficiency's sake, you'll probably want to julienne your bell pepper (cut it into skinny strips) and take thin circular slices from your cucumber.

, Finally, make a few golden-brown slices of Marmite's most well-known companion dish. You can use white, wheat, or even specialty breads like sourdough and rye here — it's up to you! When the toast is ready, butter it. As noted above, butter and Marmite pair quite well together.

, Arrange your vegetables, eggs, and toast in a circle around the outside of a large plate. Open a jar of Marmite and place it in the center of the dish.


Don't forget to peel your hard-boiled eggs. If you'd like to use them to hold Marmite like crackers, cut the eggs into quarters or eights to make skinny, curved slices.

, Using a butter knife, put small portions of Marmite on each piece of vegetable or egg before biting in. You can eat the toast without Marmite as a ""chaser"" to ready your mouth for the next bit piece of Marmite, or, if you're bold, just spread a tiny dollop of Marmite on each piece of bread.


If you want to, you can even dip your foods directly into the jar of Marmite. Be careful — it's easy to get more Marmite than you intended this way!

Whether the chips are smooth or ridged is up to you. Both types work fine.;
, Milk, dark or white chocolate are all appropriate for covering the chips. Select the one you like the most.

, Or, use foil. This is where the dipped chips will rest to set.

, Before dipping, the melted chocolate should appear glossy (tempered).

,


Half the chip: Dip halfway to cover one half in chocolate. Lift it up and allow excess chocolate to drip back (if it's really excessive, scrape against the side of the melted chocolate bowl).
All of the chip: Hold the chip with a pair of tongs and dip the entire chip into the melted chocolate. Lift it up and allow excess chocolate to drip back (if it's really excessive, scrape against the side of the melted chocolate bowl).

, Repeat with as many chips as you want to cover in chocolate.

, Before the chocolate sets, you can sprinkle on flavoring. Suggestions include smoky paprika, cinnamon, cayenne pepper, superfine sugar, ground ginger, chocolate sprinkles, desiccated coconut, chopped dried fruit, etc. You could even drizzle over zigzag lines of melted chocolate in a lighter or darker shade.

, Let sit for 10-15 minutes to set the chocolate. Remove after this time has passed, to avoid making the chips soggy.

, Place in a lined basket or on a plate and set out for people to help themselves to.

Wrap to present as a gift.",How to Make Chocolate Dipped Spoons," Make sure the chocolate you use is able to be melted properly, and avoid chocolate chips meant for keeping their shape, as they will not melt properly. Dark chocolate is a sophisticated flavour that suits the bitterness of coffee well and even has health benefits, while milk or white chocolate can be used as a funner addition to coffee as they're sweet and can be customised easily. Think about the final recipient's taste when choosing chocolate.;
,, A smaller, deeper cup gives best results, as the spoon can dip deeper and you won't need to scoop the chocolate over the spoon for more coverage. Tall glasses or even beakers work well. Ensure that the container is completely dry, as water causes the chocolate to coagulate, ruining the consistency of the chocolate.

, Every 30 seconds, take the chocolate out and give it a quick stir, checking to see if it's melting smoothly. Overheated chocolate is thick, clumpy and unusable, so keep an eye out for when it's melted and be careful with timing, changing to 10 second intervals if unsure. If the chocolate still has very small lumps, it doesn't need to be microwaved and will melt fine once stirred and left to dwell in it's own heat.

, Stir gently. Do not be tempted to use water to thin chocolate, as they don't mix well. Whole cream, butter and other oil and fat based products can be used in place of shortening

, This is where the shape of your container matters- shallow bowls may need an extra tool to cover the spoon in chocolate, while deep containers only need to have spoons dipped. Remove any excess drips by tapping the spoon against the side of the container.

, Alternatively, you can place the container in a large bowl of hot water to keep it warm and prevent the chocolate from hardening.

,, Decorations may include crushed peppermints/candy canes, sprinkles, hot chocolate powder and more. Allow to cool. If in a rush, you can put the spoons in the fridge for about ten minutes for a speedy cool.

, If using as small gifts or party favours, wrap individually in cellophane tied with a cute bow, perhaps in green and red for the holiday season, or in the recipient's favourite colour. For a larger gift, you can tie multiple together at the base of the spoon with a ribbon, then cover in cellophane. As it's a food product, make sure the wrapping is hygienic. Try to keep the spoons chilled as long as you can, to prevent melting when giving as a gift. You can even include a drink mix (coffee or hot chocolate) and a cute mug to go with your chocolate spoons.

Decide which kinds of eggs you need.,
Become familiar with how eggs are graded in your area.,
Look further into the standards for ""premium"" eggs.,
If you will be consuming the egg raw, look for pasteurized eggs.,
Look for the expiration date and date code (Julian date) to determine freshness.",How to Buy Eggs," Most people buy chicken eggs, but there are other kinds of eggs available at stores and markets that may better suit your needs:









Turkey eggs are very similar in nutrition and flavor to chicken eggs, but larger. Since these eggs are difficult to produce on a commercial scale, they are usually not available.Duck eggs - These eggs have more protein in the whites and fat in the yolks than chicken eggsso substituting them for chicken eggs in certain recipes is not recommended unless you can adjust accordingly.
Goose eggs - These have more fat content than chicken eggs, so they can make for richer dishes, but they're not good for frying.Ostrich eggs - These massive eggs are usually opened carefully with a hammer. When scrambled, the texture is lighter and fluffier than that of a chicken egg and it has a milder, faintly sweeter taste.Quail eggs - They taste pretty much just like chicken eggs, but their small size can make for unique presentation. They are also hard to open without breaking the yolk.Sometimes they are eaten raw in sushi.;
, Most countries have grading systems for chicken eggs, usually based on weight. See the section below for information from various localities showing the different standards used by consumers to purchase eggs.








,









Organic eggs generally come from chickens that are fed organic feed (little or no pesticide and herbicide use, non-GMO) and are not given antibiotics unless necessary to control infection. They are given access to the outdoors for at least some part of the year, although that does not mean they actually go outdoors.""Free range"" and ""cage free"" are terms not regulated in the US, which means anyone can label any egg ""free range"" no matter how the chickens were raised. The best way to determine how the hens are raised is to purchase your eggs from a farmer whose farm you can visit to see for yourself.

, This will help you avoid food poisoning in raw cookie dough, homemade mayonnaise, eggnog or any dish that has uncooked or lightly cooked eggs.








, The Julian date (JD) is a 3-digit number that corresponds to the calendar day, out of 365, that the eggs were packaged. If you want fresh eggs, try to find a JD that is as close as possible to the current day.

Finished.

",How to Make Lentils," Pour 1 cup (250 mL) dried lentils out on a kitchen towel, plate, cutting board, or other clean surface. Pick through the lentils, sorting out any rocks, bits of soil, or other debris as you run across them. Also discard any lentils that appear to be damaged.


While reputable sellers do have a sorting process of their own, it is possible that their machines can miss the occasional rock or bad lentil. As such, it is recommended that you sort through the lentils by hand before making them.
Note that green, brown, and French lentils work best if you plan to prepare and serve them on their own. Red, orange, and yellow lentils tend to get mushy when cooked, and are better when prepared for sauces, stews, and soups.;
, Place the lentils in a colander and rinse them under cool water for 30 seconds or so. Turn off the water and gently shake the colander to encourage excess water to drip out.


A strainer, sifter, or other fine-mesh utensil can also be used in place of a colander. Simply make sure that the tool you use has small enough holes to prevent the lentils from falling through.
Do not soak the lentils.Most dried beans and other dried legumes need to be soaked for a period of time in order to soften them and remove some of the compounds known to cause digestive upset. Lentils, however, will become mushy if allowed to soak in the same way dried beans might soak, so pre-soaking them is not recommended.

,


You can cook as few or as many lentils as you would like using this method. No matter how many lentils you plan on cooking, though, make sure that the ratio of lentils to water is 1 portion of lentils per 2 portions of water.

, Heat the water on the stove using medium-high heat. Allow the water to reach a rapid simmer, but avoid letting it come to a rolling boil.


You should see many small bubbles coming to the surface during a rapid simmer. During a rolling boil, large bubbles that almost resemble waves will come to the surface.
Leave the saucepan uncovered.

, Reduce the heat to medium or medium-low, dropping the contents of the saucepan down to a gentle simmer.


During a gentle simmer, you should only be able to see minor bubble formation. You may even see a small amount of movement in the lentils, but the movement should not be violent.
Keep an eye on the lentils as they cook. If necessary, you may add more water during the cooking time, but only add enough to make sure that the lentils are just barely covered.
Leave the saucepan uncovered.Covering the saucepan traps more heat inside and makes it nearly impossible to drop the water movement down to that of a slow simmer. The end result of a covered pot is mushy lentils.
Note that older lentils may take longer to cook. These lentils are also more likely to shed their skins while they simmer.

, Allow the lentils to stand for 5 to 10 minutes so that they absorb more of the water.


If you like tenderness and texture of your lentils after they have boiled for 20 to 30 minutes, though, you can skip this step and move directly to the next one. As the lentils absorb more of the water, they will only become softer.

, Pour the contents of the saucepan through a fine-mesh colander or strainer to separate the water from the lentils.


When done, return the lentils to the saucepan.

, Stir 1/4 tsp (1.25 mL) salt into the lentils. Taste, and add more salt as needed.


Note that salt and acidic ingredients should only be added to lentils after they finish cooking. Adding them before or during the cooking process will cause the lentils to remain hard and crunchy.
You should still stir the salt in while the lentils are warm, though, since doing so will allow the lentils to absorb more of the taste than they would if you added the salt after the lentils cooled.
Note that this step completes the cooking process.

,


As is true with the stovetop method, you can cook as few or as many lentils as you need to make using the slow cooker method as long as you have a large enough slow cooker. Simply make sure that the ration of lentils to water is 1 portion of lentils per 4 portions of water.

, Cover the slow cooker and set it to low. Cook the lentils until they become tender without turning mushy.


This process usually takes about 4 hours, but the time may vary depending on how old the lentils are. Older lentils may take up to 6 hours, while younger, fresher lentils may only need 3 1/2 to 4 hours.
If cooking on a High setting, halve the time. Cook the lentils for 2 hours instead of 4 hours.
Do not stir the lentils as they cook. Avoid removing the lid during the cooking process, only doing so once you are ready to test for doneness. Removing the lid causes the heat built up in the slow cooker to escape, which could delay and lengthen your total cooking time.

, Use a slotted spoon to transfer the lentils to a serving bowl or pour the contents of the slow cooker through a colander or strainer with small holes.


If you emptied the contents of the slow cooker, you can return the lentils to the slow cooker after straining out the water. Make sure that the heat is turned off, however.

, Stir 1/4 tsp (1.25 mL) salt into the lentils after draining them. Add more salt as needed.


Do not add salt or acidic ingredients to the lentils as they cook. Doing so can prevent the lentils from becoming tender.
Note that this step completes the cooking process for your lentils.

, Other than salt, most non-acidic seasonings can be added to the pot of lentils and water as they cook. Seasoning the lentils as they cook allows the flavor to be absorbed more thoroughly.


Possible seasonings for 1 cup (250 mL) dried lentils include 1/4 tsp (1.25 mL) freshly ground black pepper, 1 bay leaf, 1 clove mashed or minced garlic, or 1 sliced shallot.
Strain out large seasonings like bay leaves or clumps of garlic when you strain out the water.

,


Both chicken stock and vegetable stock are popular choices. Use as much stock as you would use water.
Homemade stock is preferable to store-bought broth since a commercial broth is likely to contain a high content of salt. Salt can make it difficult, if not impossible, for the lentils to become tender if added to the lentils as they cook. Any broth or stock you use should be salt-free, if possible, or at least very low in sodium.

,


Many other vegetables, like carrots and broccoli, can also be cooked alongside the lentils. Make sure that you choose slightly tougher vegetables, though, rather than soft vegetables like peas, onions, or bell peppers, since soft vegetables tend to cook too fast.
Make sure that you add more water if cooking the lentils with vegetables. In a slow cooker, you should have at least 2 inches (5 cm) of water covering the contents of the slow cooker. For a saucepan, make sure that the contents are slightly covered throughout the entire process.

, You can add other seasonings and dressings to your lentils alongside the salt.


Acidic ingredients should always be added after the lentils finish cooking, but even non-acidic ingredients can be added to fully cooked lentils.
Acidic ingredients include lemon juice and vinegar.
Olive oil or oil-based dressings can be used, as well.
You can also consider adding spices like curry powder, ground cumin, garlic, cayenne pepper, or chili pepper, as well as herbs like cilantro or parsley.

If you put in too much of the remaining water, the dough will be too soft and will stick to the sides. If you have done this, try adding pinches of flour to rebuild the consistency until you get a ball again.

, When the time is up, turn off the bread machine and unplug it. Take a sheet of plastic wrap and pick up the ball from the machine, wrapping it in the plastic. Your skin need not touch the dough. Set this wrapped dough aside to settle for 20 minutes.

,, If it feels a little sticky, dip your hands or the dough into some flour and pat the dough until it's no longer sticky. Break the dough into four or more smaller balls.

, If you have a pasta maker you are ready to go. Run the dough through the rollers at the widest setting then work your way to the thinnest. Each setting will make your strip longer and wider. If the strips become too wide, fold them over and run through again. To save time you could use every other thickness setting as you work your way to the thinnest. If your goal is lasagna, don't bother with the thinnest setting, it may be too thin.

, By the time you've made all the strips, the first strip should be dry enough to cut. The strip should not be sticky at all. If it is, it could cause problems with the cutter. As each strip is cut into noodles hang them to dry more.


If you don't have a pasta maker flatten the balls of dough with a rolling pin then use a pizza cutter to cut into noodles. You can use this to make lasagna, ravioli or egg noodles should work and you can certainly experiment with twisting and folding your dough to invent your own noodle.
You can also Use a Paper Shredder as a Pasta Machine!

, Standard pasta cooking directions apply to this dough. Boil for 3 to 5 minutes in slightly salted water.

Use the slow soak method if you've got a night to soak your beans.,
If time is of the essence, try the quick soak.,
Wait for the beans to double or triple in size, depending on what soaking method you decide to use.,
Rinse the beans thoroughly in a colander after soaking.",How to Cook Dried Beans2," The slow soak method is a preferred method of preparing beans if you've set aside enough time to soak overnight. Slow soaking ensures that the final product is fully cooked, not crunchy or underdone.


If you choose the slow soak method, put the beans in a 5 qt. (4.7 l) saucepan and cover them with about 8 cups (about 2 l) of water. Put the lid on the saucepan and allow them to soak overnight in the refrigerator.

, For a faster soak, put the beans and water in a saucepan and bring them to a boil. Allow them to boil for about 2 to 3 minutes. Remove the saucepan from the heat, cover it with a lid and let the beans soak for at least 1 hour.

, If you leave your beans in cool water overnight, expect them to at least double in size. Make sure your cooking vessel is large enough to accommodate this transformation., Your beans are now ready to be cooked.

"
"
Put the beans in a large cooking pot and add enough water to completely cover them.

,
Add a tablespoon of vegetable or olive oil to the pot to cut down on excessive foam and boil-over while the beans are cooking.,
Simmer the dried beans on low to medium heat.,
Consult the proper cooking time of the types of beans you're using.,
Test the dried beans by mashing one with a fork or between your fingers.,
Serve the cooked beans.",How to Cook Dried Beans3,", Because the beans expand while cooking, periodically adding small amounts of water to the pot will keep them adequately covered, ensuring even cooking., Properly soaked beans usually require between 30 minutes and 2 hours of cooking.

, Cooking times will vary depending on the variety of dried bean.


Black beans: 60 minutes
Light/dark red kidney beans: 90 to 120 minutes
Navy beans: 90 to 120 minutes
Great northern beans: 45 to 60 minutes
Pinto beans: 90 to 120 minutes

, Ideally, your beans will be tender but not mushy. If your beans are still crunchy or underdone after the recommended cooking time, continue cooking at a simmer, checking every 10 minutes for doneness.

, Refrigerate any leftovers.

Then, transfer the rice to a sieve to strain the water. Wash the rice under fresh running water for a minute.Soaking and washing rice removes dirt and excess starch, so your rice will be fluffy and not sticky.;
, Pour 2 cups (470 ml) or water into a medium saucepan. Put on a lid and bring the water to a boil over medium heat. Depending on the type of rice you're making, you may need to adjust the rice to water ratio. Per cup of rice (195 g), use the following water quantities:








Use 2 cups (470 ml) of water for long-grain white rice, medium- or short-grain brown rice, and wild rice.
Use 1¾ cups of water (411 ml) for long-grain brown rice or jasmine rice.
Use 1½ cups of water (353 ml) for medium-grain white rice or basmati rice.
Use 1¼ cups of water (294 ml) for short-grain white rice.

, When the water is boiling, remove the lid from the pot. Stir in the remaining ingredients. Bring the water back to a gentle simmer over medium heat. Once the water is simmering again, put the lid on and turn the heat down to low. Continue cooking for 18 to 30 minutes, depending on the type of rice.








White rice varieties will take around 18 minutes to cook.
Brown rice varieties will need closer to 30 minutes.
Don’t stir the rice or remove the lid until it’s time to check for doneness.
The rice is done when it’s firm but tender and not crunchy.

, When the rice is cooked, remove it from the heat. Leave the lid on and set the pot aside to rest for at least five minutes. This will help to steam the rice, give it a chance to absorb leftover moisture, and make it tender.









You can leave the rice to steam for up to 30 minutes., Fluffing the rice means stirring it with a spoon or rice spatula. This lets excess moisture escape and helps to make the rice plump. After stirring, let the rice sit for another two minutes before serving.Serve the rice as a side dish, add to soups, or add your favorite spices and vegetables to make a complete meal.


Store leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge for up to five days.

, Pour the rice into a bowl and fill the bowl with cold water. Soak the rice for about 30 minutes. When the time is up, drain the rice in a sieve and rinse it under running water.








Rinsing will remove starch and help make the rice less sticky.

, Add the rice, salt, oil, and 3 cups (705 ml) of water to the pressure cooker. For a more flavorful rice, you can also add other herbs, spices, and seasonings, such as:








Chopped garlic
Minced onion
Bay leaf
Dried herbs like parsley, rosemary, and thyme
Cayenne pepper
Paprika

, For an electric pressure cooker, put on the lid, lock the lid, and set the rice to cook on high pressure. For a stovetop pressure cooker, put on and lock the lid. Bring the pressure cooker to pressure over high heat, then lower the heat to low. The cooking time will depend on the type of rice:








Cook jasmine rice for one minute
Cook short-grain, medium-grain, and long-grain white rice for three minutes
Cook basmati rice for four minutes
Cook brown rice for 22 minutes
Cook wild rice for 25 minutes

, When the cooking time has elapsed, turn off an electric pressure cooker or remove the stovetop cooker from the heat. Let the pressure drop naturally for the next 10 minutes, and don’t open the release valve during this time.








This will give the rice a chance to finish steaming, and allow the pressure cooker pressure to drop to a safe level.

, After 10 minutes, open the pressure valve to release the remaining pressure from the cooker. Stand back from the cooker while the steam releases to avoid burning.








When the pressure has dropped to zero unlock and remove the lid.

, Stir the rice with a spoon, fork, or rice spatula to fluff it up and release the remaining moisture. Serve the rice as part of your favorite meal, side, or add-on to other dish.Leftovers can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to five days.

, Combine the rice in a bowl with enough cold water to cover the rice. Let it soak for at least 30 minutes before draining and rinsing the rice under running water.









You can soak the rice for a couple hours before draining and rinsing, and this will result in rice that isn't sticky at all., You can steam rice in either a rice cooker or an electric steamer. A rice cooker is specifically for rice, whereas an electric steamer is for vegetables and other foods as well. Both come with a basket for rice. Stir together the rice and water in the basket.









When steaming rice, always use equal parts rice and water. To make rice to serve more people, simply increase the quantities of both equally., When using an electric steamer to make rice, you also have to add extra water to the basin below the steamer basket. This is necessary to create the steam that will cook the rice.









For smaller quantities of rice, add water to the minimum fill line. For larger quantities, add water to the maximum fill line.
You don’t have to add extra water to a rice cooker.

, Put the lid on. Select the rice variety on a rice steamer. With both a rice cooker and electric steamer, set the cooking time to 30 to 40 minutes and cook the rice. White rice varieties will only need about 30 minutes. Brown and wild rice varieties will need closer to 40 minutes.







, When the rice is tender and cooked, open the lid and remove the basket from the steamer. Stir the rice with a spoon, fork, or rice spatula and serve."

Measure the rice with a cup and put it into your cooking pot.,
Rinse the rice if necessary.,
Measure the water.,
Soak the rice for thirty minutes, if desired.,
Add flavorings (optional).,
Push the rice grains off the sides and under the water level.,
Check your rice cooker for special options.,
Cook the rice in the rice cooker.,
Allow the rice to ""rest"" for 10-15 minutes before removing the lid (optional).,
Fluff and serve.",How to Cook Rice in a Rice Cooker1," Some rice cookers have a removable bowl or pot, while others must have the rice placed directly in the cooker. Most of the time, rice cookers will come with a measuring ""cup"" or scoop that can fit 3/4 cup (180 mL). Alternatively, use an ordinary measuring cup.


One cup (240 mL) of uncooked rice will generate anywhere from 1 1/2 cups (360 mL) to three cups (720 mL) of cooked rice, depending on variety. Leave enough space for this expansion to prevent the rice cooker from spilling over.;
, Many people prefer to rinse rice in order to remove any pesticides, herbicides, or contaminants that may be present. Some less modern milling practices also create broken grains that release excess starch into the rice, which needs to be rinsed off to prevent the rice clumping together.If you decide to rinse the rice, pour drinking water into the bowl or hold it under the faucet. Stir as you add the water, until the rice is fully submerged. Drain water through a sieve or tip the bowl slowly while catching fallen rice grains with your hand. If the water looks discolored or filled with floating bits of broken rice or dirt, rinse a second or third time until new water added looks relatively clear.









White rice sold in the United States is required by law to be enriched with powdered iron, niacin, thiamin, or folic acid; these vitamins and minerals are usually removed by washing.If your rice cooker has a non-stick bowl, wash the rice (prior to cooking) in a colander with several washes/rinses/drains. Replacement non-stick bowls are very expensive.

, Most rice cooker instructions recommend cold water. How much water you add depends on what kind of rice you're cooking and how moist you prefer it. There are often graduated marks on the inside of a rice cooker, indicating how much rice and water should be added, or instructions on the package of rice. Alternatively, use the following suggested amounts depending on your variety of rice, but keep in mind you can always adjust these in future if you prefer your rice more chewy or soft:









White, long grain - 1 3/4 cups of water per 1 cup of rice (420 mL water per 240 mL rice)
White, medium grain - 1 1/2 cups of water per 1 cup of rice (360 mL water per 240 mL rice)
White, short grain - 1 1/4 cups of water per 1 cup of rice (300 mL water per 240 mL rice)
Brown, long grain - 2 1/4 cups of water per 1 cup of rice (520 mL water per 240 mL rice)
Sold as ""parboiled"" (not half-cooked at home) - 2 cups of water per 1 cup of rice
For Indian style rices like Basmati or Jasmine, less water is needed as a drier rice is desired, use no more than 1 1/2 cups of water per 1 cup of rice. Use only 1 to 1 if you washed the rice previously. It is ok to add bay leaves or cardamom pods directly to the rice cooker to enhance the flavor.

, This is not required, but some people soak the rice to shorten the cooking time. Soaking may also make the cooked rice stickier. Use the amount of water measured earlier to soak the rice at room temperature, then use this same water for cooking.

, Flavorings should be added to the water before you start the rice cooker, so the rice will absorb these flavors during cooking. Many people prefer to add a little bit of salt for flavor at this time. Butter or oil are another common option. If you are making Indian style rice, you may wish to add a few cardamom seeds or a bay leaf.








, Use a wooden or plastic utensil to move any rice grains around the pot back into the water. Rice left above the water surface may burn during cooking. If water or rice spilled over the edge, wipe the outside of the pot with a cloth or rag.









You do not need to stir the rice under the water level. This may release excess starch and result in clumpier or stickier rice.

, Some rice cookers simply have an on/off switch. Others have different settings for brown or white rice, or the ability to delay the cooking until a specified time period has passed. You are unlikely to run into problems if you just go with the basic settings, but it's a good idea to figure out what each button or option does if possible.

, If your rice cooker has a removable cooking pot, place the pot of rice and water back into the rice cooker. Close the lid of the cooker, plug the cooker in, and press the switch to turn it on. The switch will click, like a toaster, when the rice is done. In most rice cookers, the rice will be warmed until you unplug the cooker.


Don't lift the lid to check on the rice. The cooking process depends on the development of steam inside the pot, so letting steam escape by opening the lid may result in improperly cooked rice.
The rice cooker automatically turns off when the temperature inside the pot exceeds waters boiling point (212 degrees F or 100 degrees C at sea level), which will not happen until all the free water has vaporized., This is not required but is commonly recommended in rice cooker instructions, and is automatic in some models. Unplugging the rice cooker or taking the pot off of the heat for this period will minimize the amount of rice that sticks to the pot.

, Once there is no water left, the rice should be ready to eat. Using a fork or other utensil to stir the rice after cooking will break up clumps and release steam, preventing the rice from overcooking.









If the rice is not ready to eat, see troubleshooting.

Preheat oven to 325 degrees.,
Add barbecue sauce, molasses, mustard and vinegar to a mixing bowl.,
Cut bacon strips in half.,
Add diced onion and bell pepper to the frying pan.,
Add the cans of beans to the frying pan.,
Add the barbecue sauce/molasses mixture to the pan.,
Transfer the entire mixture to a large casserole pan or baking dish.,
Cook the beans at 325 degrees for 2 hours.",How to Make Baked Beans1," The best baked beans are cooked slowly at a medium-low heat for a thick, well-cooked consistency - nothing's worse than thin or soupy baked beans. Make sure you have time in your schedule to periodically check on the beans for the several hours they're in the oven.;
, Mix until combined. Set aside.


If you don't have molasses, you can try substituting 1/2 cup of brown sugar. If you have molasses, but don't have enough, try substituting 1/2 cup of white sugar with a teaspoon of molasses.

, Fry bacon in a steep-edged frying pan until done but soft. Don't cook ""crispy"" bacon - the bacon strips will continue to cook in the oven. Transfer bacon to a plate covered with a paper towel (to absorb grease) and set aside. If there's excess grease in the pan, you may remove some for later use]. However, leave at least enough grease in the pan that you can see it move when you tilt the pan.


Resist the urge to clean the pan! The leftover grease will add a smoky, meaty flavor to the final dish.
If you're leaving bacon out of this recipe, simply heat a tablespoon of oil (vegetable or olive oil work fine) in your frying pan and use it to fry the ingredients in the following steps.

, Sautee in bacon grease over high heat until tender (usually about 2-4 minutes.)

, Maintain heat, stirring the ingredients together until combined. If your frying pan isn't big enough to accommodate the beans without spilling, scrape all ingredients to a larger pan or pot.

, Stir ingredients together to create a thick stew. Bring the stew to a light simmer for 1-2 minutes.

, If you're using bacon in your recipe, lay the cooked bacon strips across the top of the baked beans at even intervals. The bacon will continue to cook in the oven, browning to a nice, crisp consistency that compliments the soft, thick texture of the beans.

, Periodically check on the beans to ensure they don't dry out - you want a thick, but not dry, texture. If you notice your beans drying out, add more liquid. If you have it, extra barbecue sauce mixture or bacon grease works great. If not, water will suffice. When done, remove from the oven. Let beans cool slightly to thicken. Serve and enjoy!


Baked beans are a great side dish for barbecued meats - try serving with grilled ribs, beef, or chicken. Cornbread is also a great companion for baked beans.

Reduce water levels next time if the rice is mushy.,
Add more water and cook on the stove if the rice is undercooked.,
Remove rice promptly after cooking if the rice is frequently burned.,
Find a use for overcooked rice.,
Adjust for altitude.,
Deal with leftover water.,
Finished.

",How to Cook Rice in a Rice Cooker2," Next time you make rice, use 1/4–1/2 cup (30–60 mL) less water per cup (240 mL) of rice. This should cook the rice for a shorter period of time, and give it less water to absorb.

, If the rice turns out too chewy or dry for your liking, move it to the stovetop with 1/4 cup (30 mL) of water. Cook covered for a few minutes to steam the rice.









Adding it back to the rice cooker without enough water to cover it could result in burning, or the rice cooker failing to turn on.
Next time, simply add about 1/4–1/2 cup (30–60mL) of water per cup (240 mL) rice to the rice cooker before you turn it on.

, A working rice cooker shouldn't burn rice during the cooking, but if left in ""warming"" mode, the rice at the bottom and sides can get burned. If this happens often, remove rice from the cooker as soon as you hear the ""click"" signifying it is done (or when the warming light goes on).









On some cookers, you can turn off the warming option entirely, but in this case, you should still eat or refrigerate the rice before it cools to reduce the risk of food poisoning.
If you are cooking other ingredients with the rice, those can burn during cooking. Next time, remove any sugary ingredients and cook separately, or any ingredients that you notice burning.

, Mushy, split grains can still be tasty if used in the right recipe.Consider these options to make the mushy texture less noticeable:









Fry it to remove that excess moisture
Turn it into a sweet dessert
Add it to any soup, baby food, or homemade meatballs

, If you live at 3,000 feet (910 m) or above, you may notice your rice ends up undercooked. If this happens, add an extra 1/4–1/2 cup of water per cup of rice (30–60 mL water per 240 mL rice). The lower air pressure at high altitude causes water to boil at a lower temperature, so the rice will take longer to cook. The more water you add to a rice cooker, the longer it will continue to cook.


Consult the rice cooker instructions or contact the manufacturer if you cannot find the correct amount of additional water. The amount necessary varies with altitude.

, If there is water left over in a rice cooker after it's finished cooking, the rice cooker model is likely defective and may need to be replaced. For the current batch of rice, drain the water and serve if the rice texture suits your preferences. Otherwise, turn the rice cooker back on until the water is used up.

Add about 3.5 cups of dry navy beans to a large pot.,
The next day, transfer the beans and water to a stove top and heat to a light simmer.,
Strain the beans, setting the water aside.,
Prepare them the same way you would canned beans.",How to Make Baked Beans2," Submerge the beans in plenty of cold water - about three times the volume of the beans. Let the beans soak in the refrigerator overnight. The beans will absorb water overnight, increasing in volume substantially.


If you don't have time to let the beans soak overnight, soften the beans quickly in the oven. Heat your oven to 325 degrees. Add your dry beans, submerged in plenty of water, to a pot with a tight fitting lid. Cook the pot in the oven until your beans are soft - about 90 minutes - 2 hours.







, Simmer the beans until soft - about 1 - 2 hours. Optionally, add 2 teaspoons salt. Sufficiently softened beans should be able to be easily crushed in your fingers.

, The leftover water can be added to the beans during the baked beans while they're cooking to prevent them from drying out. Since the water carries the flavor of the beans, it will taste better than ordinary water when added., Since canned beans often come packed in a bit of sauce, you may need to add slightly more barbecue sauce, molasses, etc. to compensate for the beans' relative dryness. Use common sense - a long as you check the beans periodically as they're cooking, it's hard to accidentally let your beans dry out.

Substitute salt pork for bacon.,
Add extra spice for zest!,
Experiment with your liquid ingredients.",How to Make Baked Beans3," Baked beans have a long and storied history - Native Americans cooked dishes resembling modern baked beans in New England before the arrival of European colonists.Early baked bean recipes in the United States often used salt pork - then a commonly-used ingredient - instead of bacon. Salt pork, like bacon, is derived from the fatty portions of the pig. To give your baked beans an old-fashioned touch, prepare your salt pork by briefly boiling it to remove some of its salt, then fry in a pan until crispy, like bacon. Then, simply substitute your salt pork for bacon!

For a truly authentic Native American baked bean dish, use dear (or even bear) instead of pork products and use maple syrup instead of molasses.

, One great way to give your baked beans a good ""kick"" is to chop up a jalapeno pepper or two when sauteing your onions and bell peppers. If you're especially adventurous, you can even add dried pepper or a super-spicy hot sauce to the baked beans as they simmer in the frying pan. Be warned - not everyone can handle the extra heat.

, Modify your ""sauce"" to suit your tastes. If you don't like barbecue sauce, try substituting ketchup! You can use Worcestershire sauce to modify (or replace) mustard. Also try adding a dash of your favorite spice - a little cinnamon, for instance, can fantastically compliment the sweetness of standard baked beans for a subtle ""Autumn"" flavor. Your sauce is limited only by your imagination - make your own special recipe and share it with your friends!

Choose a bread.,
Choose your condiments.,
Choose your fillings.,
Eat the sandwich cold.,
Cook the sandwich.,
Make breakfast sandwiches.,
Make lunch and dinner sandwiches.,
Make unusual sandwiches.,
Make regional sandwiches.",How to Make a Sandwich," There are lots of different styles of bread that contain ""whole grain"" instead of ""multi grain."" These are the best ones to choose if you're trying to eat healthy, since multi grain has no nutritional benefits beyond normal bread. You can consider some of the following types of breads:


Sliced breads are the norm in most Western grocery stores and these are what is used to make most ""standard"" sandwiches, like peanut butter and jelly. You can get this bread made from many different ingredients (rye, potato, white, wheat, etc), and the different flavors will go better with some sandwiches than others.
Loaf breads are basically sliced breads that haven't been cut yet, but get used in much the same way. This bread is usually fresher and cut thicker than normal sliced bread.
Buns are small round or oval loaves that get cut in half to make the sandwich. This is common with hamburgers or Brioche sandwiches, but you can also use things like pretzel buns.
Raised flat breads include breads like focaccia bread or panini. These have a similar texture to pizza dough or true flat breads but are thicker, which means they can be sliced to create a true sandwich.
Flat breads include things like pita bread, naan, and tortillas. These do not make a true sandwich but instead make wraps or are cut in half and stuffed between the natural bread layers.
;
, Condiments are meant to make the bread more moist. They aren't required, but they can really add to the flavor and texture of the food. When placed on the bread, the condiment should be spread as close to the edge of the bread as possible, making sure the bread is fully covered. Some condiments include:









Butter
Mayo
Mustard
Ketchup
Pesto
Barbecue Sauce
Hollandaise


, Different sandwiches will include different things between the bread layers. This is where you can really get creative! Usually what's inside the sandwich determines which meal it's ""appropriate"" for, but don't let this stop you: if you want a bacon-and-egg sandwich for dinner, go for it! Fillings come in a few categories:









Meats like deli meat, sausage patties, loose meat (usually ground and in a sauce), or chicken breast.
Vegetables like salad leaves, stir-fry vegetables, sliced tomatoes, sliced onions, etc.
Cheese, which is generally always sliced for ease of use, though some cheese may be crumbled (like blue cheese). Good sandwich cheeses include swiss, muenster, brie, gouda, pepperjack, or cheddar.
Other items like egg salad, fried eggs, chili, peanut butter, jelly, marmite, and nutella.

, You can assemble the sandwich by layering the ingredients between the two pieces of bread and simply eating it cold, if you want to. This is common with lunch sandwiches.

, Cooking of sandwiches or hot sandwiches are more common with breakfast and dinner. You should never cook a sandwich in a microwave, as this will steam the bread and make it soggy. However, there are several good ways that you can cook a sandwich or heat it up:









You can use a frying pan or griddle. This is most common with sandwiches like grilled cheese. When doing it this way, you should cover the bread that will be touching the pan with butter or mayonnaise and then cook the sandwich over low heat until the cheese melts, switching to high heat towards the end to brown the bread if it is not already. Don't forget to flip it!
You can use a broiler, which most modern stoves have. This is the drawer under the stove and is usually turned on with a special knob. It gets very hot! Put the sandwich on a pan and place in under the pre-heated broiler for about 5 minutes a side. Check is frequently to make sure it doesn't burn. This is closest to how sandwich shops (like Subway) cook their sandwiches.
You can use a panini grill, which is basically just a George Foreman grill (for the American crowd). This grill gets sprayed with cooking spray and then the sandwich gets pressed between the layers of the grill for about 3 minutes.
You can use a BBQ to cook a sandwich. Aside from the obvious prep of a burger, you can also put other kinds of sandwiches on a grill whole. However, the flames will have to be low or you will likely burn your sandwich.

, Breakfast sandwiches are usually served hot, but don't feel like you can't eat them cold! Some breakfast sandwiches you can make include:









Fried egg and ham sandwich with butter
Sausage and egg sandwich with hollandaise
Bacon and cheese sandwich with mayo
Tomato and cheese sandwich with pesto


, Lunch sandwiches are usually cold, while dinner sandwiches are usually hot, but you don't need to follow those rules! These include sandwiches like:










BLT, which is bacon, lettuce, and tomato with mayo

Reuben, which is sauerkraut, mustard or Russian dressing, corned beef, and swiss cheese

Sloppy Joe, which is ground beef mixed with tomato paste and seasoning

Italian sandwich, which is salami and similar meats, with mayo, lettuce and tomato

Meatball sub which is meatballs and red sauce, covered in Parmesan cheese.

Tunafish sandwich, which is canned tuna mixed with mayonnaise, mustard, onions and pickles


, These include sandwiches like:









Sundried tomato, garlic, spinach, and pepperjack cheese on rye bread
Apple, chicken, and brie burrito
French toast, egg, and bacon sandwich, using the french toast as the bread.
Brie, raspberry, and Nutella on a brioche bun

, For the US, these include sandwiches like:










Po Boy, common in the South, which is made with fried shrimp or oysters, lettuce, tomato, pickles, and sauce
Avocado, cream cheese, and salmon are common sandwich ingredients in the Pacific Northwest and West Coast of the US

Pork Tenderloin sandwiches are common in the Midwest

Bagel and Lox sandwiches are common in the East

Clean the sink thoroughly inside and around the edges, making sure not to leave any soap residue behind.,
Stop up the sink, but don't fill it with water just yet.

,
Know that the easiest way to core and separate a head of lettuce is to firmly (but not squeezing) hold the head of greens in your hands with the stem side down and strike the cut end of the stem against a counter top.,
Fill the sink with cool water.

,
Agitate the greens around gently with your hands to circulate the water through them thoroughly.,
Let the leaves sit for a couple minutes, to allow the dirt to settle on the bottom of the sink.

,
Lift out the leaves one or two at a time, tearing them into the size you want, or leaving them whole for use later.,
Put the leaves in a colander to drain.",How to Clean Greens1," It doesn't have to be sterile, just washed down so there aren't any food remnants or other contaminants. The larger the sink, the better.;
,, This usually cores the head in one or two blows. Then you may pull greens apart (so that nothing remains between leaves that are stuck together) and put them in the sink. For smaller baby greens the stem can usually be pinched away with a thumb and forefinger. To remove tough stems from greens, fold the greens in half along the stem line with one hand clasping close to the stem. With the other hand rip away the stem from the base toward the tip of the leaf. Discard the heart (unless you plan to use the heart for a dish) and any tough stems.

,, Each leaf should be submerged and moved around.

,, If you pull a leaf out of the water and it still seems dirty, swish it around in the water gently or, if you have a double sink, run it under the tap in the other sink. Try not to stir the water (and dirt) up too much.

, If you place the colander in the sink, make sure you have drained the sink fully and rinsed away any remnants. To remove excess water from greens, place the greens in the center of a large piece of cotton muslin (36' x 36'). Gather up the four corners and four edges of the muslin and grasp firmly. Go outside (or in a shower stall) and swing your arm around in a big circle. The water will spin away from this centrifuge action. Then while you prepare the rest of your meal you can open up the muslin and place the greens on a surface somewhere cool and dry, so the greens dry off even further. You can also use a salad spinner, but muslin is much easier to store and less expensive. Dry greens make the best salads -- the salad dressing is not diluted by rinse water, and the leaves are less prone to rot when the salad is stored.

If you are using a roll of bread, slice your bread into 3/4 inch thick slices. You can also cut your bread length-wise.Keep round tops turned in. If you try to grill round-topped bread, like baguettes, you’ll find it can be a real challenge to keep them from rolling over and spilling out the contents of your panini. To solve this problem, turn round-topped bread inside out so that the flat surfaces make contact with the grill.;
, Use a brush or butter knife to distribute a small around of olive oil over the inside surface of your bread. You want to achieve a thin coating here, so make sure not to glob a lot of olive oil onto the bread.


If you use too much oil, your bread will get soggy!

, Put one slice of cheese on each piece of bread, against the olive oil. Adding a piece of cheese to each side of the sandwich helps it stick together better while cooking.


You can use grated cheese too.
If you prefer, you can put cheese just on one side.

, You can get as creative as you want with your panini and use a combination of sliced meats or shredded meat, or make a vegetarian panini with sliced zucchini. Add two slices of meat or zucchini to one piece of bread.


You can increase the amount of filling if you prefer a thicker panini.

, Try some diced onions or fresh cilantro. You can also sprinkle in some salt and pepper, garlic, or add a dash of your favorite hot sauce.


If you are interested in adding vegetables like lettuce, spinach, or tomatoes to your panini, wait until you have cooked it. This will ensure that the vegetables stay crisp and don't get soggy.

, Make sure you don't overfill your panini by too much or the inside of the sandwich won't warm properly when cooking.


You can also use margarine.

, Cooking your panini in a panini press is simple and easy. Just place your sandwich inside and close the lid. Cook for about 3-5 minutes.


Cook according to the manufacturer's instructions until golden and crisp.

, Add butter or oil to your skillet and heat it over medium to low heat until the oil starts to shimmer or until the butter melts. Don't let the butter brown. Without a panini press, your best option is to use a grill pan, but you can use a regular frying pan if that's all you have. Place your sandwich into the heated grill pan.

, Since you aren't using a panini press, you will still need something to press your sandwich down. This is where the cast iron pan comes in. You can use a metal pan or skillet, but a cast iron pan works best.


Be careful when handling your pan. Cast iron pans can get very hot so you may need to use an oven mitt to grab it once it's heated.

, Place you heated cast iron or metal pan directly onto your sandwich. The weight of the pan on top of your sandwich will create the same effect you'd get from a panini press. Keep in mind, there are additional alternatives to a cast iron pan. Here are some other things you can try:


Use a pan lid for a press. This works best if you cook your panini for a few minutes on each side while pressing down on the lid.Use a pot. If you have a large spaghetti or soup pot, you can put some rocks inside and press your panini with it.
Try out the ultimate makeshift panini press by wrapping a brick in aluminum foil and using it to press down your sandwich., Let your panini cook like this for about 3-5 minutes or until the bottom piece of bread gets golden brown and the cheese melts.

, Lift the cast iron pan away and use a spatula to flip your panini over. Place the cast iron pan back into your panini. Cook your panini until the cheese is melted and the underside is golden brown.

, Remove your panini from the pan and carefully peel it open. Drop in your lettuce, spinach, or any other vegetable you desire. Adding greens last will help they stay crisp.

, A sharp, straight-edged knife, rather than a serrated one, will ensure a smooth separation for your finished panini. Serve with a side of chips, a cup of soup, or a delicious salad and enjoy!

, You can use virtually any type of bread you desire. You can even use a bagel. Visit a fresh bakery and try a pretzel roll, pita bread, or even plain white bread. The options are endless!

, Try sharp cheddar or a spicy pepper jack. Grate your own cheese or layer on the slices. Mix different cheeses for a more interesting flavor. Try any cheese you like.


Try adding some shaved parmesan, manchego cheese, or soft goat cheese.

, Add a few minutes to the cooking time to get a rich golden brown. Letting the bread crisp up will create a crunchy panini that is gooey and soft on the inside.

, Try sliced tomatoes, cucumber, onions, or mushrooms. Add these ingredients raw or grill them first. You can even add a few basil leaves or some sliced bell pepper.


Be careful when adding ""wet"" ingredients. They might make your sandwich soggy. If you are adding tomatoes, cucumbers, or anything with a high water content, scoop out the seeds first.

, That's right, fruit! Slice some apple or pear for a sweet and refreshing twist on a meat or vegetarian panini.


Try adding grilled eggplant in place of meat for a delicious vegetarian panini.

, You can use any leftover meat you have. Shred chicken or steak or add some crispy bacon. Try adding chopped anchovies for an interesting flavor. Try roast beef, pastrami, or any meat you prefer.Make sure all the meat you add to your panini is fully cooked.

, Spread some pesto sauce inside your sandwich or try your favorite spicy mustard. You can even add some fig jam for an added sweetness. Try BBQ sauce or hot sauce too!

, You can't go wrong with a pinch of salt and pepper. But, you don't have to stop there either. Try a dash of garlic or onion salt. Try dusting a bit of garlic salt on the outside of your bread over the butter.


Use seasonings sparingly, you can easily overpower your panini with too much salt or garlic.

, Use white bread or cinnamon raisin bread and coat the inside with hazelnut spread. Fill your sandwich up with sliced banana and marshmallows and drizzle some chocolate syrup on the inside. Cook until the outsides are golden brown and the marshmallows are melted. , Invite a group of family and friends to try out your most creative panini. Buy a selection of bread and fillings and challenge your friends to make the most creative and delicious panini.

Place the rice in a fine mesh colander.,
Rinse the rice thoroughly.,
Let the rice dry.",How to Cook Brazilian Rice1," Pour the rice into a colander with fine mesh holes. Gently shift the colander so that the rice is evenly spread throughout.


The holes of the colander must be very small. For this reason, a mesh colander is better than a plastic one, since mesh colanders are often available with very fine holes.
It is not recommended that you use cheesecloth since the grains of rice will likely stick to the cloth.
Note that this part of the process only applies to versions of the recipe that use uncooked rice. If you are using rice that has already been cooked, the cooked rice does not need to be washed.

, Rinse the rice under running tap water. Continue rinsing until the water dripping out from the bottom of the colander runs clear.


You must wait until the water runs clear. Only then can you be certain that the rice is thoroughly cleaned.
Shift the rice gently in its colander or use your hands to gently stir it as it rinses. Doing so will help clean the rice quicker and more thoroughly.

, Set the colander of rice aside and let the excess water drip out naturally. Wait until the rice air dries before you use it for the dish.


Do not attempt to dry the rice with paper towels or cloth towels.
The rice must be thoroughly dry before you add it to the pan in any of these recipes.

Understand the biology of a hangover.,
Keep it light.,
Hunt out the healthy ingredients in your fridge and pantry.,
Break out the these ingredients and cut them to your taste!,
Eat small portions only.,
Stay hydrated.,
If the salad just doesn't do it for you and you still feel like hell, there's always a way to speed up the recovery.,
Get enough sleep and be patient.",How to Make a Hangover Bashing Salad," When your body breaks down alcohol, it has to use plenty of vitamins and other nutrients that your body would normally be using to run its usual functions smoothly. So after tying one on, you're depleted of vital nutrients, which all need to be replenished as quickly as possible. So, instead of popping a chemical nerve freezer, it's much wiser to revitalize yourself with yummy fresh salad to help speed up your recovery.;
, In order to save your stomach, you will need to avoid heavy foods of the following sort: potatoes, fries, pasta, greasy salad dressings, meats and other foods that are heavy on the digestion. Heavy starchy or heavy protein foods are going to be tough on your weakened stomach and anything greasy will probably be super nauseating. Instead, arm yourself with: veggies, rice, eggs and nuts.


If you have some vague notion that fried foods and alcohol are a good match, then remember this for future reference: Fried food can possibly work before drinking to help slow the absorption of alcohol into your bloodstream by sticking to your stomach's lining., When making a hangover bashing salad, find the following in your fridge or from the pantry:


Tomatoes, lettuce, cucumbers, green olives, carrots, bell peppers (capsicum), onions, etc.
Bananas, kiwi fruit - these are great because they replace lost electrolytes, potassium and magnesium Fish (canned, smoked or fresh) - sardines will replenish lost sodium, chloride, potassium, magnesium and calcium, as well as contributing liver protecting Omega 3 fatty acidsFresh non-roasted unsalted nuts
Eggs - which contain cysteine, that can help break down the hangover causing toxin acetaldehyde in the liver
Cheese (choose a very natural one like Gouda, Emmental, or Mozzarella
Extra virgin olive oil (EVOO).

, There's no right and wrong here. Mix up a good bowl of salad made from these ingredients. Use only raw vegetables, unsalted and unroasted peanuts and serve with cooked eggs (boiled or poached is ideal). As much as possible, concentrate on using ingredients that contain moisture. Your body needs water more than ever at this critical moment. Don't deprive yourself of liquid!


Never use spices and/or salt. The reason for this is simple––you don't want to put too much strain on your stomach after a heavy night of drinking. That's why you need to use easily digestible foods. This is the fastest way to replenish the lost vitamins!

, Never munch down the whole bowl of salad at once. Your stomach may get angry at you for this kind of abuse and it will most definitely reward you with some heavy metal vomiting. Avoid this by eating small doses of salad in hourly intervals until you feel better. When you're confident that your stomach feels better, then you'll be able to eat heavier food like meats, bread, potatoes, etc., but for now keep the meals fresh, light and short.

, Never forget to drink plenty of water after a hangover. This will help your body to clean out all the junk you put into yourself the day before. Have water as often as you can stomach it but again, initially this may mean only small amounts frequently because a large amount may simply come up again.


Have fruit juice. The fruit sugar replenishes your energy quickly after a hangover., You can use a blitzkrieg combination of veggie soup and salad. This will boost up your vitamins and rehydrate you to a decent level.You could use leeks, onions, carrots, asparagus, chicory and broccoli and mix them all together. Many of these are vitamin bombs, but only in combination of a soup. Eating them this way makes them actually quite yummy. Remember, just salad and soup with small doses and you'll be fine before you know it.

, In between this rabbit munching, do some sloth snoozing. Alcohol causes us to sleep fitfully and you'll be needing more sleep to help restore the energy that has been depleted by the booze. Sleep some, eat your hangover bashing salad and blitzkrieg soup and you'll recover in a record time.

, Break an egg into the mixture and whisk it together to incorporate the egg. You're on your way to making the batter.

, Just squeeze a lemon slice into the mixture and then pour the water in. If the mixture is still too thick, you can add more water to thin it out.

, These are the last of the ingredients you'll need for the batter.

, Use a whisk to fully mix the ingredients together. The result shouldn't be too thick, but should be a bit on the thin side. If it seems too thick and chunky, then you can add a little bit more water.

, In a frying pan, heat the oil over medium to high heat. Give it at least one minute to heat up.

, When the oil is hot, add 2 tablespoons of the mixture for each fritter and flatten it with the back of a spoon. This will give the fritter a pancake-like shape. Just watch out for spurting oil when you place the fritters into the pan.

, Cook until golden brown on both sides.

, When the fritters are cooked, use a slotted spoon to remove them from the pan and absorb any excess oil with paper towels.

, Serve them with chili sauce and garnish with coriander or parsley leaves. You can also always enjoy this delicious recipe on your own. These fritters are perfect for breakfast or as a snack during any time of day.

Heat the oil in a large saucepan.,
Add the onion.,
Add the garlic.,
Stir in the rice and salt.,
Let the rice brown.,
Pour in the hot water.,
Simmer until done.,
Serve hot.",How to Cook Brazilian Rice2," Pour the oil into a large saucepan and set it on your stove over medium heat.


Let the oil heat up for 30 to 60 seconds before continuing to the next step. It should look glossy and should easily glide around the bottom of the pan when the pan is tilted. Do not let the oil begin to smoke, however.;
, Stir the onion into the hot oil and cook it alone, stirring frequently, for about 1 minute.


The onion should start to become fragrant and take on a translucent appearance, but it should not yet begin to brown.

, Stir the garlic into the onion and cook both, stirring frequently, until the garlic turns golden brown.


This should only take 2 or 3 minutes. The mixture should be fragrant and lightly toasted, but not quite browned.
Cook the onions and garlic carefully. If they start to burn, this burnt flavor will also taint the rice and make the dish less appetizing.

, Add the rice and the salt to the saucepan. Stir well to distribute the onion and garlic evenly.


Basmati and jasmine rice are recommended, but any long-grain white rice should be fine.

, Stir the contents of the pan until the rice starts to take on a lightly toasted appearance.


As you toast the rice, you will need to stir it frequently to ensure that none of the grains stick to the bottom of the pan.

, Add the hot water to the saucepan. Stir well, making sure that all of the rice is submerged.


For best results, use boiling water prepared in a saucepan, tea kettle, or microwave. Hot tap water will also work, but make sure that it is as hot as possible before adding it to the pan.
After adding it to the pan, let the water reach a boil before continuing to the next step.

, Cover the saucepan with its lid and reduce the heat to low. Let the mixture simmer for 20 to 25 minutes, or until all of the water has been absorbed.


If the water evaporates before the rice is tender, you can add more water to the pan and continue cooking it. Only add 1/4 cup (60 ml) of additional water at a time, though, to prevent the mixture from getting too soupy.

, The Brazilian rice is now finished and ready to enjoy.

Melt the butter.,
Toast the rice.,
Add the remaining ingredients.,
Cover and let simmer until done.,
Serve hot.",How to Cook Brazilian Rice3," Add the butter to a large skillet. Set it on the stove over medium heat and let the butter melt completely.


To minimize the number of dishes you need to dirty, use a large skillet with deep sides and a lid or a large, wide saucepan with a lid. If you start the process with this sort of pan, you should not need to switch to a different pan later on.
The butter should be allowed to melt but should not start to smoke or burn.

, Add the rice to the melted butter. Cook for 2 minutes, stirring frequently.


Frequent, nearly continuous stirring is the only way to prevent the uncooked grains of rice from sticking to the bottom of the pan during this step.
When finished, the grains should have spots that look lightly toasted. Do not allow the grains to burn or brown too deeply.
Any type of white rice should work for this recipe. Brown rice could also be used, but white rice is the most traditional.

, Pour the coconut milk, brown sugar, and salt into the pan. Stir well to combine.


Make sure that the rice is completely submerged beneath the coconut milk
Allow the liquid to reach a full boil inside the pan before continuing to the next step.
If your skillet is too shallow, transfer the toasted rice to a deep saucepan and add the other ingredients to that.

, Turn the heat down to low and place the lid on the pan. Allow the rice to simmer for 20 to 30 minutes, or until the liquid has been completely absorbed.


The rice should also be fairly tender when done. If it is not tender after the liquid has been absorbed, add another 1/4 cup (60 ml) of coconut milk or water to help the rice cook.
You may wish to stir the rice every few minutes during this process to prevent the grains from sticking to the bottom of the pan.

, At this point, the Brazilian coconut rice should be fully cooked and ready to enjoy.

Season with salt.,
Serve hot.",How to Cook Brazilian Rice4," Pour the oil into a large saucepan and heat it on the stove over a medium setting.


Wait 30 seconds, or until the oil becomes glossy and thin enough to coat the bottom of the pan.

, Add the onion and garlic to the hot oil. Cook the two ingredients for about 2 to 3 minutes, stirring frequently.


The garlic and onion should be fragrant and soft, but they should not begin to brown.
Keep a close eye on the two ingredients as you cook them. If they burn, the burnt flavor will likely get into the flavor of the rice and may ruin it.

, Place the chopped broccoli in the pan with the onion and garlic. Stir the ingredients together until evenly distributed.


Only use the crowns or heads of the broccoli. Do not use stems for this recipe.
For best results, make sure that the broccoli is chopped into very fine pieces. Doing so will help keep the final cook time lower.

, Cover the pan and let the vegetables ""sweat"" for about 3 minutes.


In essence, you are allowing the vegetables to steam cook in their own moisture during this step. This will only be effective if all of the vegetables have been previously chopped or minced into very fine pieces, though.
The broccoli must be tender when this step is finished. If the broccoli does not feel tender after 3 minutes, cover the pan again and let it cook longer.

, Pour the hot, cooked rice into the pan with the vegetables and stir well to combine. Cook the rice for a minute or two, allowing it to deepen in color.


Unlike other Brazilian rice recipes, note that the rice in this recipe must be previously cooked before you add it to the pan.
Any long grain white rice is suitable for this recipe.
For best results, use freshly cooked rice that is still fairly hot.

, Sprinkle the contents of the pan with salt. Mix the salt in, then let the contents of the pan warm thoroughly.

, Once everything is steaming hot, the rice should be ready to serve and should be enjoyed immediately for the best flavor.

, Once you've combined the first set of ingredients, you should stir the next set together until you've thoroughly combined everything again.

, You can use canned corn or corn fresh off a cooked cob. Now, use a mixing spoon to fold the ingredients into the batter until they're fully incorporated. They don't have to stick together completely; thanks to the milk, the mixture should be a little bit loose. If it's too chunky, add a bit more milk to loosen it up.

, Use a deep fry thermometer to make sure the oil doesn't get hotter than this; if it does, the fritters will burn right away. You can go ahead and start heating the oil while you make the batter to save time since it'll take a little while for it to heat up.

, You can use a cookie scooper or a regular spoon to scoop out each spoonful of dough. It will expand and should be no bigger than a ping-pong ball. Once you've scooped it out, drop it into the oil. You can throw in as many spoonfuls at a time as will comfortably fit into the pot.

, Give each spoonful about 2-3 minutes on each side before flipping it over, allowing it to brown evenly. You have to keep a close eye on them during this time to make sure they don't burn.

, Use a slotted spoon to remove the fritters from the oil, shaking off the excess oil, and place them on a paper towel over a plate.

, You can enjoy these tasty corn fritters on their own, or you can sprinkle them with a spoonful of powdered sugar or lightly drizzle them with maple syrup. Enjoy them for breakfast, as a snack, or during any time of day.

Get your starter.,
Prep the container.,
Pour in the alcoholic liquid.,
Cover the opening with cheesecloth.,
Wait.,
Bottle and store your delicious, homemade vinegar!",How to Make Your Own Vinegar," The starter's job is to provide acetic acid bacteria, which converts ethanol into acetic acid (the primary ingredient in vinegar).


Unpasteurized, unfiltered vinegar. It's important to use vinegar that hasn't been processed in a way that interferes with the acetic acid bacteria.
Mother of vinegar. This slimy looking thing consists of acetic acid bacteria and cellulose. It's a natural product of the vinegar-making process. If you have a friend who makes vinegar, you may be able to get a piece of theirs, or you can make your own. You can make your own by mixing unpasteurized and unfiltered vinegar with an alcoholic liquid and putting the mixture in a sunny spot for two weeks, but in that case, you might as well use the vinegar itself as a starter; a mother will form with your vinegar that you use next time.
Mycoderma aceti. You may be able to find it in a wine-making store. It's clear and comes in a jar.;
, Choose a container made from glass or enameled earthenware. You don't want the container material to react with the vinegar. Aluminum, iron and plastic will ruin the vinegar.Clean it thoroughly. Pour in the starter and swirl it to coat all the surfaces so that the vessel is inoculated with the acetic acid bacteria., Since oxygen is necessary for this process, try to ensure as much liquid surface area as possible. Fill the container up to its widest point.wine

cider (referred to as hard cider in the US and parts of Canada)
beer
fermented fruit juice

, Tighten the cheesecloth around the opening with a rubber band or string. This will allow oxygen in while keeping flies and other contaminants out.

, Put the container in a warm, dark place and let nature do its thing. Keep the mixture between 60 degrees and 80 degrees Fahrenheit (around 15 to 27 degrees Celsius).During the course of about 3-4 weeks, it should start forming a mother of vinegar; you can observe this if you used a glass container. The amount of time it takes for the vinegar making process, however, depends greatly on the type of alcoholic liquid you used, and how much of it you're converting. The range is anywhere between 3 weeks to 6 months.


Some sources suggest stirring the mixture daily in order to provide oxygen, and taste testing a little bit at a time towards the end of the 3-4 week period to see if the vinegar's ready.Other sources recommend leaving the mixture undisturbed, so that the mother doesn't sink.If you decide to leave the mixture undisturbed, it'll be a little trickier to see if it's ready. Smell it through the cheesecloth; it's done when there is an intense vinegary smell that almost burns in your nostrils. If, based on this, you taste it and it's not ready after all, let it ferment undisturbed for another period of time, depending on how close it is to your desired vinegar flavor.A container with a spout at the bottom would make this much easier, since you can taste the vinegar without disturbing the mother at the top.



, Strain out the vinegar through cheesecloth or a coffee filter, separating the mother, which can be kept for making more vinegar.


Unless you ferment the vinegar for a very long time, there is probably alcohol still left in it, which you can remove by boiling. While you're at it, you can pasteurize and reduce the vinegar, so that you can store it for longer and concentrate the flavours, respectively.To achieve pasteurization, heat the vinegar to 170 degrees Fahrenheit (77 degrees Celsius) and hold it there for 10 minutes.Crock Pots are perfect for holding food for a long time below the boiling point. Use a thermometer to check your crock pot's temperature at each setting to determine which setting is closest to 170 degrees.
Unpasteurized vinegar can be stored in sterilized, capped jars in the refrigerator for a few months. Pasteurized vinegar can be stored in sterilized containers with tight-fitting lids at room temperature for more than a few months, as long as they are kept out of direct sunlight."

Learn about the different kinds of olive oil.,
Be open to trying new products.,
Think about how you will use your olive oil.,
Decide how much you can spend.,
Read the labels.,
Sample your olive oil.,
Select dark-colored bottles or tins.,
Use your olive oil quickly and liberally.,
Store your olive oil in a dark container away from heat.,
Experiment with different dishes.",How to Buy Olive Oil," The olive is a stone fruit, and thus olive oil is actually the juice of the olive fruit.Trying to select a tasty, quality olive oil can be quite overwhelming.


There are over 700 different kinds of olives, grown in moderate climates throughout the world, with multiple factors such as growing conditions, soil type and quality, and seasonal weather patterns all affecting the taste and quality of the final product.There are many different types of olive oil. For example, you'll find products labeled “extra virgin,” “virgin,” “olive oil,” or “pure olive oil”.
If you're planning on using your olive oil for consumption, experts recommend selecting products labeled “extra virgin olive oil”. To merit this designation, the olives are either pressed—or more typically spun using a centrifuge—without the use of heat or other chemicals. This is the highest grade of olive oil.Products labeled “olive oil,” “pure olive oil,” or “light olive oil” are processed oils that are more similar to simple vegetable oil. They are not harmful to consume, but will lack the fruity, spicy complexity of a fine extra virgin olive. oil.;
, Particularly if you are searching for an extra fine (no pun intended!) extra virgin olive oil, you should not feel as though you must remain committed to one particular brand.


Just like wine, the product of a particular label can vary from year to year. Thus, even if you find a brand that you like this year, know that the taste of the product may differ next year. You should be open to frequently sampling and trying different varieties.
Be open to trying olive oils in different price ranges from different regions. Just as wines are sampled and rated by experts, so too are olive oils.You can stay on top of new trends and leaders in taste-tests by searching for excellent olive oils online.

, Different oils are better-suited for different purposes.


As noted above, extra virgin olive oil is the highest grade. If you are looking for an olive oil to use for salad dressings, finishing dishes, or perhaps to use with fresh-baked bread, you'll want to select this type.
If you are looking for a general cooking oil, you may be satisfied with a lower-grade olive oil (or even regular vegetable oil), particularly if the flavor of the oil will be lost under the other flavors of the dish.
There is conflicting advice about whether or not olive oil is well-suited for frying. You'll read many claims that olive oil has a low smoking point, but high quality extra virgin olive oil remains stable up to 365–400 °F (185–204 °C).Because the ideal frying temperature is usually cited as 356 °F (180 °C), there is thus no apparent risk to using olive oil for frying.However, because of its high cost, and because you need such a high volume of oil to fry, it tends not to be very cost effective to use olive oil for frying. Also, any subtlety in the olive oil's taste will be lost in the frying process. You'd most likely be better off with vegetable oil.

, Becoming a true olive oil connoisseur can quickly prove to be an expensive hobby. Once you've determined how you want to use your olive oil, your budget will point you towards the products that will best serve your cooking goals.


As a general rule of thumb, more expensive olive oils tend to rate higher among the experts. Producing high quality extra virgin olive oil is an expensive process, and the cost is passed on to consumers.Nonetheless, it's possible to find quality olive oils to fit any budget.
If you want to splurge, select an extra virgin olive oil and use it sparingly on dishes where it will shine as the star of the dish.
Be sure to comparison shop (both in different stores and from online merchants) to be able to snag the best deal for your final choice.

, While the International Olive Council (IOC) sets the standards for labeling olive oils as extra virgin, virgin, or ordinary virgin, it should be noted that the US has not adopted these standards.Nonetheless, spending some time reading the labels of your potential purchases will be time well-spent.


Again, look for a label that indicates the product is extra virgin. This will help ensure that you are not purchasing lower-quality olive oil.
Look as well for a harvest date on the label. Unlike wine, olive oil does not get better with age. It is a perishable product (a natural fruit juice), and will deteriorate within a few months of being harvested. Try to choose products with relatively recent harvest dates.
If a harvest date is not indicated, then look for a “best-buy” date. Avoid products which are quickly approaching this date.
Look for an estate name on the label. This is not a guarantee of a quality product, but is typically a good sign that the oil was grown and pressed by a small producer.If you don't see an estate name on the label, look for an olive oil with a PDO or DOP (Protected Designation of Origin). This status is granted by the European Union to designate agricultural products which are produced, processed, and prepared within a geographical area which specializes in that product and which have been handled according to specific industry standards.You may also find labels with PGI (Protected Geographical Indication), which is a similar, yet slightly less strict designation.You may also consider looking for a certified organic seal from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which guarantees that at least 95% of the product is made from olives grown without the use of pesticides or other synthetic fertilizers. Keep in mind, though, that many organically grown products will lack this label, as it is expensive for growers to pay for this certification., Because olive oils can vary so much in flavor even within the same brand from season to season, you'll be assured of choosing the best oil for your own palette if you can sample the product before buying.


You may need to go to a higher end supermarket or cooking store to be able to sample olive oils before purchasing. Farmers markets can also be a good place to sample selections.
Don't base your selection solely upon the color of the olive oil. You may think that a darker colored oil indicates that it is less pure, but the color of the oil is primarily a result of the particular olive variety and the point at which it was harvested during the growing season.
For example, if the olives were harvested earlier in the season, the final product will tend to be greener in color with a more peppery flavor; conversely, if the olives were picked and pressed later in the season, the oil tends to be more golden with a mild, even buttery flavor.Choose any olive oil that appeals to your tastebuds, but know that typically a light, fruity olive oil will pair well with lightly sauteed vegetables, while stronger, peppery, or even fruity olive oils complement meat dishes., Because olive oil degrades quickly, and because it will degrade even more quickly when exposed to light and heat, it is recommended that you select an olive oil that is packaged in a dark bottle or in a tin.


This is an especially important guideline to keep in mind if you haven't been able to sample the oil before purchasing it.

, Unlike many wines, olive oil does not get better with age. It is a perishable product (a natural fruit juice), and will deteriorate within a few months of being harvested. Thus, there's no good reason to hoard your olive oil for special occasions only.


This may mean that you will want to purchase your olive oil in small amounts, particularly if it is an expensive, high-end extra virgin olive oil.

, We've explained how you should ideally choose an olive oil that was packaged in a dark container (who knows how much heat and light the product was exposed to while it sat on the shelf awaiting your selection!); you should also be careful with how and where you store your olive oil at home.


If the bottle you purchased is not dark or opaque, consider transferring the contents into a darker container once home.
Even though it makes intuitive sense to store your olive oil right next to the stove-top for easy access, it's best to keep it in a cool, dark space in your kitchen. This will keep it fresher tasting for longer.

, Once you've selected an olive oil that appeals to you, don't be afraid to look for new ways to incorporate it into your meal planning. Olive oil is featured prominently in many Italian and Mediterranean style dishes, but it is a flexible and tasty oil for many other cuisines as well.


You'll be sure to find hundreds of recipes (if not more!) which feature olive oil online.
Be sure to scope out recipes which feature olive oil by browsing titles at bookstores and your local library (often a surprising source for excellent cookbooks).

,
Gather together the grated wasabi.,
Let the wasabi rest for about 10 minutes prior to serving it.",How to Make Wasabi1," Choose a firm, unwrinkled root with fresh, crisp looking leaves. These rhizomes may not be readily available since they are local only to Japan and are grown in limited areas of Canada and northwestern United States. However, check your local Asian grocery stores and you might be lucky.;
, The leaves do not necessarily need to be discarded – they can be eaten and make a flavorful addition to salads. (You can also dry them to use later.)

, Wash the outside of the rhizome. Trim off any odd bumps or marks. Let the wasabi root air dry.

Whisk together the hot sauce and mayo.,
Add lemon juice, if desired.,
Refrigerate until ready to serve.",How to Make Spicy Mayo1," Put the prepared mayonnaise and hot sauce in a glass bowl and whisk together, vigorously, until evenly combined.


One very popular spicy mayo is made with sriracha.Keep in mind, many people may find this chili sauce to be extremely spicy. Taste test after you mix your mayo up to determine if you should add more chili, or perhaps water it down by adding more mayo.
Keep whisking until the ingredients are completely combined. There should be no streaks of hot sauce running through the mayo. Instead, the color should be completely uniform.;
, Drizzle the lemon juice into the spicy mayo and whisk well to combine.


Lemon juice is not necessary, but if you sample the spicy mayo and decide that it is too hot for your preference, adding a little lemon juice can help cut down on some of the heat.
Since the lemon juice will be harder to see than the hot sauce, you will need to make a rough estimate about whether or not the juice has been completely mixed in. Do this by mixing it in for approximately as long as you mixed in the hot sauce.

, Cover your new condiment with plastic wrap or a lid and leave it in your refrigerators until you are ready to use it.


The finished mayo will be a little thinner than standard mayo.
If using the spicy mayo for sushi, you can pipe it through a pastry bag or a plastic bag with a small hole in the bottom. Squeeze a thin drizzle or trail of spicy mayo over the dish to spread the heat.

Purchase your specialty chilis in adobo sauce.,
Prepare your chiles.,
Whisk all three ingredients together and store.",How to Make Spicy Mayo2," Chilis in adobo sauce are an ingredient commonly used in Mexican and Asian cooking. To find them look in the Mexican aisle of your grocery store, near the canned jalapenos. The chipotle chilis are prepared by the drying and smoking of jalapenos., After opening your can of chipotle chiles, fish out two. Using a glass cutting board to prevent any absorption of heat, finely dice and chop your chiles.

If you’d prefer a very fine mix, grind your chiles with adobo sauce in a food processor. This will turn them into a paste.

, Mix your chiles, adobo sauce, and prepared mayo until an even, salmon-like color. Once completed, store in an airtight container.

To jazz up the look of your mayo, try garnishing it with a finely chopped chile, or a sprinkle of cayenne powder.

Separate the egg yolk.Crack the egg open over a small bowl.,
Combine the yolk, vinegar, and lemon juice.,
Add the seasonings.,
Gradually whisk in 1/3 of the oil.,
Add the remaining oil slowly.,
Chill until ready to serve.",How to Make Spicy Mayo3," Capture the egg yolk in the shell while letting the white drain into the bowl. Use the yolk for your spicy mayo and discard the egg white.


You may need to gently toss the egg yolk back and forth between the two eggshell halves in order to separate it completely from the white.
To make life easier, you could also use an egg separator. Crack the egg into the separator and let the utensil do the rest of the work.
If desired, the egg whites can be saved and used in another recipe.
Egg yolks contain lecithin, a natural emulsifier that binds the ingredients together and thickens the mayo.

, Transfer the three ingredients to a medium glass mixing bowl and whisk them together thoroughly until completely, evenly combined.


The mixture should be a vibrant yellow.
Lemon juice and vinegar add both acidity and flavor to the final product.
If desired, you can also mix the mayo in a food processor instead of whisking the ingredients together by hand. Using a food processor can make the process easier, but whisking it together by hand will work just as well.

, Add the Wasabi paste, minced garlic, Dijon mustard, Tabasco sauce, and salt to your mayo mixture and whisk well to incorporate.


If using peppers, you do not need to remove the seeds before adding them. The seeds contain a large portion of the pepper's heat, so removing them will cut down on the spiciness of the mayo.
When using a food processor, add these ingredients to the contents of the machine through the hole at the top of the glass. Pulse until the solid ingredients, like garlic or peppers, have been finely minced and incorporated into the mayo.

, Add 1/4 cup (60 ml) of olive oil to the mixture 1/4 tsp (1.25 ml) at a time, whisking continuously.


This should take about 4 minutes.
If the bowl begins to move around as you whisk, place a kitchen towel beneath it to hold it steady.
While whisking by hand will still work well, this is the point at which a food processor really comes in handy. If using a food processor or blender, add the oil through the hole at the top of the lid. Continue to hold the pulse button down to steadily and continuously blend in the oil.

, Add the remaining 1/2 cup (125 ml) of olive oil to the mayo mixture in a slow, thin stream. Continue whisking continually as you add the rest of the oil.


This step should take roughly 8 minutes.
The spicy mayonnaise should be fairly thick once you finish adding the oil.
If using a food processor, add the remaining oil in through the hole at the top of the lid. Continue to hold down the pulse button so that the contents are continuously mixed together.

, Cover the dish with a lid or plastic wrap and leave the condiment in the refrigerator until you are ready to use it.


You should use fresh mayonnaise within 5 days.
To beautify your efforts, cut up a thin, red, thai chili and distribute in the middle of your mayo. This adds a fun color contrast and gives your mayo a professional look."

Blend together the flax seeds and almond milk.,
Add the seasonings.,
Mix in the acidic ingredients.,
Slowly add the oil.,
Refrigerate for several hours.,
Finished.

",How to Make Spicy Mayo4," Combine the two ingredients in a blender at high speed until the flax seeds are almost impossible to distinguish.This should take roughly 1 minute or so.
The resulting mixture should be very frothy.
Choose a milk with the most neutral taste and smoothest texture possible. Unsweetened almond milk and unflavored soy milk are recommended. Avoid hemp or oat milk.
You could use a food processor instead of a blender for this recipe, if desired. Whisking the ingredients by hand could also work, but it will be much more difficult to fully incorporate the flax seeds into the almond milk if you mix it by hand.
The flax seeds replace the eggs in this recipe and are responsible for binding and thickening the spicy vegan mayo. They must be well blended before this thickening ability is activated, though.

, Transfer the sugar, dry mustard, onion powder, salt, paprika, and hot sauce to the contents of the blender and blend for another 30 seconds or so on high speed.


Make sure that the hot sauce you use is vegan-friendly. If desired, you could skip the hot sauce altogether and use 3 small chilli padi, chopped into fine pieces.

, Add the lemon juice and vinegar to the mayo mixture in the blender. Blend for another few seconds on high speed until combined.


As with traditional egg-based mayonnaise, the lemon juice and vinegar in this recipe add acidity and flavor to the mayo.

, Add the grapeseed oil in 1 Tbsp (15 ml) batches. Blend for a full 30 seconds after adding each batch of oil.


Alternatively, you can slowly add the oil to the mayo mixture through the hole in the top of the lid in a slow, steady, and continuous stream.
The essential thing is that the oil must be added slowly and evenly. Otherwise, the texture will not be consistent.
Pause the blender every now and then when it starts to get hot. Otherwise, it will cause the mayo to heat up along with it.
The mayo should begin to thicken after you have added half the oil. After you have added 3/4 of the oil, it should be spreadable. The final addition will create a thick consistency.

, Scoop the spicy vegan mayo into a glass container and cover with a tight lid or plastic wrap. Refrigerate it for a few hours to let it thicken and store in the refrigerator when not in use.


This mayo has a very strong, potent flavor initially. Chilling it in the refrigerator will help the taste mellow down and blend more evenly.
Use this version within a week.

Prepare your horseradish.,
Combine all your ingredients.,
Cover and refrigerate until you wish to devour your spicy horseradish mayo.",How to Make Spicy Mayo5," If using pre-made horseradish, simply measure out your called amount. Fresh horseradish will be significantly more potent than pre-made, so caution is needed when chopping it. To prepare it, simply chop up your horseradish root. Pour it into a food processor, add a few drops of water, and grind it up. Now you’ll have a paste similar to pre-made horseradish.When using fresh, you may wish to lower the amount called for in your recipe by half or more. Always remember it is easier to make something more spicy, than it is to make something less spicy.

, Using a whisk, mix your mayonnaise, horseradish, chives, lemon juice and pepper. Whisk until the color of the mayonnaise is solid, and even. There should be no streaks.Use a metal or glass bowl when making horseradish mayo. Horseradish is significantly more pungent than onions or chilis, and making your mayo in a plastic dish can leave a smell or flavour that is less-than-desireable after removing the mayo., Your mayonnaise will improve in flavour, but also spiciness, with age. If you can, make it the night before it is needed so the flavours have time to blend together and become more full."

Select the steaks.,
Prepare the rub.,
Rub the steaks.,
Rest the steaks.,
Grill the steaks.",How to Apply a Dry Rub to Steak,"


There are many cuts of steak available, but not all are suited to being rubbed with a dry rub. The flavor of very thin steaks can easily be overwhelmed by a dry rub, so choose steaks that are thicker, at least 3/4 of an inch (2 cm). Cuts of steak with a bone in them tend to be more flavorful but require more time to cook. Look for cuts of steak that are well marbled with little or no connective tissue. Great choices are ribeye steaks, t-bone steaks, New York strip steak and sirloin steaks.;
,


Either follow a recipe for a rub or make your own. Brown sugar, paprika, cumin, onion and garlic powder, mustard powder, chili flakes, cayenne, and thyme are just some of the herbs and spices used in a rub. If making your own, don't forget to add salt and pepper to the rub. You'll need approximately 1/4 cup (60 ml) of rub for each steak.

,


Working with 1 steak at a time, apply a generous amount of rub to 1 side and using your hand, rub the spices around the surface of the meat until it's totally covered. Turn the steak over and apply the rub to this side as well.

,


Rubs can be applied as soon as a few minutes prior to grilling, but the best flavor comes as a result of letting the steaks rest, covered, in the refrigerator overnight or for at least a few hours. Let the meat come to room temperature prior to grilling it.

,


Put the steaks on a preheated grill and cook them until they're cooked according to your taste. Rubs can burn so it is advised to cook the steaks over a lower temperature. Broil for 7 minutes a side at broil. Broil after leaving steak out for a few hours at room temperature. Broil on screen or grill sheet.

Use the same type of stock as the consommé you want to make (for example, use beef broth to make beef consommé). No matter what kind of stock you want to make, including chicken, vegetable, beef, or duck stock, the process involves similar steps:

Combining your ingredients, including meat, bones, vegetables, and seasonings in a large potCovering the ingredients with water
Boiling the ingredients and water together for several hours
Straining the ingredients and reserving the stock, which is now infused with all the flavors from the meat, veggies, and aromatics;
, Instead of making your own stock, you can also purchase premade stock from grocery stores and some farmers markets. Many people like premade stock because it’s faster and more convenient, but you can't control the flavors and ingredients as carefully. Premade stock comes in cans, tetra packs, and vacuum packs, and in a variety of types and flavors, including:

Beef
Chicken
Vegetable
Bone broth

, Another option is to purchase bouillon to make stock at home. Bouillon is a dehydrated and concentrated stock that comes in both cube and powder forms, and all you have to do is combine the bouillon with water.

To make stock, combine 1 teaspoon (5 g) of powder or one bouillon cube per 1 to 2 cups (235 to 470 ml) of boiling water, according to the directions.

, You can customize the flavor of your homemade, premade, or bouillon stock by adding herbs, spices, and aromatics. To infuse your stock with more flavor, place it into a large stock pot, add your desired aromatics, put on the lid, and simmer the pot low heat for about an hour. Strain the stock after to remove the aromatics. Aromatics you can add include:Fresh or dried parsley, sage, rosemary, oregano, marjoram, basil, and thyme
Peppercorns
Onions, garlic, shallots, and leaks
Peppers and carrots
Ginger
Mustard or coriander seeds
Nutmeg, cinnamon, or allspice
Horseradish

, Tap each egg gently against a corner to crack it. Break the egg in half and hold a shell half in each hand over a large mixing bowl. Gently transfer the yolk from one half to the other. As you transfer the yolk, the white will separate and drop into the bowl below. Continue transferring the yolk until all the white has been separated.Repeat with each egg.

Transfer the yolks to a separate airtight container and reserve them to make pudding, custard, cake, ice cream, or other treats.
You only use egg whites to clarify consommé, so you must separate the yolks from the whites first.

, In a meat grinder, blender, or food processor, combine the meat, celery, carrot, onion, and leek. Pulse the ingredients together on high for about a minute, until all the ingredients are minced and combined. You want a rough mash rather than a puree.You can substitute in any kind of vegetables you like, except for starchy vegetables (like potatoes) that will make the stock cloudy.
Blending the meat and vegetables together will make for a more flavorful stock, but it will also make the stock easier to clarify.
Use the same kind of meat and stock to make the consommé. For instance, if you mince up chicken meat with the vegetables, use chicken stock to make the consommé.

, Use a whisk or fork to rapidly beat the egg whites. Continue beating for about 30 seconds, or until the whites are frothy and thick. When you combine and heat all the ingredients, the protein in the egg whites will coagulate and glue together the chunks of meat and vegetables from the broth. This is known as the raft.

In place of the egg whites, you can use a cellulose gum such as methylcellulose F50 to create the raft., Transfer the minced meat and vegetables to the bowl with the whisked egg whites. Use a wooden spoon to combine the mixture. Transfer the mixture to a large stock pot and cover it with the cold stock. Add the cloves, peppercorns, and chopped fresh herbs as well, which can include any mixture of:Parsley
Tarragon
Thyme
Bay leaves

, Place the pot with all the ingredients on the stove and heat it over high heat. Stir the mixture constantly as it cooks, and heat it until it reaches 120 F (49 C). When the broth reaches this temperature, the raft will start to float to the top., When the raft floats to the top of the broth, use the cup of a ladle to break a hole in the center of the raft. This will allow you to access the stock below so that the raft doesn’t dry out as it cooks., Keep the heat high until the consommé comes to a simmer. At that point, turn the heat to low and continue cooking the consommé for about 60 minutes.It’s important that the consommé never come to a rolling boil, otherwise the raft will break and the soup won’t clarify.

, It’s important to baste the raft with the broth throughout the simmering process. This will keep the raft moist and prevent it from drying out. To baste the raft, dip your ladle into the hole you poked in the center of the raft. Fill the ladle with broth and drizzle it over the raft.Baste the raft every five minutes or so to keep it moist.

, When the liquid is clear and all the egg, meat, and vegetable particles have floated to the top and joined the raft, remove the pot from the heat.Use the ladle to press down on the raft gently so it sinks to the bottom of the pot., Line a fine-mesh strainer with cheesecloth, muslin, or a clean dish towel. Place the strainer over a large mixing bowl. Pour the broth through the cheesecloth and strainer to remove any particles and impurities from the stock.

Once the soup has been strained, you can discard the raft., Transfer the strained stock to the refrigerator and let it chill overnight. As the soup chills, extra fat will float to the surface, making the consommé as clear as possible., When you're ready to serve or reheat the consommé, remove it from the refrigerator. Use a ladle or spoon to skim off the fat that has risen to the surface of the stock., Consommé can be served chilled or hot.To serve it hot, simply ladle individual portions into soup bowls as soon as the consommé is ready. Otherwise, allow the consommé to cool to room temperature, and then chill it in the refrigerator for one to two hours before serving.

Chilled consommé is best served alone or simply garnished with fresh herbs.

, You can serve hot consommé with vegetables to make the soup into a more filling meal or starter. Traditionally, consommé is served with raw or ] that have been julienned, which means cut into small, thin sticks.Vegetables you can serve with consommé include:Carrots
Onions
Peppers
Broccoli
Mushrooms
Celery

, Hot consommé can also be served with meat slices, meat balls, sausage, or dumplings to make it a heartier dish.You can use fish, vegetable, pork, beef, or chicken dumplings, and any kind of sausage or meat you like. Place the meat or dumplings into the serving bowl and ladle hot consommé on top before serving.

Make sure meat and dumplings are cooked through before adding the soup, because they will not cook in the consommé.

, Right before serving the consommé, you can spruce it up by adding chopped fresh herbs as a garnish. Add your vegetables, meat, dumplings, and other additions first, then ladle the soup into the bowl, and then sprinkle the herbs on top. Popular herbs to pair with consommé include:

Parsley
Chives
Rosemary
Saffron

Obtain fresh green olives.,
Inspect the olives.,
Break the olives.,
Place the olives in a plastic bin and cover with cold water.,
Change out the water.,
Continue the process for about a week.,
Make a finish brine.,
Drain the olives and place them in a storage container.,
Cover the olives with the brine.",How to Cure Olives1," Water curing gently removes oleuropein, a component in olives that gives them a sharp, bitter taste. Green olives are actually just immature olives (just like green tomatoes are immature tomatoes) and they are naturally pretty mild, so using water alone is sufficient to cure them.


Green olives left on the vine to fully ripen will turn purple or black. Once they're fully ripe, water alone won't remove the bitter taste; you'll need to choose a different curing method.;
, Make sure that they are as unbruised as possible. Look for holes left by insects or birds. If the olives were treated with chemicals, rinse them off before you begin the brining process.

, In order for the water to be able to reach the insides of the olives, you'll need to break or slit the olives to let the moisture in. You can do this with a wooden mallet or, more commonly, a rolling pin. Give the olives a light smack, keeping them as intact as possible. You want the flesh to tear, but don't completely mash it or rip it into several different pieces. You should also take care not to damage the pit.


If you're concerned about the appearance of the olives, you can slit them with a knife instead. Take a sharp paring knife and make three slits in the olives to allow the water to penetrate.

, Use a food-grade plastic bin with a lid. Completely cover all of the olives with water, making sure none are poking out. You may need to weigh them down with something a plate to keep them from floating above the surface of the water. Place the bin's cover loosely over the olives and put the container in a cool, dark place.


Make sure you use a food-grade container that won't leach chemicals into the brine. A glass container also works well, but you'll need to make sure it isn't exposed to sunlight.

, At least once a day, change out the water with fresh, cold water. Make sure you don't forget, since otherwise bacteria could build up in the water and taint the olives. To change the water, just strain the olives through a colander, wash the pot, replace the olives and fill it back up with cold water.

, After one week of changing the water daily, taste an olive to see if the bitterness is at a level you like. If it is, the olives are ready; if you want the olives to be less bitter, wait a few more days (changing the water daily) before moving on., This is the solution that the olives will be stored in. It's a mixture of pickling salt, water and vinegar that will both preserve the olives and give them a delicious pickled taste. To make the brine, mix the following (makes enough for 10 pounds of olives):


1 gallon (3.8 L) cool water
1 1/2 cups pickling salt
2 cups white wine vinegar

, Use a large glass jar with a lid or another storage container of your choice. Wash and dry the storage container thoroughly before placing the olives inside. Leave one inch of space at the top of the container.

, Pour it into the container to completely cover the olives. Place the lid on the container and store the olives in the refrigerator.


You may add lemon peel, rosemary sprigs, roasted garlic, or black pepper to flavor the brine if you'd like.
The olives will keep in their brine for up to a year in the refrigerator."

If using a stand-alone mixer, pour the oil in drop by drop.
If using a hand-held or electric whisk, it might be helpful to have someone pour for you, or at least to have something holding your mixing bowl steady as you whisk.

, This may take up to a half a cup of oil per yolk. If the mayonnaise remains soupy, give it a chance to rest. If in resting the oil and yolk seem to separate, the mayonnaise has broken. See Tips.

Obtain fresh olives.,
Cut the olives.,
Place the olives into glass jars with lids.,
Cover the olives with a medium brine.,
Wait one week.,
Drain the olives.,
Cover the olives with a strong brine.,
Store the olives for two months.",How to Cure Olives2," Both green and black olives may be cured in brine, a mixture of salt and water that preserves the olives and gives them a salty taste. This method takes longer than water brining, but it's the best method to use for ripe olives. Manzanillo, mission, and kalamata olives are commonly cured in brine.


Inspect the olives to make sure that they are as unbruised as possible. Look for holes left by insects or birds. If the olives were treated with chemicals, rinse them off before you begin the brining process.
You may want to sort the olives by size. A batch of olives will cure more evenly if all the olives are a similar size.

, In order for the brine to be able to reach the insides of the olives, you'll need to slit the olives to let the moisture in. Make a vertical cut down the olive using a sharp knife; make sure not to cut the pit.

, They need to be stored in containers that can be sealed against the air, and glass is best for this purpose. Pack the olives into jars, leaving an inch of space at the top.

, Mix 3/4 cup of pickling salt with a gallon of cold water. Pour the brine into the jars so that it completely covers the olives. Seal the jars and store them in a cool, dark place, such as the pantry or cellar.

, During this time the olives will begin to brine. Leave the jars undisturbed to allow the salt and water to seep into the olives.

, After one week, drain the olives and discard the medium brine, which will be full of bitter flavor. Keep the olives in the same glass containers.

, Mix 1 1/2 cups of pickling salt with one gallon of water. Pour the strong brine over the olives to completely cover them. Seal the containers.

, Keep them in a cool place out of sunlight. At the end of two months, taste an olive to determine whether the bitterness level suits your taste. If not, change the brine again and store the olives for another month or two. This process can be repeated until you're happy with the way the olives taste.

Manzanillo, mission, and kalamata olives are commonly cured this way. Make sure the olives are completely ripe and dark in color. Inspect the olives to make sure that they are as unbruised as possible. Look for holes left by insects or birds., If the olives were treated with chemicals, rinse them off before you begin the brining process. Lay them out to dry completely.

, Use a kitchen scale to figure out exactly how much they weigh. You'll need a pound of pickling salt (1 1/2 cups) for every two pounds of olives.

, You may use a wooden fruit crate about six inches deep with two slats on each side. Line the entire crate with burlap, including the sides, and staple or nail it to the top. Prepare a second crate identical to this one.


Alternately, you can line the crate with cheesecloth, old sheets or cloth napkins as long as there is enough fabric to keep the salt contained and to absorb any liquids which may drip from the crate.

, Mix 1 1/2 cups of pickling or Kosher salt for every two pounds of olives in a large bowl. Make sure to mix thoroughly, so that every olive gets covered in salt.


Do not use iodized table salt; this will affect the flavor of the olives. You need pickling salt or Kosher salt.
Don't skimp on the salt, since it prevents mold from growing.

, Pour all of the olives and salt into one crate, then cover it with a layer of pickling salt. Cover the crate with cheesecloth to keep bugs out of the mixture.

, You may want to lay out a tarp, since the juices from the olives will seep out and stain the surface. Rather than setting the crate directly on the ground, raise it up on blocks to promote air circulation., Dump the contents of the crate into the second, clean crate. Shake the crate well to mix the olives, then carefully pour them back into the original box. This ensures every olive gets an even coating of salt and allows you to see any damaged or rotten olives. Remove these, they'll not be good to eat later.


Any olives with white circular patches (probably a fungus) should be removed. The fungus often starts at the stem end of the olive.
Check the olives to make sure that they are beginning to cure evenly. If an olive has shriveled areas and plump areas, you may want to dampen the olive prior to repacking in salt; this will encourage the plump area to start shriveling.

, After this time, taste an olive to determine if you like the flavor. If the olive is still quite bitter, continue the dry-curing process for another couple of weeks. The olives should take about a month to six weeks to become cured depending on the size of the olive. When cured, they will be shriveled and soft.

, Either sift out the salt by pouring the olives over a screen, or pick the olives out of the salt and shake them out one by one.

, Spread them out on paper towels or cloth napkins to thoroughly dry.

, Store them in the refrigerator for several months or more.


You can also mix the olives with extra-virgin olive oil and spice to taste.

Determine your university’s policies for hoods.,
Unfold your hood.,
Turn out the velvet lining.,
Turn out the satin trim.,
Place the hood over your head.,
Secure the hood using the cord and a button or pin.,
Ask a family member or friend to check the folding.",How to Wear an Academic Hood1," How you wear your hood will depend on your whether you put it on yourself, or a professor places the hood on you at your ceremony. If you’re participating in a hooding ceremony, you may need to drape your hood over your arm or shoulder while you wait for it to be placed over your neck. Ask your university about your specific hooding timeline and instructions., Your hood will likely come folded up in a plastic bag or on a hanger. Shake out the hood so it’s fully extended. Then place it on a flat surface so you can ensure that it’s properly prepared before you put it on or drape it over your arm or shoulder.

, Your hood will have a velvet lining that extends down from the top, or where you’ll be putting your head. This brightly colored velvet indicates your degree, so it should be facing out. You don’t want to hide the colors that show your accomplishments!, About halfway down the velvet lining, most hoods will have a satin trim that reflects the school colors. Fold this out so that the velvet remains visible on the top half of the hood, and the trim is showing on the bottom half. Hoods will also generally include a small button and cord that you can secure horizontally across this halfway-point to keep the satin trim visible.This fold should be right below your shoulder blades when the hood is placed over your head.

, An academic hood is meant to drape down your back. You should also make sure the small, pointed end of the hood, usually also lined in velvet, is laid flat at the base of your neck.Remove your graduation cap or tam when you put on your hood, as you don't want your hat to get tangled up in your hood.

, Most hoods include a small cord that hangs off the triangular end that goes around your neck. Loop this cord around a shirt button or a purposefully made button inside your graduation gown to keep the hood safely in place. Once the hood has been secured to your clothing or the inside of your academic gown, you may close your robe.If you are not wearing a shirt or dress with buttons and your gown does not come with a specially made button, you can use a safety pin instead.
If your hood doesn’t come with a cord, or the cord breaks, use a thick needle and sturdy yarn to create a homemade cord. Be sure to use a color that won’t clash with the hood, likely black.

, You may jostle the folding when you put the hood over your head. Because it will be out of easy reach once it’s down your back, you’ll want another person handy in case they need to fix it."

If there's a bad smell, slow your breathing so you don't have to inhale as much.,
Always wear your own shower-shoes, sandals, or flip-flops.,
Touch as little as possible.,
Be VERY careful when shaving.,
When all the disgusting people on your floor decide not to flush the toilet or to dirty up the seat, don't hesitate to leave a sign on the door.,
Make sure to clean the seat before sitting down.,
If possible, wait to go to the bathroom until you are in a nicer facility.,
Always wash your hands with soap after using the restrooms, and remind others to do the same.",How to Survive the Horrible Bathrooms in Your Dorm," You can also breathe through your shirt or use an odor-eliminating spray.;
, Never venture into the bathroom with bare feet. You never know what bacteria or viruses are living on the floor. Especially in the shower, wear flip-flops or some kind of sandals. Footwear will help keep you from developing meningitis, plantar warts (caused by HPV), athlete's foot, and staph and strep infections. Many types of bacteria, viruses, and fungi thrive in warm, moist environments like bathrooms and showering areas. To prevent warts on the feet, never wear another person's sandals or flip-flops, and don't lend out your own.

, Make sure not to touch the walls of the shower or the bathroom stalls. Wash your hands before leaving.

, Because of poor lighting, it may be difficult to shave without seriously injuring yourself. If you find shaving in the shower problematic, consider waxes, depilatory creams, or an electric razor.

, Signs will decrease the amount of gross things occurring in the bathroom. However, you may need to post different messages every so often if students stop being complaisant. The best place to put a sign is on the inside of every stall door: people will definitely see it, and they have a moment to read it while they're on the toilet. Attract attention to your sign with lots of color and some clip art. Short and sweet messages are best; longer ones tend to be ignored., For girls: hover over the seat whenever possible. Not touching the seat is always the most hygienic option. If you must sit down, wipe the seat off and line it with a few layers of toilet paper (this may be a waste of paper, but for the sake of your health and hygiene it's worth it).

, Find good bathrooms that you can resort to every once in a while in order to get away from the almost unbearable bathrooms in your dorm. Try to find a less popular or less messy restroom on another floor.

, If you do nothing else, at least perform this step! Also, if it doesn't create privacy issues, prop the door open when you enter the bathroom. Try to avoid touching door handles on your way out, or use a paper towel, a napkin, or even some toilet paper to open the door. Provided that you wash your hands, most restroom messes are more unpleasant than unhealthy. Washing your hands frequently will help stop the spread of illnesses as well.

Take precautions when working with lye.,
Clean the olives.,
Place the olives in a lye-resistant container.,
Make a lye solution.,
Pour the lye over the olives.,
Stir the mixture every two hours until the lye reaches the pits.,
Switch out the lye solution if necessary.,
Soak the olives in water for two days.,
Taste test an olive on the fourth day.,
Cure the olives in a light brine.",How to Cure Olives4," Lye can cause burns. Wear chemical-resistant gloves and safety glasses whenever you're working with lye, and don't use an olive vat made of plastic or anything made out of metal (even lids, since the lye dissolves metal).Do not use the lye curing method if children might come anywhere near the olives or the solution.
Complete the process in a well-ventilated room. Open the windows and turn on a fan to increase the airflow.

, This method works best for large olives, such as Seville olives. It may be used for either green or ripe olives. Pick out the damaged or bruised olives and sort the olives by size, if desired.

, Again, do not use a metal container; a large glass or ceramic. container is best.

, Pour one gallon of water into a lye-resistant container. To the water, add 2 ounces of lye. The solution will immediately heat up. Cool it to 65 to 70 °F (18 to 21 °C) before you add it to the olives.


Always add lye to water; never add water to lye. It will cause an explosive reaction.
Use exact measurements. Using too much lye will be detrimental to the olives; too little and they won't cure properly.

, Cover the olives completely with the lye solution. Use a plate to weigh the olives down so they don't get exposed to air, which would cause them to darken in color. Cover the container with cheesecloth.

, For the first eight hours, just stir the mixture and recover it when you're finished. After eight hours, start checking the olives to see whether the lye has penetrated to the pits. While wearing chemical-resistant gloves, pick a few of the largest olives. If they are easy to cut to the pit, with soft, yellowish green flesh all the way through, the olives are ready. If the flesh is still pale at the center, submerge them and try again in a few hours.


Make sure you never handle the olives with your bare hands. If you don't have chemical-resistant gloves, use a spoon to remove the olives and run them under cold water for several minutes before checking lye penetration.

, If the olives are very green, the lye may not penetrate to the pits after 12 hours. If this is the case, drain the olives and cover them with a fresh lye solution. After another 12 hours, do the same if the lye still hasn't penetrated to the pits.

, Change the water at least two times a day. This process washes the olives and gives the lye time to seep back out. Each time you change the water, it will look lighter color.

, If it's sweet and fatty, with no bitterness or soapy flavor, proceed to the next step. If it still tastes of lye, continue the soaking and rinsing process until the olives taste mild and the water rinses clear.

, Place the olives in a glass storage container. Mix 6 tablespoons pickling salt in a gallon of water and pour it over the olives to cover them. Let the olives cure for a week, at which point they're ready to eat. Store the olives in the refrigerator in their brine for up to a few weeks.

",How to Make Mustard from Scratch,", Whole seeds come in 'white' (yellow), brown, and black varieties. The darker the seed, the stronger the mustard.

, Do not try to hurry the process by boiling, as the heat will activate an enzyme that takes away the flavor of mustard., You can use a mortar and pestle if you have one, or a cleaned-out coffee grinder, or even a blender. The sound of the grinding will change when the mustard reaches an evenly ground consistency.

, For a quick, hot mustard that you will use right away, use water; otherwise use wine/beer/mead, vinegar, or grape juice. Feel free to combine liquids.

,, To make it sweeter, try anise or cinnamon; to make it hotter, try ginger, cloves, horseradish (as is the norm in Europe), or one of the black peppers. Taste and adjust seasoning.

, Heat and bitterness will reach a peak in 5-15 minutes; water-based mustard should be served then. For other kinds of mustard, wait between 2 hours and a day for flavors to blend.


Aging for a day is typically needed for the flavors to mellow, however some find that the best flavor arises after aging for several weeks.
Aging mustard in the refrigerator will cause it to stay hotter longer.
Aging mustard in a closed container in a cupboard or on the counter is generally considered safe, as mustard has anti-bacterial properties.

,, Grind in a spice grinder until relatively fine. This way you won't have to do any soaking.;
,,,,, It will thicken as it cools.

Grab a small bowl.,
Remove the plastic wrap.,
Transfer the mustard to a small container with a tight-fitting lid.",How to Make Dijon Mustard2," Place all the ingredients into it and stir well to combine. Cover it tightly with plastic wrap (or a well-fitting lid) and let it sit at room temperature for 2 days. Think of it as a weekend project.

This is a mandatory step before you can blend and serve the mustard. The ingredients must interact to draw out all the quintessential ""dijon"" flavors.

, Transfer the mustard mixture from the bowl to the blender. Blend until the desired consistency is reached -- this should take about 30 seconds for a coarse texture.

Keep in mind that it’s not possible for this mustard to reach a smooth consistency. Don't spend your afternoon blending.

, Cover and refrigerate it for up to 3 months. A little time (but not a lot) aids in aging the flavor as well.

Allyl isothiocyanate, the oil in mustard seeds that gives pungency and heat, tends to dissipate over time. So know the longer it sits in the refrigerator uneaten, the milder it will become.

Bring your academic hood to the graduation ceremony.,
Drape the folded hood over your arm or shoulder.,
Carry your draped hood to the stage.,
Face away from your adorner and remove your cap.,
Allow your adorner to hood you.",How to Wear an Academic Hood2," Your superiors, professors, and school heads will award you with your achievement by placing your earned academic hood on you during the ceremony.


At some universities, you will not need to carry your hood with you. Instead, you will be expected to drop off your hood ahead of time. Follow your university's commencement instructions closely., You’ll want your hood folded in half with the turned-out velvet lining fully visible. The velvet strip should be at the front of your arm, facing outward. The narrow, or neck, end should be facing out from your body.If the hood includes a button and cord, such as for the satin lining, be sure these are unfastened. Your professor will secure them for you during the ceremony.

, You’ll need to check on your program’s policies to be sure you use the correct arm. Most will require you to use to the arm closest to the adorner and furthest from the audience, usually the left. Some university ceremonies, however, may want you to drape your hood over the right arm., Your hat can get in the way of the hooding ceremony. Remove it and then turn your back to the adorner. This will allow your adorner to smoothly affix the hood to your robes.

, Your adorner will lift the hood over your head and place it on your shoulders. They will then align the cord with your neck. Your adorner will place the velvet lining along your shoulders so the hood flows smoothly down your back and turn the bottom half of the hood out so the satin lining shows. Finally, the adorner will fasten the cord across the middle of the hood to secure the fold.

Purchase or rent academic regalia.,
Consult your university policies about regalia.,
Tell your regalia provider which degree you’re earning.,
Provide your seller with the name of your institution.,
Inform your provider of your field.",How to Wear an Academic Hood3," Most universities will give you the option of either purchasing or renting academic regalia. For most people, renting academic regalia is more cost effective. However, if you are planning on becoming a professor, you might be expected to wear regalia as a faculty member at future events. In that case, purchasing your own regalia might be more efficient., Many universities have a specific provider of academic regalia and will not permit you to purchase regalia elsewhere. Other universities will allow you to buy or rent regalia from any provider you choose, or perhaps borrow regalia from an alumna. Always adhere to your specific school's regalia requirements so that you are allowed to participate fully in commencement exercises.

, Different types of degrees require varying academic hoods. To make sure that you acquire the correct kind of hood, inform your provider whether you are earning an Associate's degree, Bachelor's degree, Master's degree, or Doctoral degree.


An Associate's degree hood is usually worn flat against the back like a cape or cowl. Note that Associate's hoods are not as commonly worn as graduate degree hoods--you might not need a hood to be a part of your regalia.A Bachelor's degree hood is 3 feet long and does not end in a sharp point. Note that Bachelor's hoods are not as commonly worn as graduate degree hoods--you might not need a hood to be a part of your regalia.A Master's degree hood is 3.5 feet long and comes to a point at the bottom.A Doctoral hood is the longest hood at 4 feet long. It has the sharpest point and also the largest trim of all hoods., If you’re not using the university provider, it’s important to double check that your regalia adheres to school standards. Make sure that your regalia provider has all the relevant institutional information so that you match your fellow graduates., American universities have a standard set of colors that indicate your field of study, rather than just your degree. These fields determine the color of the velvet trim that lines your hood. European universities are not standardized in the same way as American universities. Check with your institution to make sure you are purchasing the correct academic hood.Law students, for example, wear hoods trimmed in purple, while all Ph.D. students wear hoods trimmed in royal blue.

If you bring back a boyfriend to your place, refer back to the household rules on what everyone has agreed upon about having others back to stay.",How to Survive Living With Male Roommates As a Female," Schedule a decent-length interview and ask that every person in the household be present so that you can get to know one another before you move in. It's an effort but given that you intend on living with these guys, you must feel happy from the outset. The interview process isn't just about them assessing whether you're the right fit, it's also about whether they're the right fit from your perspective too. So, use the opportunity to size up their personalities and decide whether they're the right group of roommates for you.


Ask what household management rules and expectations are already in the household. Then, ask politely whether they're open to having a discussion about renewing those arrangements once you join the household. This will give you an indicator of how receptive they are to listening, learning and being open to change. If they're okay about changing a few things to accommodate you too, that can be a good sign. If there are no household management rules in place, be sure they're willing to change this, as these are the best way for ensuring equal pitching in to run the household smoothly.
Ask questions about their interests and hobbies. This will give you a good indicator of what they get up to in their spare time and whether their activities are likely to impinge on the household arrangements and amenity.
Ask about the household rules related to parties and bringing home friends. This will give you a good feel for whether you are about to join a household keen on wild partying (great if you like that, not so great if you don't), dinner parties or occasional events, and if fair warning is the norm. It will also give you some ideas about who might be coming over to stay without actually being an ongoing part of the household. You might also ask something like: ""If I wanted my mom and dad to stay for a few days when they visit the city, would that be okay?"" Gauge their reaction to see if it matches with your preferences.;
, Couple this with your feelings about how they gel as a group, whether or not you've warmed to each of them, and what potential issues you can see arising given what you've already sensed about them. This is the time to trust your instincts as well as your analysis.

, Explain that you've never lived with an all-male household before and while you're stoked to give it a try, you would like to be sure that this is going to work, not just for you, but for them too.


You could even offer to pay an extra month's (or so) rent if you decide to leave earlier than you expected. This may be better than staying stuck in a rooming situation that just isn't working out for you.

, Cleaning is nobody's business until it's made everybody's business. Gender does not determine responsibility for keeping the house clean; it's up to making clear decisions about who does what and when. Once this has been worked out, failure to carry through is a failure in responsibility toward the household as a whole, so it's also important to decide together on what penalties apply in such cases.


It is not your problem whether people you live with are not used to picking up after themselves. To ""accept"" that they don't is to perpetuate the myth that some people are entitled to be lazy while other people have a duty to do the picking up. It doesn't matter how your roommates were raised, they're in the big world now, and the big world expects them to be responsible.
If things are getting messy, assume leadership (not ownership), at least temporarily, with respect to getting things in order. When disorder descends, point to the agreed roster and rules on household management responsibilities. Avoid making inflammatory or demeaning statements; keep your observations factual, such as ""The sink is being used for food prep. Kindly put those dirty dishes straight into the dishwasher."" Don't explain, don't complain; there is no need to justify wanting cleanliness.
Consider having differentiated approaches to certain areas of the house. For example, messy bedrooms are fine provided the doors are kept shut (after all, you might prove to be the messiest member of the household if you never hang your clothes up, but that's your space), while the living area must, without fail, always be acceptable enough to bring friends home without embarrassment.

, This is a great way to provide momentum and ensure that everyone is responsible for encouraging the group as a whole to get things done. Even if it's the only day when everything is in order, at least you can rely on this weekly event to deal with the worst of mess and missing things.


Weekly clean-up can also be a good time to do forward planning, such as making grocery lists, writing requests to the landlord about repairs needing to be done, discussing any household issues that any person has, etc.

, If you avoid doing your share of the cleaning, you'll upset the household balance as much as anyone else slacking off. Schedule it in your diary and do what needs doing in the spirit of being a good team member.

, You don't have to love it but you do need to manage around it, so that you get the space and freedom you are paying for too. Maybe you want to join in sometimes, all the time, or never at all––that's your call, but you do deserve to have the amenity you're paying for.


Have clear household rules in place about hosting events using the property you all live in. As with cleaning, there must be clarity on what's acceptable, what's okay by way of spontaneous visits from groups of friends, and what is not appropriate. Together, set up house rules with boundaries on noise levels, quantity/type of party events, times visitors can call, whether or not people can stay over, and so forth.
If there is a party and such events bother you, consider whether you'd prefer to schedule a night out or do something else for a few hours. Unless the party-throwing is constant, it's important to find ways to ensure that everyone in the household has their chance to use the premises in ways they enjoy too.

, It is important to have a discussion about grocery distribution and payment. Unless one householder adores shopping for groceries and truly doesn't mind doing it, it's everyone's responsibility. How this is divided up is entirely up to your household but it should be done fairly and every person must pay their fare share.


Be sure to include snacks in the household rules. Snacks tend to disappear for party events, and it is the responsibility of the person throwing the party to pay for these, not to use other householder's supplies.
Mundane-yet-essential things such as cleaning gear, first aid supplies and household safety (batteries for those smoke alarms) should also be incorporated into the shared household spending budget.

, This is extremely personal to your household, as sometimes there are one or two persons who love to cook and who genuinely don't mind cooking for others a few nights a week. In other households, nobody likes to cook and take-out and noodles are the staples. However, whatever the cooking arrangements, nobody should feel obliged to cook for others and if someone does cook, nobody else is entitled to steal that person's food.


If there are different dietary needs or mealtime preferences, include these in your discussions about when the kitchen gets used by whom, and how to keep food preparation areas and utensils clean/separate to meet everyone's dietary preferences. It is a lot better to talk about these things than to feel upset all the time or that your preferences are being compromised.
If food goes walking, try putting sticky notes on food you have put away, making it obvious that is off limits to anyone else in the household. Have a house rule that it's okay to ask for food but not okay to assume that food is for the taking.
Hide snacks if they disappear a lot. Whether you're living with all-males, all-females, your family, or any other arrangement, sometimes the temptation is simply too much. Maybe even for yourself...

, Moreover, it pays to be wise about such generosity, and keep it to a minimum, in case you build up expectations of being Saturday's baker. On the other hand, if you really do enjoy baking and everyone's loving the baked goods, ask them to pay for the ingredients. It's the least they can do.

, It can complicate things not just for the two of you but for the whole household. When people pair up within a group, it can be awkward for the others, as suddenly the pair turns into a team and other members of the group can feel that they are being left out or even overwhelmed. An article can't tell you whether or not it's appropriate to turn platonic household friendships into romance; that's something you need to tackle if it ever comes up. However, do think long and hard about the consequences and whether it might not just be better for the two of you to find your own digs should the relationship become long-term. It will all depend on the context of everyone you're living with and... it might just never happen anyway.

, Most importantly, don't let anyone over-stay their welcome; if your boyfriend becomes a fixture in the house, it's probable that the other guys will also want him to pay rent and pitch in, or that you two find your own accommodations together. Treat it the same way as everyone in the household is treated, by being respectful of everyone's comfort.

Make friends.,
Don't share your personal life with everyone.,
Avoid unprotected sex.,
Eat well.,
Bring your own appliances and electronics.,
Don’t share everything.,
Don’t go looking for trouble.,
Figure out if you can trust your roommate(s).,
Think carefully about sharing food.,
Learn to live with noise.,
Work out a ""privacy signal"" with your roommate.,
Realize that the only cleaner will be you.",How to Survive Living in a College Dorm," It seems to be an easy and fun thing to do, but remember that most of the people won’t really, truly care about you, and they only want to know your life so they can gossip about you. So choose your friends carefully, but be sure to get out and find good, trustworthy people you'd enjoy spending your time with.;
, Everyone in dorms converses with everyone else, especially if they’ve formed little cliques/groups/squads. If you go telling everyone your business, don’t be surprised when your life turns into the focal point of everyone’s entertainment.


Keep in mind that social media plays a huge part in this. If you follow/friend request everyone you meet on Instagram, Snapchat, Tumblr, Twitter, Facebook, etc., you’re setting yourself up for a hard time. Unless you want to feel like you have to monitor everything you post, use caution when following/friend requesting people.

, Unprotected sex can result in contracting an STI or pregnancy. Even if you know and trust the person you're sleeping with, it's always safer to use protection.


If you do choose to have unprotected sex, make sure both of you are tested for STIs first. Still be wary of this, as pregnancy is still a risk.

, Continuing to eat nutritious food is important for your health and well-being, as well as helping you sustain the energy needed to keep concentrating in classes.


When you buy groceries, do not forget to buy healthy food. Don’t just buy snacks and junk food because too much junk food will cause you to be a very unhappy and unhealthy person.  
Buy food that you can eat for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Keep a stock of items for those times when you don’t feel like going to the dining hall.  
Ramen noodles/instant noodles and canned soups are always good go-to foods that are easy to store in a dorm. Be sure to get fresh vegetables to add with them, especially if you're eating them a lot.
Keeping a supply of cereal and milk is a good idea, since cereal can be eaten at any time of day.
Try to eat five portions of fresh fruit or vegetables every day.
Make sure you eat enough fiber to keep your bowels healthy.

, This can include a refrigerator, a television, cooking supplies/silverware, movies, DVD/Blu-ray player, video game system, etc. You do not want to get too comfortable using other people’s stuff, even if they’re your roommate, because if things turn sour between you, you’re out of luck.

, Avoid sharing all with your roommate/friends because they may start using you just for your things, they may break something, they may misplace or steal your things, and your roommate or friends may villainize you once you try to take your things back. Don’t put yourself in that position.

, When you see drama poking its ugly little head around the corner, go the other way. Don’t approach it, don’t converse with it, don’t play with it, just ignore it and go in the opposite direction. If someone seems to be in trouble, call for help immediately.

, Trusting your roomies is fine, and it’s great to be able to leave your room and not have to worry about anything being out-of-place when you get back; however, your judgment of who you can and cannot trust must be spot on before you even think about leaving your valuables out in the open.

, Sharing food can become problematic, because some people may take advantage of you and end up eating too much of your limited food supply. Only share food with people you trust not to behave this way.

, Realize now that your neighbors are probably not going to be as quiet as you’d like them to be 90 percent of the time. Also realize that there isn’t always a lot you can personally do about that. It’s just something you’re going to have to learn how to deal with and ignore. Try turning music up decently loud and sitting with your phone or speaker as close to you as possible. This will help you tune out any loud sounds next door.

, College is often a time for sexual exploration. As such, you or your roommate may from time to time need some privacy in your room so they can bring their sexual partner there. A good way to make sure neither of you walks in on the other mid-act is to set up an indicator that the room is occupied and in need of privacy. Common solutions are to hang a tie, sock, or bandana from the doorknob.

, You are no longer in the luxury of your home, which means that the bathrooms are often going to be disgusting, and there’s not much you can do about it.


Get some shower shoes. Flip flops or sandals work, too. As mentioned, dorm bathrooms aren't the cleanest places. Avoid getting any of that shared filth on your feet by wearing shower shoes.

Buy healthy food only.,
Start your day with an apple.,
Stay away from fast food.,
Avoid soda or alcoholic drinks.,
Allow yourself one day of rebellion.,
Go the long way.,
Work out.,
Get a gym membership.,
Participate in any social activities you can manage.",How to Stay in Shape During College," So it's hard not to constantly eat fast food, but it's not hard if you add up how much money you'll save. For example, if you go to Chipotle once a day and you spend around $10, that's $300 per month! Imagine if you did that for lunch, Starbucks for breakfast, and another fast food for dinner? That's a lot of money! A cheap, healthy, and filling option for breakfast is oatmeal. A variety pack of 24 Quaker Oatmeal is around $7.50 from Smart & Final. Eat one every morning. For lunch, pack a peanut butter and jelly. Super cheap, delicious, high in fats, and protein. For dinner, make chicken and rice. Chicken isn't too expensive, and rice is cheap and lasts a long time too. For in between snacks, eat a banana, apple, or some nuts.


Eat real food. Whether you're at college dining hall or out and about off campus, you must choose carefully what you eat. Stay away from greasy food, no matter how hungry you are. If you are visiting a restaurant and you don't know what to order, think of the stuff you usually eat at home. In other words: do not order some ridiculously expensive or greasy meal that is enough for three people.;
, It might not seem much, but it's easy and healthy. One apple is the best food you can have for breakfast, according to some. Try to have at least 6 apples somewhere in your room. Keep them at a low temperature level, and make them a mixture of red, green, and yellow; After all, eating only one type each day will make you hate it later.

, Fast food is the easiest and fastest way to have lunch. However, you must avoid it completely! The first time, it will be a onetime thing in your head... but low and behold, it becomes the thing. You will be stuck in the greasy fat life of fast food forever. So you might want to avoid that from the beginning.

, You are young, but in college you are in a very sensitive place in which any mistake will help in shaping the body you will have later in your life. So if you want to stay fit, try to replace soda with juice, water or diet drinks. If you are afraid to be embarrassed in front of your friends, say that it’s hurting your stomach these days. And if you must drink with them, make sure you have a lot of water and exercise later that day.

, Depriving your body from all the tempting food you see, especially if you are eating in a restaurant, all day will make you rebellious at a certain point. So you might as well want to put that rebellion under control. Pick the day that you usually hit the gym. Allow yourself a delicious certain food that you’ve been craving all week. As long as your exercise enough, you will burn those calories, there’s no need to worry.

, If your class is next to where you are staying, try to take the longest and hardest route to get there. Take the biggest number of stairs at morning. This will become your daily morning workout!

, College does not give you much free time, so try to steal a couple of minutes daily to do about fifty ab workouts. It should not be hard if you haven’t gained weight yet. If you have, start with ten; on condition that you make it fifty in less than 15 days. Also make at least 2 hours of serious workout each week. That should burn whatever you had piled up in your body during the week.

, Aim for one of those $10 per month ones. The gym can be helpful in many ways.


You're working out, and burning calories
You're releasing hormones that make you feel better and happier
You're around more people and can make friends. After all, you have something in common with everyone in the gym: you work out.
You're keeping yourself busy so you don't spend money shopping or eating.

, Being in college means there is a lot of work. However, it also means that there is a lot of fun. If you choose to stay in bed and play video games while eating during your free time, your body will adjust to the idea of being asleep the whole time... and therefore, burning calories will stop. Try to make the best of those times by having fun and also staying in shape during the best years of your life.


Keep yourself busy. Sitting in your house or dorm all day is boring, so you eat, burns no calories because you're just sitting there, and is lonely. Consider joining a group or club. Maybe even get a job. It doesn't have to be anything fancy. In fact, a simple, mindless job is probably better. A stressful job is the last thing you want when you're already stressed about school. Remember your main focus is school, not your job. Consider a coffee shop, waitress, or clothing store job.

Feeling home sick?",How to Survive Your Freshman Year in College3," Be courteous and considerate, but don't be a doormat. If you have a problem, don't be afraid to bring it up, but think carefully about how you address them. It is more productive to use ""I"" statements, like ""I can't sleep well when there is loud music. Could you wear headphones after midnight?""

, If you decide early on what is okay and what isn't, it will help avoid resolve conflicts later. Some important talking points:


Music and noise. If you have really different taste in music, you may have to alternate music playing or resort to headphones. Set some ""quiet hours"" and some ""loud hours"" if you need too. An example: roommate A loves to sing along loudly to Disney songs. Roommate B can't stand it. Set an hour aside where roommate A can blast the songs and sing along to get it out of their system. If you or your roommate is uber-sensitive, try earplugs. The other person shouldn't have to walk on eggshells all the time.
Visitors. Do you mind platonic sleepovers? How about non-platonic? Set up rules about overnight visitors before you think you'll need it to avoid awkwardness. Agree on a door signal or a message system ahead of time.
Partying. Talk about what is and is not okay. Maybe you are okay with a few friends over for beer, or maybe you want full party every weekend, or maybe you are not okay with any substances. Be willing to compromise both ways. It's not fair to forbid your roommate from being social in their own space, but it's also not fair to be constantly inundated with drunk people if it makes you uncomfortable.

, Personal preferences vary, but be considerate of your roommate, and don't let it get smelly in order to guarantee survival.

, Laundry rooms and shared fridges can result in lost belongings. Depending on your school and where it's located, you may need to lock your bike and keep a close eye on your laptop too. Find out from older students how careful you need to be.

, Typically, dorms have a residential director and residential assistants that can help make you feel at home while you're living in a dorm. If you’re having big issues with your rooming situation, contact resident life.

, Some dorms are dry dorms, some are single-sex, some have very strict fire policies. Be careful.

, Make sure you wear shower shoes! Some disease can be transmitted through the feet. Besides, you don't know what's gone on in there.

, It's recommended that everyone gets at least 8 hours of sleep nightly, though it varies by person. It can be hard, whether you are socializing or studying, but it makes a big difference in your classes and in your health.

, Some campuses discard items left outside your room, or have theft problems.

, Call your family: you're never too old to call home.

Or celebrate a friend’s 21st birthday? Think about the occasion for your party and use this to help you decide what you want to do at the party, who to invite, and what to serve.


For example, if you want to have a birthday party for a close friend, you will need to decide if it should be a surprise or not, what kind of cake to buy, what your friend likes to drink, what kind of music your friend would like to hear, and who to invite.;
, You can also use the season to help you plan your party. You could throw a winter, summer, spring, or fall themed party.


The season can also help you to pick a dress code for your party if you want. For example, if it is winter, then you could throw a winter themed party and require all of your guests to wear white. If it is spring, then you could throw a spring themed party and ask your guests to wear pastels.

, If you have something that you are passionate about, then you may also consider turning that into the theme for your party. Whether you are a fan of cooking, football, movies, or politics, there is probably a way to work it into a party theme.



Super Bowl or Game-Watching Party. If there is a big game happening over the weekend, invite some of your friends over for a game-watching party. Tell everyone to wear team colors and bring something to drink and snack on.

Recipe Swap Party. If you are a fan of cooking, then you can throw a recipe swap party. Have all of your friends make something and bring copies of the recipe along. Pair the food with some wine or craft beer and have a classy evening.

Movie Marathon Party. Choose a few of your favorite movies (or a few you have never seen before) and invite some friends over to watch them with you. Make some popcorn and cocktails and enjoy watching the movies and talking about them with your friends.

Debate-Watching Party. Invite some friends over to watch a big political debate. Order a couple of pizzas and buy a case of beer. Some people even play drinking games while watching political debates.

, There are lots of different dress code themes that you can use to create an awesome college party. Some popular dress code themes include:Decade Themed Party. Have all of your guests show up dressed in 80s or 90s era clothes or dressed as a well-known figure from one of these decades. Another option is to do an 80s versus 90s party and allow your guests to choose the decade they like best. You can do other decades as well, but 80s and 90s parties are popular right now.

Toga Party. Tell all of your guests to wear nothing but a bed sheet and some underwear. You can give other aspects of the party a Greek vibe as well, such as by serving Sambuca shots, hummus, and pita chips.

Angels and Devils Party. Everyone chooses to wear red or white and may also go all the way with it and put on an angel or devil costume.Black Light Party. Replace all of your regular light bulbs with black lights and tell all of your guests to wear lots of white and neon clothes.

Ugly Sweater Party. This works well for a party in December. Tell all of your guests to buy or make the ugliest Christmas sweaters they can and wear them to the party.

, Since you will be inviting your friends to this party, you may want to get their input t see what they might enjoy. If you are stumped about what kind of party to throw, then just talk it out with a few of your close friends. They might have some great ideas.


Throwing a big party can be hard work, so you might also benefit from enlisting your friends as co-planners., Whether you are planning a small party or a large one, you will need to decide who you want to invite. Jot down a list of all of the people you would like to come and then use Facebook, Twitter, or word of mouth to let everyone know.If you are planning to serve food to your guests and you want to keep it kind of small, try to get a head count at least one week before.
If you are hoping to have lots of people at your party, then you might consider telling all of your friends to bring someone along.
You may also want to invite your neighbors to reduce the chances of noise complaints., Creating a playlist for your party is an essential part of the planning process. It is important to make sure that you have plenty of good music to last through the entire evening, so stock your playlist with at least five hours of music.


Try to keep your guests music interests in mind as you complete the playlist. Don’t just stock the playlist with music that you like.
Keep your theme in mind as you create your playlist for the party. For example, if you are having an 80s party, then your playlist should include lots of music from the 80s.

, Drinking games can help to keep your party interesting and they are popular among college students. Decide what drinking games you want to play so that you can suggest a game later in the evening. Some drinking games to consider include:Beer Pong
Flip Cup
“Never Have I Ever”
Quarters

, You may need to make some adjustments to your apartment to prepare it for your guests. Try to get everything set up at least an hour before people are supposed to arrive.


Clear a large area of your living room or kitchen to use as a dance floor.
Set up extra chairs and tables for your guests.
Lock or block off rooms that are off limits.Make sure that you have essential items like toilet paper, plastic cups, and paper towels.

, If you have a back or front yard that you plan to use during your party, then take some time to prep this area as well.


Set up some lawn chairs and tables.
Use lanterns, string lights, or solar lights to provide some ambiance.
Try setting up a slip and slide or sprinklers.
Put out lawn games like KanJam, Frisbees, or cornhole.

, As the host, you should probably provide something for your guests to eat. However, you don’t need to prepare a gourmet meal. Ordering a sheet pizza or putting out chips and pretzels is fine too. Your guests will probably be more interested in socializing than doing anything else.


Make sure that you have something for everyone. For example, if you have a friend who is a vegan or vegetarian, then try to avoid having nothing but all meat and cheese snacks., You might have some friends who love to cook and others who don’t know how to boil water. Ask friends to bring something, but let them choose. You might just say what you think you might need to give them some guidelines.


For example, you could ask someone to bring something salty and crunchy or ask another friend to bring some cocktail mixers.

, Providing alcohol for your guests can be expensive and your guests will not expect you to foot the bill for their drinks, so it is usually best to tell everyone to bring their own drinks.


If you are just having a small get-together, then you might decide to treat your friends to a case of beer or a large bottle of vodka with mixers.
If you are having lots of people over, then you should either require everyone to chip in for a keg or make it a BYOB event.

, There’s always the chance that more people will show up than you had expected and you may have to replenish your food and drink halfway through the party. Make sure that you have a plan in case this happens.


For example, you might put the number of a local pizza place on speed dial, enlist a sober friend to make a beer run, or just stash extra supplies in your bedroom in case the food and drinks go faster than you expected."

The workload in college is going to be a lot more than it was in high school. Planning out your due dates, class times, and breaks will help you tailor your time management to your personal learning needs. It will also help you get a feel for how much time you will need to dedicate to studying and homework outside of class, so you have a better view of your available social and free time.;
, On the first day of classes, teachers will want to go over the class outline with you. The main points that will be covered include things like what tests are mandatory, what projects will be like, what grading scale will be used, how to contact the professor, if attendance is mandatory, and other important details to know about the class. Having a hard copy in front of you will allow you to star important items, make notes, and better prepare you for the overview of the course that the professor gives.

, If possible, try to reach out to them before school starts (provided you receive their information ahead of time) so that you can get to know each other as soon as possible. It is crucial to try to talk to your roommate and discuss and compare your interests, hobbies, values, etc. You will be living with this person all year, and it will be what you make of it. If you two get along, this can usually end in a lasting friendship. However if you find that you are uncomfortable for whatever reason, it will be beneficial to talk to your Resident Assistant and address your concerns. Under most circumstances if you are truly unhappy, you can request to be moved.

, Most college dorms are the basic four walls, one window, tile floors, a desk, and a bed. It's important to decorate and make the place feel more comfortable since you will be spending a lot of time there. If you're having a hard time with the transition from home, try posting more pictures of your family or hometown around your room to remind you of the people you love. Surround yourself with your favorite colors, decorations, posters and pictures. You want to feel as though the place is your own, and personalized. College is about exploring yourself and setting out into the world on your own, so start expressing yourself a little through your decorations.

, If you're finding it hard to transition to the life on campus, it may be really helpful to branch out and meet some more people. You'd be surprised how much the support and friendship of even just one person can better your experience. Great ways to do this are through joining clubs, teams, meeting others on your dormitory floor, or simply talking to the people next to you in your classes. Most colleges have a running list of clubs, which you can pick from and attend interest meetings for. If sports teams are more your thing, but you aren't a varsity athlete, try out for an intramural team! There are plenty of things on campus to get involved in. You might even decide you want to start your own club. Get out, get involved, and get socializing.


Another huge subcategory to meeting new people is Greek life. Sororities and fraternities are a great way to meet new people and to get involved both on and off campus. When rush time comes around on your campus, attend a few interest meetings or talk to some people in the sorority/fraternity you're interested in to get a better feel of whether Greek life is for you. However, don't worry if Greek life isn't your thing - you don't have to join, and it's simply not for everyone.

, Not only will it help you easily keep in touch with friends from home, it also can help you connect with the new ones you're making at college. Facebook is especially great, as you can easily see campus events that are going on such as concerts, parties, and fundraisers. Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, etc. are all other great ways to stay connected with friends all around campus.

, Many campuses have a ""Friends and Family Weekend"" dedicated to students having their loved ones come and visit them. There are usually activities and sights planned for your visitors to see the campus and all it has to offer. Even if no such event is offered, inviting your parents, siblings, friends, and other loved ones to come visit you occasionally can help you transition to this new stage of your life. They can offer support and remind you that you are not completely alone in this new scary stage of your life.


If your friends and family can't come visit, you could ask them to send you a care package, a simple letter, or a favorite snack from home instead - these can be really comforting when you're feeling a little homesick.

, After you've moved in, met those new friends from clubs and teams, gotten to know your roommate, and been invited to parties on Facebook... go to them! Mingle at a frat party, or go to a sponsored concert or event put on by your university. Even if you don't think you'll enjoy the event you've been invited to, try it out anyway - you never know where you might end up having the most fun.

, You don't have to call each other every day, but try to keep in touch with them as much as possible Even if your parents didn't attend college, they can help you when you're feeling stressed out, lonely, just need someone to talk to... or if you just want to brag about the wonderful time you're having.


Remember that you're not the only one transitioning; your parents are adapting to their own changes in environment too now that you're gone.

, If you don't do so well in a class, if you haven't picked a major in your first semester, or even if you aren't sure if you're at the right college... it's okay. Remember that it's not the end of the world, and this is the time you're supposed to explore. You're out on your own for the first time, and no one knows the direct path to walk on. There are going to be times you wonder if you're making the right decision, and there are going to be regrets or desires that you ponder over. This is just the beginning to finding out who you are and what your place will be in the world. Remember that this transition is unfamiliar for everyone, and you are not alone in wondering which way to go.

Stick the leaves and berries together to create the holly.,
Stick the candy holly onto baked goods.",How to Make Candy Holly," Candy melts are sugar-based candies that are designed to be melted and formed into decorative shapes. To begin making the candy holly from candy melts, open the package of green candy melts and place them in a microwavable bowl. Then turn the microwave on to medium (50% power) and run the microwave for 1 minute.After 1 minute, open up the door and stir the candy with a spoon for about 10 seconds. Stirring ensures that the candy will melt evenly.;
, Run the microwave again for 30 seconds on medium power, then check on the candy melts. By now, they should be completely melted. If they are not, stir the candy melts for a few seconds, then microwave in 10 second intervals, stirring in between each 10-second spurt. Stop when they are fully melted., After the candy melts have completely melted, stir in the corn syrup. Stir for about 30 seconds until the whole mixture has an even texture. Corn syrup helps to smooth the candy melt mixture and make it the proper consistency., Once the corn syrup is integrated into the candy melt, pour and scrape the mixture into a ziplock bag using a spoon. Seal the top of the bag and let it sit for 8 hours undisturbed.Letting the mixture sit will make it harden into a putty-like consistency that makes it easy to shape and mold.

, Once the eight hours are up, take the candy melt mixture out of the bag and place it on a clean cutting board or countertop. Gently knead the candy melt as you would dough, kneading for about 2-3 minutes., Dust a clean counter or cutting board with a thin layer of powdered sugar. Then use a rolling pin to roll the candy melt into an even layer that is about 1/16 inch (1.5 mm) thick., Once you have rolled out your candy melt, use a small holly leaf-shaped cookie cutter to punch holly leaf shapes into the candy melt. Use a sharp knife to cut a central vein of the leaf running lengthwise, and several vein offshoots that angle upwards.Peel away the excess candy melt so you are left with just the leaf shapes.
If you want to use up all the candy melt, roll the excess pieces into a ball, then roll using a rolling pin to 1/16 inch (1.5 mm) and cut out another leaf.

, Place the holly leaves on a piece of wax or parchment paper, then let them sit for 3-4 hours. Rolling the candy melt warms and softens it, so letting it sit will cool the candy holly to the right consistency., Airheads have a moldable, taffy-like consistency that is perfect for shaping into the leaves of candy holly. Take your three watermelon airheads, or as many as you wish, and rub the candy between your hands for a few seconds, still with the wrapper on.Watermelon airheads are a shade of green ideal for making the holly leaves.
Rubbing the candy in between your hands warms it up and makes it easier to cut and shape.

, Once you have warmed up the airheads, take them out of their wrapping. Place them on a clean counter or cutting board so that they are ready for shaping., Use a small, holly-shaped cookie cutter to cut out holly shapes from the airheads. Make sure that the holly cookie cutter has the same width or is smaller than the width of the airhead, or else the shape won’t come out right., Once you have cut out all the holly leaves you can, gently pry away the excess Airhead pieces from the leaf shapes. Eat or dispose of these extra pieces as you wish., Use a small, sharp knife to cut lines in the leaves to resemble leaf veins. Make one central vein that runs vertically through the leaf, then make several offshoots of the central vein that are angled diagonally upward and intersect with the pointed ends of the leaves., There are several red candies that could serve as the berries on the holly, so choose your favorite. Examples include red M&M’s, red Airhead Bites, red Sixlets, Cherry Sours and Cinnamon Imperials.You can also melt and shape red candy melts as in Method 1 to make round berry shapes, or roll part of a red Airhead into a round shape.

, One piece of candy holly comprises of several leaves and berries. Separate your candy to create groups of two leaves and two berries, or three leaves and three berries, according to how big you want each candy holly., If you want your candy holly to be enjoyed on its own, as opposed to stuck to a baked good, you want to be sure that the red candy berries and the green leaves stick together. Create an edible paste by melting 2 parts sugar and 1 part water in a saucepan over medium heat, stirring until the mixture thickens and becomes golden., Use a pastry brush to add the sugar paste the base of the leaves where they will connect with the candy berries, as well as to one side of each candy berry.This sugar paste will dry clear, don’t be afraid to use a lot of it to hold your candy holly together.

, Overlap your leaves at their base, pressing them gently together so that they stick to each other with the help of the sugar paste. Stick the red berries together, adding more sugar paste if necessary, then place the red berries so that they are on top of the base of the leaves.

Let the candy holly dry for at least an hour. If the candy berries fall off of the leaves or unstick from one another, add more paste and let them dry again until all the elements are in the right place.
Now that your candy holly is assembled, it can be displayed and enjoyed on its own.

, You can skip the process of making the edible paste by placing the separate elements of the candy holly together on top of the icing or frosting of a cake or cupcake. The frosting will hold all the elements of the candy holly together, so there is no need to attach them with the sugar paste.Place the leaves of the candy holly so that they are overlapping at their base and span out like splayed cards. Then place two or three red candies next to or on top of the base of the leaves.

Finished.

",How to Make Candy Apples1," If your apples came with a waxy coating, the chocolate may not stick. Boil 6 cups (1.4 liters) of water with 1 tablespoon (15 milliliters) of white vinegar. Dip each waxy apple into the mixture for 5 seconds, then pat dry.If the sticks are hard to insert, make a shallow cut in the top of the apple first with a sharp knife. Make sure that the apples are secure on the sticks.;
, The apples will chill as you prepare the chocolate. This will help the melted chocolate harden faster once you dip the apples into it.

, If you don't have wax paper, lightly coat the baking sheet with cooking spray instead. This way, the chocolate won't stick to the baking sheet.

, Fill a saucepan with 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters) of water. Place a heat-safe glass bowl on top of the saucepan. The bottom of the bowl should not be touching the surface of the water.

, To help the butter melt faster, cut it into small cubes. You can use any type of chocolate you want: white, milk, or dark. If you bought colored bakers chocolate, it may have different melting instructions; follow the directions on the bag instead.

, Don't let the chocolate get wet, or it will seize. Also, don't let the chocolate burn, or it will have a bad taste. This will only take a few minutes.

, Get your apples out, and be prepared to start dipping. The chocolate will start to harden quickly.

, Roll it around the chocolate to coat it evenly, then lift it out of the bowl. Give the stick a twirl to help the chocolate coat the apple more evenly. It will also help get rid of any excess chocolate.

, You can also shake some sprinkles over the apples to make them more colorful. When shaking sprinkles onto apples, try to do it over a paper coffee filter. The filter will catch the sprinkles, and make it easier to funnel them back into the jar when you are done., Work quickly, as the chocolate will start to harden. If the chocolate begins to harden, simply place the bowl back onto the saucepan, and warm the chocolate up again.


When placing the apples onto the baking sheet, remember to leave a little space between each apple so that they don't stick together.

If you are planning on using these leaves to decorate a cake, choose ones that look nice. Don't use any bruised or torn leaves.;
, If you are worried about Salmonella, use pasteurized egg whites or dried egg whites instead.If you are going to use powdered egg whites, mix them with about 1 tablespoon (15 milliliters) of water first., Make sure that both sides are evenly coated, or the sugar won't stick. If the mixture is too runny after you have brushed it on, wait 1 minute before proceeding. This will allow the egg white to solidify a little.

, You can do this simply by tossing them in a bowl of sugar, or holding them by the stems and sprinkling sugar over them. You can also spread them out, cover them with sugar, flip them over, and cover them with more sugar.

, Make sure that the leaves are not touching or overlapping, or they will stick together when they dry.

Wait for the candy to harden.,
Serve the apples.",How to Make Candy Apples2," Some apples come with a waxy coating, which can keep the candy coating from sticking. You can get rid of this waxy coating by boiling 6 cups (1.4 liters) of water with 1 tablespoon (15 milliliters) of white vinegar. Dip each apple into the vinegar water for 5 seconds, then pat dry.If you find the sticks difficult to insert, make a shallow slit in the top of the apple with a sharp knife first. Make sure that the apples are secure on the sticks, or they'll fall into the candy mixture.

, The apples will chill as you prepare the candy mixture. Melted candy will harden a lot faster on cold apples than on room temperature ones.

, If you don't have any wax paper, lightly coat the baking sheet with cooking spray instead. This will keep the candy apples from sticking to the sheet while they harden.


The baking sheet needs to be large enough to hold all of the apples without them touching. If you need to, use two baking sheets.

, During this time, you will want to clip a candy thermometer to the side of the saucepan. Don't let the bottom of the thermometer touch the bottom of the saucepan, however. If you don't have a candy thermometer, don't worry; there are other ways to test the temperature of the candy.

, Don't stir the candy during this time. If you don't have a candy thermometer, you can test whether or not the candy is ready by putting a drop into a cup of cold water. If the candy hardens and cracks easily, it's ready. If it sinks to the bottom and stays gooey, it is not ready., If you want it to be opaque, add 2 tablespoons (30 milliliters) of white gel food coloring. The more gel food coloring you use, the brighter the color will be.Avoid over-stirring the mixture. You don't want any air bubbles. Stir just enough to mix in the flavoring, but not so much that you get air bubbles. You are mixing the extract in now, because otherwise the high heat will kill the flavor.
If you aren't a fan of vanilla, you can omit it, or use another flavor, such as cinnamon.

, Twirl the stick in your hand to help the candy coat the apple more evenly, and the excess to drip off.


For a smoother finish, let the candy cool on the apple for 30 seconds, then dip again., This will allow any excess candy to drip towards the stick, and prevent any puddles from forming., As you continue to work, tip the saucepan towards you, so that the candy mixture gathers in the corner. This will make the candy mixture ""deeper"" and make it easier to coat the apples., It will take about 1 hour for the candy to harden.Don't get impatient and stick the candy apples into the fridge, or they may turn sticky.

, Candy-coated apples are best eaten the same day.

If you going to decorate a cake with these, choose ones that look nice. Don't pick any that are bruised or torn.

, You can do this the microwave or over the stove. This will make the corn syrup easier to brush on.

, This will help make the corn syrup stickier and less likely to slide off. When brushing the mixture on, try to do it as thinly as possible. You don't need a lot for the sugar to stick.

, Coat them as evenly as possible, and don't worry if the sugar layer appears thick. You will be shaking the excess off at the end.

, Make sure that the leaves aren't touching or overlapping, or you won't be able to coat them evenly.

, Don't re-use any of the sugar from the first round. It will be damp from the corn syrup and clump up. Also, don't shake off any of the excess sugar; let it sit on the leaves., Don't cover the leaves with anything while they are drying.

, You can eat them as a treat, or use them as a garnish for cakes, drinks, pastries, or even ice cream.

Add oatmeal crunch topping.,
Try a flavored glaze.,
Add other mix-ins to your yams.",How to Make Candied Yams," Use a vegetable brush to scrub the yams to remove dirt and roots. Rinse the yams under cool running water. Do not peel them yet; you will do that after you cook them. Because of this, it's important that the yams are clean.Take a look at the yams to make sure they are fresh. Use a paring knife to slice off any bruised or black spots.
Leaving the peels on will help the yams cook evenly while keeping the flesh intact. If you'd prefer to peel the yams first, your candied yams will taste delicious but won't have a firm texture.;
, Use a large pot big enough to fit all of the yams. Fill the pot with enough cold water to cover the yams by about an inch. Make sure the water is several inches from the rim of the pot, or it will bubble over as the yams cook.

, Place the pot over high heat and bring the water to a full boil. Boil the yams for about 20 minutes, until you can easily poke into their centers with a fork. The yams should be tender, but not mushy.

, When the yams are ready, remove them from heat and drain the water from the pot. Keep the pot close by; you will be putting the yams back into the pot later one.

If you're in a hurry, transfer the yams to a cooking rack to cool off.
Otherwise, just keep the yams in the pot while you begin making the glaze.

, When the yams are cool enough to handle, remove the peels with your fingers. They should easily come off in strips. Try to keep the flesh of the yams intact as you peel. Keep going until all of the yams are peeled.

, Set the yams on a cutting board. Use a paring knife to slice the yams into ¼ to ½ inch (0.64 to 1.27 centimeters) thick discs. The discs should all be the same thickness. The sizes of the discs will vary according to the shape of the yams which taper at the ends., Keep the pot covered, so that the yams don't dry out or lose color. You will be mixing the glaze into the yams later., Place the sticks of butter together with the sugar in a medium saucepan. Turn the burner on medium or medium low to melt the butter. The butter and sugar will cook together to create a glaze perfect for classic candied yams.Cutting the butter into smaller cubes will help it melt faster.

, Once the butter melts, the glaze will begin to bubble up and change texture. Stir constantly until the sugar completely dissolves, but the glaze is still quite runny. Remove the glaze from heat when it is smooth and pourable.


If you overcook the glaze, it will caramelize and become hard. Remove it from heat before it begins to thicken.
You can keep the glaze from caramelizing by keeping the heat low and stirring constantly.

, Be sure that the yams are coated evenly. Use a spoon to gently mix the yams and the glaze so that all the yam pieces get thoroughly coated.

Sweeten your yams to taste. You will have enough glaze to make very sweet, sticky candied yams. If you'd prefer, use only half of the glaze to keep the dish from being too sweet.
Don't overmix the yams and the glaze. The soft-cooked yams will fall apart if you stir too much.

, Pre-heat your oven to 400°F (205°C). Once the oven reaches the right temperature, put the yams into a casserole dish, and bake them for 20 minutes. The glaze will caramelize on top of the yams, and give them a slightly crispy texture., Pour the candied yams into a large bowl or onto a platter. Serve immediately, while the yams are still hot and steaming. If you'd like, serve the yams with a dish of extra glaze on the side.

, This classic Southern preparation is a hit at holiday parties. Adding marshmallows to candied yams makes them sweet enough to serve as dessert. Here's what to do:

Pour the candied yams into a baking dish.
Top the yams with a layer of mini marshmallows.
Place the baking dish in the oven. Broil until the marshmallows are melted and slightly brown on top, about three minutes.
Remove from the oven and serve.

, Oatmeal crunch provides a nice contrast to the soft sweetness of the yams. You bake the candied yams with a dry oatmeal topping that bakes up into a crispy crust. To make it, follow these steps:Pour the candied yams into a baking dish.
Mix 1/2 cup (50 grams) oatmeal, 1/4 cup (50 grams) firmly packed brown sugar, and 2 tablespoons diced butter. Spread the topping evenly over the candied yams.
Bake the yams at 400°F (205°C) until the topping is crispy and brown, about 20 minutes. Remove the yams from the oven and serve hot.

, If you don't want to mess with the texture of your candied pecans, you might be up for experimenting with the flavor. The sweet, sticky glaze provides a good opportunity to play with your favorite flavors. Try stirring in one of the following flavors after you remove the glaze from heat:


1 tablespoon bourbon
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
1 teaspoon cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon nutmeg or cloves
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper

, Candied yams are great on their own, but you may want to spice them up a bit with some extra mix-ins. These add new textures and crunch to an otherwise soft, sweet dish. Try stirring in 1/2 to 1 cup (50 to 100 grams) of one of these mix-ins:


Dried cranberries
Toasted pecans, walnuts or almonds
Diced pineapple
Diced apple

Determine what kind of purpose your fraternity should stand for.,
Decide if you want to start your own fraternity or just a chapter.,
Figure out what kind of people might be interested in your fraternity.,
Start generating interest.",How to Start a Fraternity1," Most fraternities have a code of conduct or beliefs that informs their existence. What do you believe in? Why are you creating this organization? What are your core beliefs? These are important questions to answer if you want to be able to you're your fraternity to fellow students and the administration.


Loyalty, leadership, service, and rigorous academic standards are all ways to appeal to your school’s administration.Sports often work as a big draw too.;
, There are many national fraternities that may not already exist at your school. If you want to start a chapter for a certain fraternity you can visit the national fraternity's website and follow the process that they list there. There are many different fraternities but the processes are relatively similar. They will help you raise funds and find appropriate members for the fraternity.You can also stay independent. There are not many independent fraternities because they lack funding that national fraternities have. Alumni networks are key to maintaining a fraternity.

, If you are starting an entirely new fraternity you’ll have to figure out what exactly is appealing about your fraternity. An independent fraternity might make its mark by being more spontaneous and avoiding many of the tropes that national fraternities fall into. Try to add your own flair to your fraternity.You might want a fraternity that is associated with athletics, or theater, or a different activity.
Try to pick something that you are interested in and will also interest a lot of other people. For example, you could try to start a fraternity that is very interested in community service or one that wants to be known for holding a lot of fun social events.
For example, many fraternities have their own songs. However, one popular fraternity in Nevada called Omega Xi made a name for itself by choosing ‘Row, Row, Row Your Boat’ as their song.

, Spread interest through word of mouth and by posting on social media. Put flyers up all over campus and advertise relentlessly. When you go to the administration asking for them to recognize your fraternity you’ll need a large number of people who are already interested in joining the fraternity.


Your administration will probably try to dissuade you from starting a fraternity because it doesn’t look good for them to support failed projects.

Decide on a name for your fraternity.,
Pick a mantra.,
Determine your organizational structure.,
Create your Constitution and write your fraternity's policies.,
Consider if you want a central location.",How to Start a Fraternity2," Because fraternities are a part of the Greek system you should pick between two or three letters of the Greek Alphabet. These letters should represent the Greek words for values you want your fraternity to embody. Make sure you choose a name that isn't already taken. A quick internet search should let you know if the name is taken or not.


You also could design and select your regalia, symbols, and mascots.

, Most fraternities have a good Latin phrase that fits their belief system. Your slogan doesn’t need to be in Latin, but that is the standard.

, All fraternities have a hierarchy. For example there will be a President, a Vice President, a treasurer, and so on. Decide on how you would like for the fraternity to be organized. Some schools may have specific requirements for student organizations, so it would be a good idea to check with your Greek life coordinator or the director of Student Life., These should cover topics like academic performance, personal conduct, and public relations. Make sure you make a section that allows your brothers to sign the document. This way people are bound by the policies and you can remove someone from the fraternity if they are causing issues.


Make sure that you include all of your members on the editing and fine-tuning of your Constitution. This is vital to creating a good organization.

, Many fraternities are known for their houses. These houses act as gathering places for the fraternity brothers as well as a great location for parties and other social events. A house or other central location is vital to the long-term well being of a fraternity. Without a fraternity house it is hard to tell the difference between your fraternity and a club."

Understand the requirements.,
Develop a strong pitch.,
Affiliate with a national fraternity.If you want to affiliate with a national university you’ll have to get in touch with that fraternity and tell them you are interested in opening a chapter at your school.,
Convince your university to recognize your fraternity.",How to Start a Fraternity3," Get in touch with your campus Greek Life office.Once you have an idea for a fraternity and a decent pitch, you should go to the Greek Life office at your school and tell them your plans for starting a fraternity. Ask what they would like you to accomplish before they would be willing to recognize your fraternity. They might be resistant at first, so you’ll have to come in with a very concrete pitch and plan. Don’t wing it. Be very prepared.


Come with details about name, values, and organization as well as a list of all the people you have gathered who are interested in it. The administration will be much more open to your idea if it is clear that you are on top of it.

, Present your fraternity with confidence. Show everyone what hole in the campus culture you fill. Prove to them that you will be a positive influence. Don't try to develop a fraternity that is just like every other fraternity - that will make you redundant. However, you also shouldn't be so far out in left field that no one would want to join your group.


Your pitch should include all the aspects that you have organized so far including structure, constitution, name, mantra, regalia, and location. However, you also need to explain to them how your fraternity will survive moving forward and how they will fit into the daily life of the campus. What do you bring that no one else brings? Why will you succeed?
Draft a plan that starts by addressing the basics and then moves on to the details. For example, maybe you are selling a fraternity that is based on political activism. You need to explain not only the idea behind your fraternity but also how you will organize events centered on political activism and how this fits into the college's mission.

, Let them know that you have established an interest group and ask them what the next steps will be. They can help guide you through the process., Once you have taken the steps that your Greek Life office has asked you to take, you can ask for recognition. This will allow you to throw campus events, advertise on campus, and be involved in school-sponsored events. Being recognized by the university is necessary if you want to add legitimacy to your fraternity. Remember, the better prepared you are and the more details you can show your administration the more likely they are to approve your fraternity."
"
Develop a program to RUSH prospective new members.You shouldn’t admit just anyone to your fraternity going forward.,
Create a pledge process.,
Allow your pledges to join the fraternity.,
Set up an alumni event.",How to Start a Fraternity4," It’s important to have criteria that is written and defined. Don’t just pick people because they seem cool. Have a defined set of criteria like GPA, community service, and any other qualities you want in your members. You should never discriminate based on race, religion, sexual orientation, or anything else.

, Pledge processes often have a bad reputation for hazing. That’s not necessary. A good pledge process should be one that determines whether or not the prospective new members are a good fit for your Fraternity. Use this process to educate them about your group's values.


A good pledge process should allow the members of your fraternity to get to know your pledges and vice versa. This way both of you will be able to judge if the pairing is a good fit. You should hold a lot of events with pledges that fit the values of your fraternity so that the pledges can see what life would be like inside the fraternity. For example, if your fraternity is based on political activism, maybe you could ask your pledges to organize and execute a protest or event bringing awareness to a certain issue your fraternity finds important.

, Initiate those pledges with customized rituals that embody your Fraternity's values. Initiation rituals are great ways to build friendship and add legitimacy to your fraternity.

, If you are starting a new fraternity you will probably be struggling for money, especially since you will only have young alumni for a long period of time. Developing an annual alumni event is a great way to keep in touch with your alumni. Hopefully you can convince them to make some donations!Events like pig roasts or sports games are great examples of alumni events.

, Measure up 6 inches (15 centimeters) from the bottom of the bottle. Cut around the bottle at that point using a sharp pair of scissors or a craft blade. If you need to, draw a cutting guide using a permanent marker first.Discard or recycle the top potion. You will only be using the bottom potion for this project.

, The slits need to be ½ inch (1 centimeter) wide and 3 inches (8 centimeters) deep. When you are done, you should have a fringe all around the top, cut edge of you bottle. You will eventually flare these out to form the rim of the cauldron., You will be using these to secure the flared out fringe. Choose a strong, sturdy tape, such as duct tape or packaging tape. Place the strips down against the edge of your table so that they are easy to grab., Turn the bottle upside down so that the top is facing up. Push it against the table so that the slits open up and flare out., Holding the bottle flat against the table, take a piece of tape, and lay it down across the flared out flaps. Make sure that the tape is as close to the side of the bottle as possible; don't worry if the ends of the flaps are exposed. Continue laying down pieces of tape across the flaps until they are all covered., Turn on a hair dryer, and hold the nozzle against the joint between the bottle and the flaps. Wait a few seconds, then move over a little bit. Keep moving the hair dryer around the bottle until you are back where you started., The heat of the hair dryer will have softened the plastic. When the plastic cools, it will take on a permanent curve. Once the plastic is cool to the touch, you can lift your hand away., Turn the bottle right side up.

Bend the ends inward by 1/2 to 1 inch (1 to 2.5 centimeters)., Hold the handle over the cauldron so that the inside edges are touching the rim. Open up the folded ends a little and push them up through the holes so that they come out through the top of the rim. Fold the ends back towards the edges of the handle., This is not absolutely necessary, but it could give your cauldron a nice touch. Place St. Patrick's Day-themed stickers onto the cauldron. Great choices include gold or green shamrocks, but you could also add a leprechaun or rainbow. You can also paint on a large, golden shamrock instead:Place a shamrock stencil over the cauldron.

Cover the glue with gold or green glitter.
Remove the stencil and let the glue dry.
Seal the shamrock with clear, glossy acrylic sealer.

, The most obvious choice is chocolate coins, but you can also try other types of candies as well, such as Kisses, jelly beans, and even M&Ms."

Meet people at parties.",How to Prepare for Your First College Semester," Will you be in a dorm or an apartment? Will you be living on campus or off campus? How many roommates will you have? What furniture will already be included with your room? How many people will you share a bathroom with? Knowing these details will help you figure out what items to buy for your room. Plus, it will give you time to prepare mentally to live with other people if you’ll be living with roommates for the first time!;
, If you chose your roommate, or if your university discloses who your roommate is before you arrive at school, reach out to them to figure out who will bring what to for the room. There’s no use having two refrigerators and two tea kettles!


It’s okay to get to know each other on social media before you meet in person, but try not to make first judgements based on what you see online - wait to get to know the real them when you arrive at school.
If you don’t know who your roommate is before you arrive, that’s great too! It will make moving in all that much more exciting, and allow you to get to know them in person on the first day.

, You might want to match your bedding with your rug, for example. Or, you might want to bring some pictures of your friends and family to frame or put on your wall.


If you’ll be living at home and staying in the same room you’ve always lived in, maybe you’ll want to change it up a bit for the transition to college. A fresh coat of paint or a rearrangement in your furniture can make all the difference for a fresh start. Make sure you have a good, quiet study space with an uncluttered desk and adequate lighting if you don’t already.

, You can find great college checklists online.


From there, see what you already own at home that you can bring to school and what you need to buy.

, The earlier the better, as many stores sell out as the summer winds down.


Before you go out and buy a mini fridge full-price from Target, see if you know someone who just graduated college who might be selling theirs for a cheaper price. Or, look online at sites like eBay or craigslist for used items.

, Nothing screams “freshman” more than someone cluelessly wandering around the buildings with a campus map in their hands. A few days before classes start, figure out which buildings your classes are in so you’re not in a rush on the first day. It will also give you an idea of how much time it will take to get to class and what time you’ll need to leave your dorm.


Figure out how you will be commuting to campus/class. If you are far from campus or your campus is really big, consider driving or biking. If it’s not too far, you can walk or skateboard.
Be early on the first day to get a good seat. Even for the subsequent classes, it doesn’t hurt to be a few minutes early.

, It’s okay not to know your exact class schedule before you arrive on campus. Usually, there will be academic advisors at orientation who guide you through what courses you should enroll in for your first semester. However, have an idea of what you’re interested in taking and browse your school’s course website to make enrolling in classes easier once you get there.When it comes to scheduling classes, try to choose a good mix of classes that both fulfill general education or “core” requirements and delve into subjects that you might be interested in majoring in.
Don’t be over-ambitious with your course load for your first semester. You will already be busy meeting new people and getting situated during this big transition - the last thing you want is to be bogged down with work in the second week.

, While professors don’t usually send out a checklist of required school materials like in high school, you’ll need to be prepared with the right materials to stay neat and organized.


Get a planner or calendar. As soon as you get the syllabus for each class, go through and write down all your assignments. This will help you stay more organized during the semester.The one list professors will send out is a list of the required textbooks for each class. You can either buy or rent them at your school’s bookstore, or check out websites like Amazon.com that sell used textbooks for less.
Get a laptop. A laptop is almost indispensable in college, as many students like to take notes on their laptop in class, and it gives you the freedom to study anywhere. Also, it’s a good idea to invest in a computer backup so that if something happens to your computer, you won’t lose everything you worked on.]
Although you will be using your laptop a lot, don’t ditch the old-school paper and pencil. Be sure to have a notebook and a handful of pens and pencils with you at all times when going to class, in case a professor doesn’t allow laptops to take notes or you quickly have to jot something down.
Buy folders or binders to keep your papers organized. Although almost everything seems to be done digitally nowadays, professors still hand out assignments on paper. Don’t let them get crumpled at the bottom of your bag and buy at least a couple folders to keep them tidy.
Decide if you want to invest in a printer for your room, or if you will use the university printers. Keep in mind that, although the school usually charges you for each page you print, it may still be more cost effective than buying a new printer and refilling paper and ink (plus, everyone will ask you if they can borrow yours!).

, Although the first day of classes are usually just an overview of the course, don’t zone out! Especially if you’re deciding whether to keep or drop a course, you’ll want to get a good understanding of the syllabus and professor’s teaching style. Get in a good habit of taking notes during the first lecture.There might even be homework assigned before the first class, like a reading assignment. Check your email the week leading up to the first day so that you’re prepared in case your professor sends out an assignment.
College classes run at a much higher pace than high school. There are no ice breakers on the first day of class. Professors lecture at a fairly fast pace, and although they sometimes stop for questions, they are on a strict agenda, especially for big lectures. Be sure to note down what you might need clarification on to ask them during office hours.

, Even if you have friends from high school going to the same college, branch out and meet new friends through your dorm, classes, and extracurricular activities. Your high school friends will always be there - now is your chance to meet people with diverse backgrounds and interests to expand your social circle., The first week of school is the best time to meet people - usually that’s when all the freshmen activities are, and no one knows each other yet! Put yourself out there and don’t be scared of being awkward or weird, no one really knows what they’re doing anyway. Start up a conversation with someone sitting across from you at the the dining hall table or in class. All you have to do is introduce yourself and ask them where they’re from, or if you can borrow a pencil - easiest ice breaker ever!That being said, don’t be discouraged if you don’t meet your best friend on the first week. You will not click with every single person you meet. Oftentimes, once you get into your routine and bump into the same people from class on a day-to-day basis, friendships will seamlessly blossom from everyday experiences.
If you are shy, a good place to start making friends is in your own room with your roommate, if you have one. You can easily bond over moving in and getting up for your first day of class together. This doesn’t mean that you have to be automatic best friends, but these shared experiences are likely to bring you close.

, College is a clean slate - join a club that fascinates you, or try out for a sport you’ve never heard of. There are plenty of student organizations, sports teams, and clubs that you can join. Who knows - you might end up discovering your lifelong passion. Your college will likely put on an activity fair during orientation week, so be sure to check it out.Greek life is often regarded as the quintessential way to build a social life in college and can be a great way to meet new people. But, if it doesn’t seem like a good fit for you, there are a multitude of other types of student groups you can join. Keep in mind that Greek life differs vastly from school to school, and is likely very different from what you see in the movies. If you’re on the fence about joining a sorority or fraternity, just try it out! It doesn’t hurt to go to rush, and you don’t have to commit to joining a sorority or fraternity at the end of it. Go with your gut, and know that you will make friends whether you’re in one or not.

, Of course, moving away from your parents’ watchful eye means you have all the freedom to do what you want on the weekends, including going to college parties. This can be a great way to unwind and meet new people, dress up in themed outfits, and have fun getting ready with your dorm mates beforehand. Keep in mind that you should always have a buddy system before entering a party so that you have someone to rely on if you ever run into trouble. Be sure to familiarize yourself with the campus’ safety resources and procedures and have important emergency phone numbers inputted in your phone before heading out."

Think about what type of a student community you'd like to run.,
Create a group that would attract students with the same interests.,
Decide if you will need to prepare financially to purchase materials for your club (flyers, posters, name badges, administrative materials).,
Think of what audiences will be interested in joining your new community.,
Create a list of what you will need to operate a successful community.,
Check your school's website to examine the costs of using a room on campus as a designated meeting area.,
Prepare your materials.,
Create a group identity.,
Plan activities that are meaningful to your community.,
Think about how your activities and materials are being received by members.,
Adjust to the needs of students in your community.,
Listen to what your members are saying and take their thoughts into account when preparing materials.",How to Run a Student Community at a University," Are you interested in a social group? Are you looking into establishing an academic community that meets to discuss classwork? Or, are you interested in meeting new people in the same field as you? Research the established organizations at your school.

Perhaps there are pre-existing communities that already offer what you're trying to create. If so, reconsider starting a student community and explore the options that are available on campus. Here, you will be able to find people who share the same interests with you without having to create promotional materials to advertise your new community.;
, If you are interested in organizing a general social community of students, search for potential meeting places that accommodate varying numbers of students. You are not limited to organizing academic communities, but consider what the students at your university may express interest in., The extent to which you decide to organize your club will determine any costs that arise during the preparation process. Some examples of easily accessible, inexpensively maintained clubs are:

Microbiology Club
Engineering Students Association
Sophomores of ______ University

, Promote your group: invite friends and students, print flyers to post around campus, and consider creating an online presence for the group where you can share announcements and meeting places.

Explore opportunities to print inexpensive documents through your school's library to make the promotional process easier. Most schools offer cheap printing for around 11 cents per page.
Social media can help promote your group. Create a Facebook page to share information and facilitate the process of joining the group.

, For example, if your group will be academic in nature or may attract a large group of students, consider the fact that any potential conferences or meetings may necessitate a meeting area. Some college campuses allow students to use board rooms for meetings, but depending on the size and function of your group, you may need to explore options of renting a room on campus for a few hours occasionally., Also, depending on the function of your community, you should consider the costs and utility of things like:

Folding tables and chairs for group functions
Fundraising and volunteering to generate income and create experiential opportunities for members
Governing the community. Depending on the size and function of your group, you may need to hire someone or purchase software that tracks membership, expenses, and funds. For example, you could download and use Microsoft Excel to create a simple spreadsheet that has members' names in alphabetical order, their attendance to group meetings, or their contribution and donations to the group. Again, this is not necessary for a simple, recreational community, so you want to define the title and purpose of your group before planning for large events or membership.

, Print posters with the name of the group, possibly an introduction to the new community, and any upcoming meeting times. This ensures that the group is visible to the public. You can post an announcement to your school's bulletin boards to your classes.

Create an agenda. Schedule group meetings that are accessible to other students. Have a topic prepared to talk about before attending any community meetings.
Prepare a list of expectations, guidelines, or rules that define your community.
Track members' names and email addresses on a database such as Microsoft Excel so that you have a list that is easily accessible in the event that you need to send out an important message or announcement.

, This is critical to running a successful student community. You want your community to be attractive to potential members, but you need to have a cohesive set of shared group interests to do so.

Invite friends that share an interest in your community's theme, but don't be exclusive of outsiders or students who are curious. Encourage diverse people to share ideas on how to improve the community.
Think of opportunities for community members to engage with each other on campus. For example, schedule a community clean-up or a fundraising bake sale to create a positive image of your group and encourage friendships among members.

, If you are running an academic community, such as a Microbiology Group, gather study materials that may be helpful to struggling students or prepare to show a helpful educational video you used to study for a Microbiology exam. If you are running a community that is for athletes, have exciting games or drills prepared to engage the community members.

Be creative. Think of plans that are inspiring, useful, and structured.
Seek help from your campus recreation office to find resources that will keen your community entertained and excited to be a part of your group.

, Do you need to find exciting activities to liven up your community? Or, are you finding that noise levels at a previous meeting were too high and that you need help controlling your group? Consider what changes can be made to improve members' experiences in your community., Be attentive to students who are expressing dissatisfaction, or those who are actively suggesting changes., If several students are unhappy with how a meeting went, you can choose to address it to the whole group to get feedback or you can make a simple change to improve your next meeting."

Prepare the building during the summer: Right after winter semester’s move out day, there are approximately 100 days until fall move in day.,

Get started: The meeting with the Community Director will be about how to prepare a room.,
Report Room Condition Report findings: When reporting the Room Condition Report, if there is an item that needs to be replaced, the Resident Advisor must communicate with the Community Director in order to get a replacement item.,
Finalize the checklist: By the time the building is ready to be inspected, there is about 3 weeks left until Freshmen Move In Day.,
Attend Resident Advisor training: This is a two-week process that trains the Resident Advisor for almost any situation that may be encountered during the school year.,

Prepare for move-in day: This is the busiest day of the year for all housing employees.,
Implement training during the school year: Resident Advisors are expected to assist the Residents in every aspect throughout the entire course of both semesters, such as campus life, homework, and residential issues.,
Schedule meetings: Every week, the Resident Advisors will have a meeting with their respective Community Directors.,
Assign duty: Duty days are assigned to each Resident Advisor according to availability due to personal and school events.,
Answer duty calls: When a resident calls the front desk to report an incident, the front desk staff immediately calls the Resident Advisor on Duty to respond to the problem.,
Do rounds: Rounds only apply to the Resident Advisor on Duty.,
Build community: Residents are encouraged to leave their doors open to make new friends, hang out in study lounges, and/or attend a program hosted by the Resident Advisors.,
Speed up the move-out process: As the winter semester draws to an end and everybody is saying their goodbyes to their new friends, the Resident Advisors are responsible for checking the residents out of the building.",How to Run a Residential Community in a University," The Resident Advisors are responsible for turning the building around. Resident Advisors must organize the cleaning crew, send records to the central office, and prepare every single room for the incoming residents. There is an end of the year meeting with each building’s respective Community Director to set deadlines and goals for the summer preparation period.

, To start, inspect every single room in the dormitory according to the Room Condition Report. This report indicates the condition of the entire room at the time of move in and move out. Items are shown on the attached image. If anything on this sheet needs to be replaced due to damages, it is up to the Resident Advisor to make a report about it. If no report is made, the residents that occupy the room in the upcoming semester will not be happy when they move in. To keep the residents happy, the Resident Advisor must complete this Room Condition Report flawlessly., When examining the Room Condition Report, if an item was checked as OK at move in but damaged at move out, the person responsible will receive a charge. These charges are placed by the Office Service Clerk and sent to Central Housing Office. The item will be ordered by the Office Service Clerk once all the Room Condition Reports for every room are completed.

, The Community Director will accompany the Resident Advisors as they do a final walk-through of each room. Once the Community Director approves the building, Resident Advisor Training begins.

, This process shapes the Resident Advisor to read and react to an incident. The first week consists of numerous presentations on resources on campus to refer to, how to build community within Residence Halls, and accepting and assisting certain groups of residents. The second week consists of Community Directors recreating scenarios using former Resident Advisors as actors and placing the new Resident Advisor in these situations to respond to a disturbance. Once the scene is over, everybody sits down and explains strengths and improvements on how to handle the incident. Going from a resident to a leader will teach many new abilities, and most of these are learned from these two short weeks.

, On this day, your students will say goodbye to their families and call campus their new home. The new residents will receive help from volunteer staff to move their belongings to their new room while Resident Advisors keep order during the process. After everybody is moved into their rooms, there are meetings held on every floor by the Resident Advisors to introduce themselves, lay out guidelines, expectations, and rules of the building. Then all the Resident Advisors on campus host a welcoming party., The building must be kept orderly and the residents must have an overall satisfaction with living on campus. There are three responsibilities that are met by the Resident Advisor: Meetings, Duty, and Community.

, These meetings discuss how everybody is doing mentally and physically, ideas for improvement in the building, and weekly wrap-ups. These are pretty general and simply just a check up on everybody’s status.
, Duty is defined as the person responsible for the building when the Community Director is not in office. This is the most important step in running a Residential Community. Throughout the course of the night, the Resident Advisor on Duty can be called upon to respond to an incident, must do three rounds, and show presence in the community.

, The Resident Advisor Training sessions come into play in these situations. This is when Resident Advisors are tested in real-life events and try to handle it how the Community Director would. However, if the incident needs higher authority, the Resident Advisor could call the Community Director for further instruction. After each duty call, there will be an incident report submitted to the Community Director to be investigated for further involvement.

, Throughout the course of the night, the Resident Advisor is responsible for walking around each floor and making sure everything is normal. These are called rounds. During rounds, the Resident Advisor checks for any damages in the hallways, trash, and also checks in with residents to check on their satisfaction.

, These programs can serve as a break from everyday life and relax with friends. These help the Resident Advisors to build community and get people involved in the building and around campus. They are meant for fun and can get attendees of upwards of 300 people to come to an event.

, The residents remove their personal belongings, make sure the room is left how they were at move in, and turn their key into the Resident Advisor. The Resident Advisor then does a walk-through of the residents’ rooms to see if there are any damages. Once all the residents are moved out and the building is empty, the process restarts all over again.

",How to Move Into a Dorm from Your Family Home," Determine the exact size and shape of your room. If you are sharing with one or more people, what spaces are yours, and which are the common areas? Is there a kitchen? Where is the bathroom? What will you need to bring for yourself? What is already provided for you? Don't be shocked on move-in day.;
, It is really useful to know what other students think about that place.

,

, Most people will be glad to know they aren't the only one with bodily quirks, and it's a good icebreaker. Tell them where to find your family's phone number. If you have a medication or allergy list keep it in your purse or wallet, and tell your roommate where it is.

, Chances are, you are moving from a larger living space at home, into a smaller space at college. If you have time, and room in your house, mark off an area that is the same size as your new space (not to be confused with the entire room), and fit your things in it. Don't forget the furniture that will already be provided there!

, Do you plan to eat in the cafeteria all the time, or do you plan eat in the dorm? Even if you plan to have a few weekly meals in the dorm, you will probably need some sort of silverware and plates (paper ones rock!). Some colleges send lists of suggested items to pack in their orientation mailings.

, Keep separate lists for the things that you already have, and the things that you need to buy. Decide whether you want to buy new items beforehand , or buy them when you get there. The things that you buy there will be a better fit to that part of the country/world, which is important if you are moving to an area that has a much different climate than your hometown.

, Most colleges provide information on how to do this in their orientation packets.

, You'll be able to find your own stuff in the communal bathroom if it's all in one place, and carry it to your room easily if you have to.

,, Some things HAVE to be the same. And remember you may not find a supplier of your favorite lotion or hot sauce for a while. If you can't live without it, bring a little with you.

, The campus health service is extremely busy after beginning of the year, and it may take some time for your first appointment.

, Unless your room is a palace, you probably won't need a gigantic trailer. Read your orientation packet or ask for this information.

, Do you know if you have any forms to fill in or hand in? Do you know where to pick up your key? Do you have to go to a specific place on campus first, or do you go straight to your dorm?

Contact your roommate beforehand if you can.,
Choose the clothes first.,
Know what special occasions might be coming up.,
Choose grooming or bathroom items you can't or wouldn't buy regularly.,
Pack room items that are essential.,
Bring your laptop or other word processing digital device.,
Pack some stationery.,
Pack items that you'd like to have but aren't necessarily essential.,
Take some food.,
Include some decorative items.,
Obtain some good packing.,
Pack clothes with a mind to keeping them in good condition.,
Try to organize everything by category.,
Take off all the wrappers, plastic stickers, etc., from new products.,
When you're ready to move in, try waking up as early as possible to get to your dorm as soon as you can move in.,
Take your time setting up.",How to Pack Your Belongings for College," That way, you can both figure out who brings what, rather than doubling up on the same shared items. For example, she might bring a TV and a coffee maker, while you bring the microwave and refrigerator. Also check to see what items the campus already provides, and what you are allowed (and not allowed) to bring. Once this is all squared up, you're ready to begin choosing the things and packing.

, Ensure that you have essential items that can be mixed and matched with each other, to increase the extent of your campus wardrobe. Keep everything casual, neat and comfortable, and prefer easy-care items over the more challenging fabrics and styles.


A few good pairs of jeans/shorts, plenty of basic tops that you can layer, shoes that you can walk in, a good coat/jacket, plenty of clothes to lounge around in your dorm, old tee-shirts, and socks. Also, bring shower shoes or flip flops for shared bathrooms.
Extras: Scarves, swimsuit, heels, jewelry, and belts.;
, This can help you work out whether you need a suit or special dress for these occasions now, or whether you can drop back home and collect them later in the term rather than having to take up valuable space in your dorm room now.

, For example, your hairbrush, your current toothbrush, your makeup brushes, etc. For things such as new toothbrushes, shampoo, toothpaste, floss, etc., just buy them as you need them; no need to stock up now unless they're frightfully expensive wherever you're headed.


If you have medication, ensure that your doctor has provided you with sufficient scripts for renewals.
It's a good idea to turn up with a basic set of typical bathroom items, such as headache tablets, one tube of toothpaste, a chapstick, sore throat gargle, fungal cream, Band-Aids, etc.
Check out online store options for buying in the things you need. This may prove cheaper than lugging around supplies from home that take up precious space in your room.

, Some of the things that you will likely need include:


Sheets and pillow covers. Include a comforter and a blanket.
A portable hamper or laundry basket for toting dirty clothes to the laundry and clean ones back. Laundry detergent is helpful to have too. If you use dryer sheets, throw a few in.
An alarm. This might be on your phone/digital device, a standalone clock or some other means. Be sure to have one!
Earplugs or noise-canceling headphones; this will help you to stay focused when your roommate is noisy or snoring.
A bundle of quarters. These will be useful for all manner of machines that take your change.
Basic cooking items, such as a microwave-safe bowl and plate, a microwave-safe mug or cup, a spork, a few utensils, an electric jug, etc. Always find out in advance what is provided as part of your room, to save yourself from carrying unnecessary items.
A refillable water bottle, so that you can enjoy tap water and save your precious pennies. It can also be useful to bring along a pitcher for cold water, one with a lid that can be placed in the refrigerator.
If your room has its own bathroom, find out in advance if it needs a shower curtain. Definitely bring along a bathmat or two, and some towels/ face washers/ hand towels.

, These are rarely ""optional"" nowadays, so you'll need to invest in something if you don't already have a word processing device. Used reconditioned laptops are very affordable and come with guarantees if you buy from a reputable seller.


Don't forget chargers, extension cords, power packs, etc. that are needed for all digital devices, including your phone.
Add a sticky name label to all of your digital devices, along with a phone number or email address in case of loss. Record all serial numbers somewhere safe, in case of theft or loss.
Many dorms and colleges have computers available for student use. If you don't want to take or purchase your own computer, find out what the computer availability will be at your college, including all-hours access for those late-night essay finishes.

, If you have special items you'd like to have with you, pack these. Take advantage of summer sales to stock up. Always consider whether it's easier to stock up once on campus or before you leave home though; for example, if your parents are driving you to college, it may just be easiest to stock up during a specific outing with them once you arrive.


It is always a good idea to have a pair of scissors, some tape and a stapler and staples. Also grab a few recycled envelopes and note paper from your home stash; leaving notes will become a commonplace activity on campus and these come in handy.

, Before doing this, be absolutely sure you have the room for them, both in your bags and at your destination. Also take into account security or fragility concerns before taking valuable items with you. Some of the ""nice-to-have-but-not-necessary"" items include:


A small fan for your room if it's likely to be hot.
Trash bags, for clearing away all of your trash.
Cleaning products. An all-purpose spray is a good cleaner to have handy, along with such things as Clorox wipes, a spray bottle for water, etc. Find out if it's easier to purchase these supplies when you arrive though.
A lamp. While it's not essential, if the dorm doesn't provide one and you like to read in bed, this can be an important asset for comfortable and easier reading, especially if your roommate wants the overhead light off.
Clear storage organizers can be a helpful way to store clothes and bits and pieces. Look for stackable ones that make the most of the space in your dorm room.

, Don't think that you can rely on your meal plan. Most cafeterias close around 8 or 9, and you don't want to waste a meal when you could just eat a light snack.


Use the internet to find out what the local stores provide by way of food, and how easy (or difficult) they are to reach. Do they have the food you like? Use this research to guide what you stock up on at home.

, Your dorm room will be your home for the coming year or so, so making it feel cozy will help you to feel more ""at home"". Adding a few decorative touches can enhance an otherwise generic room space.


Take along some posters or a tapestry to hang on the wall. A large poster or tapestry can cover up a lot of dull wall space.
You might also consider making a collage for the wall, one that grows as the year goes on, by sticking up a large piece of mostly blank paper, with a pretty border and some sayings, then add to it as the year goes on, with more sayings, photos, scraps of paper, mementos, etc. By the end of the year, you'll have a fabulous keepsake.

, If you are able to drive your belongings to your dorm, or your parents are driving you, you have more options than those catching a plane, train or bus. Boxes are a huge help, as you can pack a lot into them and they will fit easily in the car. You can get some free at grocery stores. (Drive to the back of the store and you'll normally see a pile of boxes ready to be picked up by trash services.)


If you are traveling by public transportation, use sturdy and reliable suitcases. Find out what the maximum weight and baggage allowance is, to avoid nasty surprises. If you need more than what is allowed with your ticket, find out what the costs are for unaccompanied baggage or for freighting the additional items by courier. Keep in mind that everything you take has to also come back with you, unless you plan on donating items at the end of the year.

, Transporting clothes by folding in boxes can be messy, and your clothes will wrinkle. Try gathering a handful of your clothes by the hanger and keep them together with a rubber band. Cover everything with a trash bag and then pack you clothes last in the car. This way, when you move in, just take off the rubber band and trash bag and you clothes are ready to be hung up.


If packing in a suitcase, try to roll as many items as possible. This makes for better usage of the space and can prevent wrinkling.
If taking a suit, use a suit-pack. Do you really need that suit though?

, For example, don't put your sheets and cleaning supplies in the same box. Try to keep such things separate.

, That way, you won't have to take everything apart when you're moving in and then have to find somewhere to dispose of it all. Remember to wash new sheets, towels and other cloth items before you move in.

, Hundreds of other students will be as busy as you, so it's nice to be a little ahead. This way, you have all day to unpack, and time after to explore your new environment.

, You may find it takes the first week before you're happy with where everything will be for the rest of the term or year. And always be open to moving things around or changing layouts, etc., if you find things aren't working as well as they could be. Aim for efficient use of space, comfort and privacy for you and your roommate.

Work in the industry and make lots of friends.,
Tip well.,
Frequent the place regularly.,
Be nice to everyone.,
Dress the part and dress to code.,
Look for deals.",How to Party Like a Rock Star on a College Budget," Be a bartender, waiter, waitress, bouncer or even a manager. Being industry as they call has its many perks. You get into some clubs free just for working in the industry, especially if the door guy at that club frequents yours’. You may get drink discounts or even free drinks. Being in the industry and knowing people is the first thing to being a V.I.P. Maybe you want to stand out at a top shelf club in St. Louis. Well, knowing who works there and who frequents your club or bar from there helps a lot.;
, That normally $5 beer only costs you $3 but tip the bartender or waitress the two bucks you would have saved. They are more apt to remember you and people who tip might get special treatment in those times you need it. It is impressive to friends or clients if you get special treatment at a place. Things like getting your table before anyone else at a restaurant or maybe not paying the ridiculous cover charges at clubs is impressive not only to friends and client, but to people who are waiting in line as well. Tipping the door guy for letting you in for free is a great way to get the service time and time again. He will remember you, trust me.

, Not just on a Friday and Saturday, but in the middle of the week as well. This way you can learn more about the people who cater to you when you are there. Ask them to come to your club. Give them the treatment that you would like or at least to your ability. If it is slow ask them to sit and chat get to know the person. Get to know there first name and remember it. This way if you see them somewhere other then work you can say hello. They may not remember yours but remember theirs. It impresses people if you remember there name. Also if you have a waitress, waiter or bartender that you see on a regular bases ask if they are there that day as you go in and sit in their section or their end of the bar.

, The weird looking man sitting two seats down from you at the bar may look like a pedophile, but he may be the owner of that club you are trying to get in. Industry people usually hang out with industry people. Working in bars and clubs you live a vampire life style, working nights and sleeping days. It is easier to hang out with friends on your same schedule, then people who work normal nine to five jobs. Being nice will go along way, Get free concert and sports tickets, free admission to clubs, and even free nights out on in the town just for being nice to people. Remember though not to take something for granted or abuse the privilege.

, If you are going to rub shoulders with the elite of the area you need to dress the part. I am not saying anything less then Gucci won't do. Have style. You don't need to drop two thousand dollars on a over price suit. A-listers don't always wear suits and ties to go party. Most of the time this would be slightly over dressed. If you are planing on going to a plush club wear a nice sports jacket or stylish evening jacket both with a pocket square. This could be worn with jeans or dress slacks depending on the clubs dress code. Style will go along way into getting you in to the V.I.P area in a lot of places. If you look like you belong in there then you are more than likely to end up there. Specially if you have done all of the above.

, Look for awesome drink specials Why pay five or six dollars a beer when you get that same beer for one or two dollars. They may not have everything you want, maybe they play blues or country music instead of the thrash metal you love. For a dollar a bottle listen to country, plus we all know country girls are great looking. If Tuesday is the day they have a drink special visit the club on a Monday or Wednesday when they are less busy and make friends with the staff there. This way they know who you are when you come in on Tuesday and receive better service.

Make sure your suggestion is realistic, sensible and feasible.,
If it will make you feel more confident, get together a small (and I mean small) group of friends to come with you, but only if they can help you to argue your point- don't just bring them along to hang around behind you and giggle.,
Pre-arrange an appointment with the headteacher at a time that is convenient through their secretary.,
Arrive to your appointment on time- lateness gets the negotiation off to a bad start.,
Thank your headteacher for allowing you an audience with them and state the reason for your appointment; for example, ""I really appreciate you taking the time to speak to me.,
Get straight in with why it is a good idea, and outline all the benefits it could bring.

,
If there has been opposition to your proposal in the past, or you can think of reason why the proposal may be rejected, try to explain any ways you have thought of that could eliminate any worries the headteacher may have.,
It might be a good idea to tell your headteacher about any support or approval you have been met with when talking to people- particularly teachers- about your proposal, e.g.,
If it is applicable, for instance if you are trying to change a rule, be sure to explain the current system's flaws and how your proposal would change this.,
When you have finished speaking, let your headteacher speak and discuss with him or her any issues they may have calmly.,
Always thank your headteacher for their time, even if they have said no to your proposal.",How to Negotiate an Issue With Your Headteacher," For example, you're never going to convince your headteacher to let your school have a 10 week Christmas holiday or change the uniform to pink. He/she will not be impressed if you waste their time over something ridiculous.;
, It is VERY important to choose reliable people who are known for being polite and trustworthy, and not people who may become aggressive or rude. Do not bring more than about 4 people.

, Don't just barge into their office and spring your visit upon them unannounced as he or she may be busy. Let them know if you are bringing other people with you.

, Knock on their door, and go in only when invited.

, I'm here because I would like to discuss the possibility of arranging earlier study leave.""

,, For example, ""I realise that you may have concerns over whether the idea of having water fountains around school may invite problems with people misusing them. However, I think this could be solved by having prefect monitors or teachers around to make sure nobody causes trouble.""

, ""I have spoken with teachers and some of my fellow students about this and they all agree that this would be a good thing to do.""

, So if you were trying to make it so that students were allowed to bring mobile phones to school, you might say, ""Many parents worry about their children walking home from school on their own and would feel much better if they knew that they had a way of contacting them if they got into trouble.""

, LISTEN to what they have to say.

, You want to stay on their good side, and appear polite and mature. If it is appropriate, shake their hand.

Find a paper or digital calendar system.,
Sketch out deadlines for your semester.,
Plan a weekly schedule.,
Create a daily to-do list.,
Block out time for your job.,
Make time for sleep, well-balanced meals, exercise, and downtime.,
Schedule in rewards.,
Leave room for flexibility.",How to Manage Your Time in College1," Before you begin making a schedule for yourself you want to find a calendar system that’ll allow you to plot out both long and short-term activities. It is important to have just one calendar where you can store all of your information for easy reference.


Digital calendars can be very useful since they can be linked to many electronic devices, allowing you to access them at any point.
A calendar that has a monthly overview followed by a weekly breakdown would be very useful for long and short-term planning.;
, Once you’ve got your hands on the schedules for all of your courses, put all assignment due dates, exams, and homework on your calendar. This will help you be aware of what weeks or months of the semester will be particularly busy so you can plan ahead.If you know in advance that you’ve got three midterms in one week, you’ll tell that friend who asks you to go on a weekend trip that you can’t go until later.

, Now that you’ve got a roadmap of your semester, you can begin planning out a schedule to prepare yourself for those crunch times. Make a weekly priority list that takes both daily homework assignments and larger projects into account. You can break down larger projects into more manageable chunks so you’re not overwhelmed.If you have a research paper due at the end of the semester, for example, don’t procrastinate until the week before it’s due! Use your weekly schedule to budget in time for library research, an outline, and a rough draft. If you think it’ll take you six weeks to get this done, work backward from the due date to create deadlines for yourself., At the beginning of each week, sit down with your calendar and come up with a list of tasks you’d like to accomplish each day of that week. This will allow you to see how you will achieve your weekly goal.


Prioritize your daily tasks by marking them with an H, M, or L for high, medium, or low importance., Working during college can limit your study hours, but you can learn to manage your time by choosing a flexible job that will help you work around busy academic weeks.Look for a job that has flexible hours, is online, or has a large number of employees with whom you could swap shifts with.
Ask in advance about time off during times in the semester you know will be busy.
Consider jobs that will let you work during times that you normally wouldn't study or attend class. For instance, if you are a morning worker, you might take shifts at a restaurant in the evening.

, You can’t be a machine, so don’t try! Your mental and physical well-being will determine how successful you are in accomplishing your goals. Budget adequate sleeping time and don’t feel guilty if you schedule in some fun.In fact, spending time doing a fun hobby can help you become more conscious of your time.

, Did you just survive a brutal week of exams and papers? Make sure you build in a reward for all the hard prep work you’d done in the previous months to prepare for this difficult time.You can use these rewards as a motivating tool as well. If there’s a movie you’ve been dying to see in theaters, buy a ticket for a showtime at the end of your challenging week.

, Things happen. You’ll get sick, have a family emergency, or have to cover for a friend at work. If you plan some flexibility into your weekly schedule, you’ll manage to stay on top of your schoolwork while navigating life’s curveballs."

Know your best study time.,
Focus on one task at a time.,
Utilize those small amounts of time between activities.,
Stay off the internet during your designated study hours.,
Designate a study space.",How to Manage Your Time in College2," A good method to minimize distractions is to schedule study time during the time of day when you are most focused. Are you a night owl? Early bird? Block off your most productive hours for studying.


If you have a class you don’t like to study for, you should prioritize working on this course during the time of day you are most concentrated., Multi-tasking has both a physical and mental toll. You’ll lose time while trying to multi-task and you’ll lose in-depth engagement in the subject as well., Do you have an awkward 20 minute gap between classes? Instead of pulling out your phone or taking a cat nap, grab your notes from the week before and review them., Avoid Instagram, Reddit, Pinterest, Twitter, and Facebook. Getting onto these social media sites will distract you and prolong study time.


Instead, use these sites during scheduled downtime. Or, better yet, schedule to see some of these people you follow online in person!
If you can’t seem to keep yourself away from social media, alter your alert settings or have a friend change your password., Studying in a place where you will feel relaxed and sleepy, like your bed, is not the best idea. Instead, find a location that has a desk, good lighting, and minimal distractions.If you have a chatty roommate, head to a campus library or dorm study space.

"
"
Start a study group.,
Find a writing partner.,
Set limits with your friends and roommates.",How to Manage Your Time in College3," At the beginning of the semester, make a plan with some classmates to have a weekly study group. Studying in a group can be a very helpful learning environment, and it also makes studying more fun., Do you have a big writing assignment? Find a friend who also has some serious writing to do and come up with a regular time to meet and write together. Even if you’re not in the same major, you can benefit from having a designated time to write and a person to swap drafts with., Tell your friends and roommates the times you’ve blocked off for study and ask them to leave you alone during those periods.


Have an easy way to show your friends that you’re busy, such as a “Do Not Disturb” sign on your door."
"
Monitor how you spend your time for a week.,
Sort your activities into groups.,
Prioritize your needs.",How to Manage Your Time in College4," Keep a journal where you write down how much time you spend on every activity in your daily life. If you keep track of your time for a full week, you can pinpoint activities that dominate your daily routine., Once you’ve determined what types of activities you typically spend time on, sort them into larger categories.


For example, you can have categories for academic, recreational, work, or social activities.

, Once you’ve sorted your activities into groups you need to determine what categories need to take priority in your life. Managing time is all about balance, so dedicate more time in your life for activities that are most important for achieving your goals.If you need to work to pay your rent and want to maintain a high GPA, you should prioritize spending more time on these sorts of activities.

"
"
Stay Organized.,
Be on time.,
Get help when you need it.,
Just do it.",How to Make the Most of Your College Experience," The two most important things you should keep organized: your dorm room (if you live in one) and your academic life. Organization for your dorm means knowing where everything is, and keeping things in places that are easy to get to. Academic organization means using a system that allows easy access to your notes and assignments, as well as knowing all your ""to-dos"" and appointments. This includes using all these worthwhile things: containers, folders, notebooks, book for ideas, book for homework, large yearly calendar to hang on your wall;
, This is for everything really- in life, and especially during college. It goes for lectures, events, parties, etc. It's the one thing that has hugely made my life easier the past few months, but it took me some time to learn. This being said, stuff happens, and if you find yourself being late, just look frazzled, then take a seat and relax or (particularly if it's a professor you know is a stiffer for lateness OR says something at that moment)say ""sorry I'm late"". If the professor asks why: ""I had to speak with my adviser, I had to stay behind my last class, I didn't plan my time well""

, OK, so you don't always know when you need help. Clearly you're an adult, and you will be declaring independence. But you can get and figure out so many things by asking others for help. This is general, but is meant to be. I mean asking for help in such cases (to list just a few) as: when you need directions, when you're feeling depressed (more on that later), when you forgot what the assignments were for class, when you need help in writing or grammar, when you need to borrow something.

, Can you guess where this is going? Procrastination. If you are a procrastinator, the best thing to get on an assignment or project is to start it. That's all. It's about leaning in...Then, keep going (either the same day or over some time). But starting is almost always the icebreaker. You can apply ""just do it"" to anything you want or need to do.

Join a club or two.,
Join an intramural or club sports team.,
Get a job.,
Take an elective.,
Don't be too cool for Facebook.,
Volunteer.,
Consider rushing a fraternity or a sorority.",How to Make Friends in College1," This is the easiest and most effective way to meet new people with similar interests. Don't be afraid of going by yourself. That is the only way you can get to know people in a personal level, especially in these huge universities. Smaller colleges and community colleges may not have as many clubs, but if they do, they are related mainly to a technical program. During the first weeks everyone is going by themselves. If you are joining late, just remember that most groups will be very happy to show you around. You could try a group relating to your interests, or a totally random club.


Check your college website, Facebook profiles, and flyers around the school for when clubs meet and what clubs you can join. You can start your own club too.
Most colleges have a club fair on the second or third week of school. Don't be ""too cool"" to check this out. You'll get a sense of what type of people are in each club just by talking to the representatives at each booth.;
, Sports are a great way to meet new people because you all have a common goal. If you don't like the stress of intercollegiate sports, you can go into inter-murals. You spend a lot of time together practicing and it helps develop teamwork. Most of the time your team does turn into family. If you are not athletic, try going into something like theatre or music.


If you were obsessed with your high school tennis team and have joined a club team, you won't have the same level of commitment and team work. Still, you can meet some great friends this way.

, Often, finding a position as a tour guide or a clerk in the bookstore will allow you to form common bonds with your coworkers which could reward you with new friendships, and a little spending money. You can do it outside the college too.


Pick a job where a lot of students or people your age are likely to work. If you work at a day care center, you won't meet as many friends as you would at a high-school tutoring center.

, Electives (especially the ones that are lab based) are a great way to make new friends. If you are interested in music, try taking band or choir, or some music production course. If you have a passion for art, take an art class. If you are interested in athletics, take a bowling or weightlifting class. If you really like health care, take a psychology or biology course. But don't overdo it and try to keep your classes related to your major.


You can also pick classes that are more socially-oriented. Classes with a lot of discussion and group work, along with coursework that requires interacting with new people may help. That include communication, sociology, psychology, political science, etc.

, This is not the time to be original. If you're not on Facebook, the people you meet are much less likely to remember you, to stay connected with you, and to invite you to their events. With the modern era of the Internet, when you are sitting on here finding out how to make friends in college, add some people in your college or your community -- after you've met them, that is. Join campus groups on Facebook with common interests and you can meet some new friends that way.


Being reasonably active on Facebook after you've made a bunch of new Facebook friends will keep you on their radar. Just don't spend more than 15-30 minutes a day on Facebook or you'll be missing out on the time you can spend socializing in the real world.

, Volunteering at a local soup kitchen or animal shelter, or even at your college, is a great way to meet new people or make friends. It will also look great on your resume and will help you get a job. Volunteering through Circle K or another volunteer organization on campus will make you even more likely to make friends.

, Joining Greek life is definitely not for everybody, but don't knock it until you try it. On some college campuses, Greek life is a major part of the social scene, and you can be missing out on a major opportunity to make lifelong friends just because you're skeptical of the rush process. On other campuses, Greek life only makes up a small minority of student activities -- still, it could be a fantastic way to make friends.


Greek rush is about meeting people that you click with, which is basically like speed friend-dating. If you get the wrong vibe from a sorority, no one will force you to join it.
Even if you don't end up landing in the sorority or fraternity of your dreams, you can make a lot of great friends through the rushing process.

Pick out the style of paddle you’d like to use.,
Decide what theme you want to go with for your paddle.,
Personalize it.,
Do some research.,
Brainstorm on paper.,
Get your necessary tools.,
Pick out your accessories.,
Paint it.,
Plan it out.,
Glue everything in place.,
Writing the message.,
Delivering your paddle.",How to Make a Paddle for a Greek Sorority," There are many different shapes of wooden paddles you can find at your local craft store.;
, The paddle you’ll be making is most likely for your big sister. Think about what she likes. Brainstorming with these questions should help you decide what you will want her paddle to look like.

Does she like paisley or chevron?
Does she like flowers or jewels?
What are her favorite colors?

, The paddle should be personalized to your big sister, but also your sorority.  Commonly, a paddle will have the greek letters of your sorority on it somewhere.  It is important to give recognition to the sorority that brought you and your big sister together. 


Also, you should add “little"" followed by your name and “big"" followed by their name so it's personalized to the bond between you and your big sister.

,  If you’re not very creative it is okay.  You can browse through a website like Pinterest and look at examples of other paddles people have made for their big sisters.  Do not get discouraged by doing this because some paddles can be extremely intricate and almost like a work of art. 

Also, make sure you do not exactly copy a paddle you see online. You want the paddle to appeal to your big sister and also be meaningful to her. No matter what, your big sister will love it because she knows you spent the time to make her one.

, Making a paddle takes a lot of beforehand planning. Once you’ve completed the previous steps, draw out what you think you want the paddle to look like. 


Make notes on what color, what embellishments you’ll need, and the placement of where you’ll be putting everything on your paddle. This will be extremely helpful when getting to the craft store so you do not get overwhelmed by the never ending aisles of glitter, paint, and flowers.

, You will need some basic tools when making your paddle.  These things can be found at your local craft store.

Exacto knife
Glue gun
Paint brushes
Big garbage bag to set your workstation up on to make sure you do not make a mess on your floor or carpet.

, Do this after you have figured out exactly what you want from brainstorming questions, after doing some research from step three, and after completing your drawn out rough draft of your paddle from step five. All of your paint, embellishments, and other accessories you have planned to use can be found at your local craft store. Again, do not get overwhelmed at the craft store!  If you find something you weren’t thinking of buying, but now want, buy it and return it later if you do not end up using it.

, The first step in making your paddle is to paint it.  You may be staining it, painting it, or decorating the paddle in some way, but this step should be done first. Painting is most common. The best paint to use for a paddle is acrylic paint. If you are not sure what paint is what, ask a worker at the craft store when picking it out. They are usually very helpful.


Make sure you paint your paddle with at least two coats so it is uniform throughout.  Also, make sure it has plenty of time to dry before starting to decorate it with any of your embellishments.

, Place all of your jewels, flowers, and other embellishments in the places you have them written out on your drawn out plan. This way you can see if you like where things are or move them around if you do not.


When laying things out try to keep a symmetry within the paddle. Do not just haphazardly place a mess of jewels and flowers on to your paddle.  Make a corner filled with different color of flowers and fill the corner diagonal to it with the same layout of colored flowers to create symmetry.  Line the outside of your paddle with your jewels.  Commonly they’re outlined with pearls or diamonds, but it is up to you.

, Gluing everything down takes a lot patience since you will most likely have many different pieces. Make sure to glue down the things touching the paddle first.  Glue from the bottom to the surface. After gluing, make sure to remove all the extra strings of glue that a hot glue gun leaves around.

, The most significant part of the paddle is the written message you should include on the back for your big. It should be a thank you to them for helping you through your new member period and telling them how much you appreciate them. This is by far the most meaningful and memorable part of the paddle you will be making for your big sister.

, Wrapping a paddle can be difficult so it's better to find a big bag and some tissue paper. The paddle should be given to your big sister after your initiation ceremony. It is a thank you to her for getting you ready for initiation and helping you officially become a member of your sorority.

Go to events.,
Talk to people.,
Don't do your homework in your dorm room or apartment.,
Go to parties.,
Check out events in your town.,
Take advantage of any previous acquaintances.,
Be approachable.",How to Make Friends in College2," There's nothing like a good football game to build camaraderie. If football isn't your thing, there are usually poetry readings, concerts, art shows, dances, contests, or other events around campus. Asking people about local events is a useful conversation starter. But hey, if football isn't your thing and you go to Ohio State or University of Michigan, you should probably go to a game or two to see what the hubbub is about. It's not just about the game -- it's about the social experience.


Go to something completely fun or ridiculous, like a magic show or a belly-dancing contest. Step out of your comfort zone and see who you'll meet in the process.

, You can't make many new friends while sitting in a dark corner of the library unless there are other people just like you sitting in the dark corner of the library. Ask people who take classes with you questions about the material covered. Even if you don't have a question, classwork is a great icebreaker. Other great conversation starters are upcoming events and holidays/vacations, sports, food, music, etc.


When you talk to a new person, remember his or her name. Use it the next time you meet, and the person will be impressed.
State the obvious too. Usually when you are eating, you talk about food and if you hear music, you automatically talk about music.
When you meet someone new, tell them one thing to remember you by. You're the girl who is a triplet, or who has a pet snake. Make them remember you.

, Most dorms have a lounge or common area where you can work instead. When you must be in your dorm for studying, leave the door open. Try to put a TV on or some music to attract more people into your dorm. If you're an outdoors person, go outside to work. While you may not enjoy the same level of privacy, people will approach you in time.


Try studying on other parts of campus, too. The campus has many common areas where you can study and congregate.

, These will be scary at first (loud music, drunk seniors, etc.), but eventually, you will find your groove. College is about having a good time (as well as getting your degree) so have some fun! If you are not the type to go to the hardcore parties, a school or community dance might help too. You can also have small quiet parties if you are not into these big frat parties such as having a movie night, slumber party, or sports party.


Just stay safe and go with a group. In the first few weeks of school, people travel in packs of people usually from their dorm rooms. Try not to get separated from them too much -- keep a buddy system going with one friend, at least.
Embrace the theme. If a party has a theme, dress up. Don't be a stick in the mud.

, Most students get completely wrapped up in their college campus and forget to check in with the outside world from time to time. If you're at a smaller school, you can meet people off campus and in the community. Check out events like movies, the mall, bowling, festivals, fairs, local shows and concerts, and even go shopping at bit. This is a great way to meet people of all ages, not just college students.

, Maybe you're going to college with a girl you knew from math class, or with your second cousin's best friend. Treat these people as valuable resources, even if you don't have so much in common. This will make it easier and your acquaintances will more likely have friends that are like you. You can hang out with your old buddies from high school, but be sure to make sure you get out of your nest and meet new people too.


And you never know -- your old acquaintance can turn in to a best friend.

, Part of being social is making it easy for people to walk up and start a conversation with you. Try to look available instead of furiously tapping into your iPhone or walking to your class so quickly that you can't stop and smell the (conversational) roses. Be nice to other people, open doors for people, help them with their homework. These small things will help you a long way.


Really, just taking the time to smile at people you don't know will make them much more likely to go up and talk to you.

"
"
Try to make friends before school starts.,
Start socializing immediately.,
Ditch the long-distance relationship.,
Branch out from your roommates if you don't really click.,
Find a friend who is even more social than you.,
Don't humiliate yourself too much.,
Don't give up.",How to Make Friends in College3," Some colleges offer a variety of activities before fall classes start. This could be a week-long trip spent volunteering in the area, or a camping trip where you and your future classmates would form bonds that could last forever. Your school may also have local incoming freshman meet-ups in your area in the spring before school starts; go to these with a big smile on your face. Though this kind of thing may sound corny, or like doing more work before school, it will definitely pay off when it comes to making friends.


You may not meet your new best friend at these events, but you're likely to meet a few people that you can hang out with who will make you feel less afraid of socializing. And the more people you know, the more likely you are to meet someone you really like.

, When you get to college, everyone will be incredibly friendly, eager to shake your hand and ask for your number, and to talk openly about their high school experience and college plans. This is absolutely a fact: for the first few weeks of school. If you spend those first few weeks being homesick, calling your best friend, or generally engaging antisocial behavior, you will miss your chance to randomly introduce yourself to people in the cafeteria, in your class, or in your dorm.


If you wait too long, people will start listening to their iPods, drifting into their set groups of friends, and closing their doors to new people. This may sound harsh, but that's the way it goes.
When you meet a new person, don't be afraid to ask for his or her number, whether it's a potential friend or love interest. In the beginning, this is completely socially acceptable and won't come off as creepy.
When you meet new people, it's also a good idea to make plans with them. Say, ""Hey, are you going to that party tonight?"" or ""Are you checking out the a cappella show too?"" Finding something cool to do will make people more likely to agree to hang out.

, Though about 1 in 1,000 college long-distance relationships have proven to last, it's just not worth it for you to keep up this charade. You're only 18, or 22 at most, and you should spend this time meeting new people, exploring your options, and spending your time outside your dorm room -- not on the phone with your boyfriend who is all the way up in Michigan, planning your fourth visit of the month. Nothing will isolate you from your potential friends or make you feel lonely faster.


You don't have to meet the love of your life in your college -- heck, you probably won't -- but closing yourself off before you begin the search is guaranteed to make you more antisocial.
If you really are devoted to your long-distance relationship, make sure to keep your phone conversations relatively brief and to plan as few visits during the first few months of college as possible.

, Sure, your roommate seems kind of normal and is pretty nice. Does that mean you should spend the next four years glued to this person? Probably not. Your roommate is a great person to hang out with for the first few weeks of school, and who can help you meet some new people. But if you just have the sense that you're not friend soul mates, stop using your roommate as a crutch.


You don't have to ditch your roommate completely. Just be prepared to go out and do your own thing instead of following him around.
Sometimes, it's better if you and your roommate have a friendly, but not too close relationship. This can help avoid future awkwardness if you start having issues about living together.

, Your college will be filled with an endless variety of people. Some of them will be shy, and others will be about as shy as Justin Bieber. You should find a balance of friends, of course, but you should pick out at least one person, or even a few people, who have really great social skills, are excited to meet knew people, and are always up to something exciting.


This will maximize your chances of meeting as many people as possible -- and of finding the few people who really matter to you.

, Though college is all about making mistakes and bad decisions and living to regret them, you should try to avoid making a spectacle of yourself -- too much. Have some fun, get crazy, and dance wildly with your friends, but don't be the girl who pukes in the shower or hooks up with three guys on the first night of college. Unfortunately, you will be remembered for your mistakes, not for all of your great qualities.


Don't be afraid of stepping out of your comfort zone and trying new things; but do be wary of developing a bad reputation early on.
Having sex in college may be glamorized in the movies, but it will have many costs to your success in college, such as the possibility of STDs that could be deadly or getting someone pregnant when you are not ready. If you do, make sure you are well protected and try to do it at your own risk.

, Freshman year is a major change and many people flip out and give up. Many freshman still haven't left their nest and the transition from being with close friends, siblings, or with their parents to a new environment might be difficult. This usually happen with students that go to college that is far away from home. Don't let this happen to you. It may take an entire year before you really start meeting people. Some college students who are not in sports, music or theatre, or in some technical program don't meet people really well until sophomore and even junior year!


Realize that once you have a major targeted (or are in a technical program or trade) and are done with your general classes, you'll find several people who have a similar schedule.
This eases the friend-making process tenfold. If you are taking generals, try to have a path too in your major so you can easily meet people with common goals and interests.

Therefore, it's important to talk to people and ask questions about what you should expect from university. There are multiple ways you can do this:

Ask friends, parents, or older siblings about their university experiences
If your university has a social Facebook group, join the group and ask questions to the upper-year members
Ask questions and read experiences from fellow students on forums and websites like Reddit
Read blogs about university, and try to find ones that are about your university specifically;
, You shouldn't trick yourself into believing that university is one big party, that you'll befriend everyone you meet, and that the classes will be easy. If you have unrealistic expectations about university and end up being disappointed, it is much more likely that you'll drop out later on. Therefore, it's important to have positive but realistic expectations about what your experience will be like. Here are some ways to do that:

Take a campus tour. Walk around campus, visit lecture halls, and take a peek in the dorm rooms so that you know what to expect when first year starts.
Sit in on a lecture. If your university has big lectures, sit in on one to get a better idea of what to expect from a lecture.

,

Many students find the transition between school and university challenging because of the changes in teaching and course specifications.. In university, students are expected to learn more independently, and are not reminded about projects and tests multiple times like they were in high school. To prepare yourself for this major change, try to practice learning independently as much as you can before university by creating study schedules, getting head-starts on projects long before they're due, and studying before your teacher reminds you about an upcoming test. This should help you be less stressed during the transition. , One of the biggest transitions in university is getting used to living by yourself and away from family and friends. This newfound need to be self-reliant can be a big source of stress for students. . If you've lived by yourself before, this transition should be much simpler. However, if you don't have experience living alone, try to prepare before university starts by doing some common household tasks independently in order to practice being self-reliant. For example:

Cook your own meals
Do your own laundry
Clean your room and bathroom
Go grocery shopping by yourself

, The more confident and optimistic you are, the more successfully you'll adjust to university.. Staying optimistic about the transition to university can help reduce the impact of stressors, and it can also help you cope better.. Rather than going into the situation convinced that you won't make friends, that you'll be homesick all the time, and that you'll fail a class, try your best to think positively. You will experience some challenges in your transition, but staying optimistic will help you to actively manage those challenges.

, A key factor leading to a successful transition is being socially integrated. One way to ensure you meet many new people early on is to join a sports team or society - from reggae club to lacrosse, immersing yourself in the vast amount of clubs on campus is valuable in creating a social support network that many use to cope with stress.In addition to meeting people through clubs and sports, make sure to talk to the people in the hallways of your dorm, or the ones who sit beside you in class. You never know which one of them might become a close friend!, You will be much more independent at university and that means you will have to find the incentive to work without anyone asking you to, otherwise coursework and deadlines will pile up. Some form of motivation is vital in order to adjust and succeed in your courses,so figure out what motivates you, whether it's getting good grades so you can get a scholarship, making yourself and your family proud, or just the goal of earning your degree., Although being motivated and having a goal is good, without a routine it will be difficult to accomplish your goals. It's important to be self-disciplined and to establish a routine in order to help with your time management and your workload. Establishing a routine that allows for a good work-life balance can take some time, but it's worth doing as it will reduce your stress in the long term and is associated with better grades. Take some time in the first week of school to sit down and create a schedule of your days every week, planning out time you're in class, time you'll be studying, and your free time.

, Make full use of all the available support your university offers - don't wait until you're struggling to look for help. If you have a disability, this is even more important - many campuses offer academic support in order to create a learning environment that will work for you. Aside from academic support, there are also resources for emotional support, such as counselling services, peer groups, and support sessions on time managing and coping with problems. Students without these resources are more stressed during their transition,, so make sure to use them whenever you feel like you need to., If you are lucky enough to have a close friend or family near your university, be reassured this should aid your transition hugely. For many students, having someone important to them nearby, or even a few familiar faces around, was enough to ease their nerves at the beginning. If you don't have friends or loved ones nearby, you may find yourself feeling lonely at the start of your university experience, so keep in touch with friends and family in order to reduce your homesickness and receive support. You can do this by:

Talking on the phone
Texting
Using social media to send messages and connect
Writing letters back and forth
Video-chatting
Having your loved ones visit your dorm or have a meal with you

, Having a coping mechanism that works for you is key to keeping stress levels down during your transition. It may take a while to find one that works for you, so try out a few different ones, such as:


Breathing exercises
Yoga or meditation
Talking to friends and family
Spending time with friends and other support networks
Doing a hobby you enjoy
Spending time outside
Taking a break from school-related work to let yourself relax

"
"
Make friends!,
Join them.,
Turn the tables on them.,
Remain friendly with the jokers; it will confuse them, as if you're being tricky (which you are).,
Try to get away from the situation, if it's too crazy.,
Never take one upmanship or teasing personally or too seriously.,
If it is a more stressful situation, take a few deep breaths, counting up to ten then back down.,
If you feel like the situation is way to tense to handle inside the building, exit the apartment building and go outside.,
Say I have to go, but don't tell why or where.,
Discuss your problems with your landlord, resident advisor (RA), counselor, school nurse, dean or school psychologist, if you have chronic problems.,
Do other stress management techniques such as breathing, yoga, visualization, etc.

,
If you suspect the stress might be causing (caused by) some personality difficulty (shyness or bragging), disability or illness, make an appointment with your doctor or psychologist or go talk to your college disability services to get some modifications or advice.

",How to Manage Stress in a Fraternity/Sorority," Don't put on airs/or be sarcastic or bitter. Be calm and pleasant. ""Get the run of the place!"" Instead of running from them: Say,""Good one! You know how to do it up right!"";
, Laugh a little! Say,""That's is why I l-o-v-e you guys! All this f-u-n!""



Don't act bad or mad at their practical jokes or cut-downs. (Also, laugh at yourself when you make a mistake.)

,
Ask, ""Who are we doing/joking next?"" ""Whose turn is it?"" Say,""Let's plan something! I have some real good ideas!"" (Then drop it. Don't get creepy, by blaming the wrong person! Act unaffected!)


Ask, ""What can we do for good-clean fun -- but nothing nasty!""


, Avoid threats of destruction or harm -- making it worse. Do not make veiled threats, such as: ""I don't get mad; I get even!"" or ""Turnabout is fair-play!"" or ""Paybacks are heck!"" Or, then they may do stuff and blame all of their tricks on you, if you make threats against everybody...

, If you live in an apartment, go to your bedroom and listen to inspiring music, get absorbed in a TV show, use the extra energy to exercise or play video games to wind down.


Do not go on Facebook or Myspace, unless you are just listening to music, playing games, or watching videos. Often fights and disputes can be continued on social networking sites.

, Sometimes your re-acting/acting-out, showing anger or displaying hurt feelings will just be fun/and a challenge.


Don't give an excuse to your roommates to stir it up even more.

, Get some fresh air; go take a walk down the halls, or up and down stairways to cool off.

, It may be calming to sit in/or drive your car or run, jog or walk off that energy.


If you are in the dorms, exit your dorm. There are usually some activities and a reading/study area, a music listening room, TV viewing room, pool, bowling, game-room/pool tables and a snack bar in the campus student center.

, Enjoy studying or browsing in the college library (find a place out of easy view), upstairs, in the math section or some place they won't go.

, They may consider an apartment or roommate change or reevaluation if needed.

Don’t overburden yourself.,
Create a visual weekly schedule.,
Keep track of important dates and deadlines.,
Block out time for study.,
Prioritize your study time appropriately.,
Block out time for fun and socializing.",How to Manage College Life1," A normal college course load can be difficult to manage on its own. If you have work or family obligations, it can feel pretty overwhelming. Don’t sign up for more classes in a term than you know you can manage.


If you have a job or obligations at home, consider signing up for a part-time or online college program instead of a traditional full-time program.
Talk to your academic advisor about creating a manageable schedule that fulfills your program’s requirements for each semester or quarter.
If you’re feeling overwhelmed, don’t be afraid to drop classes that aren’t working out for you. You will probably get a chance to sign up for that class again at a later date.;
, This should be a one-page sheet that shows what a normal week will look like during the semester or quarter, so you will have a quick reference until you get used to your class schedule.


Use a page from a pre-made weekly planner, or make your own. Create a grid on paper, or use a program like MS Word to create a table with columns for each day of the week and rows for each hour of the day.
Fill in the appropriate blocks of time for each of your classes. This will help you keep track of your class schedule and visualize the time that you have available for doing other things during the week.

, Look over the syllabus for each of your classes and make note of assignment deadlines, test days, and other important dates. Write these dates down in a planner, or use a program like Google Calendar if you prefer.

, Once you’ve figured out your basic schedule, set aside a certain amount of time each day for study. Ideally, you should be spending about two hours of study time for each hour spent in class., It can be tempting to get relatively fun and easy tasks out of the way first, but it’s generally best to focus on your most difficult and time-consuming assignments first. Take a few minutes to assess your assignments each week, and decide which assignments are most urgent and which will take up the most time. Make those your first priority.

, Taking time for things other than classes and study is extremely important. Relaxing and having fun are vital to your mental health, and can actually make you more productive.Schedule your fun and social time the same way you would your classes and other obligations. For example, you might set aside an hour each night for hanging out with your friends over dinner, with a clearly defined start and end time. This will help you maintain a structured and well-balanced routine."

Eating well will help you feel more energetic and better able to handle your classes and other responsibilities.Don’t skip breakfast. Even if only have time to grab a little fruit and a bagel or piece of toast before heading to class, eating breakfast is vital for giving you the energy and focus you need to feel well and succeed in your classes.
Eat plenty of fruits, vegetables, and calcium-rich foods to help you stay energetic, keep your body strong, and help you feel energetic.
Keep snacks with you. Healthy snacks can boost your energy and focus while you’re studying or even sitting in class. Try pretzels, nuts, fresh or dried fruit, or whole grain crackers.

, A lot of people have trouble remembering to drink enough water during the day, and it can be even harder for a busy student. Try bringing a bottle of water with you to class.

, Depending on your individual metabolism, a cup of coffee now and then or an occasional drink with your friends is probably okay. However, always use moderation and common sense, and get advice from a doctor if you are worried about your caffeine or alcohol habits. Excessive caffeine or alcohol intake can interfere with your sleep, cause dehydration, and contribute to other health problems.

, It can be tempting to stay up late studying or having fun, but most people need 7-8 hours of sleep a night to be at their best.


Utilize daylight for study as much as possible so that you have evenings for relaxation and rest. Pulling an all-nighter before a big test can ultimately be counterproductive.Try to get into a regular sleep routine. Set aside a little time before going to bed each night to unwind away from your computer or phone.

, If your living space is too noisy or distracting, find a place that is quiet and conducive to study. You might find a corner of your campus library or a spot in a study hall that works for you.


Well-lit environments work well for study. Having enough light can help you concentrate and feel more energetic.Listening to music can help you study, but make sure you select music that helps you concentrate instead of creating a distraction. Try music with nature sounds or instrumental classical music.Some people benefit from studying in groups, while others find it distracting. Experiment with meeting with classmates for study sessions and see if it works well for you.

, Studying so long that you become fatigued is counter-productive. If you start to get sleepy or restless, take a break to walk around for a few minutes, have a snack, or even put your head down for a catnap.

, Even if you don’t have time to go to the campus gym, set aside a few hours each week or a few minutes every night to go for a brisk walk or do a little stretching. Getting occasional physical activity can help you feel more energized during the day and sleep better at night.

, In addition to studying and working towards your academic goals, college is an opportunity to have fun, make friends, and discover new interests. Find out if your school has any clubs or student organizations that match up with your interests. Take time to work on creative projects, play games, or just hang out.

Serve.",How to Make a Giant Kit Kat Bar," Before you get your paws on the chocolate, you’ll need to prep your work area and giant bar receptacle.


Cut out the Kit Kat logo from the floor tile. If you don’t want to freehand it, obtain an image online, print and trace it onto the floor tile.
Stick the logo to the bottom of your trough, but place it in reverse so that the name appears correctly on top of the bar.;
, This can be a sticky job, so go with a chocolate melting method that works best for you. Suggestions are:


Double boiler (bain marie). Either use an actual double boiler or create one at home. Using two pans, fill one pan halfway with water. Place the second pan on top––you should have a small amount of space between the pans so steam can seep out. Place chocolate in the top pan and simmer on low until the chocolate is melted. Stir often to ensure that the chocolate melts evenly and doesn't burn.
Microwave. Place broken chocolate chunks in a microwave-safe bowl. Place the uncovered bowl in the microwave and cook for approximately 30 seconds to one minute. Remove the bowl and stir. Place the bowl back in the microwave and cook for another 30 seconds to one minute. Repeat this step until the chocolate is smooth and creamy.

, Use a rubber spatula to smooth the chocolate, ensuring that it is evenly distributed throughout the trough. Let the chocolate set for several hours (overnight is the best).

, Break wafers into small squares or along the intuitive “break” lines and completely fill the bottom.


Build wafers to the top of the trough. You should have approximately five to six layers, filling the entire trough by the time you are finished.

,


Pour the chocolate so that it distributes evenly over the giant bar. Ensure that chocolate seeps down each side so that you have a fully encased chocolate bar.

, If the bar does not fit in a flat position in your refrigerator, wait until the chocolate has hardened and then place it in a slightly slanted position. Do not place unhardened chocolate on a slanted surface (in the fridge) or it will end up sliding out of the mold.

,


Invert the mold on the wax paper and gently tap the top of the mold to loosen the bar. Continue tapping until the mold can be lifted from the wax paper while leaving the chocolate behind.
Transfer the bar from the mold to your wax paper. Have a friend help by standing on one end and with you on the other to avoid breaking the chocolate when trying to free it from the mold.

, The best way to serve this is to set it out on a large plate or tray. Invite everyone to ""help themselves"" but do provide a knife or two in case they experience problems trying to break off pieces!

Tin foil may be used, but it will be extremely difficult to remove from the platter and you may end up with pieces on your plate - or a broken plate from trying too hard to remove foil bits!

",How to Make a Green Candy Buffet," There are lots of container possibilities but the most important factor is ensuring that the containers will show off the green candies inside. As such, clear glass or plastic containers are an optimal choice, along with containers that lift up the candies and show them to their best advantage.


Try bowls, glasses, sundae glasses, jars (including Mason jars), vases, dishes and platters. Tall stemmed glasses with wide brims can be especially effective, such as those used for cocktails.
Tins and other opaque objects can also be used provided it is obvious to the guest as to what is inside.;
, The best implements are scoops and mini tongs, which will allow guests to collect a few candies at a time without being tempted to use their fingers. Maintaining the hygiene when many people are sharing the buffet is essential!


Provide small plates, bowls, baskets or other containers for guests to scoop their candies into.

, This is definitely the fun part! Once you are set to looking for only green hues of candy, you'll start seeing them everywhere. Some ideas include:


Green jelly beans and green gummy bears and other gel candies
Green wrappers on any kind of candy
Green wrapped chocolates and green chocolate; green Easter eggs if it's around Easter season
Green lollipops, suckers and any other candy on a stick
Green boxes of candies––the candies inside don't necessarily need to be green if the packaging is green, as it will simply look great on the buffet table
Green candy sticks, green rock candy
Green licorice
Green marzipan figures
Green mints
Green toffees, caramels
Green taffy.

, Consider using a green tablecloth for covering. If this is too much though, use white as it's a forgiving background for all-one-color themes. Plan out how you will arrange the containers on the buffet table, along with scoops, tongs and serving plates, etc. Some suggestions include:


Keep the larger items to the back and the smaller ones to the front
Provide green napkins (serviettes) for sticky fingers
Avoid having the tablecloth touch the ground or get in the way of the guests; with many people milling around the table, there is a risk of it all being pulled down

Encourage guests to help themselves by making it obvious where the plates and scoops are
Consider having an area for sweet food that meets the needs of diabetics, vegans, gluten-intolerant, etc. guests so that they don't feel left out. Leave a small sign denoting the ingredients or stating that they are ""gluten-free""/""dairy-free"", etc., items.

, Green macaroons, green whoopie pies, green cupcakes, etc., will all help to create the green theme and add to the overall sweetness.

, To complete the green theme, dress the table up with a few inedible green decorations as well. Some suggestions include:


Green ribbons around jars and other containers
Green bows on the tablecloth
Green figurines, such as a little leprechaun or a tree
Green floral arrangement (use lots of leaves and flowers which naturally have green tinges)
Green beads, glass pebbles, rolled up yarn, etc. inside a glass jar with a tight lid screwed or even glued on (you don't want people mistaking these for candies).

,, This will make two pieces in the shapes of triangles. Both can be turned into cones, the second one only needs to be made up if the first one starts to sag during use.

, Staple together. If you're really clever, you can actually avoid stapling it by tucking the tail of the cone into the side seam. If you're not certain how to do that, stay safe and use the staples.

,, Fold down again to close.

, Be careful, as the chocolate will start oozing out as soon as the hole is created.


How large the opening is made will determine how much chocolate drizzles out, which will affect the thickness of the lines and shapes drizzled.

, Keep the pointed end over the item to be drizzled on and squeeze gently. Work your way gradually over the item and drizzle away.

",How to Make a Candy Lei2," The candy that works best for this method are candies that are wrapped in cellophane, with the ends twisted shut. Great examples include Werthers, Jolly Ranchers, and saltwater taffy.

, You can use just one color or lots of colors. If this is for a graduation ceremony, you could even use the school's colors. You will need one piece of ribbon for each candy., Place a piece of ribbon behind the wrapper, right between the candy and the twisted part. Make sure that the ribbon is centered, then pull the ends of the ribbon towards you and tie it into a tight, double-knot.

, Don't worry if the ribbon pieces look too long. You can always cut them down later.

, The color of the ribbon does not matter, because it will be covered by candy in the end. It might be a good idea to use a color that matches your candy, however, in case there are any gaps., Alternate the sides you tie the candy onto, and gently scrunch the candy together every so often. This will give you an extra-full lei.Leave about 2 inches (5.08 centimeters) at each end of the ribbon so that you can tie it together. How full your lei turns out depends on how much candy you add.


Consider tying a knot at the end of your 2-inch (5.08-centimeter) wide ribbon to keep the candy from sliding down while you work.

, Be sure to use a tight, double-knot, and that there are no gaps between the knot and the candy.

, You can leave the curling ribbon as they are, or you can trim them down. You can also curl them slightly by running them between your thumb and a pair of scissors.

Firstly, buy some fruits from the market.,
Open the packet of sugar and pour at least a quarter of the packet into a bowl.,
Add at least 1 teaspoon of syrup to the mixture(sugar).,
Then, put the bowl of sugar and syrup into the oven.,
Use a blender and mix all the fruits together until they have all turned into juice.,
When the timer of the oven has gone off, take the bowl of sugar out with a protective hand-wear and when it is starting to harden, quickly mold it into a shape of a pot.,
Leave the sugar until it has turn into solid again.,
When it has fully hardened, take the mixture of fruits from the fridge and pour it into the cups or pots.,
Wait for one day as it takes time for the mixture to harden and then you may take it out.",How to Make a Fruit Sugar Cup," Do not buy too much as you have to make it into a 'candy'. Choose any type of fruit, whether citrus or berries, but make sure that they are good combinations and they match. If you put tomatoes in the candy, it would obviously spoil the taste so try something that is sweet with another sweet object. You might think of putting bananas but in this recipe, you aren't allowed to use any 'dry' fruit. You will need juicy fruits for this recipe.


Choose the fresh fruits. Not those old soft ones. Usually the fresh ones are more crunchy and juicy which would be absolutely fabulous in this recipe.
One of the combinations could be: Passion fruit, Orange, Strawberries and Apples. The combination is all juicy and they match as they are all sweet with sourness.;
, Make sure that the bowl is big enough to fill that amount of sugar so nothing falls out.


Using a bigger bowl for this recipe would be better because you have to 'mix' it, so the bigger the space; nothing would fall out.
If anything does fall out, clean the mess up as sugar is a 'destination' for ants so be careful.
Only use white sugar; if you use brown sugar, your candy would be brown in color.
The bowl should be made out of ceramic, if not, use any bowl that would be allowed to be placed into the oven.

, Make sure you use the appropriate type of teaspoon as the original one is holding at least 5 ml.


If you have teaspoons stuck to a chain, it should tell which one is the actual teaspoon. Do not get mixed up the the halves or the other ones.
Adding syrup would make the mixture more nourish so it doesn't get too dry even though if syrup is actually the liquid form of sugar.
Syrup is the liquid form of sugar but syrup is slightly more expensive than sugar.

, Make sure it is enough heat to make the sugar dissolve. Watch the oven or set a timer so a fire would not start.


This step is dangerous. Make sure you stay in the kitchen to do the next step.

, There still may be skin left-overs but you can take them out when you have place them into another bowl. After you are finished, place it in the fridge with a cling wrap covering it, not the freezer.


To take all the 'solid' parts out, just tip your bowl into another bowl but not too much so all of the mixture would go out and use a spoon to trap the solid parts from escaping from the 1st bowl. If you look in the 2nd bowl, it is the liquid. There still may be a few parts but it doesn't matter.

, Usually they should be 3 centimeter (1.2 in) wide and 3 centimeter (1.2 in) long but you don't have to be too precise but just make sure it is not too big.


This process may be very sticky. Only mold the sugar when it is starting to harden so it feels like gum. If you actually mold the syrup when it is still hot, you would notice that the pot would just fall apart.

, While waiting, you can use the comic for reading purposes.


This is optional.

, Not too much so it doesn't overflow. Leave the pots into a stable place in the freezer so nothing would make it fall over.


This time, you are using a freezer, not a fridge now.

, As simple as that, you have your 'Fruit Sugar Cup!' Enjoy!


It may be hard to eat it so let it out for a few minutes then gobble it up with laughter.

Choose a container for your candy bouquet.,
Stock up on a good supply of candy.,
Use a glue gun to secure a chunk of Styrofoam to fit tightly in the bottom of the container.,
Wrap a wooden skewer with green floral tape and stick it in the center of a Styrofoam ball.,
Use floral pins to attach the wrapped candy to the Styrofoam ball.,
Pin silk leaves between a few of the candies.,
Camouflage the top of the container with shredded paper or dried sphagnum moss.",How to Make a Candy Bouquet1," Be creative and personalize the container to fit the person you're making the bouquet for. A sand pail makes a great container for a child's bouquet. Use a parfait cup, coffee cup, or a soup mug for a friend, co-worker or teacher; a vintage tin for an antique collector; a small tackle box for an angler; a clay or plastic flower pot for a gardener or a popcorn bucket for a movie buff.;
, Choose candy that you or the giftee loves, as well as candy that looks visually appealing and stands out. You should stock up on a variety of wrapped candies such as bubble gum, small candy bars, toffees, or chocolate kisses. Any securely wrapped candy will work.Choose colors appropriate for the occasion, such as bright primary colors for a young child, pink and blue for a baby shower, gold or silver for an anniversary, black and orange for Halloween, red and white for Valentine's Day, green and white for St. Patrick's day or red and green for Christmas.

, Trace the bottom of the container onto the chunk of Styrofoam and then cut out the shape you've made and glue it to the bottom of the container, putting glue on the sides and the bottom of the shape. Wait a few minutes for the Styrofoam to dry completely before you put the candy in -- unless you'd also like to glue the candy to the sides of the container., You can also use a thick popsicle stick instead of a skewer. Anything that is long and thick enough to hold up the candy will do. Insert the skewer into the center of the Styrofoam base, securing the skewer with a dab of glue. Put a small amount of glue on the other end of the skewer, then poke the glued end into the center of a Styrofoam ball.


Use a Styrofoam ball appropriate for the size of your container. As a general rule, a ball the size of a tennis ball or baseball works well for most arrangements.
You can also wrap the Styrofoam ball with green tape or paint it green, for an added effect.

, Pin one or both ends of each wrapped candy. Continue pinning the candy to the ball one at a time until it is completely covered with wrapped candies. When you've done this, you can also stick the skewer into the Styrofoam at the bottom of the container.

, Alternatively, use small bows and loops tied from narrow, ¼-inch ribbon. Pick any design that would make the candy bouquet look even more festive and visually appealing.

, This will make the bouquet look more finished and will hide the Styrofoam bottom. You can also stick a few candy canes or pieces of candy appropriate to the occasion into the bottom of the basket. Finish your candy bouquet by tying a big, colorful bow around the container.

Use a glue gun to glue boxes of candy around each edge of a Styrofoam block.,
Glue at least 6-8 candy bars to popsicle sticks.,
Stick the popsicle sticks into the top of the Styrofoam block.,
Glue tissue paper around the edge of the block.",How to Make a Candy Bouquet2," Get a Styrofoam block that is about the size of a brick and glue a box of candy around each of its four sides. Put the glue on the block and then stick the boxes to the glue. Using boxes of candy like Hot Tamales or the boxed M&Ms or Sno-Caps you can find at the movies are perfect for covering the Styrofoam block. Turn the box sideways, so the long way is facing up, and make sure that the top and bottom do not have candy bars glued to them., Glue a variety of candy bars, like Snickers, Hershey's, Crunch bars, or Butterfingers, to popsicle sticks so that about 2 inches (5 cm) of the popsicle stick is glued to the candy bar.

, Once the glue on the Styrofoam block has dried, you can stick the popsicle sticks into the top of the block so that the candy bars are evenly spaced.

, Glue some tissue paper around the top edge of the block so that all of the Styrofoam is covered and the candy block has a more bouquet-like feel.

Glue a Styrofoam bottom into a large mug.,
Bake a tray of cookies on popsicle sticks.,
Stick the popsicle sticks with cookies on them into the Styrofoam at the bottom of the mug.,
Fill the mug with candy and brown tissue paper.",How to Make a Candy Bouquet3," Pick a mug that is festive for the occasion, whether it's around Christmas, Thanksgiving, or Valentine's Day. Trace the bottom of the mug over a piece of thick Styrofoam and cut the Styrofoam and place it snugly into the bottom of the mug. You can even try to glue the Styrofoam into the bottom of the mug, but then you -- or the person you're giving it to -- won't be able to use it once all the candy is eaten., Make the dough for chocolate chip, gingerbread, oatmeal raisin, or any other cookies that you like. Before you put them into the oven, cut a small hole in the bottom of the cookies and insert a wooden popsicle stick in each one. It's a good idea to bake a few extra cookies in case some of them break or don't stay on the popsicle stick. Give the cookies at least 10-15 minutes to cool off and harden before you try placing them in the bouquet.

, Spread the cookies out evenly so they stick out neatly above the mug. They can stick out at different angles and heights, as long as the bouquet looks visually appealing.

, Place wrapped candy that goes well with the cookies, such as Reese's peanut butter cups or individually-wrapped Milky Ways, into the bottom of the mug, and place some brown tissue paper on top to cover the candy and Styrofoam.

Hide your candy in layers.,
Make your candy hard to get to.,
Hide your candy in different spots.,
Don't hide your candy in places that get warm.,
Skip the obvious hiding places.",How to Hide Candy in Your Room1," The longer it takes to get to your candy, the harder it will be to find. For example, your sock drawer may not be a good idea. All someone has to do is open up the drawer and see the candy. A better idea would be inside one of your socks. This way, whoever opens up your sock drawer won't be able to see your candy right away—they will have to dig through your socks first.;
, Similar to hiding your candy in layers, the longer it takes to get to your candy, the less likely someone will find it. Great places include under your clothes in a drawer, far under your bed, in a box at the very top of your shelf, and so forth.

, The saying ""don't put all of your eggs into one basket"" exists for a reason. If you hide all of your candy in one spot, and someone finds it, you might end up with no candy. Try to hide your candy in at least two different places.


Don't hide your candy too close together. For example, if you have some candy tucked away into your socks in one drawer, don't hide the rest of your candy in the next drawer.

, This includes next to windows, near heaters, or close to lights. The reason for this is simple: candy melts if it gets hot. A good hiding place won't be of much use to you if you can't eat the candy later on. Not to mention, melted candy can create a mess, and messes attract attention.

, Lockers, safes, and piggy banks are all popular hiding places—and this means that they are obvious hiding places. Shoe boxes that say ""TOP SECRET"" or ""KEEP OUT"" are also bad choices, because they draw attention and curiosity. Your friends and siblings would be more likely to go through these boxes.

Try using what you have at home.,
Hide your candy in the bottom of a tissue box.,
Try hiding your candy inside your pillowcase.,
Hide candy inside your clothes.,
Keep the candy in a small box on top of your bookshelf.,
Hide candy inside magazine folders.,
Camouflage the candy.",How to Hide Candy in Your Room2," You don't have to make a secret cubby to hide your candy. You can use what you have in your room, such as a sock drawer or tissue box. This section will give you a few ideas on where you can hide candy in your room.

, Find a tissue box, then carefully lift out the entire stack of tissues. Place your candy in a thin layer along the bottom, then place the stack of tissues back. Pull out the first tissue—this will make it look like the tissues are ""in use.""

, This only works for a short while, and you have to take the candy out before you go to sleep. Keep the candy on the bottom of the pillow case—the side that is touching the mattress. If you put it in the top, the candy will make lumps, and give your secret away.

, Find a shirt that you never use, and hide the candy in it. Place the shirt neatly back in your drawer. It would be best to use a shirt that you don't wear often. For example, if it is summer, hide your candy in a winter shirt or a sweater. If it is winter, hide the candy in one of your summer shirts.


Another great hiding spot is inside of a pair of socks.
Coat pockets make great hiding places too!

, Push the box towards the back of the shelf, against the wall. This will keep the box out of sight.

, It would be best to use folders that you are currently using. That way, the folders will look like they are only being used for magazines.

, Candy and toys are both brightly-colored. If you have a bin where you keep lots of small, plastic toys, you can hide some small, brightly-colored candies in the bottom of that bin. The bright colors of your toys will help camouflage the bright colors of the candy.

Throw the wrappers away outside your room.,
Don't brag.,
Act natural.,
Don't draw attention to your candy stash.,
Don't hide your candy in places that other people go through often.,
Rotate your hiding places.",How to Hide Candy in Your Room3," If you have a trashcan in your room, don't throw the wrappers away in that. If someone sees candy wrappers in your trashcan, they will suspect that you are hiding candy in your room. Instead, throw the candy away in the kitchen trash.


If you want to be extra-stealthy, throw the wrappers away at school.

, If you brag about hiding candy in your room, someone may go looking for it. If you have any siblings, it might be a good idea to keep your candy stash secret from them. If they get mad at you, they may tell on you. They may also get careless, and accidentally give your secret away.

, Don't get nervous, especially if someone is close to one of your hiding spots. For example, if someone opens the sock drawer where you hid your candy, don't scream ""Don't open that!"" or ""Don't look in there!"" This will tell the other person that you are hiding something, and they will get suspicious and look through your sock drawer.

, People tend to look where other people are looking. If someone is with you in your room, and you keep looking at your secret stash, the other person may get curious. They may even try to look wherever you are looking and find your candy.

, For example, if someone does your laundry for you, don't hide your candy in your dresser, wardrobe, or closet. Another example would be a toy bin or a bookshelf that both you and a sibling use.

, The longer something sits in one place, the more likely someone will find it sooner or later. If you plan on hiding the candy in your room, plan on changing the hiding places at least once a week. If there are lots of people going through your room, you might even want to change the hiding places every day.

Cut the spines out.,
Glue the cardboard to the side of your box.,
Fill your box with candy, then slide it between two books on your bookshelf.",How to Hide Candy in Your Room4," A shoe box might be a little too big, but those cardboard boxes that snacks and granola bars would be perfect. You can also use a small, wooden box instead., You can choose any types of books you want, but it might be a good idea to use books that you might find on your shelf. For example, if you have a lot of new books, a set of dusty, leather-bound books might look out of place.


You can also stack some of your own books together, then photocopy their spines.

, Measure your box first and write that number down. Open up your picture in an image-editing program. Change the canvas size until the width matches up with the number you wrote down.

, Try to get good-quality print out. You can use plain, old printer paper for this.

, Find a sheet of thin cardboard—an old cereal box would work great for this. Next, cover the cardboard with a thin layer of glue. It might be a good idea to paint the glue on with a paintbrush. If you use too much glue, your paper will get soggy.


If you are using a cereal box, cut out the front or back first, then put the glue on the cardboard side. The image size will be on the back from now on.

, Use your fingers or the edge of a ruler to smooth it out. Wait for the glue to dry before you move on., The picture you printed out will probably have a white background, or the background of a bookshelf. For this project, you want just the spines and no background. Use a pair of scissors to cut your image out of the cardboard. Follow the top edges of the spines as best as your can.If you are very careful, you can also use a craft knife. Be sure to work on top of a cutting mat, and to cut away from yourself.

, Cover the side of your box with a thin layer of glue first. Next, place the cardboard cutout on top of the glue. Make sure that bottom and side edges of your cardboard cutout match up with the bottom and side edges of your box., This cubby not only acts as a storage for your secret candy stash, but it also doubles-up as a nifty bookend!

Use a grater.,
Use a safe surface to grate on, to prevent slipping.,
Run the chocolate over the grater.,
If you don't have a microplane, try using a peeler.,
Save yourself a little effort and purchase a chocolate mill.",How to Finely Shave Chocolate," Purchase a very fine grater; the best sort is a ""microplane"" that is specifically made for grating chocolate. You can find these at stores selling chocolate making supplies, as well as at good kitchenware stores.


It is important to look for a blade that is stainless steel, with tiny razor-sharp holes.
Check that it is comfortable to hold.;
, A silicone mat, wooden board or plastic board are ideal work surfaces.

, The sharp holes will do the work easily and reduce the chocolate to fine shavings.


Be careful when holding the chocolate against the grater. As your fingers get closer to the grater when the chocolate thins, keep them away from the sharp holes and don't try to grate the last thin pieces or you might catch your fingers too.

, A peeler won't create fine shavings; these will be more like ""medium"" shavings. Simply hold the chocolate firmly in place on a non-slip surface and peel down the edge of the chocolate. The shavings will start to peel off.

, This is a nifty invention that allows you to put chocolate chunks or chips into a mill and simply turn the crank for fine flakes.Look for one made from stainless steel and that is easy to take apart and clean.

Kitchen foil or metallic wrapping paper can provide a sense of richness, akin to the chocolates wrapped up in commercial boxes.
Small cupcake/sweet cases used for truffles or chocolates are another possibility.;
, This can made into a fun necklace for children's prizes, gifts or charity sales items.

, Line the container with foil or paper sweet cases and arrange the sweets into the container or box.

, If you're good at making origami, place individual truffles or substantial sweets inside an origami box or design. Line the base with foil to prevent stains weeping through the paper.

Opt for bitter, dark chocolate.,
Check for unhealthy ingredients.,
Avoid highly processed chocolate.,
Eat small portions.",How to Enjoy the Health Benefits of Chocolate1," As a rule of thumb: the darker the chocolate, the healthier it is. This is because dark chocolate contains a higher percentage of cocoa, which is where the health benefits of chocolate come from. Further, a higher percentage of cocoa means less of the unhealthy ingredients that are often included in low-cocoa chocolate bars.Look for a dark chocolate that is at least 70% cocoa. Chocolate with this percentage of cocoa is usually considered bitter-sweet.
The higher the percentage of cocoa, the more bitter the chocolate will be.
You can also purchase 100% cocoa nibs, though they are especially bitter and not usually eaten on their own.;
, Chocolate bars with a lower percentage of cocoa often include larger amounts of unhealthy ingredients. Milk and refined sugar are the most common, while some chocolate candies also include high-fructose corn syrup.In general, avoid eating chocolate candy bars with long lists of ingredients.

, Cocoa is often extensively processed in order to reduce the bitter flavor it yields in its raw form. Unfortunately, this processing also removes the flavanols. In short, different types of processing, including fermentation, alkalizing, and roasting all reduce the health benefits offered by cocoa.Note that most commercial chocolates are heavily processed. Even many dark chocolate bars are made with cocoa that has been highly processed, and will not offer as many health benefits as bars made with raw cocoa.
Often, local, artisan chocolate makers are the best place to find the healthiest chocolate.
If you’re at the store, opt for an organic, fair-trade dark chocolate.

, The good news: it’s true that eating chocolate with a high percentage of cocoa can bolster your vascular health. The bad news: it’s not healthy to eat the sort of chocolate foods that contains a lot of sugar and fat, including milk chocolate and most chocolate foods generally.As a rule of thumb, keep portions of chocolate to a few small bites.

Get 100% raw cocoa.,
Select raw cocoa with higher fat content.,
Toss roasted cocoa nibs into a salad.,
Infuse cocoa into a cream sauce.,
Include cocoa powder in a savory spice rub.",How to Enjoy the Health Benefits of Chocolate2," Pure and simple: cocoa is the source of the health benefits in chocolate. In fact, raw cocoa helps your body absorb dangerous free radicals more than any other food.Raw cocoa comes in powder or nib form, and can be consumed in various ways, including rich savory dishes.


If purchasing cocoa powder, make sure is it unsweetened, and that the only ingredient is cocoa. Often, products labeled “ground chocolate” or “drinking chocolate” will include other less healthy ingredients.
Note that 100% cocoa bars are not sweetened, and are sold for baking purposes.
You should be able to find raw cocoa at health food stores or online.
Go with organic, fair-trade options whenever possible.

, The fat in raw cocoa is not from milk or other added ingredients — it’s from the bean itself. While cocoa with the highest fat content is often more expensive, it is also healthy, more flavorful, and more satisfying than cheaper options., Raw cocoa nibs are the least-processed edible form of cocoa. You can get them raw or roasted. They taste extremely bitter, and are comparable in flavor to coffee beans. Roasted nibs are great in salads, as they add a crunchy, nutty element.Roasted cocoa nibs are especially good with bitter greens, as well as fennel, olives, and dry cheese such as Parmesan.
Dress a salad that includes cocoa nibs with a balsamic or red-wine vinaigrette.

, Cream sauces with cocoa and other spices can provide a rich, warm accompaniment to vegetable and/or meat dishes. For instance, try a cream sauce with 1 cup of coconut milk, 1 teaspoon of crushed black peppercorn, and 1 tablespoon of crushed cocoa nibs. Gently simmer it all together for 10 minutes in a small saucepan and strain the cream before serving.This particular sauce goes well with veggies, including carrots, sweet potatoes and butternut squash.
For example, roast cubed butternut squash seasoned with coconut oil and cumin seeds in the oven for about 15 minutes at 400°F (204°C). Top with the cocoa cream sauce.

, Spice rubs can be used in all sorts of meats and other dishes. For a particularly flavorful option, mix 1 teaspoon of cocoa powder with 1 tablespoon of smoked paprika and 1 teaspoon each of oregano, marjoram, brown sugar, and salt. This rub will go especially well on a rich red meat, such as lean beef or buffalo."

For instance, add cocoa powder to your morning oatmeal, or to a bowl of fresh fruit. Be creative: anything that a bitter chocolate flavor might add to is fair game.A cup of frozen banana slices with cocoa powder sprinkled on top is not only healthy, it will satisfy a sweet tooth immediately. Blend these two ingredients together for a healthy ice cream alternative.
Apples, pears, and strawberries, as well as all sorts of nut butters all taste great with cocoa powder too. Have a few of these ingredients together with one or two tablespoons of cocoa powder in a smoothie.

, Use only 100% raw cocoa powder, milk or nut milk, and a small amount of your favorite sweetener. Feel free to adjust the ratio of milk to powder, but keep the amount of sweetener low. Agave syrup is a good option for a jolt of relatively healthy sweetness., Another way to eat fruit (or anything you might want to dunk in chocolate) with cocoa is by making a chocolate dip similar to fondue. Simply mix raw cocoa powder with brown rice syrup until the desired consistently is achieved.You can use molasses instead of brown rice syrup if you’d prefer.

, For healthy double chocolate cookies, gather a cup of creamy peanut butter, ⅔ cup of coconut sugar, ½ teaspoon of vanilla extract, 4 tablespoons of unsweetened cocoa powder, 1 teaspoon of baking soda, one egg, and ½ cup of dark chocolate chips (at least 70% cocoa).Beat the peanut butter, coconut sugar, and vanilla extract together.
In a separate bowl, mix the cocoa powder and baking soda. Include a pinch of salt unless the peanut butter is salted.
Blend the two mixtures together, beat in the egg, and stir in the dark chocolate chips.
Form balls of dough and press them onto a greased cookie sheet.
Bake at 350°F (177°C) for 6 – 8 minutes. Watch carefully, as coconut sugar burns easily.
Let the cookies cool before enjoying, or enjoy them warm and crumbly.

, There are a plethora of “raw” cookie and brownie recipes online that will satisfy your craving for a chocolate baked good. Whatever your dietary preferences, these recipes will generally be healthier than other baked good recipes, in part because they employ more cocoa and avoid dairy and refined sweeteners.To assist your search, look for vegan or paleo recipes that use raw cocoa nibs or powder.

, To try your hand at a high-calorie but otherwise healthy chocolate fudge recipe, gather the following: ½ cup each of coconut oil, raw cocoa powder, and maple syrup, and 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract.Blend the ingredients together until the mixture is extremely smooth.
While transferring to a bowl, add ½ cup of dried fruit or nuts if you wish.
Spread the fudge into a baking pan lined with parchment paper. Place the pan in the freezer until the fudge is solid to the touch.
Cut the fudge into whatever shapes you desire and enjoy.

Serve amaranth instead of rice.,
Use amaranth instead of couscous, risotto or orzo in pasta dishes.,
Make amaranth instead of oatmeal.,
Add amaranth to soups or chili.,
Make amaranth pudding.,
Use amaranth to make cookies.,
Substitute a portion of regular flour or whole wheat flour with amaranth flour.,
Make gluten free baked goods.,
Add whole amaranth for flavor and texture.,
Pop amaranth into a crunchy snack.,
Add course ground amaranth to smoothies.,
Finished.

",How to Use Amaranth,"


Use 2.5 to 3 cups of water to 1 cup of amaranth.
Simmer it in a covered pan for approximately 20 minutes.
All the water should absorb and the grains should be fluffy when finished.
You can also toast the amaranth in butter and add some of it into a rice pilaf with rice and other grains.;
, Amaranth works well because the texture and size are not far off from these pastas or grains. You will want to use slightly less water to cook the amaranth to help it retain its structure.


Make whole grain rolls with amaranth. Amaranth is a nice addition to whole grain breads. It can either be used whole or as flour.

Using it whole, it will add texture and nuttiness to the bread.
If using the flour, you can substitute 5% to 30% of the regular flour with amaranth flour, and the only other change you need to make to the recipe would be a slight increase in water.
It also works well as gluten free flour. When making gluten free rolls, you will need to substitute all the regular flour for amaranth flour, increase the water and add xanthan gum and a starch to help the bread bake correctly.



,


Amaranth can be simmered in juice for a sweet flavor.
Add nuts, spices and fruit for a healthy and sweet breakfast.

, Amaranth flour can be added to thicken up soups or cooked amaranth can be added for flavor and texture.

, This is just like rice pudding. You can follow a rice pudding recipe and just substitute the amaranth for rice.

,


Amaranth seeds add a nice crunch to cookies.
The flour can also be used to make gluten free cookies. You only need to substitute the amaranth flour for regular flour when making a gluten free cookie. This will affect the flavor and give a slightly dryer cookie. To help counter these effects, try adding applesauce to your cookie recipe. The applesauce will add some flavor and retain moisture.

, By substituting no more than 30% of the flour with amaranth you can still follow most recipes, with the exception being the amount of water. You may need more water when using amaranth flour because it absorbs more liquid than regular flour.

, Going gluten free in baking requires more changes to recipes because you need a way to build air structure in bread without gluten. The way this is overcome is by using xanthan gum and a starch. When making cookies or baked goods that don’t require much air cell structure, you may be able to substitute 100% of the flour.

, You can toast the seeds before you use it or just add them raw to many bread and cookie recipes. Toasted amaranth seeds go well in items like biscotti because they add flavor and crunch.

, Amaranth will pop easily and creates nice “puffs” that can be eaten alone or added to a snack mix.


To pop the amaranth, add 1 to 2 tablespoons of amaranth to a very hot skillet.
Stir the seeds continuously until they pop and while they are popping.
Once most of the seeds have popped, quickly remove them from the pan to avoid burning them.
Try drizzling honey and cinnamon on popped amaranth for a sweet snack.

, This will boost the nutritional value of the smoothie while giving it a thicker texture and nutty flavor.

Use vegetables to replace breads or wraps.,
Swap in vegetables for pizza crust.,
Make rice out of vegetables.,
Use vegetables as pasta.,
Bake with nut or bean flours.,
Use vegetables in place of chips or crackers.,
Try spaghetti squash marinara.,
Make a cold cucumber noodle salad.,
Make cauliflower rice.,
Bring a Mediterranean kale wrap for lunch.,
Decide what ""moderation"" is for you.,
Stick to appropriate portion sizes.,
Go for 100% whole grains.",How to Substitute Vegetables for Grains," If you normally pack a sandwich or pick up a wrap as a meal, it can be hard to think of ways to have a ""sandwich"" without the bread; however, there are a variety of vegetables that you can use instead.


An easy swap for bread or wraps are lettuce leaves. Many types of lettuces are cup-shaped or have large leaves which makes them great for rolling up sandwich fillings.
Choose lettuces like butter lettuce cups, iceberg lettuce, cabbage leaves, collard green leaves, kale or Swiss chard. These lettuces are big and will hold a decent amount of fillings without ripping or the items falling out.
In addition to a lettuce wrap, you can also make opened faced sandwiches with vegetables like grilled portobello mushrooms or sliced and baked sweet potatoes.Once cooked, you can top your mushroom or sweet potato slice with your favorite sandwich toppings and serve. Use a fork and knife for this type of sandwich.;
, Another item you can use vegetables in is for pizza crust. You can skip the carb and calorie heavy flour-based crust and use a vegetable instead.Just like with open faced sandwiches, you can also use grilled or roasted portobello mushrooms as a pizza crust. Fill with a little tomato sauce and top with cheese or other toppings, like broccoli and onion.
If you want a more crust like pizza, try using cauliflower. Once grated and cooked, you can mold the cauliflower into a flat circle and top with sauce and cheese.

, If you normally have a side of rice with your dinner, consider using grated vegetables instead. It's a great way to decrease your carbohydrate intake.


One very popular swap for rice is cauliflower. By swapping in this low-calorie vegetable, you save yourself about 150 calories per serving.Use a food processor to grate and finely chop the cauliflower. It should be similar in size to rice or couscous. You can use this in any recipe that calls for rice.
Another vegetable that you can use as a substitute for rice are parsnips. These look like white carrots, but when grated and finely chopped also serve as a great rice substitute.

, If you love a big bowl of pasta or a cold pasta salad, you'd be happy to know there are plenty of vegetables that can be substituted in place of noodles and macaroni.One great tool to help you make a variety of vegetables into a spaghetti or linguine shape is a spiralizer. There are a variety of variations of this tool, but they all help turn veggies (or fruits) into spaghetti.
Great vegetables to try in your spiralizer are butternut squash, sweet potatoes, zucchini, yellow squash, beets, or cucumbers.
These noodles can be quickly boiled or steamed or eaten raw depending on what the recipe calls for.
If you like a baked pasta dish like lasagna, try using eggplant, red peppers, zucchini or yellow squash in place of the noodles. Slice length-wise into long, thin planks and layer with sauce and cheese.
Another option is to make your own gnocchi with either sweet potatoes or pumpkin. There's little to no flour in these and they're full of a nutrient-dense squash.

, Outside of items like rice, pasta and bread, there are foods that use grain-based flours. Whether it's cakes, cookies or muffins, many foods contain flour.


Baked goods and pastries can still be enjoyed if you're following a low- or no-grain diet. Substitute regular wheat flour for nut or bean flours.Many different nuts and beans can be ground into a fine flour-like consistency. You can use them in a variety of baked goods. You can try: almond flour, cashew meal, garbanzo bean flour and fava bean flour.
The proportions of other ingredients may change when you use these types of flours. Make sure you follow a recipe to help get the end product turn out correctly.
You can also use coconut flour, though this is fairly high in calories.

, If you enjoy having crackers or chips as snacks, you can use vegetables as a swap for these flour based treats. Make your own using vegetables at home.


Many types of chips and crackers usually contain some sort of flour which makes them a grain-based food.
If you like crunchy, salty chips, trying make chips from kale. Washed, dried and baked in the oven, kale becomes crispy and light.
You can also use raw vegetables in place of chips and crackers. This is especially good when you have a dip like hummus or ranch dip. Both are great with raw vegetables.
If you want a more chip-like consistency, use starchy root vegetables instead. Thinly sliced, vegetables like beets, sweet potatoes, parsnips and carrots turn into crispy chips when baked in the oven.

, A great option to try if you love spaghetti and meatballs is using spaghetti squash instead. This vegetable, when cooked, shreds into spaghetti-like strands and makes the perfect pasta replacementTo cook a spaghetti squash, carefully slice the squash in half lengthwise. Drizzle with a little olive oil, salt and pepper. Place the squash cut side down on a baking sheet and roast at 400°F (204.4°C) for about 40 minutes or until fork tender.
Allow the squash to cool to room temperature. Once cool, use a fork to shred the flesh of the squash. It should come out easily and naturally fall into little spaghetti strands.
Toss the cooked squash with warmed marinara sauce. Serve with your favorite meatballs and a sprinkle of Parmesan cheese.

, If you enjoy those cold soba noodle salads with peanut dressing, you'd be surprised at how well cucumbers do in this salad. Spiralized into spaghetti shape, they make this salad delicious.


Start by washing and drying a cucumber. English or hot house cucumbers are the best as their skin is tender and the seeds are small.
Spiralize the entire cucumber and slice ""noodles"" into manageable pieces — about 6 –10 inches (15 – 25 cm) in length.
Place the ""noodles"" in a bowl and toss with your favorite peanut sauce or dressing. Stir to combine.
Add in 2 cups of diced chicken, 1 cup of steamed broccoli florets, 1/2 cup of thinly sliced red peppers, 1 cup of steamed snap peas and 1/2 cup of diced green onions.
Toss everything to combine. Place in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes to chill thoroughly. Once chilled, serve and enjoy.

, If you love rice, you might want to try making cauliflower rice instead. It's very low-calorie and low-carb and very easy to make.To start, roughly chop up a whole head of cauliflower. Leave only the florets and discard the woody, tough stems.
Put half of the cauliflower in a food processor. Pulse until the cauliflower breaks down into couscous or rice sized pieces. Set aside and process the remaining cauliflower.
To cook your cauliflower rice, add in a tablespoon of olive oil to a large skillet. Heat over medium high and add the cauliflower. Cook for five to eight minutes or until tender.
You can also use your cauliflower rice raw if you'd like. This is a great idea if you want to do a cold salad.

, If you enjoy having a sandwich or wrap for lunch, consider swapping out the bread for a big piece of leafy kale. It's high in vitamins and minerals and makes a great sub for a wrapStart by washing and drying a large kale leaf. If it has a thick, woody stem, take a paring knife and carefully remove it. This won't taste good in your wrap.
Spread on about a 1/4 cup of your favorite hummus topped with 1/4 of a sliced avocado.
Top with 2 tablespoons of feta cheese and a 1/4 cup of thinly sliced roasted red peppers.
Drizzle on your favorite salad dressing if desired (like a balsamic vinaigrette). Wrap up the fillings tightly and slice your wrap in half. Enjoy!

, Even if a diet you're following suggests avoiding all grains, having these foods occasionally is still appropriate. You don't have to avoid these foods in order to have a balanced or nutritious diet.


If you eat large quantities of grains, eat them on a regular basis or choose items that are highly refined, this isn't a overly healthy choice.
However, having grains (even refined grains) in moderation is appropriate and healthy, as they provide energy and nutrients. If you want to include some grain-based foods every now and again, decide what your definition of moderation will be.
For example, will you only have grains one or two times a week? Or will you have one serving per day?
Stick to your definition of moderation to keep these foods in check and make sure you don't overdo it.

, One thing that is very important to do (with any food) is to measure the appropriate portion. This will help you stick to eating a moderate amount of grains.


When you plan to have a serving of grains, make sure to measure the portion size. This will help keep the total calories and carbohydrates in check.
Even if you choose a whole grain or a dish that is very nutritious, eating too much of it can cost you too many calories or carbohydrates.
For grains, measure out 1 oz or 1/2 cup. If you're having rice or pasta, measure the food after it's been cooked., In addition to eating grains on occasion and making sure the portion sizes are appropriate, it's also a good idea to choose the most nutritious type of grain.


If you're going to splurge and have some bread, rice, pasta or another baked good, choose a nutritious option. That way, you're at least getting some nutritional benefits when you eat it.
The most nutritious types of grains are 100% whole grains. These are minimally processed and contain all parts of the grain (the bran, germ and endosperm).These are high in fiber and other beneficial nutrients.
Refined grains are much more processed and the nutrient containing parts of the grain — the bran and germ — are removed during processing.
Stick to 100% whole grains only. Try items like: brown rice, quinoa, whole wheat bread, whole wheat pasta, barley, millet or farro.

Mix puffed quinoa into cookie dough.",How to Puff Quinoa," All quinoa naturally produces bitter substances called saponins. Most companies treat the quinoa to remove most of the saponins before they reach the store, but there may still be a faint biter taste.Rinsing will remove this, but you'll have to wait at least half an hour for the seeds to dry.


If you decide not to rinse, skip down to the puffing instructions.;
, Place the quinoa in a bowl. Fill it with cold water. If the quinoa still contains saponins, foam will form on the surface.

, Empty the bowl into a fine mesh strainer. Hold it under cold running water to remove the foam.

, Return the quinoa to a bowl so you can watch for foam, then rinse again. The quinoa is ready once no more foam forms on the surface, and the seeds all remain in the bottom of the bowl., Set your oven to ""warm"" or to the lowest temperature setting. There's no need to wait for preheating — just continue to the next step.

, Spread out the wet quinoa on a dry baking tray. Check every ten minutes and stir to break up large clumps. Remove when completely dry. This usually takes thirty to sixty minutes.To further reduce the risk of burning, leave the oven door ajar.
You can move on to the stovetop before the quinoa is completely dry. You'll just have to wait for the moisture to evaporate before the quinoa pops, which can take 10–30 minutes., To prevent a quinoa avalanche, this pan should either have a lid or be at least six inches (15 cm) deep.Heat the pan over medium heat.

, Many people choose to pop their quinoa dry for health reasons. If you prefer a crisper puffed quinoa, cover the base of the pan with about 1 tbsp (15 mL) of oil. A neutral-flavored oil such as canola or safflower is a good choice.

, Add a sprinkle of dry quinoa to the pan. If the pan is hot enough, the quinoa should pop within a few seconds.Quinoa does not expand nearly as much as popcorn kernels, but it will turn brown, jump in the air, and release a nutty aroma.

, Once the pan is hot enough, pour in quinoa in a single layer on the base of the pan.

, Shake constantly to even out the temperature and prevent stuck, burnt seeds. Remove from heat once popping starts to slow, usually after one to five minutes.If you are using a pan with a lid, crack it a couple times to let steam escape. Do this on the side facing away from you to avoid steam and quinoa rocketing to your face.You can continue cooking to make the quinoa browner, nuttier, and crunchier, but the quinoa will burn easily after this point.

, As long as you don't smell burning, you can continue shaking the pan off heat for another minute or two. Pour the puffed quinoa onto a baking sheet to cool down once popping stops.

, Replace your popcorn with a bowlful of puffed quinoa, mixed with a little salt and pepper. Alternatively, add a dash of chile oil, or a sprinkle of your favorite dried herbs.

, You've just made a healthier version of puffed rice cereals. Eat it with milk or add it to homemade granola (before or after baking).

, Puffed quinoa adds a great crunchy texture to salads in place of nuts or croutons. It also works well with roasted or sautéed vegetables.

, Make protein-rich hiking snacks by combining puffed quinoa with nuts and other high-energy foods.

, Replace some of the oats in an oatmeal cookie, or add it to any cookie recipe for crunch and protein.

Serve.",How to Prepare Quinoa1," You can skip this step if you have purchased pre-rinsed quinoa in a box. To rinse, place the measured grain in a strainer under running water for a few minutes. This is necessary to remove the excess saponins on the outside of the grains which impart a bitter flavor to quinoa if not removed.;
, Drizzle a bit of olive oil in a pan over medium-high heat. Add the quinoa and cook for about 1 minute. This brings out quinoa's nutty flavor.

, Place two parts water or stock to one part of quinoa in a saucepan over medium-high heat and bring to a boil. Cover and reduce heat to low. Simmer the quinoa for about 15 minutes or until the grain becomes translucent and the white germ forms a visible spiral on the exterior of the quinoa grain.


Try to ensure there is an al dente bite to the germ, in the same way as pasta. Quinoa will continue cooking for a bit even after you take it off the heat.

, This will give it time to absorb any moisture that might still be in the pan.

, The quinoa should look light and fluffy, and you should be able to see the germ separating from the seed.

, Freshly cooked quinoa should be served immediately to retain nutritional value and a good flavor. Serve with:


Stir-fry, using the quinoa as a substitute for rice.
Curry.
Braised meat.
In a salad.
Virtually any other combination you can think of!

Eat quinoa on its own.,
Make a breakfast or lunch bowl with quinoa.,
Stuff vegetables with quinoa.,
Eat quinoa for breakfast.,
Make a pasta dish with quinoa.",How to Use Quinoa1," Quinoa is cooked over the stove and is usually ready in about 20 minutes. Quinoa has a mild, nutty flavor and can be eaten on its own with minimal flavoring as a snack or lunch. A bowl of quinoa is a little bland, but it can be a good option for a quick and filling meal.As quinoa does not have a lot of flavor, a bowl of quinoa can be a great meal if you're feeling a little queasy.;
, Add quinoa to a bowl and then mix in other ingredients and spices. Quinoa served in a bowl with a fried egg, veggies, a little cheese, and some hot sauce can be a great breakfast bowl. You can add any combination of foods and spices you want to a bowl of quinoa, due to its mild flavor, and have a great and quick meal for breakfast or lunch.If you're eating lunch on the go, a quinoa bowl is a great option. It is easy to pack a quinoa bowl in a Tupperware container the way you would pack a salad.

, There are many stuffed vegetable recipes, such as stuffed peppers, that require stuffing vegetables with things like beans, rice, or meats. You can substitute cooked quinoa in these recipes if you have quinoa you need to use. Quinoa can add extra fiber and nutrients to a meal, especially when used over heavier stuffings like ground beef., If you usually eat something like oatmeal for breakfast, try substituting quinoa instead. Add a bit of maple syrup to your quinoa and some nuts for a quick breakfast on the go.Leftover quinoa can also be used as a cereal. Add some quinoa to a bowl and mix in some fresh berries. Fill the bowl with milk for a quick, easy, and nutritious breakfast., Noodles do not have as many nutrients as quinoa and tend to have more calories. Try substituting quinoa for noodles in a pasta recipe. Instead of making spaghetti with noodles, for example, mix your sauce, meat, and cheese into a bowl of quinoa. You will still get the same basic flavor, but without the empty carbs."

Add quinoa to a salad.,
Stir quinoa into chili.,
Use quinoa instead of breadcrumbs.,
Use quinoa in a smoothie.",How to Use Quinoa2," If you're having a salad for lunch or dinner, mix a handful of leftover quinoa into your vegetables. This will add extra fiber and protein,making the meal more filling and nutritious.Nuts are frequently used to add protein to a salad. While nuts are nutritious, they are high calorie. If you're trying to cut back on calories, substitute quinoa for nuts in your salad.
As quinoa has a mild flavor, it blends well with a variety of different dressings and flavor profiles.

, A hearty chili is a great meal if you want something quick and easy to reheat. To add extra fiber and nutrients to a chili dish, mix in some quinoa during the last 15 minutes of cooking time. About two cups is enough for a full batch of chili.Remember, quinoa only has a mild flavor. You do not need to go overboard adding extra spices after throwing in your quinoa.

, For things like breaded chicken or pastas topped with breadcrumbs, breadcrumbs often add unnecessary extra calories without extra nutrients. Instead of breading chicken with breadcrumbs, bread it with cooked quinoa. You can still follow the recipe more or less the same, but swap out breadcrumbs for cooked quinoa., A smoothie can be a quick and healthy snack to have before or after a workout. However, smoothies are sometimes not filling. Adding extra protein to your smoothie can help you get full faster, so add some quinoa to your smoothie before blending it. Due to quinoa's mild flavor, it will not interfere with the existing ingredient's flavors."

Add quinoa to a quiche.,
Bake energy bars with quinoa.,
Fold quinoa into a cake batter.",How to Use Quinoa3," Quinoa can add extra protein and antioxidants to a quiche. For every eight eggs you add to a quiche, you can add one cup of cooked quinoa. The next time you're baking a quiche, try adding quinoa to add nutrients to the dish., Combine two cups of quinoa with a cup of whole wheat flour. Then, add any mix-ins you want such as dried fruits, chocolate chips, or seeds. Add two cups of oats, one egg, and a teaspoon of baking soda. Form the batter into bars and bake at 375 degrees Fahrenheit for 20 minutes. This will make great energy bars to eat as a nutritious snack throughout the day., If you want to add a little nutrition to cake, sprinkle some cooked quinoa into the batter and then mix it in. This will not interfere with your cake's flavor, but it will help slow down blood sugar spikes after eating a slice of cake.Keep in mind, a cake is not a healthy option even with the addition of quinoa. It is still high in sugar and should only be eaten as a treat.

Decide what you want to study.,
Gather your ideas.,
Decide on a structure.,
Commit to 15 minutes a day.,
Draft your personal statement.,
Add an introduction and conclusion.,
Condense your personal statement to fit within the requirements.,
Get someone else to give you some final help and guidance.,
Think you've finished?",How to Write a Personal Statement for UCAS," Decide what you want to study before you write your statement. 2/3's of a personal statement is usually related to your future degree, so it's vital that you are sure of what you want to study.


If you're struggling to decide, talk with your family and friends, as well as your teachers and tutor to confirm for ""you"" whether or not a certain degree is the right option of study. Go on plenty of open days and look at a range of subjects.;
, The following steps can be taken in any order. Starting a task with the most tricky aspect could discourage and demotivate you before you even start. You'll notice that your non-degree related issues are focused on first and then those which are specific to your degree. People are able to talk more freely about themselves, however ask the all important question ""Why are you choosing this degree"" and they could be lost for words. Remember everything in this section is rough workings, so unless you think of a fancy sentence, stick to brief notes.


Brainstorm using the 5 WS. Find a blank piece of paper and in the centre write subject title, branching out from this write: who, what, why, when, where, how as your starting point for ideas about your course. This approach will encourage you to think outside the box.
Find a blank piece of paper and jot down a whole list of activities and achievements you could tell your potential university. These are anything that's personal to you. Are you involved in a team sport? Were you selected as the most improved modern languages student during your GCSE studies? Everything and anything that makes you stand out from the crowd is worth writing in this preparation stage.
Go back to the degree you're considering studying. What is it that drew you to choosing this particular degree? Have you had any work experience related to this future study? Have you previous studied the subject at a lower level? It's these key aspects that will make your personal statement stand out, as everyone will have their own reasons for choosing a particular degree. These bits are still personal and you'll start to see how your personal statement breaks away from the mundane standard statement.


You should now have a list which details the following (use it as a check list):

Why you are applying for this certain degree, your reasons with backed-up ideas and experiences (e.g. reading around the subject)

Future career plans or ideas
Work experience
Previous studies; lessons, topics, fieldwork and projects
Prizes (e.g. Key Stage 3 Science prize)

Extra curricular activities
Hobbies and interests
Part-time job



, Everyone has their own writing style, and what you write in your personal statement will some what dictate the way your structure develops. The best way to structure a personal statement is to extensively plan and then see what structure forms, you will intuitively know how to structure it.


Try to plan around a three-paragraph structure. Using all the ideas you previous gathered, split them into the following categories:


One - The degree (Everything that relates to why you are choosing this particular degree and what you have done to confirm your choice, this may even include a childhood experience that relates to your subject - don't be afraid to think outside the box.)
Two - Work experience, career plans and prizes (Pretty self explanatory)
Three - Extra curricular activities, your hobbies, interests and part-time job (As above)

, If you spend 15 minutes each morning planning, then writing your personal statement you will get it done within a couple of weeks, without it getting in the way of your other work. Keep a diary with you, in which you can write any ideas that come to you during the day.

, Use all the ideas you have gathered and categorized to try to explain concisely each of the different aspects, highlighting if they relate to your degree choice, and the personal qualities you have gained from them, whether this be team building, or an improvement in your oral communication, think carefully about these qualities as they will sell your personal statement.

, With the main body of your personal statement drafted out, you need to start bringing it all together, tying it up with a snappy conclusion, without forgetting a quirky but interesting introduction.


These two parts need to be kept to a minimum as you will inevitably write more than your character limit.
If you're applying for a combined degree, your introduction should state what you are applying to do, and why you have chosen to study the two subjects together.
The final conclusion should be a brief summary of your reasoning behind choosing the degree, it's your one final chance to clinch the deal, and assure them you've put great time and effort into this decision.

, If your personal statement is already within the requirements, then skip to the next step. It has to be within the limit of 4000 characters or 47 lines, whichever is shortest. It's best to write your statement in a word processor before copying and pasting it into UCAS, because the form doesn't have a spell checker. Keep in mind that the word-processing programs tend to underestimate both the character and line counts, so you may find that it doesn't fit when you paste it in.


Be ruthless. Start working through your personal statement deciding if what has been written is relevant to your degree, or shows you to be special in any way.
Start rewording. You'll be amazed at how much you can reduce your personal statement by cutting out a lot of unnecessary language. The key to a successful personal statement is to be concise, the admissions tutor definitely doesn't want to read anything they don't have to.

, What you have in front of you is something you should be very proud of, especially since it's taken a great amount of time to construct.


Find a friend who knows you well to see if your personal statement is a true representation of yourself.
Get a family member who probably knows you even better, to suggest anything you may have missed out that is worth a mention within your personal statement.
Get a teacher or tutor (one who has some experience in deal with personal statements is always better) to check whether you have a good enough personal statement that will hopefully guarantee that offer from each of your university choices.

, Check back through these step to ensure you've covered everything!

Experiment with adding amaranth to various foods.",How to Pop Amaranth," Choose a deep-sided pot or pan to keep the seeds inside as much as possible. Set your burner to medium-high heat. Allow the pan to heat for three to five minutes.A small- to medium-sized stainless steel pot or pan will work.Opinion varies on whether nonstick cookware is beneficial for popping amaranth, so use what works best for you.;
, Add a drop of water to the skillet. Watch and listen to the pan. Heat the pan for longer, if necessary.When the pan is hot enough, a drop of water should immediately sizzle, “dance” and evaporate.Making sure the pot is hot enough is one of the most important steps to popping amaranth correctly., Cook one to two tablespoons of amaranth at a time. Pour the first batch into the skillet.Lower the heat to medium.The amaranth should be in a single layer, not piled up., Put a lid on the pan. Alternately, use a large plate or a metal, fine mesh strainer to deflect the popping seeds. Crack the lid away from your face if you use a cover to contain the amaranth.Amaranth seeds literally “pop” and some will fly up into the air when you heat them.
If you’re not concerned about cleaning up afterwards, you can omit using lid or other object to shield the popping amaranth.

, Shake the pot back and forth over the burner. Alternately, use a wooden spoon to stir the amaranth constantly, if you’re not using a lid.If you’re cooking by shaking the skillet: shake for a couple of seconds; hold the skillet still for a couple of seconds; repeat.If you notice a toasty smell, lift the pan from the burner and shake it.Constant shaking or stirring prevents the seeds from burning.

, Continue the shaking or stirring process until the amaranth is finished cooking. Pour the amaranth into a bowl or onto a rimmed baking sheet.Not all of the seeds will pop. When there is no more popping sound, the amaranth is finished cooking.It’s important to remove the seeds quickly, as soon as they stop popping, so that they don’t burn.

, Leave it in the bowl until it’s no longer warm. If you’re not eating it right away, place the cooled amaranth in a jar or sealed bag. Refrigerate it for up to a month., Sprinkle amaranth over diced fruit, like banana. Alternately, pour some popped amaranth over fresh berries. Add popped amaranth to a green salad to accompany your dinner., Combine amaranth with cereal toppings. Spoon over cold cereal with milk, or a hot cereal such as oatmeal. Add sweetness, if desired.Try a scoop of nut butter or roasted nuts over your cereal, topped with popped amaranth.
For sweetness, try cinnamon, honey, coconut, and/or dried fruit.

, Top yogurt or a smoothie with amaranth. Add it into your favorite granola recipe. Sprinkle amaranth on top of soup. Use your imagination!Amaranth can even be used as rice, or in flour.

Give yourself enough time.,

Create an outline of your personal statement.,
Write a strong introduction.,
Back up your statements with evidence.,

Tailor your statement to each school.,
Read your draft for grammar and spelling mistakes.,
Edit your draft so that it is clear and concise.,
Take time away from your statement.,
Ask two trusted people to review your essay.",How to Write a Personal Statement for Law School," One of the biggest mistakes that you can make with regards to your personal statement is not allowing yourself enough time to brainstorm, write, rewrite and edit. It is recommended that you allow yourself at least four to eight weeks to complete your personal statement.If you know that writing is particularly difficult for you, consider giving yourself 10 to 12 weeks to work on your statement.
Start the process as soon as possible so as to give yourself enough time to take a break from writing and editing. This break can give you a fresh perspective when you return to writing.;
, Ask yourself, “what are the three things that I would want the admissions committee to remember about me?” The personal statement may be your only opportunity for the admissions committee to know something about you as a person. It may help to write a list of characteristics that you like about yourself. Admissions committees want to see that you have the maturity and ability to assess yourself—your strengths and your weaknesses.When creating your list, consider the following:


Are you able to learn from your mistakes?
Are you willing to change your opinion based on evidence?
Are you willing to consider multiple points of view when making a decision?
Are you able to set goals based on your strengths and weaknesses?, Once you have chosen three things that you want the committee to remember about you, it is time to think about what part of your background, beliefs, or experiences best exemplify these three characteristics.


A common saying in writing application materials is “show, don’t tell.” This means that it is better to share a story that illustrates the characteristics that you want to convey rather than make a plain statement. For example, rather than stating “I believe I will be successful in law school and as an attorney because of my ability to persevere in the face of great odds,” consider sharing a story about how you did persevere in a specific instance., After brainstorming about how to illustrate the characteristics that you want to share with the committee, determine whether there is an overarching theme or topic that connects all of your stories. For example, do your stories show how you have had to overcome something difficult or a commitment to service. You want to find a way to unify your examples in a cohesive story or topic.

, Once you have an idea about what you want to write about yourself, you should take some time and read how other people conveyed their personal stories. You don’t want to mimic their story but rather consider how they crafted their personal story into a cohesive and interesting narrative. You can find statements from the University of Chicago here: http://www.law.uchicago.edu/alumni/magazine/spring11/intheirownwords

, Admissions committees are reading closely to get a sense of you as a person and judging your ability to write a well-organized and articulate essay. An outline provides a road map to guide you through your statement. It ensures that you include important information and that you are not duplicative. While there is no formula for writing a personal statement, consider including the following sections in your outline:


Write down a few ideas for your introduction. Your introductory paragraph is very important because it sets the tone for the rest of the draft. You may choose to write your introduction last once you see how all of the elements of your statement come together.
Sketch out how you plan to illustrate your chosen characteristics. You may use one story to highlight your characteristics or multiple stories connected by an overarching theme. Whatever you choose, spend some time organizing your thoughts and identifying all of the points that you want to make in your essay.
Include thoughts on your conclusion. A strong conclusion will tie your statement together but also leave your reader with something to think about. Your conclusion should only be a few sentences and should not rehash everything you have already written., Your introduction is incredibly important. It offers the opportunity to capture a reader’s attention and encourage them to read your statement closely. Consider the following when drafting your introduction:


Start with a personal story that illustrates your overall theme.
Do not start with a quotation, poetry, or a bland statement such as “ I believe I will be successful in law school because . . .”, Once you are writing the body of the statement, the beginning of each paragraph should also capture the reader’s attention. Any statements that you make should be supported by examples from your own life. For example, if you choose effective communication as your theme, show the ways that you have effectively communicated or how ineffective communication made you focus on this skill.

, When writing your statement, you should always write in your own voice. Don’t try to show an expansive vocabulary but rather write clearly, concisely and in a way that feels most natural to you., While it is a good idea to create a basic personal statement to work from, you should carefully read the instructions from each school to which you are applying and add or change your personal statement to meet their requirements. These requirements may include page limits or font size or different substantive questions to which you need to respond.


For examples of law school question prompts go to: http://hpplc.indiana.edu/documents/PersonalstatementsforlawschoolJune32013.pdf.
If a school does not include page limits, your statement should be between 2 to 4 pages., You should expect to have three to four drafts of your personal statement. Once you have a draft that you think is finished, you should do a close read of the statement for grammar and spelling mistakes. Do not rely solely on spell check.


There are numerous online grammar tools that you can reference if you have any questions. You can locate these tools be conducting an internet search for “grammar tools.”
You should read the statement out loud to yourself. Often, hearing the statement out loud will alert you to awkward phrasing or other issues.
Try to write in active voice. For a description of active versus passive voice visit: https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/539/02/.

, After correcting spelling and grammar mistakes, your second round of edits should focus on how your statement is written. You want your statement to be written clearly and concisely, which means if there is a way to say something in one words versus three words, you should choose one word., After you have edited your statement for mistakes and clarity, you should not review the statement for at least a few days. When you return to your statement, read through it again and make any necessary changes.

, You should never be the only person to review your personal statement before including it in your law school application. You should have at least two people review your statement and give you feedback on the content, as well as an grammar or spelling issues.


If your undergraduate school has a pre-law advisor, consider asking this person to review your statement.
You should also consider asking faculty mentors to review your statement.

Steady the machine.,
Load the machine with oats.,
Choose the setting.,
Turn the crank.,
Collect the oats.,
Use the rolled oats as desired.",How to Make Oats1," Attach the bottom of the roller to the edge of a kitchen counter or table using an appropriately sized vise clamp.Many oat rollers are sold with a matching clamp for this purpose. The clamp should hold the machine down as you grind the oats, making it easier to operate as a result.
This step is especially important when using a manual oat roller, but many electric versions are heavy enough to remain steady even if you do not clamp them down.;
, Place the oats directly into the hopper at the top of the machine.

Fill the hopper to the top edge, but avoid overfilling it beyond that point. If the hopper is too small to fit the entire portion of oats, work the oats through in separate batches.

, Many oat rollers have three settings. Switch settings as desired by turning the regulating knob on the side or back of the machine.Turning the knob changes the distance between the machine's roller bars, thereby allowing the machine to crush the oats into different sizes.
Generally, the three settings include coarse grind, coarse flakes, and thinly rolled flakes.

Use the ""rolled flake"" setting for rolled oats that resemble modern store-bought varieties.
If you would prefer larger, old-fashioned rolled oats, use the ""coarse flakes"" setting.
Choosing the ""coarse grind"" setting will crush the grains instead of flaking them. The resulting meal will be smaller than the flakes and will generally cook faster, but it should not be used as flour.



, Insert the handle into the side of the machine, if necessary, then turn it clockwise to pass the loaded oats through the rollers and into the collection basin.

Whole oats are easy to crush, so turning the handle shouldn't require much strength.
If you use an electric version instead of a manual one, press the ""On"" button (or its equivalent) to pass the oats through the machine.

, Pull the collection basin out from the bottom of the machine. Turn it upside-down into a bowl or other container to collect the newly rolled oats.

Use clean hands to quickly sift through the rolled oats. Most moderate to high quality rollers will crush the oats evenly, but damaged or poor quality machines may produce inconsistent results.
If most or all of the oats are not ground as finely as you would like, you may wish to pass them through the machine again. If only a few grains appear unbroken or too large, however, it might be easiest to simply pick them out and discard them.

, To enjoy the full benefits of freshly rolled oats, use them immediately or within several days. You can use them to make oatmeal or any other recipe calling for rolled oats.

Freshly rolled oats retain more of their nutrients and natural flavor. The nutritional benefits and taste will gradually decline in quality as the rolled oats remain in storage, though.
If you cannot use the rolled oats immediately, place them into an airtight, freezer-safe container or plastic freezer bag and store them in your freezer for several days to two weeks. Thaw the frozen grains before use.

"
"
Place the oats in a food processor.,
Pulse well.,
Sift through the oats.,
Use or store as needed.",How to Make Oats2," Pour the rolled oats into the bowl of a food processor. Gently shift the machine from side to side, distributing the oats into an even layer.Use either freshly rolled oats or store-bought rolled oats for this process.
Keeping the oats in an even layer will make it easier for the blades to reach the separate oats at a consistent pace.
If you do not have a food processor, you could use a blender, instead.

, Quickly pulse the oats four or five times, or until they appear coarsely chopped. Do not wait until the oats turn into powder.Operate the machine in short bursts. Each burst should last no longer than one or two seconds.
You can still use the oats for oatmeal if you accidentally grind them down into powder, but the resulting consistency will be mushy instead of chunky.

, Gently stir the oats with a spoon. If there are still large, pieces of oats in the bowl of the machine, pulse the batch again.

Before pulsing the oats again, make sure that the larger pieces are positioned directly next to the blades. Try to stir the smaller pieces further away from the blades to prevent them from breaking down into powder.
If you work in small batches, you may not need a second round of pulsing.

, You can use these quick-cooking oats immediately or store them in an airtight container until needed.

If you're starting with freshly rolled oats, try to use these quick-cooking oats immediately since they will retain more flavor and nutrients.
If you're starting with store-bought rolled oats, you should be able to store these quick-cooking oats in an airtight container at room temperature or in your refrigerator. Mark the container with the expiration date indicated on the original container of rolled oats.

Choose the oats.,
Place the oats in a blender.,
Grind until powdery.,
Use or store the finished product.",How to Make Oats3," To make oat flour, use rolled oats or quick-cooking oats. To make coarse oat bran, opt for whole oat groats.Note that you should only use whole oats if you have a durable, high-powered blender. Only use hulled oat groats; do not use raw grains.
Whole oat groats can be used to create flour, as well, but they will be much more difficult to work with and will need a longer processing time.

, Pour the oats into the blender, then shift the blender from side-to-side until the oats even out and settle between the blades.

If desired, you could use a food processor instead of a blender. Keep the oats in an even layer either way to ensure an even, consistent result.

, Switch the blender onto an appropriate speed, then allow the oats to process until they turn into powder.Use a medium to high speed when working with rolled or quick-cooking oats. If using whole oat groats, keep the machine on a high speed.
Pause the machine every 15 to 20 seconds. Stir the oats, directing larger pieces closer to the blades, and continue grinding as needed.
Stop processing the oats once they reach your desired consistency. Within one or two minutes, the oats should develop into a coarse to fine powder.

, You can use the oat flour or bran immediately, but if you don't need it yet, you can also store it at room temperature in an airtight container.

Coarse oat powder can be used as bran meal. Fine oat powder can be used as flour.
To retain the full nutritional value, use bran or flour made from fresh oats immediately.
When starting with store-bought rolled oats or quick oats, keep the finished product until the expiration date marked on the original container of oats.

"

Combine the dry ingredients.,
Stir the dry mixture and milk together.,
Microwave for 60 seconds.,
Enjoy.",How to Make Oats4," Place the oats, oat flour, salt, sugar, powdered creamer, and dried fruit into a plastic bag. Seal the bag and shake it well to combine the ingredients.If desired, you could prepare the dry mix ahead of time. Keep the oatmeal mixture in its sealed bag and store it at room temperature. Use it before the expiration date of the quickest-expiring ingredient.
If you plan to eat this oatmeal immediately, consider using freshly rolled oats or quick-cooking oats made from freshly rolled oats. The resulting oatmeal will have a deeper taste and more nutritional value.
The addition of oat flour will create thicker oatmeal. For thin oatmeal similar to the store-bought variety, you may omit this ingredient.
The powdered creamer and dried fruit are both optional.

Plain powdered creamer is better than powdered milk since it lasts longer.
Most dry berries can be used whole. Larger dried fruit should be chopped into 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) pieces or smaller before you add them to the bag.



, Dump the dry oatmeal mixture into a microwave-safe serving bowl. Pour the milk into the bowl, as well, and stir until combined.

Milk creates creamier oatmeal, but if you want to cut calories, you could skip the milk and use an equivalent amount of water.

, Place the uncovered bowl in your microwave and cook it on full power for approximately 60 seconds.

Note that low-powered microwaves may require a slightly longer cooking time.
Allow the hot oatmeal to rest in your microwave for roughly 15 to 30 seconds before removing it.

, At this point, the oatmeal should be finished and ready to eat."

Use your school’s resources.",How to Write a Personal Statement for an Undergraduate Application," These personal statements often include specific references to a portion of your life, and are evaluated based on how well you answer the given question. You don’t want to waste precious space addressing a question they didn’t ask, so take the time to make sure you understand the prompt clearly.;
, Each school has a specific statement of purpose that indicates what kind of institution it is, what skills the university values and promotes, and what they expect from their students. Peruse your school’s website and read all of this information so that you can reference it in your letter.Usually, you can find this kind of information on a university’s homepage or on a page on which the university’s president discusses his/her vision for the school in an open letter to the student body and prospective students.
You want to make the school think you will be a perfect fit as one of their students. This is a great way to do that.

, Ask your older friends, relatives, or teachers if they have examples of personal statements that you can read. Or you can search for examples on the internet. It is very helpful to see what a successful personal statement looks like before you begin crafting your own.

, In a personal statement, you will have a word limit or page limit. This means that you can only include what fits within the maximum allowed characters. So, you can’t afford to waste this precious space on filler or unnecessary information. Decide what is absolutely crucial for you to say in your personal statement and then you can add more if you have the space.


Include the elements that illustrate your commitment to academic and community involvement, as well as other things that will make the committee believe you are a good candidate for their school. Avoid things that could be viewed negatively or misinterpreted.

, The personal statement is the perfect place to include things that won’t be obvious in the rest of your application. So, if you are able to list all of your volunteering experience elsewhere in the application, don’t focus on that so much in your personal statement. You don’t want to waste the limited space you have repeating yourself.Remember, the personal statement is usually the only place where you have free reign to decide what information to include. So take careful stock of what you have listed elsewhere in your application and focus on other things in your statement.

, If you feel like there were extenuating circumstances that caused a certain outcome, this is the place to explain it.


For example, if you had some kind of illness that caused you to miss a lot of school days and, thus, your grades weren’t as good as they would have otherwise been, you can mention that here. However, be careful not to make it sound like a sob story or like you are looking for sympathy.

, There is no way to predict who will be reading your personal statement or what their values and beliefs will be. The last thing you want to do is alienate your reader right off the bat by including something that they vehemently disagree with.A good rule of thumb here is to avoid religious or political topics in general because they are often controversial subjects.

, You want to grab your reader’s attention from the beginning.Begin your personal statement with a complete sentence readdressing the original question but providing your own answer. (e.g. if the question was “What was the best experience in your high school career?”, the answer might be phrased “The best experience of my high school career was ...”).


Consider starting with a personal anecdote or clever story that draws the reader in right away.

, Continue throughout the statement giving very specific and detailed reasons or justifications for why you feel the way you do. Just answering the question outright isn't enough of a reason for them to believe you, so you should spend the majority of your personal statement giving specific life experiences that justify your position or personal feeling on the given subject. This will also help your reader remember more specifics about your application.For example, say that you volunteered at the Fulton County Humane Society rather than just your local humane society. Or that you won the Norman Mailer Student Writing Award instead of just saying you won an award for writing. Providing specific details like this will help your application stick out more in the minds of the review board members.

, Just stopping after some reasons and life experiences isn't enough; you must make the reader understand that you weren't just rambling. Tie together all of the fundamental elements you've written about so far, and summarize your main point.


Try coming full circle and referring back to something you mention at the beginning of your essay. For example, if you begin by discussing a particularly transformational moment in your life, you could close the personal statement by referring back to that experience and how it has helped prepare you to be a successful college student.

, Applying to college can be a very competitive process. Some of the top tier schools receive so many applications from qualified students that they have to look for any reason to throw out an application. Often, this can happen from simple grammatical or spelling mistakes in a personal letter. Poor editing in something as important as a personal statement reflects poorly on the student who writes it. You don’t want the admissions board thinking you don’t know how to spell things properly or, worse, that you are a careless student who couldn’t be bothered to re-read their personal statement before submitting it., Word choice is important in a personal statement because you want to sound educated and elegant. The personal statement is no place for slang or curse words. But also, try to use better descriptive words.For example, if you say you “accomplished something,” it sounds much more intelligent than saying you “did” something.

, As with most written projects, it is always a good idea to ask someone else to read your personal statement for you. When we write, we get so caught up in what we intend to say, that we often lose sight of what we actually say. An outside party will be able to catch mistakes that your brain simply skims over. They will also be able to see the bigger picture more clearly.It would be especially beneficial to ask someone who has strong writing skills. This could be a parent, a particularly studious friend, or even your English teacher.

, Many schools employ people whose job it is specifically to help students who are applying to college. It may be your guidance counselor, or it may be someone with a more specialized position regarding college placement. Either way, this person will have a lot of experience with personal statements and they will be an excellent resource for you. Schedule an appointment with them and ask them to read your personal statement. Ask them for specifics about what you can do to make your letter more impressive.

Obsessively edit for mistakes in grammar, punctuation and spelling.,
Adapt the statement for each program you are applying to.,
Give your personal statement to your recommenders.",How to Write a Personal Statement for Grad School," Before you write a word of your personal statement, you should truly explore why you want to attend this program.


On a piece of paper, write down the question ""Why do I want to attend this program?"" Then write a sentence that answers that question. Rewrite and revise that sentence again and again (at least 3-4 times) until you get a very clear, specific answer. You should use this sentence as inspiration for your broader statement.
If the program you are applying to is very prestigious or famous (like an Ivy League school), you need to write an answer that goes beyond ""This is a good program."" The admissions committee already knows it is a great program and they won't be able to learn very much about you if this is your only reason for applying.
Similarly, if you are applying to a program because of its desirable location (as in a major city or by the beach), you need to have an answer that avoids praising the program for its location. An admissions committee will also be able to see your true motivations very quickly and reject your application.;
, As a graduate student, you will work much more closely with the faculty in the department than as an undergraduate student. Which faculty members would you like to work with in the department? Whose work do you admire? How will their research interests align with yours?


You should actually read articles and books by the faculty member and know what kinds of arguments they are making. Don't just look up their research interests on the faculty web page. Let the committee know you are truly interested in the research that is conducted at the program.
Make sure the faculty members you want to work with are listed as graduate faculty members. Most programs require that their graduate students work with tenured faculty. This means the faculty members you want to work with should have the title of Associate Professor or Professor.
If the faculty member you want to work with is listed as an Assistant Professor or Visiting Assistant Professor, then you should avoid naming them as a potential advisor in your statement. They do not have tenure and their future at the institution is uncertain.

, Will you be expected to teach undergraduates or lead a lab over the course of this program? How will you succeed at this? What can you offer to this program as a potential teacher?

, You want to make sure the entire campus is a good fit for you, not just the individual program. Does the university have useful archives or an excellent interdisciplinary research center? How will these additional resources help your research?

, Ideally, you should start to write your personal statement one month before the application is due. This will give you plenty of time to revise and get lots of feedback from other readers.

, Most personal statements range from 2-3 pages. Since admissions committees will read through hundreds of statements, you need to grab their attention very early.First paragraph. Clearly define your purpose in pursuing graduate study in this program. Why are you a good fit for this program? Answer this question with a unique anecdote or fact about yourself.
Second paragraph. Expand on your thoughts from the first paragraph. Explain 1) which field you want to specialize in and 2) how you are prepared to specialize in this field. What has led you to this specialization? How do the research strengths of the program's faculty align with your own interests? Who would you want to work with in the program?
Third and fourth paragraphs. How do you plan to use your graduate study in your future career? Do you want to go into teaching, research or a non-academic field? Do you plan to use your graduate program to further a career you are already in?
Fifth and sixth paragraphs. Discuss any additional resources on campus you might be interested in using (such as a certificate program or an interdisciplinary research center). Close with a strong statement on how you can contribute to the program and how it will help you in your career goals.

, You should immediately convince the committee that you are committed to the research of their program. Is there a story in your background that you can use as an indication of your interest in the program? Was there a particular moment when you realized you wanted to study this subject in depth?


Avoid writing statements such as ""I always knew I wanted to be a ___."" These statements are overdone and, generally, they are also untrue. Did you really know, at five years old, that you wanted to be a mechanical engineer or the manager of a non-profit? Probably not. Be honest about what led you to this field of study.
Avoid cliches. Do not open with statements like ""Webster's dictionary defines 'medicine' as..."" You will also want to avoid opening with a quote from someone else. You need to make your own words shine here.

, Set aside 2-3 hours where you can just write. Don't worry about making it perfect yet. Just aim to get a full working draft on paper. Try not to edit yourself too much in this part of the writing process.

, And by break, we mean a real break (2-3 days). The writing process for these documents can be stressful. You need to give your brain a rest so you can come back to the statement with fresh eyes and a certain level of objectivity.


If you give yourself time, you will also be able to mull over new ideas and unique ways to phrase them in your statement.
Keep in mind that the revision process should take 2-3 times longer than the drafting process.

, Have you given the committee a real, honest view of your interest in this field? Make sure that you have not just repeated everything included in your resume or CV.


You don't want your personal statement to read like a laundry list of accomplishments. Instead. give the committee a clear idea of who you are and why you want to pursue this program of study.

, Do you sound like yourself in this statement? Or do you sound like an awkward, robotic version of yourself? If it feels like the latter, then revise it so you sound more like a human. Don't throw around academic jargon just because you think it will sound impressive.


While you don't want to sound stuffy, you should avoid anything inappropriate (obviously, no profanity). This is also not the place for crude jokes. You want to sound approachable, but also serious about your studies.

, After you have finished at least one thorough revision, get feedback from other readers (at least 2-3 people).


You might ask one of your current or former professors. They will likely have read many letters like this and they will be able to give you a sense of what an admissions committee is looking for.
Take it to your university's writing center and career center. These resources are generally free and the people who work there will be able to give you in-depth, objective feedback. They will have worked with hundreds of students who have successfully gone on to graduate school, so they will understand the best way to craft a personal statement.

, Some words and phrases come up over and over again in personal statements. You should avoid these if you want to stand out from hundreds of other applicants:interesting
satisfying
significant
challenging
rewarding
gratifying
remarkable
valuable
I want to help others

, When an admissions committee has to sift through hundreds of applications, they are looking for a reason to remove your application from the pile. Nothing will help them throw out your application faster than a typo.


Don't rely on the grammar or spell check function in your Word document to do this work for you. Check it yourself and have others help you check it as well.
Typos indicate a lack of attention to detail on your part. Multiple typos might cause your committee to question if you are lazy or imprecise in other parts of your work.

, You might be using your personal statement as a template in your applications to multiple programs. But you should tailor your statement to the strengths of each program.


Make sure you adapt the statement to include the correct name of the university and its respective faculty members. If you start out writing that you are interested in the program at Alpha University but then finish by saying you'd be thrilled to be accepted to Beta University, your application will most likely be tossed by the committee.

, Once you have a polished draft of your personal statement, you should provide a copy to the people writing your letters of recommendation for the program. This will give them a clear idea of your research interests and will help them write more detailed letters for you."

Exam and test papers are especially handy to keep around, not only because they could be useful to someone you know taking that class later, but they are usually not printed on both sides so they are useful when you're out of printing paper or need a blank surface to jot down notes. Once your box is full, drop it off at a Recycling Center.

, Instead of buying a new product to deal with each and every kind of stain or cleaning issue you have, try using household items instead. The article How to Clean Your Home Without Using Chemicals provides some pretty good ideas., It's a pretty good feeling to finally get around to cleaning your room and making it smell pretty or just hiding the layers of muck under clouds of fragrance. There's a better way to do it: Bring in the smell you're trying to imitate. Trying to make the room smell floral? Bring in fresh flowers. Going for a more musky smell? Bring in scented candles (Note: Candles are a fire hazard and are usually not allowed in a dorm room. If you're a commuting student this might work, but otherwise, say no to the candle idea) or go for potpourri which is the safer and organic alternative.

, If you go to a mall or department store and chance across the Perfume section, you'll get a chance to take samples of rather expensive perfume. Take the strips and put them in clothes drawers, bathrooms or even in coat pockets.

, Bills especially are a mark of collegiate independence. Most companies have an initiative called Paperless Billing in which they give you secure access to your bills online. Call your bank, phone service provider, health insurance company etc. and find out if they have paperless billing. Enroll in it if they do, there usually is no fee and it can save a lot of excess paper circulation.

, If you're living in a dorm especially and don't have to worry about electricity, it is all too tempting to leave the computer on and just get to it whenever you have to. Appliances on standby mode take up a lot of energy. If you're not using your computer or TV, turn it off and take the plug out of the socket. It doesn't take too much time to put it back in when you need to. If your computer is slow at startup, turn it on about 10 minutes before you actually need to sit at it and finish up what you're doing or do something else in the meantime. Even with the ten extra minutes of energy, you'll conserve a greater bulk.

, See if you can find some in a store nearby, they are a reduced chemical solution to laundry.

, Unless its summer and you're turning the air conditioning on, in which case the lower the temperature the higher the energy consumption. Keep the temperature as high or low as you need to, but once the room is as hot or cold as you want it to be, adjust the temperature by a few degrees closer to the zero point. You can always adjust it again if the temperature doesn't work for you, but even adjusting it for an hour can save plenty of energy. This rule applies to washing machines too, if you're washing clothes, try going for a medium temperature instead of a high one.

, If you can't seem to find one on campus and are bored one afternoon, look up private recycling centers in the area. Set a date when you would be able to take the time to drop off your recyclable materials there.

Understand the two keys to life as a happy student are setting goals and finding a balance that works.,
Determine where you will live.,
Living with a budget.,
Transportation.,
Getting involved.,
Health.",How to Live Like a College Student,"



Goals are things you want to achieve. Your goals will depend on your values and needs as a student. Goals can be anything. One major goal all students have is to graduate. Many students also have a goal of finding new friends. Some students may have budgetary goals. It doesn't matter what your goals are, all that matters is that you know what they are.

Make a list of your goals: the things you want to accomplish as a student.
Use brainstorming techniques like mind maps and freewriting to find your own goals. Sometimes knowing yourself is the hardest thing, so try working on your goals with friends.
Prioritize your list of goals.
Your goals will be a dynamic list, you will be adding and deleting from this list your entire life as you and your priorities change. In college you are likely to change you values and priorities a great deal, so don't be nervous about editing your list of goals.


Find balance. Balance is how you are going to manage your time in order to accomplish all your goals. It is vital to find the right balance between your competing priorities, which will be different for every individual student. For example:

A single parent returning to school will need to find balance between studying and child care.
A student who works and attends school full time will need to find balance between work and studying.

Other students will need to find balance between sports, studying and socializing.
With balance in mind, prioritize your list of goals again.

Remember, you may not have time to do everything, and will have to make some hard choices.


Remember that as a college student nobody is checking on you any more. You are an independent individual. Nobody cares if you miss class, don't do your homework, don't eat properly, or don't go to a party. It is up to you, now, to set these goals and keep them.

;
, One of the most important choices faced by all college students is where to live. Most four-year colleges in the USA offer dorms to students, and some even require you to live in a dorm for the first year or two. You can also choose off-campus housing. Your decision will depend on your goals and balance choices.


Living in a dorm can be a great experience but is not for everybody. Dorms are typically crowded, noisy, with many individuals competing for time and space. A lot of dorm time is spent socializing, so if you are more of a serious student, perhaps easily distracted, dorm life may not be for you.

If your goal is to study but you also wish to live in a dorm look around campus for private study spots you can go to when needed. These may include the library, art centers, computer labs, under a tree or any other place you feel comfortable.
Understand that most modern colleges offer a variety of dorm experiences on the same campus. For example, your college may have a ""zoo"" dorm where anything goes, along with quieter dorms where people like to study, and even ""alternative"" dorms that offer kitchens and on-campus apartments. It is often difficult to know which dorm has which style on your tour day, so check out the dorm options after you have been in school for a while, and be prepared to move.


Live off campus. For returning students in particular, and those ready for more responsibility, living off campus can provide many benefits, but also has disadvantages.


Advantages of living off campus can include:

Depending on your location, living in an apartment can be cheaper than paying housing fees.
Living off campus gives you privacy and independence.
Food and other costs can be cheaper, especially if you develop good budgetary habits.
Many would argue that living off campus gives an individual wider cultural exposure, access to a homogenized community, and a richer college experience.
This will work better with more outgoing college students. Shyer ones benefit in a dorm.


The disadvantages of living off campus include:

Higher costs in rent, groceries and utilities, depending on area.
More work and responsibility maintaining an apartment.
A commute.
Feelings of isolation, depression or loneliness.




Live Greek. You may also choose housing with certain clubs and organizations. The Greek lifestyle often provides an alternative housing to both dorms and off campus living.
Visit your campus housing office who can give you more information about all these topics.

, For many students managing money is a major new challenge. A budget does not mean you are poor, it simply means spending what you have on what you need. That said, many students are on limited budgets. Some techniques for learning to manage your money include:


Learn to live cheaply. You can buy hip clothing in thrift stores, buy groceries using coupons or shop in cheaper neighborhood markets, put collections on hold and do many other many things to reduce your cost of living.

Learn to cook. By cooking your own foods it is possible to eat sensible, delicious food, but spend very little money.
Use dollar stores for things like toothpaste and toilet paper.
Apply for financial aid. Step one in receiving student loans and grants is filling out the FAFSA: Free Application for Student Aid. (Link below)
Get a part-time job to supplement your income.

, Transportation is also an important choice for most college students. Your transportation options are principally determined by your needs, budget, lifestyle, available facilities, location and possibly political beliefs.



Cars. A car on campus gives you the freedom to get away when needed, but can also be expensive to park, use and maintain. Most college campuses are fairly self-contained so a car may be more hassle than it is worth.
Many colleges offer sophisticated transportation services including shuttles, free buses, night escorts and other systems. Learning to use these facilities can be both fun and rewarding.

A bicycle may be your best option for transportation at college. Bicycle theft is a serious problem at most colleges so be sure to have a good lock.

Scooters and motorcycles can also work well, especially if you live off campus. They are far cheaper to operate than a car.

, Almost all colleges in the USA offer far more activities than you could possibly explore in just four years. For many, college activities are only part of a rich student life. Some of the things you can do include:


Get involved in sports.
Join clubs, associations and organizations. Whatever you are interested in there will be a club for it at your college, and if there isn't, start one!
Many colleges offer training outside of the typical academic environment. For example some college offer after hours training in things like ""leadership skills"".
Take or just sit in on classes you find interesting, or that can teach you valuable skills, like typing.
Become involved in campus politics.
Explore your local community. Many colleges are located in wonderful areas. Exploring some of the countryside and surrounding areas can add precious memories to your college experience.
Volunteer for your favorite charities or other organizations.

, Getting sick on your own is part and parcel to living like a college student. Fortunately most colleges have both health insurance plans, and on-campus health facilities.


Stress is the most common new ailment faced by college students. Living on your own, new pressures and the immense workload involved in college can create stress you may not have encountered before.

Stress can have serious effects. Stress can lower your immune system and alter your personality. Learning to recognize your own internal stress is the first step in dealing with the issue. While we are all under stress all the time, stress that effects your life can be indicated by some of the following symptoms:

Memory problems.
Difficulty making decisions.
Inability to concentrate.
Confusion.
Seeing only the negative.
Repetitive or racing thoughts.
Poor judgment.
Loss of objectivity.
Desire to escape or run away.
Moody and hypersensitive.
Restlessness and anxiety.
Depression.
Anger and resentment.
Easily irritated and “on edge”.
Sense of being overwhelmed.
Lack of confidence.
Apathy.
Urge to laugh or cry at inappropriate times.




Taking good care of your health is the best way to insure a good college experience no matter what kind of student you are.

Decide what type of fraternity you want to join.,
Attend events at several different fraternities.,
Create a narrowed list.,
Meet with as many brothers of each fraternity on your list as possible.,
Manage your bids.,
Choose your fraternity.,
Know what to expect.,
Take a zero tolerance approach to hazing.,
Make the time commitment.,
Engage in philanthropic practices.,
Keep up with your academics.,
Participate in social events.",How to Join a Fraternity," Fraternities may have similar goals of cultivating friendships and taking part in campus life, but no two fraternities approach these goals the same way. Each fraternity has a different charter, plans different events, and focuses on different aspects of campus life. With this in mind, you should meet with a wide array of fraternities as early as possible in your school’s recruitment process.


You may find that some fraternities put too much emphasis on social events while you’re more interested in a fraternity that will be conducive to academic and leadership skills, or vice versa.;
, Each fraternity will hold several events early in the semester during what is most often referred to as “rush week” to drum up interest in potential recruits. Spend the first night or two of rush week sampling events at as many fraternities as possible to determine which one best suits your personality and goals for life on campus.In addition to simply meeting people, keep track of what life as part of each community will entail. The parties and free food of rush week aren’t necessarily emblematic of day-to-day life in the fraternity. Don’t be scared to ask a lot of questions about what the fraternity’s pledging process is like, the type of expenditure you can expect related to dues, the types of commitments you’re expected to make concerning study hours as well as campus and community events, and whether joining means living in the fraternity’s house or elsewhere.Not only does this assist you in deciding which frats truly interest you, but you’ll network with a ton of people in the process.You’ll likely find lists of these events wherever campus clubs and groups are allowed to advertise, including bulletin boards, sandwich boards, etc.

, After getting a sense of a wide array of fraternities and what each one is about, create a short list of the ones that most appealed to you.Once you know which houses you’re interested in learning more about, you can schedule the rest of your rush week to attend more of their events.

, This is dependent upon how many fraternities are on your list, but spend an extra day of rush week meeting with as many brothers of each fraternity on your list as possible.You may learn that your initial impression of a fraternity wasn’t quite what you thought or that while you like the focus of a certain fraternity, you’re unsure of how well you fit with the brothers with whom you will be in constant interaction.


Remember during these interactions that it’s their job to sell their fraternity, and it’s your job to just be yourself. Be pleasant yet honest with all of the brothers with whom you meet. If you’re not interested in their fraternity, that’s perfectly okay. Pretending you’re interested in order to receive the most bids possible will ultimately waste your time and theirs.
Continue narrowing down your list as you compile more information information on each, but don’t worry about narrowing the list down to a single fraternity. Much like applying to colleges in general, wide participation in a single fraternity’s rush week doesn’t guarantee they will extend a bid for you to join.By keeping your options spread three or so fraternities, you raise your changes of getting into one of them.

, Depending upon the demand of the fraternities on your list, they may hold offering bids to potential recruits until late in rush week, or they may start offering them early on if they find people they believe are a perfect fit. Don’t feel pressures to come back with a response immediately. In addition to accepting or declining a bid, most fraternities will allow you to place a hold on the bid while you continue weighting your options.Make sure you fully understand the specifics of putting a hold on your bid. You don’t want to miss a spot in the fraternity you ultimately choose because you responded too late.

, After spending time with a few different fraternities that you feel are the right fit, you’ll hopefully receive a bid from at least one. Take the proper amount of time to weigh your options and choose the one that most complements your personality, goals on campus, and expected level of interaction.


When you accept a bid from a fraternity, they will then make it official by having you sign a “bid card,” though it may have a different name in your specific frat., Once you’ve accepted a bid from a fraternity, you still have to undergo the pledging process, which is essentially where you continue learning about the frat and pledge to uphold the traditions and expectations thereof. You can expect to dedicate a large portion of time organizing frat events, representing the frat at school-related events such as sports, and giving time to the frat’s chosen charitable organizations.


Due to the highly controversial history and connotations of pledging, many fraternities have actually done away with the process. This means that while you will be expected to maintain a commitment to learning about the community and upholding its practices, you may not actually have to pledge.

, While many college campuses and fraternity chapters have widely cracked down on the practice of hazing, it’s not unheard of. Generally speaking, fraternities feel the hazing process is a rite of passage proving your dedication and desire to belong. However, there’s a huge difference between showing your dedication and subjecting yourself to humiliating or potentially dangerous acts.


If you ever feel as though you’re being harassed by the brothers of your fraternity as you pledge, then take it to someone higher up. If you feel the actions go beyond anything that the higher ranking brothers of the fraternity would allow, take it to them. If you don’t feel like you can take it to other frat brothers, then talk to someone at the student affairs office at your college.The student affairs office will allow you to remain anonymous if you so choose. They will then take up the issue with the fraternity and even law enforcement if necessary.Never feel as though you’re snitching or simply can’t hack it in the face of unacceptable behavior.
You’ll have to decide for yourself what you find an acceptable level of razzing from the fraternity brothers as you earn your place in the organization as a pledge, but never allow them to cross a line with which you aren’t comfortable.

, Though not hazing, pledging is still an intensive process of continuous learning and integration into fraternity life. You can expect to spend roughly six to twelve weeks as a pledge depending on your fraternity., During your time as a pledge, the fraternity will expect you to sample the wide range of activities in which they take part. This usually includes helping one of the philanthropic organizations the fraternity supports.This can range from helping to organize a fundraiser to donating time to the organization.

, Many fraternities require keeping your GPA above a certain threshold in order to maintain your involvement.Develop good study habits early on, so that you’re never stuck in a bad situation when grades roll around. While pledging, the frat will likely advise you to familiarize yourself with study halls and other academic support that they offer.

, In addition to philanthropic and academic responsibilities, fraternities will also expect you to maintain a level of participation with social events. Fraternities want to be well represented at campus functions, athletic events, and other social venues, and pledges may be expected to engage in quite a few of these events.Pledges may even be tasked with helping do the legwork in getting the word out about the fraternity’s events. Above all, prepare to be active.

Gain membership into the sorority.",How to Join a Sorority," If joining a sorority is important to you, make sure that you attend a university or college that contains a vibrant Greek life scene, not all schools do. For instance, at the University of Texas Pan-America, 100% of women are involved in a sorority. Each campus has a different relationship to sorority and fraternity life and so it is important to take this into consideration when deciding where to pursue your post-secondary education.Harvard and Amherst College, for example, do not affiliate with any sorority on campus.;
, Each university will have different recruitment dates and guidelines. Check online to make sure you know when recruitment begins at your school. Alternatively, you can also check with the fraternity and sorority life office at your university. There may be a number of mandatory events that you need to attend as a part of the recruitment; therefore, you need to check the college website to learn the important dates and follow the steps to register.Some colleges begin recruitment in the fall, some begin recruitment in the spring, and some individual sororities will allow for continuous open bidding. Continuous open bidding is a less formal recruitment process and occurs when individual sororities do not fill their quotas during the formal recruitment period.You do not need to join a sorority in your freshman year, although most do.

, Before you register for recruitment, look up the different sororities in place at your university. If possible, locate their national organizational website and their local website, if they have one. These can be valuable tools because these sites offer general information about the history, symbols, and philanthropic efforts of each sorority. The local web pages can show you the activities of each sorority and what they do each semester.


Look at the national organizational websites to find local chapters in your area.

, Once you have discovered when recruitment begins at your college, you must sign up for recruitment. It is a good idea to sign up for recruitment early so that you don't accidentally miss the sign up date. Also, at some colleges, each sorority will be given the sign up list. If your name is closer to the top, it is more likely that your name will be remembered by some of the sisters.


When you sign up for recruitment you will likely need to pay a non-refundable registration fee.
You will also likely be placed into a recruitment group and given a recruitment counsellor, or ""Rho Gamma,"" who will act as your guide and mentor throughout the recruitment process.

, Most university Greek life organizations have some sort of form you will have to fill out when you register. Include all high school activities you were in, even if you didn't hold any leadership roles because sororities love extracurriculars. Also include any, and all, academic clubs that you have joined in college. Regardless of what you may have seen in movies and television shows, sororities hold scholastic achievement in high regard.


For instance, you may be required to have a certain grade point average after high school. It is important to know and understand all of the requirements to ensure that you are eligible to join a sorority on campus.

, During the period of formal recruitment, most sororities will hold a number of events in order to get to know potential new recruits and showcase their sorority. Typically, these events are divided into rounds where you will meet with a number of different sororities during each round. You should attend events at multiple different sororities in order to get a feel for how the sorority works and the types of activities they engage in. This will help you make a decision regarding which sorority to join.For instance, you may be interested in joining a sorority that places a large emphasis on social activities. Some sororities place academic events ahead of throwing parties. By attending events at multiple sororities, you will be able to find one that matches your priorities.

, Generally, each night of recruitment will grow more formal, starting with a simple jeans and polo outfit to a more formal/cocktail dress event near the end. While appearance is definitely not the most important thing that sororities will be looking for, pride in appearance and self confidence will definitely give you an edge.


In order to make sure that you are dressed appropriately for each event, or round, ask about dress codes at the Panhellenic office. Alternately, you could ask your recruitment councillor for wardrobe advice!, It is a good idea to meet with lots of women during the recruitment period. This way, you will get to know some of the people involved in each sorority. By meeting with individuals from each of the sororities you are interested in joining, you will get a better idea of how you will fit into that social circle. For example, you may really like the sorority activities, but find that you have little in common with many of the sisters. You are going to be spending a lot of time with these people throughout your college career so it is important that you get along with them.Remember when you are meeting with members of each sorority that they are trying to sell you a specific experience and brand. You should always be yourself in these situations and assess how you fit with other members of the sorority.
Always be polite and thank the individuals you met for their help and guidance. This will help them remember you and may give you a better chance of being accepted into the sorority.

, During the recruitment period, it is a good idea to ask questions about the sorority in order to decide if you are a good fit. When you join a sorority, you are making a huge commitment and it is important that you have weighed all the options and decided upon the sorority that is best for you. Some questions to consider are:How will I benefit from membership in this sorority?
Can you describe an ideal member in your sorority?
Are there are leadership opportunities available for me? If so, what do they entail?
How long is the new member (or pledging) period and what is the time commitment?
How much does membership cost?
Does this sorority have a housing option for sisters to live together?

, Sorority’s can be fairly pricey and will add multiple extra expenses to your academic year. For example, membership dues, for a single semester, can cost up to $1,000. There will also be additional costs such as shirts, pins, event tickets etc. If cost is important to you, look for a sorority that is affordable and fits your budget., After each round of events you attend during the recruitment period, you should make a list ranking the sororities. This list can be adjusted after each round of events. You can narrow down the list once you have determined which chapters are the best fit for you.In the final round of recruitment, called preference, you will only visit your top ranked sororities and will typically get to spend quite a bit of time with each of them.
Make sure you ask specific and detailed questions in order to help you make your final decision. By this point of recruitment, you will already have a good idea about the costs and time commitments associated with each sorority, so you may want to ask about specific events, opportunities, and philanthropy.
For example, you may want to ask how many people have received jobs through their connections with the sorority, or if the sorority provides members with education regarding sexual harassment and consent.

, At the end of the recruitment period, you may or may not receive bids to join certain sororities or chapters. If you receive multiple bids, you will need to weigh the options and decide which chapter is best for you. Choose the sorority that best complements your personality, goals, and expected level of interaction.For example, did you find that you made a personal connection with any of the sorority sisters during the recruitment stage?
Did you find that one sorority held multiple events that align with your interests and values?
Some sororities cater their activities specifically to certain populations. For example, Alpha Kapa Alpha and Lambda Theta Alpha, focus primarily on African American and Latin populations respectively. This is something you may want to take into consideration when choosing a sorority., Once you have decided on a sorority and accepted a bid, you will enter into a four to eight week pledging period. During this time, you will be expected to learn about the history and values of the chapter and community, engage in philanthropic events, volunteer your time to sorority activities on campus, and uphold the traditions of the sorority. Think of this as a probationary period. The sorority has decided to give you a bid, but want to make sure that you are a good fit for them.During the pledging period, many sororities will pair up a ""big sister,"" or veteran member, with a ""little sister,"" or new recruit. This is a type of mentorship program and the big sister is expected to help the little sister adjust to sorority life., Hazing, often depicted in Hollywood movies as some form of embarrassing or dangerous initiation ritual, is banned by most sororities and fraternities. Do not engage in in any type of demeaning or embarrassing experience as part of the pledging process. If you have been asked to do something that is dangerous, illegal, or demeaning, you should report your experience to the sorority life office on campus., As a pledge, you will need to be active and engaged in the sorority. This will include devoting time to philanthropic and social events hosted by the sorority. As a new pledge, you will likely be tasked with some of the legwork, such as advertising sorority events on campus.


For example, you may need to man a booth on campus that advertises your sorority, or you may need to hand out fliers one day to promote an upcoming event.
It is important that you engage in these activities in order to demonstrate that you are committed to sorority life.

, Once you have completed the pledging period and demonstrated your devotion to the sorority, you will become a full member of the sorority. As a member, you will likely need to maintain a certain grade point average as well as engage in social and philanthropic events moving forward.


Although most sororities have banned hazing rituals, there will likely be some form of initiation. For example, you may need to memorize and recite the sorority oath.
If you do not gain membership into a sorority at the end of the formal recruitment period, you can always try an open bid later in the year. Go back to some of the sororities on your initial list and see if they have space.

Assess whether or not you're also in the room too much.,
Take note of his or her schedule.,
Ask politely for some schedule alone time.,
Be patient until they take trips away.,
Try the ""fire alarm"" trick.,
A third trick is bringing friends to the dorm.,
Try negotiating daily time slots when both of you can be alone.,
Speak with your RA, as a final resort.",How to Get Time Alone When You Have a College Roommate," It's not fair of you to try to get your roommate to leave when you won't. Do you regularly attend a club or two? Have you done community service on the weekends? Do you give them time to enjoy the room on their own?

A good way to gauge if you spend too much time in the room is to ask others if they think that you do.;
, Is there a period of time where your roommate is in class, but you aren't? Do they have to attend fraternity/sorority meetings? If you know when you can expect your roommate to leave, you can plan on having alone time., If you believe that you aren't being unfair and can't find a time when you're guaranteed to be alone, try politely asking if you could have an hour or two alone. This shouldn't be too hard. Simply text or ask your roommate, ""Hey (roomie's name), could I have an hour to myself tonight? I feel like I need to be alone.""

Offering them a time period when you'll leave so they can be alone is a good idea to get them onboard.
If they ask you why you need alone time, just calmly state that you feel stressed and need some private time to vent.

, If they decline, and you absolutely need alone time, wait until they go home for the weekend. When your roommate goes home, you can usually tell by them packing anything they'd need for a weekend and leaving without returning for a long period of time (i.e. a couple of hours). If this happens, you'll have a couple of days to yourself!

This method requires patience. Sometimes, they could stay up at school for months on end. If you need alone time ASAP, keep reading.

, As they're leaving class, or class is ending, text them, ""Great, some idiot burnt their popcorn and we all had to evacuate"". Your roommate might want to avoid standing outside the building doing nothing, so he or she may head to the dining hall or elsewhere.

This method is risky, as your roommate may come back anyway and find out that you lied to them.

, If you bring a couple of friends into the room and start hanging out, your roommate might feel the need to allow you guys some privacy. Alternatively, you could ask them in front of your friends, ""Hey, we need to talk about schoolwork, so could we have a little privacy?""

While this isn't true ""alone time"", as you'll be with friends, this trick will at least get your roommate to leave, should it work.

, Let's say you have class in the morning, while your roommate, Kyle/Kelly, has class in the afternoon. You could try arranging it so that from 11-2, you have time where you can be alone, and Kyle/Kelly can have his/her alone time from 2-5. This way, you both have the same amount of alone time set aside.

You should allow your roommate in to grab stuff they need, but don't let them linger, should they have to enter the room during your alone time.

, While this is a last resort and the option you should only turn to when the above steps have failed, it might work. Your RA can mediate the discussion between you and your roommate and help you both air your concerns without starting a massive argument.

You should notify the RA if your roommate threatens you at any point.

Talk to your parents if you think your drinking is getting out of control.",How to Hide Your Drinking From Your Parents When You're in College," While drinking with friends can be fun to do on weekends, drinking alcohol can swiftly become a serious problem if it starts to get out of control. One of the signs of alcohol abuse is hiding your drinking from loved ones, including family and friends, as you are aware that you can no longer control your drinking. You may feel guilty or ashamed of your drinking and lie about drinking or keep it hidden to prevent being judged or questioned about it.If you are hiding your drinking from your parents because you suspect you may have a drinking problem, you should seek help right away.


You may seek help by talking to a university counselor ora therapist on campus. You may also talk to close friends and discuss your struggles with your drinking.
It may also be a good idea to talk to your parents about your drinking, as they will likely care more about your safety and well-being than whether or not you are drinking irresponsibly. It may be worth reaching out to your parents, as they can help you and support you.;
, Keep count of how many drinks you have throughout the night and recognize your limits. This could be three beers, four glasses of wine, or even one pint. Once you start to feel like you’ve had too much, stop yourself or ask friends around you to make sure you stop drinking. If you drink too much, you could end up doing irrational things that could put yourself or others in danger. There could also be consequences that would require a call to your parents to let them know you were drinking irresponsibly.You should also keep an eye on your drinks when you are at at a bar or in a club, as you do not want to drink a spiked drink and end up getting into a bad situation.
Do not drink and drive, as this can lead to serious consequences that can put your life and the lives of others in danger. You should also discourage others from drinking and driving.

, Avoid raising suspicion of your drinking lifestyle by maintaining a good physique. This could mean taking up a sport in college, running three to four times a week, or doing weekly fitness classes. Staying fit will also help you to burn off any weight gain due to your drinking and give you a healthy, youthful appearance that you can present to your parents.


Staying fit with a busy school schedule can be a challenge. Try to fit in exercise whenever you can, such as biking to school every day if you live off campus or taking the stairs rather than the elevator to your classes.
Remember that when you are consuming alcohol, you are consuming calories. If you tend to drink a lot at least one to three times a week or drink every day, you will likely gain weight from your drinking habit.If you notice you are gaining weight due to your drinking habit, you should cut back and limit your alcohol consumption.

, Maintain a healthy diet so you can work out and stay physically fit. Eating well will ensure you maintain your health and recover more quickly from your hangovers, thereby preventing your parents from noticing a tell tale sign of drinking too much the night before.This means skipping processed foods or microwave dinners and trying to cook meals for yourself at least four to five times a week. Pick a day to go grocery shopping every week and make a meal plan with your roommates in your apartment or your dorm so you can eat healthy meals together. If you are limited to access to a microwave or a hot plate, you can try to cook healthy meals using what you have.

, If you are going to college far from your hometown and have weekly calls with your parents, plan your calls so you are talking to them when you are sober and feeling energized. This will ensure you sound normal and responsible during the conversation and your parents will not get suspicious.


If you tend to video chat your parents, this point is extra important. You do not want your parents to see you looking intoxicated or stumbling around in your dorm room as you speak to them.

, Parents will often judge their children based on the company they keep. Surround yourself with good, respectable friends who project responsibility and honesty to your parents. This will help you to maintain a good image and show your parents you are surrounded by positive influences., To hide your bad habits in college, it is important that you maintain a high academic performance. Make sure you dedicate enough time to studying and completing your assignments. Often, if you are doing well academically, your parents will be less suspicious that you are drinking or doing reckless things while in college.


You may want to set up a study group with your peers to keep you on track and to ensure you meet your deadlines.
You can also use an organizer on your phone or your computer so you are aware of when your assignments are due and can block out time to complete them. This will help you to prioritize your academics over your drinking habits, though this does not mean that you have to stop drinking altogether. Instead, it just means you will need to balance your school work with your free time activities, including partying and hanging out with friends.

, Another way to maintain your academic performance is to make sure you attend all your classes and are on time. Show the professor that you are engaged, and not just drinking all the time, by participating in class as well. Raise your hand and contribute to the discussion in class.


This will ensure you get high participation marks in your classes, which will also ensure you maintain a high grade point average. Your professors will likely take notice if you do not show up for class several times in a row or you appear to be hung over and sleeping in the back of the room. Impressing your professors with your clean, sober behavior in class will allow you to fly under the radar.

, Though you may enjoy drinking and partying, you should try to ease up during mid-terms and final exams. It may be possible to scrape by without attending too many classes but failing your mid-terms and your final exams could lead to a failing grade in your classes. This could then alert your parents that something is going on with you and that you may be spending too much time hanging out and partying.Prepare for your exams by taking good notes in class and participating in a study group. You should also mark down the mid-term exam dates and the final exam dates for your classes in your calendar so you can prepare in advance for these important exams.

, Coming home for a visit with great grades will surely impress your parents and quell any suspicions they may have of your drinking. You could also email or mail a copy of your grades and your grade point average to your parents as proof that you are staying on top of your studies.


Parents are usually very concerned about how their child is doing in school and will focus primarily on their child's high grades and high GPA scores.They will likely be satisfied that you are staying focused in college and not spending too much time drinking if you show them a high GPA.

, Though this may seem obvious, it can be tempting to get a drink when your parents are not looking or in another room. But to maintain your good image, you should not drink at all in front of your parents or around your parents. The last thing you want is for your parents to see you drunk.


Over time, you may want to start drinking a few drinks in front of your parents. If you are of drinking age, drinking alcohol responsibly is part of becoming an adult and becoming independent. You may gradually start to drink in front of your parents as a way to show them that you can be mature and not get out of control when you are drinking.

, If you know your parents are coming for a visit to your dorm room, clean up the room and keep in mind your parents’ rules. This could be basic etiquette rules like no elbows on the table or more serious rules like no drinking, smoking, or swearing at the table. Follow your parents’ rules as much as possible to avoid arousing their suspicions.Your parents may not approve of drinking alcohol in public. If this is the case, you should avoid drinking in front of them to prevent offending them. Being on your best behavior and following your parents' rules will also show them that you are responsible and respectable. Your parents will then be less suspicious of your bad habits, including your tendency to drink.

, If you feel as though your drinking habits are no longer in your control, you may want to reach out to your parents for help. Though you may be scared of the repercussions, being honest about your drinking to your parents may be the necessary first step to dealing with your drinking issues.You may choose to speak to one parent that you feel closer with or that you feel will be less strict with you. Select a place and time where you will have privacy with this parent to allow you to express your thoughts honestly and sincerely.

Introduce yourself to people.,
Cultivate friendships with your neighbors.,
Hit up orientation events and activities planned in your dorm.,
Leave your door open whenever you’re around.,
Start a weekly get-together in your hall or room.,
Take advantage of the community kitchen.,
Initiate a dorm service project.,
Hang out with a mix of people.,
Date wisely within your hall.",How to Get the Most out of Co Ed Dorms1," Since there are so many fellow students living in the same building as you, there are basically non-stop opportunities to meet new, exciting people. One of the best things about co-ed dorms is that they provide a sense of instant community. You’ll rarely if ever again be in a position where prospective friends are so abundant and accessible. Take advantage of it!


If you see someone in the hall, commons area or entryway, there’s no reason not to say hello: “Hi, do you live here, too? I’m Scott; nice to meet you.”
If you encounter a group of fellow residents gathered informally and socializing, don’t be afraid to join in: “Hi, everyone, I’m Katie. Can I join you?”;
, You’ll see the people that live immediately around you more than most people, so why not be on friendly terms with them? It’ll create a sense of community and make those inevitable bathroom encounters much less awkward.


The easiest way to make yours neighbors into friends is to acknowledge them when you see them, and stop for chat whenever you’re both in the hallway. If you’re having trouble finding an opening to introduce yourself, ask to borrow something like a stapler or seek their advice about something, for example: “Say, I’m about to grab some food. Do you know of any good places to eat around campus?”
Invite them over to hang out. You live right next to each other, so why not have them to your room for a film or a cupcake? “My roommate and I are going watch Rockie tonight, would you like to join us?”

, Besides giving you important info about campus life, they're a great, low-pressure way of meeting people just like you, that is, people who are also new to campus and looking for friends.


Welcome Week and in-hall gatherings will often include icebreakers, which give you the opportunity to connect with people you might not already know.

, Doing so will make people take notice of you. It will also give fellow residents the impression that you’re friendly and accessible, which will encourage them to wander in and have a chat.

, This way you can meet all the people in your area without having to single anyone out on an individual basis. Be sure that it’s at the same time each week so that people know what to expect.


The get-together could be an informal mixer, or you could gear it towards a specific activity. For instance, you could have movie night in your room and have guest taking turns picking the film. Or, you could have people gather in the commons area to watch a popular tv program when it airs. Maybe you want people to play chess or bake cookies with. Pick a format that interest you and will best accommodate the kind of people you want to meet.

, Host dinner parties or potlucks. Make brownies and popcorn to accompany a movie. As an added bonus, friends and romantic interests alike love people who can cook or bake. Put something in the oven, and people will follow the delicious aromas.

, Helping a local charity is a meaningful way to meet people and help your community while creating community within your hall. If there’s a cause that’s important to you, give them a call to see what the best way would be to help out.


If a donation would help the most, try hosting a fundraiser. Post an announcement in your commons area and your hall’s online forums to see who would like to be involved. You can also go door-to-door asking people if they’d like to be involved or reach out to your residence life staff to ask them to help spread the word. Then, work with the people who sign up to organize an event in your hall.
If volunteer work would be more useful, follow the same process to organize a service day with the organization.

, You’re living with both sexes, so make friends with both. Don’t let biases limit your interactions with people or insecurities keep you from engaging with them.


If you feel nervous about asking an individual person to hang out, invite them to do something as part of a group. This is likely to make them feel more comfortable, too.
Things will go more smoothly for you if you’re friendly but not flirtatious with everyone. If it seems like you’re only interested in sexual relationships, it can make people wary and put a damper on friendships. Remember: friendships often last longer than sexual relationships, so it’s wise to focus on cultivating friendships first.

, When you’re attracted to someone, it’s hard to slow down and think about the matter rationally. But, if you want to avoid or at least prepare yourself for the potential of future drama, it’s worth taking some time to consider the possible drawbacks of the relationship before you pursue it.


If you plan on dating someone who lives in the same hall as you, make sure that you understand the pros and cons before starting that relationship. For instance, if they live on the same floor, be aware that you’ll be running into them often. That’s great while you’re dating but can be awkward if you break up.
Be up front with them about your concerns. You can broach the subject by saying something like, ""I'm really excited about going out with you, but I want to make sure that it won't compromise our friendship."" Communicating about this early on will make it more likely that you can stay dorm friends even if you break up.
Residents who live in a co-ed dorm are more likely to be sexually active than other students. If you plan to be sexually active, it’s important to inform yourself about sexual health. Campus health services offer excellent resources for students to learn about practicing safe and consensual sex. Be sure to take advantage of the information, workshops and kit they have available. It will make your dating life more pleasurable in the long run!"

Get to know your roommate.,
Grab a meal together.,
Collaborate on decor.,
Go sight-seeing.,
Share a TV series or game together.,
Host a party together.",How to Get the Most out of Co Ed Dorms2," They don’t have to be your best bud, but it’s worth getting to know them and cultivating a mutual respect. Especially early on, it’s nice to have a go-to companion around. Since your roommate is one of the first people you meet, they’re the most obvious person to help see you through orientation and the early weeks of college. That being the case, it’s a good idea to start getting to know your roommate before you even move in together.Your university should provide you with your roomie’s contact information if you don’t already know them. Don’t hesitate to reach out via email or find them on social media and start up a conversation. Open with a greeting like, “Hello, I’m your new roommate! I wanted to introduce myself, and find out about about you.”
Keep your message fairly brief at first, so you don’t overwhelm them with information, but do share where you’re from, along with some of your hobbies and interests. Don’t forget to close by asking about them: “What are your favorite things to do your free time?”
Exchanging messages with your roommate early on can also be a great help logistically; you can plan your move-in strategy together.
Depending on your school, you roommate may be of the opposite gender., Even if it seems like you don’t have much in common at first, you both need to eat, so why not help each other navigate the cafeteria? If you have a similar schedule, you may even want to meet up to eat a particular meal together on a regular basis. It’s always nice to have steady company, and it’ll help you bond with your roommate outside your room.

, Each of you will have your own furnishings and taste, but it can be nice to pick out a few things for your room together. It will make your dorm room feel like it belongs to both of you.Try attending a campus art fair to choose a statement piece or two for your walls. Or, go to a home goods store to purchase a rug for the floor between your beds or a string of lights to brighten up your ceiling.

, Check out your new environs together. Take a tour of campus or a bus into town. Track down your nearest sushi restaurant, or go to a local museum. It’s a great chance to learn more about your campus, community, and each other.


If there’s something you want to do anyway, it makes it easier to ask. For instance, you could say: “Hey, I’m going to the concert in the student union building--do you want to join me?” or, “I’ve been meaning to check out this park; would you like to go sometime?”

, Figure out a show or a video game that you both enjoy. It’s nice to have a “thing” with your roomie that ensures you’ll spend time together and always have something to talk about.It’s nice if you already have a guilty pleasure or must-see prime-time program in common. But, if you don’t, it’s also fun to try something that’s new to both of you. You might open the conversation by saying, ""The new Netflix series is about to launch. Should we give it a try?""

, If you’re both comfortable having people around, go ahead and invite your classmates and neighbors over. If both you and roommate invite people, it’ll expand your friend group. Plus, organizing the party offers an opportunity to bond.


Discuss if you want it to be just a casual get-together or if you’d like the gathering to center around a particular activity (such as watching movie or playing a game). You could also make it a themed party, like a disco or pirate party, or an event to celebrate a particular holiday, like Halloween or Mardi Gras.
Set the guest list together, keeping in mind that your room has a limited capacity.
Decide how you’re going to go about inviting people. Do you want it to be word-of-mouth, or do you want to make a paper or online invite? If you go with the latter, designing the invitation can be a blast in itself. Make the announcement short and fun. Try embellishing it with a graphic or picture that you both find entertaining.
Collaborate on day-of preparations that set the tone. Work together to select the soundtrack, pick decorations, and choose refreshments to have on offer.

Start by considering each others’ schedules and sleeping habits.,
Find a way to give each other private time.,
Come up with a visitors’ policy.,
Be prepared to compromise.,
Put it down in writing.",How to Get the Most out of Co Ed Dorms3," Since you’ll be living in the same space, it’s important that you agree on some guidelines for how you’ll respectfully share it. Setting boundaries early on will help you avoid conflicts later.It can feel like a difficult subject to bring up, so do it in a friendly, approachable manner: “I’m really looking forward to living with you, and I’d love to discuss if there’s anything I can do to make sure I’m not stepping on your toes and vice versa. Could we talk about it now or plan some time to do it later?”

, If you have an early morning chem lab on Thursdays, you probably want to go to bed at a reasonable hour on Wednesday night. Set quiet and study times in advance.


Good questions to ask include: “What does your schedule look like this semester?” “Are there times when you would like to designate as quiet times in our room?” “When do you usually go to sleep, and will it bother you if I’m working in the room while you’re in bed?”
After you have the answers, print and post a weekly calendar so that you can keep track of each others’ schedules. It’s also nice to know when you’ll have the room to yourselves.

, If there are times when you foresee wanting the room to yourself, make arrangements for that. Agree on a signal, like a sign on the door, that will notify the other person when you want privacy. Be sure that you’re not hogging the room or causing your roommate serious inconvenience.

, What seems like an easy-going social interaction to you may feel like an invasion of privacy to your roomie, so it's important to discuss how you’d like to handle other people in the room.


Important questions to ask include: ""Are you comfortable with having visitors drop in unannounced or me bringing someone back to the room without telling you first?"" ""Do you mind groups of people being in our room?""

, This should be a two-way conversation where you both take into consideration the other’s needs and desires. If you’re having trouble coming up with a resolution to a particular conflict, seek out help from your resident assistant or other residence life staff member.


Try to come up with reasonable solutions that appease both sides. For instance, if your roommate is uncomfortable with having visitors in the room, ask if they’d be okay with you having people around if you give them notice first.

, Once you have agreed on a basic set of rules, it’s a good idea to keep a record them. Doing so will ensure that you’re both on the same page, which can help clear up any future misunderstandings. This will also make it easier to refer back to them and reconsider them throughout the year as your schedules and attitudes change.

Get out of your comfort zone.,
Get socialized.,
Get to know people as people.,
Start a study group.",How to Get the Most out of Co Ed Dorms4," Moving into a co-ed dorm will definitely shake up your routine. You’ve been living and doing things in a certain way for a long time, and this new environment will force you make some changes. It can be uncomfortable, but why not seize the opportunity to switch things up? Doing so will help you get to know yourself and your personal limits.Even mundane things, like wearing your pajamas around at night or using the bathroom, can be scary in this new, much more public context. But, there can be benefits, too, like making you less self-conscious. It’ll make you less likely to sweat the little stuff.
You’ll encounter plenty of people who behave and do things differently from you, sometimes in ways that can challenge your expectations. While this can be upsetting, it can also help you figure out what you think the best way of doing things is or what you believe good behavior looks like.

, Interacting with a diverse set of peers such as you’ll find in a co-ed dorm is useful preparation for real life. It will help you develop the self-assurance and experience you need to network with ease or fit in at a new workplace.


Try challenging yourself to not always hang out with the same set of people. Every time you’re at a dorm event, introduce yourself to someone you don’t know. It’s as simple as saying, “Hi, I’ve seen you around and wanted to introduce myself.” Or, “Hi, I’m Luke, do you live on the third floor, too?”

, There’s often a sense a mystery around how other people live. When you’re in a dorm, you get a first-hand glimpse at a diverse set of people’s ordinary existences, daily routines, and idiosyncratic habits. Sometimes it may feel like you’d rather not be privy to some of the stuff you see, but it does help to understand people as human beings just like you, with their own values and quirks.


Many students have noted that living is a co-ed dorm can be especially powerful at breaking down the mystique that sometimes surrounds the opposite sex or anyone who seems, on the outside, to be different from you. Getting a glimpse of the mundane aspects of people’s lives can help overcome those sense of difference that distances you from others and limits your ability to authentically connect with them., Co-ed dorms can be a great venue for finding people to study with, not just party with. Make learning fun by collaborating with your peers to get your homework and test prep done.

Use a rollerball pen.,
Print out any available materials.,
Listen for key concepts, don’t transcribe.,
Move on when the professor moves on.,
Use shorthand.,
Revisit your notes after class is over.",How to Take Notes Quickly1," Any writing instrument will do for note-taking. However, a rollerball pen has less friction against the paper and will allow you to write more quickly across the page. If you are left-handed, you may want to buy a felt-tipped pen to prevent smudging.;
, Sometimes professors or speakers upload or share their notes. These notes can take the form of a slideshow, an outline, or just a text document. If you have access to these documents, print them out, read them ahead of time, and bring them to class. This way, some of the notes are already taken for you and you can simply add additional thoughts during the lecture.

, Writing down everything the teacher says will waste time. Instead, pick up on larger, overarching issues. You should be writing out short sentences, no more than five words. , You can always come back to a concept or ask a question. You will waste time if you move at your own pace, so don’t spend time finishing up a section to your satisfaction while your professor moves on. Instead, switch concepts when they do.

, Professional stenographers use a special system of writing called shorthand.But there is no need to learn this specialized knowledge. Instead, figure out a personal shorthand that works best for you.Here are some ways you can try shorthand:


Use abbreviations for both proper nouns and long and tedious words. For example, write “US” for “United States,” but also ""w"" for ""with,"" ""b/w"" for between, ""ex"" for ""example(s).""
Drop articles like “the,” “an,” and “a.”
Drop vowels. For example, write “trnsfrmtn” instead of “transformation.”
Use arrows and lines to convey relationships instead of cumbersome sentences. For example, instead of saying “the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand IN 1914 caused World War I,” say, “ass. F Ferdinand → ww1 - 1914”
Write in cursive. Like the gel pen, writing in cursive will shave off note-taking time because your pen never leaves the paper.

, Pick a note-taking or word-processing program that works best for your needs.For example, you may want to pick a program you know well, like Microsoft Word. On the other hand, you may want something simple and basic, like Text Edit. Consider using a note-taking program like Evernote or One Note.

, There are a variety of keyboard shortcuts that can help you take notes more quickly. Keyboard shortcuts can vary depending on the kind of computer you use (Macor Windows) and what kind of word-processing program you are using. That being said, you will find keyboard shortcuts useful for the following note-taking issues:


Formatting. Keyboard shortcuts can allow you to emphasize key concepts through shortcuts that help you highlight, bold, or underline words or phrases. For example, command + B will make a word bold.
Navigation. Certain keystrokes can help you move to the beginning or the end of a line. Other keystrokes allow you to move seamlessly between programs or windows. In the Windows program OneNote, using the ""End"" or ""Home"" key will allow you to move your cursor to the end or beginning of the line you are on.Organization. Keyboard shortcuts can allow you to automatically make ordered, hierarchical lists like outlines or numbered lists.
Type expanding. You can program your word processor to recognize phrases as you type them. Instead of typing out “interdisciplinary coordinated calculus” you can type “icc” and your computer will know what you mean.

, Writing down everything the teacher says will waste time. Instead, pick up on larger, overarching issues. You should be writing out short sentences, no more than five words., You can always come back to a concept or ask a question. But don’t spend time finishing up a section to your satisfaction while your professor moves on. Instead, switch concepts when they do.

This would include any and all social networking sites or just anything besides what you need for research. If quiet music helps you concentrate, you can use Pandora, as long as it's a good classical or choral station you won't find yourself distracted with and singing to it.;
, Most likely, you will be using Microsoft Office Word or Google Drive. If you are in MLA format, set all the margins to 1 inch (2.5 cm), use Times New Roman font, 12 point. Set your spacing to 2.0, and do justify to avoid having to double-space each sentence. This will save any confusion later. Keep entering down on the page until you have 3 blank pages. Enter your full name, teacher's name, course name, and the date it's due (tomorrow, in format Number Month Year). Title the third page Works Cited. Now you know what you're up against.

, After doing a quick Google search with your topic, you will find many websites. Choose the best and most interesting-looking websites. Most papers you need to have 3-5 sources, so choose accordingly. Don't use anything like WikiAnswers, ChaCha, Yahoo Answers, blog posts or especially Wikipedia. Only use trusted sources from official companies; usually if they end in .edu or .org they are okay.

, Copy and paste the URLs into your third page on the document. Now that you have some base information, go ahead and get started.

, The introduction paragraph and the conclusion paragraph is always the worst. It's best to do it later, unless you already have some super good ideas on what you need to do.

, Usually the best thing to do is just start. Stop staring at the blank page. Read more websites if you need more information to work with, but you should be able to get in at least a paragraph or two with 2 or 3 sources.

, Plan accordingly. If you have to have 2 pages of content, then plan for about 5 or 6 full, good, paragraphs. If you have 6 paragraphs, you need 6 subtopics. Go ahead and type out 6 or 7 subtopics you want to cover, and place them on your paper. If you must, do research on each subtopic to encourage you to write. Start writing, and don't let yourself take breaks until you have reached 2 pages.

, Remember to copy and paste each Web link you use onto the Works Cited page.

, Fix any spelling or grammatical errors. If you aren't doing in-text citations, double-check and make sure you used your own words. If you are doing in-text citations, be sure to add them in now before you forget.

, Go back and read each topic sentence per paragraph. If you need to, copy and paste each sentence into a messy paragraph together above where your conclusion paragraph will be. Reword the sentences, use conjunctions to combine some topics. Fix any grammatical or spelling errors and polish it up. Delete the topic sentences above your conclusion paragraph.

, Go and re-read your entire paper so far. Using what knowledge you now know of your topic, write an introduction paragraph which introduces each topic without giving too much information away. Anything that is in the introduction paragraph definitely should be covered in the paper, and also should be in the conclusion paragraph, reworded yet again.

, The title should always be last, not first. Sum up your entire project into one good title which will entice your reader in. Don't make it extremely long, nor too short. Use concise adverbs and adjectives to state your point, but don't use very descriptive words on a PhD level then use the vocabulary of a kindergartener for the rest of the paper.

, MLA formatting can get tricky, so go to a good website like citationmonster.com. Go to each link you currently have on your Works Cited page, copy and paste into your browser, and fill in the required information you need to have it automatically cited for you. Copy and paste, put in alphabetical order, fix the alignment, and you're done!

, If it's not too late, get a sibling or parent to read through it and give you some tips on some minor changes you might want to make. Save your work, and email it to your teacher or print it out. It's always best to print it out, in case your internet happens to not work or theirs doesn't work.

, You just wrote a paper better than half the class did in one night!

Learn how your college professor teaches.,
Consider using a specialized note-taking program.,
Use the Outline Note taking system if your professor follows a PowerPoint very closely, or bases most of the teachings around a PowerPoint.,
Use the Cornell Note taking system to just focus on main points.,
You may have to use different styles of notes for different classes.,
Learn your note styles in and out so that you can quickly reference to where certain things are in your notes.

,
Review your notes before and after classes.",How to Take Good College Notes," For example, if your college professor tends to use PowerPoint presentations but doesn't follow them word for word, it might be easier to use an Outline Note system instead of maybe copying the PowerPoint verbatim, or using Cornell Notes.;
, These can be invaluable organizational tools for educational success. They improve note-taking efficiency and come with features that any other word processor won't have. For example, look at Knowledge NoteBook.

, The Outline Note taking system is very simple, but certain tiny details aren't as easy to find. To do this style of note taking, you basically copy down whatever is on the PowerPoint verbatim in a system that looks like an outline (one point then sub-points below it, then further sub-points, etc) and adds in anything else that the professor happens to say.

, This system isn't good for those who like to copy down every little thing. This is more if you like to get the main things out of a lecture, or if your professor tends to go on and on. To do this style of note taking, take your notebook paper and draw a line horizontally at the top of your paper, and then draw a line vertically along the margin of the paper or a little wider if you write big. Start by tilting your notes with the title of the lecture. Then write main points on the left side of the vertical line and elaborate more on the right side. Studies done by Cornell University have shown that this is the most effective strategy for taking notes.

, Such as using the outline system for a history class, and the Cornell style for a psychology class.

,, This is proven to improve memory and raise grades.

Keep a positive attitude.,
Practice saying “no.”Some commitments are not worth your time or energy, and if you’re going to get through graduate school with a family, you’re going to have to learn when to say “no.” The particulars will vary depending on your particular situation, but in general:


You’ll have to say no to your partner on occasion.,

Celebrate milestones.",How to Handle Graduate School with a Family," Understand that even if you were an outstanding undergraduate (as most graduate students were), you will face an entirely different set of challenges in graduate school. The specific nature of your coursework, research, teaching, and laboratory obligations will vary tremendously depending on your field, your school, and your department, and so will your potential paychecks and funding packages, so do some research and figure out what, exactly, you’re signing up for.


Many department websites will answer your basic questions about particular programs, so start there to get a sense of what your obligations as a graduate student might be.
Consider contacting current students as well. Most programs have a Director of Graduate Studies who can put you in touch with students in your program. You can then send an email or two to ask more specific questions. Current students may have insights about the standard workload and funding packages, and – unlike the website – they may be forthcoming about the potential downsides of pursuing a degree in their department.;
, Graduate school is not something to do just because you can’t think of anything else to do with your life. No one should sink years of time, money, and energy into a graduate degree without being crystal clear about his or her goals and what is required to achieve them. This goes double for people with families. Know your reasons for pursuing a graduate degree, and do some extra research about what your opportunities will look like after graduate school – don’t just assume that your M.A. or Ph.D. will get you a wonderful job.


Many people in the academic world are reluctant to admit this, but the job market for academics is abysmal right now, especially in the humanities and social sciences. If you are pursuing a graduate degree in one of these fields, think twice: even if you go to a top program and do well, you may find yourself, five to ten years down the road, with an impressive Ph.D., considerable debt, and no job. For graduate students with a family, this might be especially troubling. Do your research, and go in with your eyes open (if at all).

, If you are married or in a committed relationship, it is imperative to discuss the upcoming challenges with your spouse or partner. For most people with families, beginning a graduate program will entail some combination of relocating, quitting jobs, creating a new budget, making new child-care arrangements, and re-evaluating the division of household labor. These are major, life-changing developments, so work to discuss them openly and honestly.


If your partner is not an academic, he or she may not fully understand what your new commitments will look like. Once you’ve done the research yourself, make sure you pass along your knowledge and clear up potential misunderstandings – let your partner know, for example, if you think you’ll need to work on weekends or travel for research.

, If your children are old enough to understand, you’ll need to discuss your plans openly with them as well. Remember that your decision to attend graduate school will change their lives, too: they will likely need to adjust to new schools or child-care facilities, changes in their schedules, and less time with you. Be up front with them, in a way that’s appropriate to their ages and maturity levels, and explain why you’re taking this path.

, Whatever your financial circumstances, graduate school is an expense to be considered carefully. Ideally, you should avoid going to graduate school, especially in the humanities and social sciences, unless you are fully funded by your program of choice – “fully funded” generally meaning that you receive a tuition waiver and a modest monthly stipend, often in exchange for teaching or laboratory duties. But people with families should be extra cautious, especially since “full funding” will probably not include money for expenses like child care.


Research child-care costs ahead of time.If you’ve been a stay-at-home parent and plan to pay for child care for the first time, you may have no idea how expensive these services can be. If you’re quitting a “real world” job to attend graduate school, you may not realize how insufficient your stipend will be once you subtract the costs of child care from it. Either way, you need to know what you’re getting into.
Be sure you look into any tax credits or deductions associated with child care costs.Factor in changes to your partner’s income, too. If you’re married or in a committed relationship, your partner’s income also needs to be assessed. Are you moving to attend graduate school? If so, your partner will probably have to find a new job – how will you pay the bills in the meantime? Will your decision to attend graduate school affect your partner’s work schedule or potential for overtime hours? If so, you need to consider that as well.

, You may be tempted to get as much financial aid as possible from the government, but though this decision might be appealing right now, it’s probably unwise in the long term. Ph.D. programs, especially, take a very long time; the debt will add up, and then, in the end, you’ll face the horrible academic job market. How will you pay it back?

, As you begin graduate school, pay attention to what’s going on around you. Are there other parents in your program? Do faculty members seem supportive of graduate students with outside responsibilities? How much time do successful graduate students seem to spend at the office? Are they studying at night and on the weekends? The answers to these questions will help you identify potential problems and adjust to the demands of your program as quickly as possible.

, Many universities have a family resource center or other services available to graduate students or young faculty.Tapping into these resources prior to committing to an institution is a good idea. The resource center can give you a sense of whether the university is family-friendly.
Some institutions even offer employment opportunities or collect job postings for spouses of graduate students., Most graduate students are assigned an advisor or mentor when they enter a program. Let this person know that you are a parent. He or she may have specific advice for you about balancing your family commitments with your academic responsibilities.If your assigned advisor is not sympathetic to your having a family, try to find another personal mentor who is more in-line with your perspective.
As with most interactions in graduate school, your tone and attitude matter here. Do not whine or complain to your advisor about how hard it is to balance school and family, and do not demand special treatment because you are a parent. You are learning to be a professional, so act like one. Strive for a confident “I can do this!” attitude, but be receptive to any advice or constructive criticism your advisor offers.

, The first skill that a graduate student with a family needs to develop isn’t an academic or intellectual one – it’s simple time management. Estimate how many hours a week you’ll need to spend on coursework, reading, and research; if applicable, estimate how many hours a week you’ll need to spend on teaching or laboratory obligations. Note important family obligations, and create a schedule that will allow you to get everything done. Then figure out how to stick to that schedule and maximize your productivity.


You may find, in the beginning, that you are not correctly estimating how long coursework, reading, or teaching preparation will take you. Consider asking a senior graduate student or two for help, at least until you have a better handle on what your responsibilities are. Senior graduate students may also be able to point out “hidden” work hours that you’re not aware of – academic work that’s “unofficial” but necessary, conferences and department events, and the like.
Time yourself. If you’ve allotted three hours of time for a particular task, set a timer and, unless the situation is truly desperate, make yourself stop at the appointed time. If you find again and again that you’re not completing your tasks within the allotted time, then you need to revise your schedule.
Consider actively limiting the unnecessary activities that are taking up too much of your time – Facebook and other social media, for example. Getting rid of Facebook (or setting firm limits on your Facebook time) may boost your productivity significantly.Be flexible. Know that the demands of graduate school will shift over time: you’ll have different courses and different teaching or laboratory duties, and different projects will begin and end. Your family obligations will shift, too, as your children grow up. What works this month may not work next month, so realize that you’ll have to continually revise your schedule.

, Learning to balance graduate school and family life is a challenge, and the first months of graduate school will likely be the most difficult. Ask for help. If you have a partner, see if he or she can take on some of the tasks that you have usually done, including meal preparation and laundry and other domestic tasks, at least temporarily. If you are fortunate enough to have nearby friends and relatives who want to help, accept their offers! They could babysit for you, bring occasional meals, or cover for you at a child’s activity.

, Don’t get so caught up in your new responsibilities that you neglect your older ones. Let your partner and children know that you care about how they are adjusting. If your adjustment process has left you moody, distant, or neglectful, apologize and let them know you will try to do better.

, The first months of graduate school can be overwhelming and difficult, even for people without children! Give yourself some time to adjust, and don’t feel like a failure if you are struggling. There’s a process involved here, and eventually, if you work hard and adapt where necessary, you will get to the place you need to be.

, Your spouse or partner might want you to go to the movies on a Saturday afternoon, but if you have a paper due the next week, you may have to turn down the offer. These situations can fuel resentment, though, so proceed with caution and make sure you’re discussing these tensions openly.
You’ll have to say no to your children regularly. If you are going to succeed at graduate school, you won’t be able to let your children participate in every activity that appeals to them or accept every party invitation they receive. Explain this to them as clearly as you can.
You’ll have to limit the extra obligations you take on for your children’s schools and child-care centers. If you are already serving on a PTA committee, for example, say “no” when someone calls to ask you to join another. Resist the urge to take on unnecessary fundraising or volunteer work.
You’ll have to learn to say “no” to certain academic opportunities. This can be a minefield: you don’t want to sabotage your success as a graduate student, alienate your advisor or professors, or miss crucial opportunities. Still, you cannot do everything. Realize that it’s okay to miss an occasional department event, turn down an opportunity to speak at a conference, or pass up an active role in a department organization.

, Some commitments are basically non-negotiable. The particulars will again vary according to your personal circumstances, but in general:


You’ll need to differentiate between your family’s “wants” and “needs.”If you say “no” to your partner too often, he or she will feel neglected, unloved, angry, and resentful, and that’s not fair. Know when you need to spend more time with your partner or relieve him or her of some household chores. The same goes for your children: don’t neglect their needs in the name of your academic career. Be sure you are spending enough time with them and letting them do some fun activities.
You’ll need to recognize what’s necessary for success in graduate school. Know that doing the bare minimum to get over each hurdle and earn your degree may not be enough to get you to your goals; in some situations – but not all! – you’ll also need to excel and impress people. Say yes to enough academic commitments, departmental events, conferences in your field, and travel for research to ensure the level of success you want.

, In general, it’s a good strategy to have your academic work done in advance, so if a major seminar paper is due on a given Friday, aim to have yours done the Friday before that. Making these early deadlines for yourself gives you a cushion so that you’re not turning in things late whenever unforeseen issues come up. When you have a family, unforeseen issues come up all the time! Your child will get sick; you’ll be called to a parent-teacher conference; your partner will have a problem at work. You don’t want to realize at the very last minute that you won’t have the time to get something accomplished.

, Many graduate students are perfectionists; they work hard and want everything they do to be A+ quality. Ultimately, though, this perfectionism will stand in your way – at school and at home – preventing you from getting things accomplished and enjoying your life.You don’t want to be a slacker or be known for mediocre work, but you don’t have to exhaust yourself trying to be the best at everything.


Realize that most academic tasks are hurdles to be jumped over, not monumental efforts that demand genius or perfection. Don’t be so hard on yourself.
It is better to turn in a paper on time, assuming the quality is reasonable for your program, than to ask for extensions. Get it done and over with, even if you think you can do it better; don’t dig yourself into academic “debt” by letting tasks hang around on your calendar too long.
Let go of your desire to keep a perfectly clean house and to be the perfect parent. It won’t happen, and spending unnecessary hours trying to make it happen will only result in frustration and exhaustion.

, But it’s better to carve out some time. Attending a party or having drinks or dinner with friends now and then will revitalize you and remind you that you are a person outside of parenthood and academia.


Try to socialize sometimes with people in your program and other times with people who are not in your program. Both kinds of friends are valuable. Your academic friends can commiserate with you about graduate school, and your non-academic friends can remind you of your life outside of it.

, If possible, reserve Saturday or Sunday as a non-working day. This practice will give you scheduled time for your family, and believe it or not, the rest may make you a better student when you return to your work.

, When you are feeling sad about not having more time with your family, remember that you are setting an example for your children. It can be such a good thing, having them see you as someone who is working long and hard to achieve a long-term goal. When they are grown, they will remember that you did that, and it may inspire them to work hard for their own goals.

, Graduate school can be a long haul. Don’t wait until you get the degree to celebrate your accomplishments – take pride in the smaller steps along the way! When you finish a paper, present at a conference, pass exams, publish an article, or teach a great class, enjoy the moment, and make sure your family gets to celebrate with you.

Practice taking multiple choice tests.,
Spread your study out over several days.,
Follow a few guidelines when taking the test.,
Study with a friend.",How to Study for the Patent Bar1," The patent bar consists of 100 multiple-choice questions. To study for taking a multiple choice test, simulate the activity ahead of time by taking other multiple choice tests. The most important thing is to practice answering questions that you haven't asked yourself.

The information for the patent bar comes from the Manual of Patent Examining Procedure (MPEP). Once you've prepared to take the exam, have a study partner prepare questions for you based on this material.
Take other sorts of multiple choices test. Although the material may be different, you should try hard to do your best in order to simulate the tension of an actual exam.;
, Rather than cramming the information needed to pass a test, research suggests that you'll retain the information more accurately if you spend the same amount of time over several days.Begin studying early. If you have more time to space out your study sessions, you'll be more likely to retain what you learn.
If you have a very busy schedule, make sure that you set aside for studying several hours, multiple times per week.

, These aren't absolute, but general guidelines that are often true when taking multiple choice exams, like the patent bar. These guidelines are drawn from multiple choice exams in many disciplines.In a multiple choice exam like the patent bar, the answers are usually not found in absolutes. If you see words like ""always"" or ""never"", these answers are more likely to be false than answers including the words ""sometimes"" or ""often"".
""All of the above"" as an option is often correct. ""None of the above"" is less likely to be true.
If you can't answer a question in less than 60 seconds, skip it and come back to it later. Sometimes you just need to move on.
If you have to guess at an answer, chose a middle response, i.e. the answer marked b or c. This is more likely to be correct.

, If possible, study for the patent bar with a friend. Having a study partner will help you stay focused on studying. If they're also studying for the patent bar, you can work together on learning the material and test each others knowledge.Studying with a partner allows you to benefit from the other person's strengths. A friend can help you understand things that you may not get on your own.
Many people are more motivated to study if it's a social activity. If you want to study, you'll be more likely to do it.

Earn a bachelor's degree.,
Get an official transcript from your college.,
Have sufficient credit hours in recognized disciplines.",How to Study for the Patent Bar2," Getting a bachelor's degree in a recognized scientific or technical discipline is one of the primary ways a person becomes qualified to take the patent bar exam. The person will have to prove to the licensing board that she has the required knowledge to take on patent law.Earning the equivalent to a bachelor's degree in a non-US university is also permissible.
There is an exception if your degree is in computer science. Your degree must be accredited by the Computer Science Accreditation Commission (CSAC) of the Computing Sciences Accreditation Board (CSAB), or by the Computing Accreditation Commission (CAC) of the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET).

, A copy of your diploma or the transcript will not be sufficient. You'll need to make sure that the transcript comes directly from your university program.


You can get a transcript by calling or emailing your university.
There is usually a fee associated with requesting this service.

, If your bachelor's degree is in an area of study other than the ones above, you may still qualify for the patent bar. To establish that you possess sufficient scientific and technical training, you must have earned a minimum number of semester hours in certain courses. Usually, this means about 2 years worth of coursework.

Semester hours must be in the fields of physics, chemistry, biology and related fields. Only courses listed for majors in these disciplines are accepted.
You may also choose to take the Fundamentals of Engineering test. If you pass this test, you may have a degree in any field, and still qualify to take the patent bar.
For more information about specific requirements regarding educational qualifications, see "

Take a home study course.,
Attend a week-long seminar.,
Study on your own.",How to Study for the Patent Bar3," There are multiple options for preparing to take the patent bar. One of the most popular options is the PatBar Professional Education Program. It consists of written worksheets, handbooks, audio CDs.Other options include OmniPrep, Bullseye, Patent Education Series, and TAPRE.
These courses focus on questions drawn from the most highly tested sections of the Manual of Patent Examining Procedure (MPEP). The instruction aims to clarify the more confusing questions generally found on the patent bar.

, Patent Resources Group and PLI (Practice Law Institute) offer week-long trainings in how to take the Patent Bar. These courses are held in many major metropolitan centers throughout the United States.The cost for the Patent Resources Group is about $2000, while the PLi costs nearly $3000.
Both are respected programs and improve your chances of passing the Patent Bar.

, The material on the Patent Bar will be taken from the Manual of Patent Examining Procedure (MPEP). However, the material in this 2000-page manual is very dense, technical and concentrated. Studying it on your own is generally not considered the most effective way to prepare for the exam.The overall pass rate for the Patent Bar is much lower than in other bar exams. About half of all exam takers fail the first time around.
Once your application is accepted, you have 90 days to take the exam.

Do not chose a college by the friend or your boyfriend/girlfriend who will be attending with you or currently attends there.,
Seriously consider what subjects you want to study.,
You have to like the place.,
Do you know what career you want or what your next step is after college?,
Make time for the people in your life.,
The only reason you should ever say no to going to that party you really want to go to is if you have an exam the next day.,
Driving lessons, dentist and doctor appointments, the gym, part time jobs, hairdressers appointments... all are important.,
Think about your day; is there any time in it wasted?,
Don't spread yourself too thinly.,
If you don't understand something, ask immediately.,
Try to get a copy of the specification for your exam; mark off in one colour the things you have covered in class (and if anything goes uncovered by the time your exam is near, tell your teacher so they can correct the problem) and in another colour the things you feel you can do; so you can plan your revision time to sort out the problems in your knowledge rather than spending time on what you do know.

Before you go to bed every night think about what you learnt in each lesson today.",How to Survive A Levels," It's nice to know people, but generally everyone will want to make you feel welcome. People have left behind the silliness of compulsory school and are ready to make new friends. Sometimes it can hold you back to be clinging to or clung on to by an old friend in a new environment; and every relationship can benefit from space and time to miss each other. If you and your boyfriend/girlfriend were to break up college would be very uncomfortable for you both.;
, Pick things you are interested in, want a job in, and are doing well in currently at school; these are generally the subjects you are more likely to commit to and put effort into to study. Not all subjects are taught at every establishment and entry grades may vary so you may have to practise your research skills early.

, Could you imagine yourself there? If you are big into sport you might like to check out their sport clubs and facilities. Have they got enough study spaces you could chose from? If you learn and revise better in school, do their teachers seem helpful, willing and enthusiastic about their subject? If think meeting new people is important, will the common room help you socialise?

, This can help you chose your subjects that will help you in the future, and you have to have a goal to motivate yourself. If you want to go to university that can be your goal; you are studying to get to that place in life where you know you want to be, and it would be a shame to let yourself down.

, You could spend your entire time studying forever; and you would probably do really well in your final exams, but you would be lonely. Sometimes you just need a good party or a get together with your friends from your old school. Organise activities; parties if you're allowed, bowling trips, meals out, days out, ice skating trips, days in the sun and days in the snow, shopping trips to town, swimming, a sleepover. And don't forget your family either, a meal out or a cinema trip with them can be just lovely, its nice to feel loved and a part of a family. You have been blessed with all the lovely people in your life; you have to make the most of every second with them.

, It would be stupid to revise for weeks beforehand to fail for one good night and a nasty hangover the next day. You will thank yourself for not going when the friends that did go fail.

, You have to look after yourself, and get out into different parts of the world; a part time job and driving lessons will give you skills for life. If you do have a part time job try to find one you enjoy, pays reasonably well and keep the hours reasonable, too. 12 hours is plenty when you have studying and socialising to get on with too.

, Sometimes you can sneak in a bit of homework/coursework in your break-time or free periods; giving you more time for life at home.

, Everyone has days where its all so hard to juggle, but at the end of it all you just have to ask yourself is it better to come out with B's and C's and happy memories of the 2 years than to come out with A's/A*'s and a miserable 2 years and few friends? It is your decision to make.

, Sort the problem out before it escalates.

,, Rehearsal makes information enter your memory. If you can remember great, if not read your notes before you go to bed. Sort it out before the day ends.

Form a study group.",How to Study Contract Law," Preparing for class will most likely involve reading a substantial number of judicial decisions (""cases"") and background information on the theories of contract law out of a textbook. This reading is really important to not only read, but to understand. The law of contracts is based on state common law, which means your reading will mostly involve important state judicial decisions concerning different aspects of the law of contracts.


Take notes while you are reading. If you are reading a case, you can brief it. Briefing a case involves reading a case and outlining the facts of the case, the legal issues of the case, and the holdings (legal rulings) of the case.If you are reading about theories of the law or anything else, you can take normal notes like you would for any other class. Make sure you format these notes in a way that is easily accessible to you as you may need them in class if you are called on to participate.
Take your time and consider reading the material more than once. Legal reading is often dense and long. If you are a new law student, the reading material may be more difficult to get through because you are not yet used to the type of material you are looking through and what you are expected to digest.Also, because contract law is mostly based on case law, your reading load may be even larger due to the length and complexity of some of the cases.
For example, if you are in a contracts class and you are learning about the formation of contracts and mutual assent, you are going to be given an assignment that is likely to contain background information on what is considered mutual assent. The textbook may tell you that one way mutual assent is formed is by a valid offer and a valid acceptance and that both parties must objectively manifest their assent in order to be bound by a contract. After giving you some background information, a textbook may then give you a number of cases that illustrate the law of mutual assent. A textbook may provide you with the seminal cases of Kabil Developments v. Mignot, James v. McDonald's, and Lucy v. Zehmer. You will read this background information and the related cases, take notes and/or brief the cases, and then read the material again if there is anything you do not fully understand.;
, As soon as possible after your contracts lecture, you should synthesize your notes from that day's class into a coherent outline. Oftentimes your notes from a class will be messy and ill-formatted. This happens because you are trying to participate in class, listen to your peers, and take notes, all at the same time. Outlining your lecture notes does a number of important things:


It allows you to look back over the day's material and gives you another chance to digest the information. This is important because contract law classes will build on each other and the more times you can read and look through class material, the more likely it is that you will understand and remember it.
It allows you to synthesize the information into a meaningful outline that will make studying for classes and tests much easier. While you are in law school, it may seem like there is not enough time in a day to get through everything you need to do. Preparing outlines from your notes is a great way to manage your time and will make things easier when the time comes to prepare for tests. For example, you can choose to spend an extra hour after your contracts class in order to outline your lecture notes, or you can choose to spend an extra day at the end of the semester trying to outline your lecture notes from the entire semester.

, Right before class, take a look at your outlines from all the previous contract classes you have had to date. This exercise will provide you with the opportunity to constantly reinforce the content and will put you in a good position to participate in class. This is also important because of the cumulative nature of a contracts class. What you will be discussing in one day's class is likely to relate to what will be discussed in all future classes.


For example, if you are in the middle of your semester and you are learning about the enforceability of contracts, you will be expected to fully understand how a contract is formed. If you go back in your notes before every class, you will likely remember that a contract is formed when there is an offer, acceptance, and consideration. This is important when discussing the enforceability of a contract because without a validly formed contract there will be nothing to enforce (i.e., you will have to go through a formation analysis before you can start to question the enforceability of an agreement).

, Law school lectures are imperative to attend and participate in. When you walk into your first contract law class, you will likely encounter the famed Socratic Method (or ""cold-calling""). The Socratic Method involves the professor asking random students a series of questions aimed at fostering a healthy discussion about the day's topics.Students will be expected to participate and do their best at answering the questions being posed.While this may seem scary at first, you should understand that professors are not trying to embarrass or intimidate you, this method is used to develop critical thinking skills and enables you to begin to think like lawyers.Most of class will be spent having a healthy discussion about the day's topic with the professor utilizing the Socratic Method where he or she feels it is necessary.

, When you attend your contracts law lecture, you will want to bring either a notepad or a computer. Use these materials to take notes during class. Some professors will allow computers in class while others will not.


Figure out how you take notes most effectively. While some people like using computers because they can type faster than they can write, others get distracted on computers and do not take good notes. Also, taking notes on a computer may make it easier to outline your lecture materials at the end of each class. However, some people like taking handwritten notes because it forces them to re-write the content when they create an outline, whereas if you use a computer you can just copy and paste.

, While you are in class, you may be asked to participate, either voluntarily or not. If you are cold-called, take time to digest the question and to formulate a concise answer. If you do not understand the question or you do not know the answer, be honest. It is incredibly unlikely you will know everything coming into class and professors understand this. Try to work through the question and learn as you go. If you are participating voluntarily, be sure to only offer thoughtful, concise, and relevant information. You do not want to participate simply to participate; you should want to participate in order to further the discussion and provide insight.


For example, if you are asked to discuss whether a television advertisement is an offer to enter into a contract or if it is simply a solicitation, you will likely have read a case titled Leonard v. Pepsi Co.. In this situation, you would tell your professor that in the case of Leonard v. Pepsi Co., a child bought a number of Pepsi cans during a promotion in which Pepsi was offering points for every Pepsi bought, and that those points could be redeemed for prizes. You would then state that the child saw a Pepsi commercial in which a kid redeemed his points for a real fighter jet. After stating the basic facts of the case, you would convey to your professor that the issue was whether that commercial was an offer to redeem your points for a fighter jet, and that the court held the advertisement was not an offer but only a solicitation for an offer.

, When you are in class and a discussion arises, do not assume that only the professor can give you valuable information. In law school, professors may expect classmates to provide the class with the important information necessary, and they will often use the Socratic Method in order to extract that information from your peers. When your classmates are talking, be sure to listen and take notes about what they say just as you would take notes about your professor's comments. If you did not understand something or you need clarification, raise your hand and ask to hear things again. In all likelihood, you will not be the only one with the same question.


In the example above regarding Leonard v. Pepsi Co., you can begin to see how a classmate may provide valuable information. In that scenario, your classmate is telling you that advertisements are normally not offers and that Leonard v. Pepsi co. is the seminal case regarding that point of contract law.

, The final task in most law school classes will be in the form of a final exam (or you may have both a midterm and a final exam). This exam is often the main source of your final grade along with your participation rating. Law school tests are often formed as essay exams (""issue spotters"") and will involve reading a hypothetical scenario and applying the case law and legal theories you have learned throughout the semester.These tests are meant to gauge your understanding of the elements of contract law and the theories underlying them.A common contracts question may look like the following: ""In an effort to reduce judicial discretion and create more predictable laws, a powerful Senator would like to propose legislation mandating that all judges fill gaps in incomplete contracts by using a single type of default rule, and there is a very good chance that such legislation will pass. You are the Senator's assistant, and she has charged you with the task of drafting a brief memorandum, not to exceed four or five pages, which (1) discusses the various ways judges currently choose default rules, (2) recommends a single type of default rule that should be implied in every case where there is an incomplete contract, and (3) suggests what likely consequences would result by mandating this default rule. The Senator was formerly a Contracts professor, so you may, if you like, discuss specific cases or rules that would likely change, and how they would change."", When all of your classes are completed and final exams are approaching, you will want to start the studying process by making a comprehensive outline of your entire contract law class. This outline will be the basis of all your other studying, so be sure it is complete and accurate. When making an outline, be sure to structure it in some logical manner. Looking at your textbook's table of contents may provide an easy and valuable way to structure your outline. Bold important terms so they stick out in your outline.


To create a valuable outline, take all of your individual class outlines and synthesize the information again into one ultimate outline. Try to not simply compile all of your individual class outlines, but instead try to reorganize the information and process it all again. This will help you learn the material by forcing you to read through it while you are creating your ultimate outline. If you did not create individual class outlines, go through your class notes and create an outline using those. If you are in this position, be sure to give yourself enough time to go through all of your notes in order to distill the important information you want to include.
Look through your textbook and add any valuable information from it to your outline. It is inevitable that your class notes and class outlines will have some holes. Fill those holes by looking back through your textbook and supplementing your information where necessary.
Use any other information you have at your disposal. Ask your peers for help if you have an area in your outline that you have questions about. Go visit your professor as well; he or she will often be a good source of information and will help guide you in your studying process. Use the library and the library staff. They will often be able to point you to handbooks and other materials that provide general information on the law of contracts.
A common contracts outline would include information on contract formation, enforceability, interpretation, defenses to performance, conditions, material breaches, and remedies. Remember that your contracts class may not cover some of these topics so be sure you make an outline that coincides with what you learned throughout the semester.

, Once you have created an ultimate outline, quiz yourself while you are reading through it. Ask yourself if you understand the concepts and theories you are reading and try explaining them in your own words. Taking the time to quiz yourself will ensure you are not just reading the outline but really digesting and understanding it.


For example, read a section of your outline then try to write down the important parts of that section without looking back at the outline itself. Once you are done, look at what you wrote and see what information you understand and what information you need to spend more time on.
Try making flashcards using information from your outline. Flashcards offer a great way to quiz yourself on important legal concepts. Write the legal term or concept on the front of the flashcard and the definition or explanation on the back. For example, one flashcard may have ""acceptance"" on one side and ""a manifestation of assent"" on the other side. Go through them multiple times and take out cards as you learn them.

, When you are tired of looking at your ultimate outline, try going online and looking at some of the websites out there that provide interactive learning tools to law students. These tools often take the form of practice quizzes, interactive online flashcards, and other outlines.


Visit the Golden Gate University School of Law. The law school offers free downloads of past exams and answers for every class. Several contract law class exams are available.
Visit this virtual flashcard website that provides flashcards with key contract issues.
Ask your professor if there are any websites he or she would recommend. They often stay up-to-date on what materials are out there and they may have some good suggestions.
Be aware that some of the material you find online will not be relevant to your class. Some classes cover different materials so be sure you are only studying things you need for your class and your exam. For example, some contracts classes may cover the Uniform Commercial Code while other classes may not. If your class did not cover this material, do not waste time studying it on a generic contract law website.

, One of the best ways to prepare for an exam is to take one. Your professor will often hand out a practice exam on the last day of the class for you to look over and even take. Use this material to your advantage and take the time to complete the exam under testing pressures. This means you should take the test under the same time constraints you will have during the real exam and you should take it with or without notes, depending on what you will be allowed to use in the actual exam.


When you finish the practice exam, do not just put it to the side and continue to look over our outline. Analyze how you did on the practice exam in order to learn where you can improve. If you did not finish in time, think about what you need to do on the real exam to successfully complete the test. If you did not know how to answer a question, look through your outline in order to better grasp the theories you did not understand.
Look here for some sample contracts exams.

, Study groups can be an excellent way to learn. Look through this document for great tips on how to form an effective study group.


Effective study groups have 3-5 members;
Study groups should meet at least once a week at specific times and places;
Group members should select a group leader or facilitator whose job is to keep the group on track;
Group members should decide at the end of each meeting what will be covered at the next meeting so everyone can be prepared; and
Try not to spend all of the meeting time working on homework problems; some time should be spent making sure that all of the group members understand each of the concepts discussed in the chapter and/or the lecture."

Don't let yourself feel overwhelmed or intimidated. Believe in yourself and your ability to meet this challenge.
Don't think about worst-case scenarios. Manage your time, and try to look on the bright side of your study situation, even if it's unpleasant or stressful.
See each obstacle as an opportunity to learn and grow.
Don't compare your grades to anyone else's. Competitive thinking will only stress you out further.;
, Staying on schedule can help you manage your time and your workload, and may make it easier to focus on the task at hand.Try entering a ""date"" with yourself to study in your planner or calendar. You may be more likely to take your study sessions as a serious responsibility if they're formal appointments with yourself.

, Studies suggest that alternating where a person studies can actually improve information retention.Know whether you work best in a quiet space or with ambient noise.
Try studying with the windows open (weather permitting). Researchers have found fresh air to be energizing and revitalizing., You shouldn't be so comfortable that you'll fall asleep, but feeling uncomfortable can make it difficult to concentrate. Set up a comfortable atmosphere conducive to studying.


Choose a chair that will be comfortable to sit on for upwards of one hour at a time. Use a desk or table so you can spread out your study materials.Avoid your bed. You might get so comfortable that you don't study. Associating other activities than sleep with your bed can also make it harder for you to sleep well., Turn your cell phone and TV off and resist the urge to check your social media accounts. These kinds of distractions can deter you from work and can make it difficult to retain information you are learning.You may think that you're a good multi-tasker, but st

, Breaking up the material you need to cover into small, manageable chunks is more effective than trying to memorize everything all at once. Cover material in shorter sessions over a period of several days or even weeks for the best results., This will keep you awake and help you focus as you read, study, and prepare for class. Studies have shown that caffeine not only helps you feel alert, it may help improve your memory.Just don't overdo it. Too much caffeine can make you feel jittery, anxious, or stressed-out. Experts recommend that kids and teens limit their consumption of caffeine to 100-200mg per day. That's just 1-2 cups of coffee, 1-3 Red Bulls, or 3-6 colas., Studies show that making cardio workouts a part of your routine can improve memory and overall mental health., Researchers have found that students who study together in groups tend to perform better on tests and quizzes., Ask your instructor's permission before recording any part of your class sessions. With his or her permission, use an audio recording device during class. If you're using a digital recorder, convert the file into an mp3 and listen to your lecture while you're commuting or working out in the morning.

, Write down important ideas, concepts, names, and dates, rather than trying to take down every single word your instructor is saying., This should be done immediately after class, if possible. If you cannot study right after class has ended, studying as soon as possible that day is crucial, as most in-class information is forgotten after 24 hours.Read through each line of notes slowly and carefully.
Ask your instructor about anything that doesn't make sense or is unclear to you.

, This will allow you to compile the most vital information in one place, and can help you make more sense of the notes you took in class. But don't just copy the material mindlessly! Rephrasing class notes in your own words will also help you understand the material beyond simply re-stating what you've been told., This will help reinforce the things you learned that week, and may help you contextualize each day's lesson better within the framework of the entire week's lesson plan., Color-coding your notes by lesson or topic may be helpful, or try using a series of folders to create an orderly system.Try different organization methods until you find one that works right for you. This may include organizing handouts separate from notes, or organizing everything by date, by chapter, or by topic.

, Flashcards can help you memorize important names, dates, places, events, and concepts. They can be used for nearly every single subject taught in school.Choose the most important names, dates, concepts, etc.
Write the name on one side and the definition on the back. For math formulae, write the equation on one side and the solution on the back.
Quiz yourself. Once you've mastered giving the definition or solution based on the front of the card, try quizzing yourself by going through the cards in reverse - that is, read the definition or solution on the ""back"" of the card and challenge yourself to give the correct term or equation written on the ""front"" of the card.
Break your flashcards up into manageable sections. Just as cramming from notes/lesson plans is ill-advised, research has shown that the strategy called ""spacing"" is also more effective than cramming when it comes to flashcards. Don't try to learn more than 10-12 flashcards at a time., Associating names or terms with something simple to remember can make it easier to memorize information from your notes.Don't get too complex with your mnemonic devices. They should be easy to remember and simple to apply on a test.
Song lyrics might be easiest to use. If you get stuck, try humming the song's rhythm to yourself, associating the lyrics with whatever material you're trying to memorize., You don't have to be chained to a desk to study. Use technology to liberate your study sessions so you can study anytime, anywhere.Many mobile apps will allow you to create flashcards. You can review them anywhere, whether you're standing in line at the store or riding the bus.
Try recording your notes in a wiki or blog. You can tag these posts with relevant keywords, making finding your material a snap when it comes time to study. You can also review them anywhere you have an internet connection.

, Look for text written in bold or italics, or off-set in a chart or graph. Also look for sections at the end of each chapter that condenses the key concepts from that unit. Information presented in any of these ways tends to be of the highest importance when teachers prepare a test on that chapter or section.If you're studying a creative work, such as a play or novel, look for patterns and themes. Motifs (elements that carry additional meaning, such as darkness, blood, gold) may repeat across the text, suggesting that they’re important to pay attention to. “Big ideas” are also good to focus on.
If your teacher permits it, you can use a study guide such as Cliffs Notes or Shmoop to help you understand the plot, so that you can focus on more important themes and patterns. Don’t rely on these guides to tell you everything you need to know! Use them only as supplements to other study and reading techniques.

, Now that you've skimmed the chapter and made note of the key concepts, read the whole section at least once, paying attention to details and taking notes along the way. This will allow you to understand the material and contextualize that chapter within the larger unit.

, Active reading, which involves asking questions of the reading and taking notes, is proven to be more effective and efficient than passively reading through just to finish the chapter.Draw a bracket around key concepts in the chapter, and circle any terms or names you're not familiar with.
Write questions in the margins as you read, then find the answers to those questions., This will help you make better sense of the material and will help you remember those concepts more concretely.Remember that restating can also condense and focus. As you restate, make sure you pay attention to what seems most important.
For example, consider this passage: “Students frequently overuse direct quotation in taking notes, and as a result they overuse quotations in the final paper. Probably only about 10% of your final manuscript should appear as directly quoted matter. Therefore, you should strive to limit the amount of exact transcribing of source materials while taking notes.” Lester, James D. Writing Research Papers. 2nd ed. (1976): 46-47.A restatement of the key concept could look like this: “Take fewer direct quotations in notes bc too many could cause over-quotation in final paper. 10% max quotes in final.”
As you can see, this has captured the most important information from the passage, but it’s in your own words, and it’s much shorter -- meaning it will be easier to remember later.

, Go over your notes and any flashcards you've made. Quiz yourself once you've read through all of your notes several times through. You should be able to recall most of the key concepts, names, and dates. Repeat this review process as often as necessary to keep the information in your mind as you prepare for upcoming quizzes and tests., Studies have found that the most efficient way to study is in short bursts, typically in 1-3 hour increments. Give yourself several days, each with several sessions, to prepare., Research suggests that studying related but varied material in one sitting is more efficient and effective than studying just one subject material in a given session.You can also try to relate material you’re learning to stuff you already know. You can even create connections between new material and pop culture. You’re more likely to remember new material if it’s linked to things you’re already familiar with."

Wear your clothes more than once.",How to Slack Off During Your Final Year in College and Still Succeed," Do your best to avoid taking a class before lunch. This rule may apply to your entire college career but it's even more important during the final year. Not only can you justify it on the grounds that you spent all night... studying... but you might be able to find those professors who prefer late afternoon and evening lectures and tutorials too. Put it this way––you're going to be getting up to work for the man everyday at 5am or 6am for the rest of your life. Now is the last great opportunity to sleep in and bask in the afterglow of slack.


A number of courses try to accommodate full-timer workers who can only make evening classes. Possibly these are the ones you should be aiming for too.;
, This maneuver may take a certain level of charm on your behalf (and legal bribery), but is well worth it if you can pull it off. Even better though is if you're in a class where the lecturer records the lectures for YouTube or iTunes––that way you don't have to con anyone into feeding you their hard-won notes.


Identify an eager student in your class and befriend the student. Sit next to him or her during every class for first term. By second term, start giving vague reasons for your need to be absent (doctor's appointments are good or a story that you have difficulty writing the notes due to a hand injury sustained in a terrible motorcycle accident...) and because you're already firm friends, you can tug on their allegiance to you to get their notes. Keep it cool and at least buy them a drink now and then to reciprocate (and make it dinner for going beyond the call of duty).
Even better, tee up absenteeism between you. You do lectures they hate, they do lectures you hate. That way, you can share the load and get time off. How cool is that!
You'll be busted if attendance forms part of the course marks. It's a little hard to send in a doppelganger, especially a doppelganger who has read the week's work and can answer coherently. Obviously, use your common sense here.
When revising, refer to your class recordings as well as the other student’s notes before exam time, which together should form a neat, comprehensive study guide that you didn’t have to write out.

, Even though you're recording the lecture, absolutely try to listen to what the professor says. While listening to what your professor says may go against the code of laziness, it will be to your benefit come exam time because it sticks in your mind without too much trouble. Often, being present is better than reading reams of notes. And if you are on the bleary side of listening, the recording is your back-up device.

, Instead of leaving it all to cramming or writing at the last minute, do a little every day. Carry notes around with you for those wasted moments like standing at the bar waiting to order a drink or waiting for a taxicab back to campus. With small note card prompts or eReader notes, you could be revising instead of standing about idly, so make the most of every single opportunity, including when watching your clothes dry in the local laundromat.

, While it is important to sleep soundly, there are going to be times when your sleep schedule is interrupted by parties, cramming and getting that experiment finished before your supervisor works out you've done zilch on it so far... In this case, make the most of napping and sleeping during lectures.


Sleep with your eyes open. This is more like meditating but it lets you look as if you're paying attention, all the while catching up on some zzz's during a dull lecture. Mastering this feat will provide you with numerous opportunities to catch up on sleep.

Find a focal point in the room and stare directly at the item. Allow yourself to go into a meditative state and relax your mind and body.
Try to block out any sounds or activity around you.
Prop your head up by resting it on your hand or relax it into the back of your chair.
Zone out. Don’t go completely into a REM state of sleep, but simply zone out. Be aware of drooling, farting or even subconscious talking, which could get you busted and totally embarrassed.


The other beneficial way of catching up on sleep is to nap during the day, around midday. Don't sleep later 1pm though or it can interfere with your ability to go to sleep at night. Twenty minutes to an hour can refresh you for the remainder of the day. Churchill used to nap at around lunchtime for an hour during his war premiership years, enabling him to stay awake until 2am every morning and still get up early. This sort of thing might work in fantastically with your busy yet slack schedule.

, Either choose to eat in the campus cafe a lot (go for the healthier meals) or find cheap take outs in the local area. In your room, stock up on two minute noodles and buy fresh veggies to add to them. Eat lots of fruit; this has the beauty of being something you can tote and eat anywhere without cooking and it's good for you.


Have a snack cupboard stocked up for quick grabbing. Refill it once a week to save constant excuses for wandering off to the store during the week, which will waste time.

, Washing clothes can chew up hours. Restore this time for more interesting pursuits by wearing as much as you can. Wear all clothes at least twice, with the exception of underwear (which can be washed as you shower anyway). T-shirts and shirts can be worn at least twice before washing, and pants (trousers), shorts, skirts and dresses can be worn many days before washing is needed. The tighter and less breathable the item, the more often it needs washing, while the looser and more breathable it is, the more wear it can withstand, so buy wisely! Ways to keep your clothing smelling fresh include:


Use deodorant every day. As annoying as that sounds, it’s easier to slap on a little Speed Stick than have to actually go through the process of taking off the shirt and finding a new one.
Apply liberal amounts of fabric air freshener to your entire body every single day. Febreeze has some nice scents that are good for both your clothing and the nasty smelling couch. Don't do this if you're worried about what chemicals are in such fabric air fresheners though––they're not made for direct human contact.
Wipe food stains off your shirt and pants the moment they happen. Spray stains immediately with either Spray and Wash or you can dip a napkin in your club soda and vodka drink and dab it on whatever is oozing all over your shirt. This may sound nitpicking but the time saved on an item of clothing rescued from a stain can be well worth the effort (let alone the fact you get to keep the item longer).

, Write your letter in a formal, business format. It should be typed, dated, and signed, and use a formal tone.Start by giving thanks for any aid you have already received. This is courteous, and lets your school know that you appreciate the aid and would value any more that you can receive.


Try writing something like: “I am a student at , currently receiving financial aid. I deeply appreciate the financial aid I currently receive, which is helping me to succeed in . However, I have experienced financial hardship, and would like to appeal my financial aid status.”

, Write that you have a gap between your EFC and the amount you can actually contribute, based on a qualified change in financial status.


Begin by writing something like: “Because of circumstances beyond our control, my family has experienced a significant change in financial status, making it impossible to meet my previous expected family contribution. I am requesting that my EFC and financial aid award be reviewed in the light of these circumstances.""
Next, explain the cause of the financial hardship. Be specific about what has changed. For example, if your parent experienced a significant change in income, list the previous income, the current income, and the reason for the change.
Be honest about the change, and about the amount you can contribute to your education-related expenses. Explain exactly what has happened, but do not exaggerate or lie. If you are dishonest, it will backfire and likely disqualify you from receiving any financial aid.
Provide as much documentation of your need for financial aid as you can, according to what your school requests. For example, your financial aid office may advise you to include copies of tax forms or income records for you or your parents.

, Close your letter by thanking your school for its consideration of your request, and assure the financial aid office that you will continue to succeed in your educational program.


Try writing something like: “I appreciate the Office of Financial Aid taking the time to review my appeal. An increase in my financial aid award will provide the support I absolutely need to continue my academic program. I am proud to be a member of the community at , value the education it provides, and look forward to completing my program in .

Make a to-do list to help focus on completing tasks.,
Overcome your anxiety about the task.,
Remove any distractions.,
Find something pleasant about the task.,
Make realistic micro-goals.,
Commit to starting the task regularly.When you make your list or goals you will need to start them to finish them.,
Reward yourself when you accomplish your goals.Even your micro-goals.,
Join a study group to encourage each other to study regularly.",How to Stop Procrastinating in College1," Write down everything you need to do on that list, even if it's not related to your college work. The goal here is to create a list so you can stop worrying about stuff on the bottom of the list while working on things at the top of the list.Always sort and rank your items with highest priority at the top. These are things that are important and time-sensitive. You’ll feel better as you complete the most important tasks first. This will boost your morale and give you motivation for the next task.
Make sure to focus your list on things you like to put off, not just things you do on a regular basis. Typically what you do on a regular basis will get done even if you don't put it on the list.
Try not to deviate from your list too much. This is giving into procrastination. If as time has passed your priorities have changed, rewrite the list to reflect your current priorities. However, don't spend so much time shuffling your to-do list that you don't actually spend time working on your tasks.;
, Think about exactly why you keep avoiding starting or completing the task. Is it because you know it will be difficult? Maybe it is not one task but many tasks. Focus on understanding what is scaring you from starting the task and facing your fear head on. Come up with ways to counteract that anxiety.


If you are having trouble with anxiety, talk to a friend or classmate. They likely have gone through the same thing. Maybe they have some good ideas about dealing with your anxiety that you're comfortable with.
You could also try seeing a counselor. Your college probably has mental health support services for students. A counselor can help you cope with your anxieties and develop strategies to defeat procrastination., Remove all distractions, if possible. This may mean switching venues altogether. If you are in your dorm and you are tempted to hang out in the commons area, then study in the library or at a coffee shop. If that new video game or television show is ""calling your name,"" then be sure to study in a place where you can't play or watch.


Turn off your phone and hide it. Especially if you like to check your messages, emails, or news. It takes a second to look at your phone but it could take much, much longer to pull yourself away if something interesting pops up.
If you surf the internet while doing work on your computer, get a program that limits your internet use. RescueTime is a program that blocks off certain or all websites for a certain amount of time that you get to set, and it can only be taken off if you turn your entire computer off. The best part of this program is that you can download it for free online.

, You may dread writing that paper or putting that lab project together. However, research suggests that if you can find something -- anything -- positive or pleasant about the task, you will be less likely to procrastinate on it.For example, if you have a history paper due that you really aren't excited about writing, you could remind yourself that you do enjoy doing research. That will give you a little boost of productivity.

, Frequently your tasks will seem monolithic because they are actually composed of multiple tasks. Break down the big task into smaller micro-tasks to be complete in sequence and separately. You will find accomplishing the micro-tasks provides a boost in your ""can-do"" attitude.


Setting personal deadlines can also help overcome procrastination. For example, if you have a big paper due in three weeks, set yourself personal deadlines: research must be done in one week, your first draft must be due in two weeks, etc., The action of starting to work on the task, in and of itself, is powerful. Even if you don't complete the task, at least start on it and see how far you can get. You may find it's not as daunting as you thought.


Finish the work period. If you carve out an hour to work on a task, then stick to working on that task for an hour. Even if you get distracted, keep coming back to that task during the hour. When the hour is over, you can put the task behind you. When you look back, you may not be able to say you finished it but you will be able to say to yourself that you worked on it for an hour.

, When you finish an item on your to-do list, reward yourself. You may not want to do this with everything, but especially with the important stuff you've been procrastinating on, this self-reinforcement will give you something to look forward to beyond ""being done"".

Don't reward yourself early. Almost finished is not finished. This discipline is important because it is what gives the rewards motivational value. Furthermore, getting the reward early may distract you from actually finishing the task.
Make your rewards commensurate to your difficulty with the task. Don't buy yourself a big reward for a small task just because you really want that reward. Be honest with yourself and make your rewards match your effort.

, When you are working with others it is no longer all about yourself. When you put something off you will look bad around others who pushed through and worked. Furthermore, if they need help, you will know that your work will be rewarded by their appreciation when you help them out.

Describe a specific plan for how you will improve.A financial aid appeal committee will not only want to read about why you fell behind, but also about your plan to improve.,
Conclude your letter.,
Deliver your letter.",How to Write a Letter for Financial Aid3," Most financial aid sources require you to remain in “good standing” or to make “satisfactory progress” in your educational program. Depending upon your school, this may mean maintaining a certain grade point average (GPA), taking a certain number of credits, or completing requirements specific to your program of study. If your financial aid has been affected because of unsatisfactory progress, however, you can write an appeal to have it reinstated., Your school may have a financial aid counselor who can advise you on requesting more aid. Your school’s financial aid office can also advise you on where to submit your letter, and whether or not there are any special forms to fill out or information to include. Your academic advisor can explain any requirements for (re)achieving satisfactory progress.

, Write your letter in a formal, business format. It should be typed, dated, and signed, and use a formal tone.Start by briefly explaining the purpose of your letter. Write something like “This letter is an appeal to the Office of Financial Aid so that I can continue receiving financial aid.”

, Do not blame the issue on someone else, but instead accept responsibility for it yourself. Be as specific as you can.


Try writing something like: “During my first two semesters, I did not focus on school the way I should have, because I was working too many hours at my part-time job. I take full responsibility, and am ready to prioritize my education.”
Excuses such as not liking your professors or classes, not knowing the guidelines for satisfactory progress, spending too much time socializing, or being unprepared for college coursework will usually not be accepted. Your explanation should concentrate on your responsibility for the problem, and how you will be accountable for it.
Provide any documentation you can to support your explanation. For example, if working too many hours caused you to fall behind, provide copies of pay stubs or work schedules along with your financial aid appeal letter.

, Be honest, and concentrate on specific ways that you will re-achieve and maintain satisfactory progress.


For example, write something like: “I have met with my academic advisor to discuss plans for me to succeed. I will take X, Y, Z courses next semester to move forward in my program. I have developed a schedule so that I will devote X number of hours to educational tasks on A, B, C days. I will also visit the peer tutoring center on B and C days to work further on improving my academic performance.”

Commit to working at least 15 minutes each day on each big task.Although 15 minutes may not be nearly enough time to complete the task, it is still 15 minutes of work.,
Work during your work period regardless of your feelings.,
Write in a journal when you feel stuck.Procrastination frequently occurs when we can't stop thinking about other stuff.,
Review your journal weekly.Look over what you have written to find patterns.,
Stretch your work periods as you feel comfortable.,
Reward yourself regularly for even small accomplishments.",How to Stop Procrastinating in College2," It's a small amount of time. Surely you can spare 15 minutes, right? You will get something accomplished, so see how much you can do.


Try setting a timer. The ""Pomodoro Method"" suggests setting a timer for a block of time (15-25 minutes), then taking a short break, then trying another block of work time. It can help you bust procrastination, because you only have to focus for a short period of time., You may not have the inspiration to work. Your class schedule will tell you that inspiration doesn't matter. The task must be completed. During your 15 minute work period, focus on that finishing that task or taking care of distractions. You may not get a lot done this time, but next time you should accomplish more.


While you work you may find distractions keeping you from working. Use your 15 minutes of work time to take care of those distractions. The next time you start working, those distractions should have already been taken care of. Now you can work without distractions.

, Maybe you don't want to forget something or need to figure out the solution. Write down everything you are thinking. Next time you think about the issue you'll know you've already written it down to remember later or solved it.


Writing in your journal can help you organize your thoughts. While writing, you may discover the reasons you are procrastinating. You may also find that once you write down something you don't want to forget, you stop thinking about it. You can remember you already wrote that down. Then the thought is no longer a distraction from the task you are really trying to accomplish.
Focus your journalling to issues related to the task. You may start with ""Why can I not do this? What is on my mind keeping me from working?"".

, You may find that a singular stress is influencing all of your work. Take some spare time to find ways to overcome that stress or deal with that problem. Adjust your next week's work by dealing with stressors that slowed you down throughout the week.

, As you successfully work for 15 minutes on a task you may feel 15 minutes is too short. It likely is too short in the long run. But 15 minutes is a good starting point. Once you know you can do 15 minutes straight, try working longer periods. Instead of 15 minutes try 30 minutes or more.

, As you complete your goals or even stick to your schedule make sure to reward yourself. Don't trivialize the time spent by saying ""But I didn't accomplish anything"". In fact, you spent time trying to work. As you spend more time trying you will find yourself working and eventually finishing the task


Give yourself both time-rewards and task-rewards. That means you should reward yourself for sticking to your schedule as well as completing tasks. Make sure to reward yourself based on the effort you put into either sticking to the schedule or task.

Defeat a fear of failure.,
Reject perfectionism.,
Build your self-discipline.,
Forgive yourself.",How to Stop Procrastinating in College3," Many procrastinators delay working on things because they're afraid of failure -- e.g., thinking that if you never start that paper, at least you won't turn in a bad one.Often, this fear is related to your self-esteem. You may feel that if you turn in a less-than-perfect project, it will reflect badly on you and damage your self-worth.Try to reframe ""failure"" as ""opportunity for growth."" Even the most brilliant minds have made many mistakes. Error is part of life. However, when you make mistakes, you can learn from them. People who are able to see their mistakes as opportunities to learn and grow, rather than permanent failures, are less likely to procrastinate.Disentangle your self-worth from your grades. This one is really hard, but think of how you would speak to a friend who just got a poor grade on a project. Would you tell her she is worthless and should feel ashamed? Or would you reassure her that the grade doesn't reflect on her as a person? Try to show the same kindness to yourself., Perfectionism and procrastination are strongly linked.Many people mistakenly believe that perfectionism is beneficial, but real perfectionism can actually cause serious distress and self-worth issues.Try to hold yourself to reasonable standards, rather than overly idealistic or rigid ones.


Look for examples of ""all-or-nothing thinking,"" a common cognitive distortion, or ""thought trap,"" for perfectionists.For example, you might believe that you are a failure if you get anything less than an A on a paper. Instead, honor your effort -- remember, you can only control your own action, not its outcome. For example, you could tell yourself, ""I did the best that I could on that paper, and I am proud of the hard work I put in.""
Look for ""should"" statements, like ""I should be able to do well in everything."" These are usually signs of unreasonable standards. Try thinking about why you believe this, and try to replace ""should"" statements with realistic ones, such as ""Nobody can be perfect in everything."", One thing many procrastinators have in common is low self-discipline.

Making yourself do unpleasant tasks is hard, but you can build your self-discipline in several ways.

Use ""if-then"" statements. This can help you recognize the consequences of your actions and set up plans ahead of time. Psychologists call this technique an ""implementation intention.""For example, you might say something like ""If I am tempted to procrastinate on this project by playing video games, I will make myself work on the project for one hour first."" Having this plan will help you exercise the willpower necessary to stay on track.
Flex your self-control muscles. Researchers suggest that the more often you practice self-control, the stronger your willpower muscles get.Get regular exercise, practice healthy eating habits, and try to develop a good sleep schedule. Not only will you feel healthier, these habits will carry over into your other aspects of life too.

, Procrastination can cause intense feelings of shame, guilt, or anxiety about your habits.These feelings can sap your energy because you end up wasting a lot of time feeling guilty over your procrastination that you could have used on the actual task. You might also end up feeling like starting later than you planned to is pointless, leading to further delay. If you notice that you have put something off, don't beat yourself up for it. Say something like, ""I slipped up there, but it's not the end of the world. I can start that project right now."" And then get to work!

Bring any materials you might need.,
Go to the library's ""quiet floor.,
Sit at a small table.,
Find a study desk, usually located in a back corner.,
Reserve an individual study room.",How to Study at the Library1," Decide which subjects you plan on studying during your library time and fill your backpack with any textbooks you need for that class. Also bring any past assignments or notebooks used to take notes in during that class. In addition to these materials, you might want to bring a pen and a highlighter. That way, you will be able to take more notes and to highlight the notes you already took.


Bring your computer only if absolutely necessary. Some students prefer taking notes on their computer, or some may have digital copies of their textbooks, making a computer or e-reader necessary. If these tools are not essential, though, leave them at your place of residence. Otherwise, they will only serve as distractions.





;
,""Libraries that only have one floor do not have a designated quiet floor, but libraries with multiple floors occasionally do. The floor is usually either the top or basement floor, rather than the main floor, since the main floor receives the most foot traffic and is likely to be the noisiest. Going to a quiet room to study ensures that you will face the least amount of distraction while at the library.

, Libraries often have large rectangular tables and small circular tables. Opt for a smaller circular table, as long as one is available. These tables are usually big enough for you to spread your books and notes out onto without being so large that they invite others to come over and sit near you. Moreover, taking up a large table when you are only one person could be considered rude and wasteful.

, Some libraries, especially those that are older or those linked to a university, actually have small desks in the library for students to work at. The desks are usually lined up, several in a row or cluster, along the back wall or corner of the library. Oftentimes, these desks have high sides to allow you to maintain your privacy and block out distractions from other students sitting at neighboring desks.

, Newer libraries are usually built with study rooms, especially if the library is connected to a college or university. At large libraries that serve many patrons, you may need to reserve the study room in order to use it. Find out what your library’s policy regarding study rooms is. Rooms may need to be reserved anywhere from 24 hours to one week in advance, and there may be a time limit placed on how long students are allowed to use the room.


If your library only has large meeting rooms available, you may not be able to reserve these for individual studying purposes.






Note that many libraries offer their study rooms on a first-come-first-serve basis. Essentially, if you arrive at the library and a room is open, you can use it. There may or may not be a time limit in these instances, but the librarian may ask you to leave if you do not appear to be working and others are waiting to use the room.

Check the rules.,
Look for loopholes.,

Use your time wisely and stay current with your studies.,
Avoid reading when it's not necessary.,
Avoid any activity that is optional.,
Do not hesitate for help if need be.,
Start early and work ahead.,
Prepare for any time conflicts.",How to Take a Large Course Load," Before even getting to take an excessive course load, you must first ensure you're eligible to take it. Not every university allows students to take 7+ courses. Hence you must get permission from your registrar.;
, Even if the rules disallow the course load you want to take, some universities might make exceptions. This is much more likely in a smaller, private institution than in a large public one with set rules, but see how far a little negotiation can get you. Explain your reasons and situation to the registrar, and if any of the following apply to you, you might increase your odds:


Having a high GPA vastly improves the odds as it shows your registrar that you are capable of taking the courses.
Having taken similar courses previously can help.
Having a reason or purpose will aid in getting your desired courses. Only provide this kind of reason if it's true and valid, and if needed.
Showing the registrar that you already have some topics covered for a certain course make them more likely to think you can handle it.

, You need to make sure that the course load won't stop you from fulfilling the basic time requirements for each class. Make a time-table, and keep the following tips in mind:


Avoid overlapping courses if possible.
Do not take too many back-to-back courses. A general rule of thumb is having a 60 minute break every 4 hour of classes.
Do not forget an extra break for lunch and dinner.
It is better to have your courses spread out over the 5 days then packing them up onto 3 or 4 days. It promotes long-term memory and spreads the work across the week.
Take shorter classes of 1 hour, 3 times a week rather 1 class for 3 hours once a week.

, With several classes, it's especially important to know when you have a test, when you have an appointment, when you have assignments due. Whether it's a physical copy or Google calendar, a solid schedule is needed to plan your day. Allocate 15 minutes at night to plan the day ahead.

, Overlapping classes should generally be avoided, but if you end up with any, you need to make sure you can still get the required material.


Some options include:

Buying or borrowing a recorder for the semester. Record the lecture for one course and attend the other course.
Having a friend to take notes or record the lecture.
Listening to an online recording, if one is posted.


Immediately after your course ends, listen to the missed lecture recording. It is important to not postpone as you will have other work to do.

,


Listen to lecture recordings throughout the day. When commuting, walking in between classes, eating lunch prior to sleeping.
Read your lecture slides 3-4 times a week. It is very important to rely on the long-term memory rather than short-term memory. Especially when it comes to a lot of material, short term memory will not suffice.

, Despite it being counter-intuitive advice, do not do the readings unless it is absolutely necessary. Most lecturers have the key points on their slides and it is possible to get As and not reading. Before you avoid all the readings, confirm with your professor how much of the material is coming from the readings. It varies from courses to courses.

, Focus on what can make use of your time.Time is very valuable when taking several courses.

, It is a skill to be able to get help when you need it rather than being a show-off. Dropping a course should be a last resort option as it is against your plan. However, if you do drop the course, you will be ahead of your classmates when you take it again.

, Before classes begin, get ahead of the material and stay ahead of the material. Staying one step ahead is crucial for not falling behind.

, Overlapping midterms or final exams are common when taking excessive courses. It is possible to reschedule your overlapping tests with a simple email to your professor. Proof will be required in most cases.

Submit your packet.",How to Write a Personal Statement for a Scholarship," Many scholarships require applicants to submit an essay on a certain prompt or topic. Carefully read your prompt to understand what your essay’s subject should be before you start writing.Prompts may also give you guidelines regarding things like essay length or word count. Check carefully to see if your prompt specifies things like, “Write 500 words on the topic,” or, “Write two to three pages.”;
, Before you start writing your essay, check the scholarship’s rules and guidelines for additional instructions that may not be in the prompt. Read carefully to make sure you understand what kind of formatting is required, when the scholarship due date is, what kinds of students may qualify for the scholarship, and what, if anything else, you need to submit with your essay.


Check the web page for the scholarship or the group or organization offering it to find additional rules and regulations.
If something is not specified by the scholarship provider, such as the length of your submission or the due date, contact the providing organization and ask, “What are the guidelines for this scholarship?”

, No matter what prompt you get, there will be more than one way to answer it. Start by brainstorming a few ideas. Don’t immediately get to work on the first idea that comes to mind. Instead, consider multiple perspectives and ways to answer the question.Your first idea may still provide for the most cohesive essay, but brainstorming multiple ideas helps you think outside the box and consider multiple facets of the prompt.
Jot down your ideas in no more than a few sentences. If you can, give yourself a full day and night to clear your head, then come back and review your ideas with fresh eyes.
When reviewing your ideas, try to avoid obvious answers. If, for example, the prompt is to write about someone you admire, avoid talking about the President or a well-know philanthropist. Turn instead to your own experiences to make your essay unique.

, Once you have a topic, outline key points of your essay before you start a full written draft. This helps you get down key ideas and concepts beforehand so that you don’t forget them while you write.Make each important concept its own heading, then add two to three points under it supporting your core point or idea.
If you don’t like traditional outlines, you may want to try flowcharts, thought webs, or other forms of visual organization to show how your ideas relate., Depending upon the length of your essay, this may be as simple as a topic sentence, or it may take multiple paragraphs. Regardless, your thesis should communicate the core concept that holds your essay together. All the concepts that you mention in your essay should relate back to your thesis.Try to keep your thesis as concise as possible. Worry less about fitting in big vocabulary words and more about making your point clearly and meaningfully in as few words as possible.For example, “Some theorize that it is possible to travel through time because of evidence such as,” may be shortened to, “Time travel theories may be supported by arguments such as.”

, No matter what your essay prompt, your essay should reflect your personal knowledge and experiences. Write about something about which you are passionate, and make your essay personal and relatable.If your prompt asks you directly about personal ambitions or experience, don’t just provide a synthesis of what you have done. Also touch on why your school work and extracurricular activities are important to you.
Make your essay stand out by talking about why your experience is personally significant.
If your prompt does not deal directly with personal experience, still find a way to talk about why the topic you choose to address is significant and meaningful.

, Whether you want to call it a first draft or a trial essay, work up an initial draft for you to review and consider. Leave yourself time to write a complete essay and revise it several times before it needs to be submitted.


Use your first draft as an opportunity to get down all of your points and ideas. Do not worry so much about flow or formatting. Start by ensuring the content is present.
If possible, give yourself a day or two between writing your first draft and revising your essay. This way, you are more likely to catch errors with grammar and formatting., Make your scholarship application essay specific to your audience. Each scholarship is going to want something different, and every scholarship organization will stand for something different. Write an essay unique to your reader.


This means avoiding trying to write a general essay that you can use for all application. Take the time to customize your essay to fit each scholarship, because even if both ask, ""What was an experience that changed your life?"" an academic and a community service scholarship are going to expect two different kinds of answers.

, Once you have taken some time away, reread your essay with a critical eye toward content and logical flow. Now that all of your concepts are together on the page, rework your essay into a logical format and edit the content to be as clear and concise as possible.


Try reading your essay out loud to yourself. Listen closely to what you are saying to see if it makes sense.Trying working from a print-off if possible, alongside a computer screen. This way, you can make notes and edits on your paper before changing everything in your text document.

, After you have a revised draft of your essay that you are happy with, proofread your paper one more time, this time looking specifically for spelling and grammar errors. Go line by line to check for issues with spelling, grammar, formatting, or anything that may have failed to grab your eye in earlier drafts.Try working one line at a time and covering up the rest of your essay with a blank sheet of paper to focus your attention on what you are editing at that moment.
Do not rely on computer spelling and grammar checks, as they often miss common mistakes such as homophones and alternating verb tenses.

, No matter how thoroughly you edit, it always helps to have another person look over your essay. Find a peer, a friend, or a family member and ask them, “Would you be willing to read and help me revise my scholarship essay?”Ask someone you know has a strong command of the written word.

Only bring materials that are pertinent to your group work.,
Stick to a normal floor.,
Find a large table.,
Reserve a larger study room or meeting room.Some libraries have small study rooms set aside for individuals and slightly larger study rooms meant to fit groups of people.",How to Study at the Library2," Even if you would usually bring your computer or mp3 player to study while by yourself, leave that behind to study with a group. If you do pack these devices in your bag, be aware that you can only use them if your group takes a break or has self-study time during the meeting. Do not bring them out in the middle of the group work, and leave them behind altogether if you think you might be tempted to do so.


As with individual study, make sure to bring any textbooks, notebooks, and past assignments need to study for the class or subject you plan on studying with your group. Also bring fresh notebook paper, pens, and highlighters.







, If the library is large enough to have a designated quiet floor, stay off of it. Quiet floors are meant for individual study. During a group study session, you will need to speak with other group members. As such, you should stick with a floor that is not designated as a quiet area.

, Make sure that everyone can fit comfortably. If you have a small group made of two or three people, a small circular table will still probably work. If you have a group that is larger than that, though, you will likely need a larger rectangular table.

, Find out what your library’s policy is concerning the use of these rooms. Oftentimes, you will need to reserve the room in advance, but this is not always the case. Some libraries will allow you to use any study room you please as long as it is open when you get there.


For exceptionally large groups, you may want to consider asking about using a large meeting room at the library.These rooms tend to have stricter conditions placed on them.






Use an open meeting room if the library will allow it. If a meeting room is not reserved by a group, some libraries may allow you and your study group to meet in there, especially if all the study rooms and other study areas are filled.

Think about safety and usability first of all.,
Look for accuracy.,
Test the thermometer.,
Read the temperature on the candy thermometer at the same level as the measuring liquid.",How to Choose a Candy Thermometer," A candy thermometer should be safe to handle and easy to handle. An ideal thermometer will:


Have a metal body
Have a mercury bulb that sits low enough to read the temperature but doesn't touch the cooking container base
Have clear markings and be easy to read
An adjustable clip or hook that allows it to be attached to the side of cooking pan or container.;
, Accurate readings are an important part of making candy. The most accurate type of candy thermometer is the kind which holds the bulb away from the base of the cooking container.


The thermometer should read in the range of 100ºF to 400ºF / 38ºC to 204ºC.
If the thermometer is out by even just a few degrees, it can ruin a sugar syrup or candy mixture.

, You can test the thermometer as follows:


Place it into a saucepan of cold water.
Bring the water to the boil.
Check the reading. It should be displaying 212ºF/100ºC.
If the reading is not showing this, you will need to make adjustments accordingly when using the thermometer (add or subtract the number of degrees by which the thermometer is out). If the thermometer comes home from the store already misreading, return it for another one, explaining that you tested it in this manner.

, Looking down or up at the thermometer can cause you to get the wrong reading.

If you're not sure that the chocolate is filling the cracks, ease it in a little using a teaspoon. The melted chocolate acts as the ""binder"" for the rocky road, so it needs to cover the ingredients well.

, Leave for several hours, or overnight. If you are leaving it in overnight, cover to prevent odor transfer.

Fill a saucepan with 2 inches (5.08 centimeters) of water.,
Bring the water to a boil over medium heat.,
Take the saucepan off the burner.,
Put the chocolate into your second saucepan.If you are using a makeshift double boiler, then put the chocolate into your heat-safe bowl instead.,
Place the upper saucepan (or bowl) on top of your lower saucepan.,
Wait for the chocolate to melt most of the way, stirring occasionally with a rubber spatula.,
Take the upper saucepan or bowl off the bottom one, and set it down on the counter.,
Continue to stir the chocolate until the mixture is smooth and there are no chunks of chocolate left.,
Use the chocolate in your recipe.",How to Melt Chocolate Chips1," You can use an actual double boiler, or improvise your own with a saucepan and a heat-safe bowl. Do not place the second saucepan or bowl on top just yet, however.


If you are using a bowl, make sure that it fits comfortably over the saucepan and that there are no gaps where heat can escape.
Double boilers are great if you need the chocolate to stay melted for a long time (ie: when you are making chocolate dipped strawberries).;
, While the water is coming to a boil, you can start measuring out the chocolate.


If you can't find any chocolate chips, you can use whole chocolate bars instead. You will need to cut them into ¼-inch (0.64-centimeter) wide chunks first, however., Set it down onto a heat-safe surface to protect your counter. It might be a good idea to keep it near the stove, however, just in case your chocolate starts to harden too quickly.

, Whichever one you end up using, make sure that it is perfectly dry. Any moisture will cause your chocolate to ""seize"" or harden.If you are working with large amounts of chocolate, consider putting only two-thirds of it in first. This will help it melt faster.It is possible to fix seized chocolate by adding cream to it, but this will affect your recipe., Make sure that the bottom of your saucepan or bowl does not touch the surface of the water. If it does, pour some of the water out. Make sure that the fit is tight, and that no steam can escape.

, Once again, make sure that the spatula is perfectly dry, or the chocolate will seize. Be sure to scrape the bottom and sides of the bowl often.


If you are working with large amounts of chocolate, you can add in the remaining third a little bit at a time., You can pour the water out of the bottom saucepan out at this time, although it might be a good idea to keep it filled until you are completely done baking—just in case your chocolate starts to harden too soon.

, Once the chocolate is melted, you can add in other ingredients to it, such as shortening or paraffin.If your recipe calls for paraffin as well, you must melt the paraffin separately first., If it is too hot, let it cool for about 10 minutes, give it a stir, then use it."

Choose dark chocolate.,
Try unsweetened cocoa powder.,
Consider Mexican chocolate.,
Limit your consumption of milk chocolate.,
Skip the white chocolate.,
Choose an all-chocolate bar.",How to Choose the Healthiest Chocolate1," If you're looking to choose a nutritious chocolate, the best and most ideal type of chocolate is dark chocolate. It may be a little more bitter, but has the biggest nutritional benefit of all.


Most dark chocolates will list a percentage on the box or bar. You may see ""75% percent dark chocolate"" or ""65% cacao"" or something similar. The percentage refers to the total amount of chocolate (antioxidant containing ingredients) in the bar.In general, the higher the percentage listed, the less sugar and other ingredients. It also means the chocolate will have a more bitter and intense flavor.Chocolate manufacturers can make a large variety of dark chocolates. If you purchase unsweetened chocolate, it will contain 85-99% cocoa. If you purchase bittersweet chocolate it will contain 34-84% cocoa. Lastly, if you purchase semisweet chocolate it will generally contain anywhere from 15-34%cocoa.;
, Although cocoa powder is not something you'd eat alone, it's a great source of antioxidants. Incorporate it into recipes and beverages to get the benefits.


Cocoa powder is made from cocoa beans. However, it doesn't contain the cocoa butter or any added sugar.Cocoa powder typically contains about 88-96% chocolate which makes it an excellent source of antioxidants.Try cocoa powder in baked goods, as part of rubs and spice mixtures for steaks, or make your own homemade hot chocolate.
Avoid the Dutch processed cocoa powder. The extra processing this cocoa powder requires to make it neutralized for baking also strips away the beneficial antioxidants., An interesting and flavorful version of dark chocolate to try is Mexican chocolate. Mexican chocolate is often blended with spices and other ingredients for a unique twist.


Mexican chocolate is made from dark, bitter chocolate mixed with sugar, cinnamon and occasionally ground almonds.You may even find some made with chili powder or cayenne pepper for an added kick.
Mexican chocolate has become more popular in areas outside of Mexico. You may be able to find it in the international aisle of your grocery store, and you can always order it online.

, Although milk chocolate is less bitter and more sweet than dark chocolate, it's not a great source of the nutritious antioxidants typically found in some chocolates.


Milk and milk solids which are an ingredient in milk chocolate bind to the antioxidants found naturally in chocolate. This makes them unavailable to your body.In addition, milk chocolate only has about 5-7% of the chocolate solids that would contain the antioxidants.If milk chocolate is your preferable choice, limit yourself to this type 1-2 times a week. Go for dark chocolate as often as you can.

, White chocolate seems to be a lighter version of your traditional chocolate. Although it looks pretty and tastes sweet, this is a type of chocolate you should avoid if you're interested in a nutritious treat.


White chocolate is actually not chocolate at all. It's only cocoa butter mixed with sugar, milk solids and flavoring.Chocolate needs to contain both cocoa butter and chocolate solids (made from cocoa beans) in order to be considered ""real"" chocolate.In addition, white chocolate is high in calories, sugars and sometimes additives without any of the nutritional benefits of dark chocolate.

, Many candies or candy bars contain other ingredients outside of the chocolate. Although they may be tempting, try to stick to an all chocolate or 100% chocolate bar.


Even though peanut butter, crushed cookies, caramel or nougat are quite tasty and pair well with chocolate, these add many, many more calories, fat and sugar.
If anything, choose a dark chocolate bar with nuts or peanuts. They'll add a little more protein and healthy fats to your chocolate bar."

Decide what texture of candy you want.,
Pour the maple syrup into a large, heavy-bottomed saucepan.,
Insert a candy thermometer into the boiling syrup.,
Gradually bring the syrup to a rolling boil over medium heat.,
Heat the candy until it reaches the soft-ball stage, 235–240 °F (113–116 °C).,
When the candy reaches the appropriate temperature, remove the pan from the heat immediately.,
Use a wooden spoon to stir the mixture rapidly until the color turns lighter.,
Pour the candy into lightly greased molds or a pan lined with waxed paper.,
Once cool, take the candy out of the molds and enjoy!",How to Make Sugar Maple Candy," As you boil sugar, water evaporates from the mixture, leaving a higher concentration of sugar behind. Be sure to know the various stages of candy making before you begin making your maple sugar candy.


Soft-Ball Stage, 235–240 °F (113–116 °C): At the soft-ball stage, the sugar concentration is 85% and the candy will form a soft, malleable ball if dropped into ice water. If you allow the sugar to sit out for a few minutes on a flat surface, it will flatten. Fudge candy is heated until the soft-ball stage.

Firm-Ball Stage, 245–250 °F (121 °C): With a sugar concentration just slightly higher at 87%, candy at the firm-ball stage is malleable, but has more structure than the soft-ball phase and will not flatten unless pinched. Caramel candy is heated to this stage.

Hard-Ball Stage, 250–265 °F (129 °C): If dropped into ice water, a hard ball will form at this stage. With a sugar concentration at 92%, the sugar syrup will form thick threads if poured from a spoon. Marshmallows, nougat, and gummy candies are all heated to the hard-ball stage.

Soft-Crack Stage, 270–290 °F (143 °C): The sugar concentration at this stage reaches a high 95%. The candy begins to become more brittle at this stage, though it retains some flexibility and will bend before cracking. Butterscotch and taffy are examples of candy cooked to the soft-crack stage.

Hard-Crack Stage, 300–310 °F (154 °C): The highest temperature with a 99% sugar concentration, the hard-crack stage produces candy that is hard, brittle, and cracks easily. Toffee, brittle, and lollipops are heated to this temperature.;
, Your saucepan needs to have a heavy bottom so that it can withstand high heat without burning the delicate sugar.








, Be sure to fully submerge the mercury tip of the thermometer to get a correct temperature reading.








, Be sure to stir occasionally. It's OK if you see foam and bubbles while your candy boils.








, Most maple candy recipes call for a soft-ball stage candy, though you can manipulate the texture of the candy by heating it to the stage you desire. If you don't have a candy thermometer, you can test the candy stage by dropping a bit of the sugar into a container of cold water. The sugar should form a soft, malleable ball.








, Allow it to cool to 175ºF without stirring. This will take about 10 minutes.








, It should look similar to caramel but be thick and creamy.








, Allow the candy to sit until cool.








, You can store the candy in airtight containers for up to one month.

Put the chocolate chips into a wide, shallow microwave-safe bowl.It is important that the container you use remains cool or very slightly warm after several minutes of microwaving, otherwise, the container itself will overheat the chocolate.,
Microwave the chocolate on medium power for 1 minute, then give it a stir.You can stir the chocolate with a rubber spatula or a spoon, but make sure that whatever you use is dry.,
Continue heating the chocolate at 10 to 15-second intervals, stirring between each one, until it is almost melted.,
Take the chocolate out of the microwave and continue stirring the chocolate until it turns smooth.,
Use your chocolate.",How to Melt Chocolate Chips2," The container must also be perfectly dry, as any moisture will cause the chocolate to harden and become grainy.


If you can’t comfortably handle the container after several minutes of microwaving, then it isn’t a suitable container for melting chocolate.
If you can't find any chocolate chips, cut a chocolate bar into ¼-inch (0.64-centimeter) wide chunks instead.
If you are planning on melting large amounts of chocolate, consider working in smaller batches instead.

, Also, keep in mind that every microwave oven is different, so your chocolate may not be melted completely after this. That is perfectly fine; you can always continue heating the chocolate in short bursts.


Chocolate doesn't lose its shape when you microwave it, so stirring it will help make it smooth and more liquid-y., Milk chocolate and white chocolate tend to overheat quicker than dark chocolate. It would be best to stir them every 10 seconds.This may sound tedious, but it will reduce the chances of any scorching. Remember, chocolate will keep its shape when heated in the microwave, so stirring it up will help it ""melt.""How long you end up cooking the chocolate also depends on how much you are working with. For example:

1 ounce (30 grams) will take 1 minute total.
8 ounces (225 grams) will take 3 minutes total.
1 pound (450 grams) may take up to 6 minutes.



, Once the chocolate is mostly melted, take the bowl out of the microwave, and set it down onto a heat-safe surface. Continue stirring the chocolate, scrapping the bottom and sides of the bowl often, until it is smooth and no chunks remain., At this point, you can also add in any other extra ingredients that the recipe calls for, such as shortening or paraffin.

Purchase dark chocolate with at least 70% cacao.,
Buy organic chocolate.,
Stick to fairly traded chocolate brands.,
Skip chocolates containing additives.",How to Choose the Healthiest Chocolate2," Go for 70% or higher for the most nutritional value. You'll receive the most antioxidants at this level.


Studies show that chocolate and chocolate bars with 70% cacao or higher provide the highest levels of antioxidants, fiber, magnesium, and copper as well.If you're not a big fan of bitter or intense chocolate, go for 70% cacao maximum. Higher levels may not be very enjoyable to your taste buds.
In addition, if it's over 70% it's considered dairy free as there are is no milk or milk solids in this type of chocolate., The level of antioxidants present in chocolate depends on the quality of the ingredients and the processing techniques. It's better to buy organic chocolate if you're looking for the most nutritious type.Cocoa bean farming uses some highest quantities of pesticides. Cocoa beans are known as one of the highest ""contaminated"" products with the largest amount of pesticide residue.Look for organic labeling on your chocolate. It should say ""organic"" or ""100% organic"" on the label. Only an 100% organic label indicates that all ingredients used in the chocolate are organic., In addition to choosing organic chocolates, also consider only purchasing chocolates that have the seal of being Fairly Traded.


Cocoa farmers are often forced to sell products to middlemen for very low prices. In addition, many of these middle men have been associated with child labor.If you purchase a chocolate with the label of Fair Traded on it, it means that the company ensures that farmers receive an appropriate price for their product, are allowed to invest in farming techniques that allow for a better flavor and cocoa bean and strictly prohibits child labor.Many times the farming practices and techniques of Fair Trade chocolate make a better quality chocolate as well.

, Not all chocolates are created equal. It's important to read over the labels of any chocolate you buy so you know what it contains.


As mentioned, true chocolate should contain cocoa butter as one of the ingredients. This is what makes chocolate smooth, creamy and delicious. However, some chocolate and candy companies use other types of fats in their chocolates.
Read over the ingredient list and look for other types of fats like hydrogenated and partially hydrogenated oils.These are processed, trans-fats that have negative effects on your health.However, they're cheaper to use so companies will sometimes use these instead of the cocoa butter.

Store chocolate appropriately.,
Enjoy chocolate in moderation.,
Make nutritious recipes with dark chocolate.",How to Choose the Healthiest Chocolate3," Not that chocolate generally sits around too long with out being eaten, but it's important to make sure you're storing your chocolate appropriately to maintain it's freshness.


Make sure to keep your chocolate wrapped or stored in an airtight container (especially if you're buying a larger block). Chocolate is porous and will pick up the flavors of other foods.Also store your chocolate in a cool and dry place. The refrigerator is a great place.
If you take the care to store chocolate the right way, it'll last up to 1 year., Although eating dark chocolate does have some nutrition benefits and positive effects on your health, overdoing is not smart. Stick to moderate amounts of chocolate to maintain your health.


Any foods that are eaten too much or too frequently can cause weight gain due to extra calories your body doesn't need. This is especially true for chocolate that contains sugar.It's typically recommended to eat about 1 oz of chocolate per serving per day. So the most you should consume during the week is 7 oz (about 1 oz per day).Another easy way to moderate how much chocolate you eat is by choosing individually wrapped chocolates. They're automatically portion controlled and can keep your consumption in check.

, If you're not the biggest fan of eating plain dark chocolate or are interested in incorporating it in other ways, try making some tasty, yet nutritious recipes with dark chocolate. You can try:


Roll halved, frozen bananas in dark chocolate and then refreeze for a frozen, chocolately treat. You can also sprinkle on chopped nuts for extra crunch.
Make your own homemade chocolate covered strawberries using melted dark chocolate.
Make hot chocolate from scratch using unsweetened cocoa powder. Use soy milk instead of cow's milk to make sure you get the full does of antioxidants.
You can also use cocoa powder in rubs and marinades - especially for beef.

Heat the ingredients.,
Create a powdered sugar well.,
Pour the gum base into the well.,
Make bubble gum dough.,
Roll out the dough.,
Finish the gum.",How to Make Chewing Gum1," Place the gum base, corn syrup, glycerine, citric acid and bubble gum flavoring in the top part of a double boiler. Place the double boiler on the stove and turn the burner to medium high. Stirring occasionally with a spoon, heat the mixture until it becomes warm and gooey.


You can find gum base, glycerine and citric acid at candy supply stores or online retailers. Choose a classic bubble gum flavor or go for something unique, like lemon lime.
You can also add a few drops of food coloring to the mixture to color your gum.
Make a double boiler if you don't already have one by finding two pots, one small and one large. Fill the larger pot with a few inches of water and place it on the stove. Put the smaller pot inside the larger pot so that it's floating on the water. Place all of the ingredients except the powdered sugar in the smaller pot and turn on the burner. Bring the mixture up to temperature, stirring well.;
, Set aside about a tablespoon of powdered sugar and pour the rest into a pile on a cutting board or another clean work surface. Use your fingers to create an indention in the powdered sugar pile., Carefully pour the melted gum base directly from the double boiler into the powdered sugar well. Be careful not to get any water in the mixture.

, Dust your fingers with some powdered sugar and start kneading the gum base mixture and the powdered sugar together. Work the powdered sugar into the gum base until the base gets sticky, then add more powdered sugar and keep kneading. Knead for at least 15 minutes, until the dough is soft and pliable and no longer sticky.


If you don't knead the dough enough, the gum will tend to fall apart, so don't skip this step.
The dough should be smooth and stiff when you're finished.

, Place the dough in front of you, and place your hands palm-down on top of it. Roll the dough using your hands so that it becomes a long, thin rope. Try to roll it so that it's the same width down the length of the rope. Use a knife to cut the rope into bite-sized pieces.


You can roll the dough flat using a rolling pin and cut it into neat squares if you'd like.
Roll the pieces of dough into balls as an alternative.

, Dust the gum pieces with powdered sugar to keep them from sticking to each other. Make small gum wrappers by cutting out squares of parchment paper, then wrap the gum pieces.

Understand student loan repayment plans.,
Consider switching to the Extended Plan.,
Inquire about the Graduated Repayment Plan if you expect your income to rise.,
Learn about Income-Driven Plans.,
Contact your loan service provider to discuss Income-Driven Plans.,
Keep your expectations reasonable.,
Take the long view.",How to Lower Student Loan Payments1," When it comes time to repay your federal student loan, the government provides a series of plans for how to do so. The default plan is known as the Standard Plan. This plan typically has the highest monthly payments, but allows you to pay your loans off quickly over time.


The payments for the Standard Plan are fixed and can be made for up to 10 years.
If the payment under the Standard Plan are simply too high for you, or you want lower payments, you will need to consider another one of the repayment plans available.
Studentaid.gov is the main resource for student loan plan information. Visiting this website can help you apply for plans and learn about plans.
These programs will likely not be available if you borrowed through a private lender. If your loans are not federal, you will have to follow up with your bank or credit union to see if you have any alternative payment options.;
, The Extended Plan is the first plan to consider if the standard payments are too high. The Extended Plan simply takes the amount you owe and stretches it for up to 25 years. This has the effect of immediately lowering your student loan payments.

The con is that you will pay much more interest over time, and will have the burden of a loan to deal with for a longer period.
This plan is also flexible, in the sense that you can opt for fixed or graduated payments. This means that your payments can be the same over your payment period, or they can gradually grow as your income grows.
To apply, contact your loan service provider and inquire about the Extended Plan.

, If you are currently in a situation where you are unable to pay full payments, but you expect your income to rise steadily over time, the Graduated Repayment Plan allows you to start with a low payment, and have it grow every two years.This program blends the Standard Plan and the Extended Plan. In this plan, you still must pay off your loan within 10 years. This means that you will pay less interest over time than with the extended plan. You also have the option of starting with fairly low payments, and having them grow every two years.
If you are in a career where there is solid income growth, this may be an option to consider.
This is perfect for an individual who cannot handle the Standard Plan repayments but does not need as much flexibility as the Extended Plan offers.

, If the main three types of plan are still too difficult to repay, the government offers three ""Income-Driven Repayment Plans"". These plans all tie your monthly payment to your income. If you are currently making very little or have high expenses, these options are wise to consider. Under all three plans, any remaining debt leftover after the payment period is forgiven.All of these plans, with the exception of the ""Income-Contingent Plan"", require you to demonstrate financial hardship..

Income-Based Repayment Plan: This plan makes your payments equal to 15% of your discretionary income. Discretionary income can be complex to calculate (your loan service provider will help you), but it basically means your leftover income after all your essential expenses are paid for. The loans can be repaid for 20 years if you are a new borrower.

Pay-As-You-Earn Repayment Plan: This plan is only available for people who received loans after October 1st, 2011. This plan allows you to repay for 25 years, and makes your payment only 10% of your discretionary income.Income-Contingent Payment Plan:This plan allows you to pay either 20% of your discretionary income, or what you would pay on a 12 year Standard Repayment Plan -- whichever is lower. This plan allows you 25 years to repay.

, An in-depth discussion with your loan service provider is necessary to both understand and apply for income driven plans. Your loan service provider can help you understand the sometimes complex eligibility requirements for these plans, and guide you through the application process.


Certain types of loans are only eligible for certain plans, and your loan service provider can tell you if your loan is eligible and if you are eligible based on your financial status.

, Understand that no matter what repayment plan you choose, you may have to cut basic expenses and forego luxuries in order to prioritize your monthly payments.

, It’s important to understand that if you pay less each month, you will typically wind up paying more over time. It’s understandable to choose the lowest possible monthly payment, but think about your long-term goals, and consider paying more if you can. To illustrate, take the average federal student loan debt, $26,946:On the standard plan, your payment would be $272 a month. When your loans are paid off, you’ll have spent a grand total of $32,585.
On the graduated plan, you might pay something like $152 a month in the beginning. This payment would increase to around $455 a month over time. You’ll ultimately spend a grand total of $33,979.
On a “pay as you earn” plan, you might pay something like $104 a month in the beginning. This payment would increase to around $272 a month. You’ll ultimately spend a grand total of $39,509.

Check with your employer.,
Look into consolidation.,
Defer your payments if you qualify.,
Check if you qualify for forbearance.,
Know whether you qualify for loan forgiveness.",How to Lower Student Loan Payments2," Many companies offer assistance to employees with student loan debt. See what kinds of programs your employer offers.

, If you are worried that you won’t be able to make payments on your federal or private student loans – or if you are already delinquent or in default – you may want to apply for a consolidation loan. These loans take all of your existing student loans and merge them into a single loan. You can often negotiate a lower monthly payment on this new loan.


If your loans are federal, stick with a federal consolidation loan, which you can apply for through the Department of Education. These are almost always a better deal than private consolidation loans.
You can apply for a federal consolidation loan through Studentloans.gov. There are also plenty of resources to help you understand these types of loans better.
Consolidation can be a useful option if you have multiple separate student loans. It can combine them into one easy payment. It is possible that the combined loan will have a lower interest rate then what you would be paying on each loan separately, and this would lower your payment.Inquire with your loan service provider about whether this option can have an interest-lowering effect for your particular situation.

, If you truly cannot afford to make payments, you may qualify for a financial hardship deferment from the Department of Education for a maximum of three years. You will have to prove that you are unemployed, underemployed, or otherwise experiencing tremendous financial difficulties, but if you do so, you will be able to stop making payments temporarily – though interest will continue to accrue on any of your unsubsidized loans. You may also qualify for deferment if:you go back to school.
you serve in the Peace Corps.
you serve in the military.
you are admitted to a full-time rehabilitation program for people with disabilities.

, Forbearance is like deferment – you’ll get to stop making your payments temporarily. However, with forbearance, interest will continue to accrue on all of your loans, whether subsidized or unsubsidized. You may qualify for forbearance if:you enroll in a full-time medical or dental internship.
you are currently teaching in a school that qualifies for the teacher loan forgiveness program.
you serve in AmeriCorps or another volunteer organization full time.
your lowest possible student loan payment is more than 20% of your monthly income.
Forbearance is typically consider for people who do not qualify for deferment, but still cannot make their payments. If you suffer from an illness, or a period of financial hardship, you may qualify for forbearance.
You can apply by contacting your loan service provider. They will likely require financial, medical, or other types of documentation.

, The Department of Education may forgive some part of your student loan debt if you teach or provide public service in specific circumstances. You may qualify if you:


teach for five consecutive years in a school that qualifies for Title I funding under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965.
work and/or volunteer for ten years in tax-exempt organizations.
serve in the U.S. military.

Start paying when you’re still in school.,
Automate your payments.,
Pay as much as possible each month.,
Increase monthly payments slowly.,
Make payments biweekly.",How to Pay Off Student Loans Quickly1," With most student loans you are not required to begin payments until six months after your graduate. However, you can choose to start paying the money back even before graduation. This would save you money in interest payments over the long run. Try to pay at least enough to cover the amount of interest you accrue each month. This will prevent your interest from “capitalizing” and being added to your principal balance (the total amount you owe).;
, You can set up monthly loan payments that are automatically withdrawn from your bank account. You may even qualify for an interest-rate reduction just for setting up automatic payments. Contact your loan servicer to see whether such benefits exist and how to set them up. Automatic payments will also help you build and protect your credit score by preventing missed or late payments.

, There is no quicker way to pay off your debt than by increasing the amount you pay each month. Making the minimum monthly payment is an expensive way to pay off your loan(s), because it maximizes the interest you'll pay. Not only will higher monthly payments eliminate your loans faster, you’ll also wind up paying less in interest (and thus less overall). Even if you can afford only an extra five dollars each month, making the effort will definitely benefit you -- and by a surprising amount. Make sure any amount you pay above the minimum is not applied towards future payments. Contact your loan servicer and make your intentions clear: you want your extra payments applied to the current balance.

, To make it easier on your budget, start with a small addition to your payments, and gradually increase it. Any extra payment you make above your minimum will typically save you twice that amount in interest over the life of the loan. Consider starting with an extra $5 a month for awhile. Once you adjust to that, maybe you'll find that you can increase it to $10 later. The idea is to accelerate payments as much as possible over time, and you can cut out years from your loan and wind up saving yourself a lot of money. It’s all right if you can’t consistently make increased payments. You're not obligated to do so. Just try to maintain as high a payment as possible, and increase it whenever you can. Over the long term it can absolutely raise your standard of living.
The same, by the way, is true of any other loans you're paying off -- home, auto, personal, etc.
Whenever you get a raise at work, commit part or all of it to higher payments against your debt. , If you make a loan payment every other week instead of monthly, you can significantly reduce the amount of time it takes to pay off your loan. This is true even if each payment is only half of what you’d pay in a monthly plan. You’ll pay less in interest, because less interest will accrue between payments. Additionally, you’ll make 26 payments in a year rather than 12, which is the equivalent of an extra monthly payment each year. If you are paid every other week, simply make a payment each time you receive a paycheck. This is one of the most painless ways to pay off your debt quickly.
An added bonus is that you may receive an interest-rate reduction for setting up an automatic-payment plan.

Use a home equity loan to finance college costs.,
Access a home equity line of credit to finance college costs.,
Obtain a cash-out refinance of your original mortgage agreement.,
Pay attention to interest rates.",How to Get Alternative Student Loans1," A home equity loan is a type of second mortgage, subject to the same type of process as a first mortgage. If you take out a home equity loan, you receive the money in one lump sum, and the length of the mortgage can be anywhere from 5-30 years.You can generally borrow anywhere from 50 to 60 percent of the equity in your home with a home equity loan.

Equity is the difference between current market value and existing first mortgage loan amount. For example, if your house is worth $200,000 and you still owe $80,000 on your mortgage loan, your equity is $120,000.


Interest rates for home equity loans are usually fixed. The rates can be attractive, because your home is used as collateral.Conversely, if you fall behind on your loan, you put your home at risk for foreclosure.
Since this is a second mortgage, you can expect to have another monthly payment to add in addition to your original mortgage.;
, A home equity line of credit, or HELOC, is another type of second mortgage. Since it is a second mortgage, it will be subject to the same types of conditions as a first mortgage, and the application process will be similar.


The difference between a HELOC and a home equity loan is twofold: HELOCs usually have variable interest rates, and the money isn’t given out as a lump sum, it’s a line of credit, like a credit card.HELOCs have a period of time for which you can access the funds, usually 10 years. Typically, the loan has to be paid off in its entirety in 20 years.
As payments are made on the HELOC, the funds available to be borrowed is increased by the payment amount.For example, if the line of credit is $100, and the debtor uses $20, leaving $80 in the line of credit. When the debtor makes $20 in payments, then the line of credit goes back up to $100.

, A cash-out refinance is not a second mortgage, unlike a HELOC or home-equity loan. A cash-out refinance is the replacement of the first mortgage by another mortgage loan, the difference between the amount loaned and the first mortgage amount paid off being cash to the home owner.The new mortgage is for a larger amount than the first mortgage, and the debtor receives the difference, hence the term “cash-out.”So if the original mortgage is for $100 and the debtor gets a cash-out refinance, the new mortgage might be for $150, allowing the debtor to pocket the $50.
Since the new mortgage replaces the old, there is only one monthly payment, in contrast to the second mortgage options.
Monthly payments may increase based upon the interest rate and term of the new mortgage versus the old mortgage.

, With cash-out refinancing in particular, you can come out ahead or behind depending on what the current interest rates are. Getting your hands on the funds might still be worth the higher monthly payment, but it’s something to pay close attention to.

"
"
Pay off loans with high interest first.,
Avoid long-term repayment programs.,
Consider consolidating or refinancing your loans.",How to Pay Off Student Loans Quickly2," Be strategic. In addition to making larger payments as often as possible, paying off the right loans first is an important factor. If you're paying on more than one loan at a time, apply the higher payments only to the loan with the highest interest rate while making minimum payments on the loan(s) with the lower rate(s). Do this until you've paid off the higher-interest loan, and then attack the loan with the next-highest rate while maintaining minimum payments on the other loan(s). Do this until everything is paid off. Repay any private loans first. These are almost certain to have high interest rates and will have less-flexible repayment plans compared to government loans.
Next pay off unsubsidized federal loans, followed by subsidized federal loans.
Contact your loan servicer directly to ask how to specify which loan you wish to pay off first.
If you have other debt that has an even higher interest rate (such as credit card debt), you should pay it off before the loans referenced just above. , If you want to pay off your loans as quickly as possible, keep payments as high as you can. Although they will lower your monthly payments, some repayment programs (such as “Pay As You Earn”) stretch your repayment period out to as much as 25 years! This leads to greater debt overall. These programs are especially unproductive if you have high-interest loans, as they impede your ability to pay those loans off quickly.

, You can consolidate loans in order to make a single monthly payment at one interest rate. This is not always the best option. However, under certain circumstances you can qualify for a lower, fixed interest rate than you’re currently paying and wind up paying off your loan(s) more quickly and paying less in interest. Pursue consolidation of federal loans through the Direct Loan program. Use the U.S. Department of Education’s online calculator to find out what your consolidated interest rate would be.
Don't consolidate federal loans through a private loan servicer. You will lose benefits that apply only to federal loans, including deferments for unemployment or eligibility for loan-forgiveness programs. Consider refinancing federal loans into a private loan only if you are absolutely certain you will never want to claim these benefits.
Consolidating two or more private loans is usually beneficial, but make sure to factor in origination fees. Don't consolidate unless your new loan has a lower, fixed interest rate overall. Your annual income should be higher than your loan balance, and your credit score should be high enough to attract a better interest rate.

Volunteer with a federal service organization.,
Work in the public-service sector.,
Finish your commitment.,
Join the military.",How to Pay Off Student Loans Quickly3," Working for Americorps, the Peace Corps, or Teach for America will give you access to loan-forgiveness grants at the end of your term of service. You also may be able to defer payments on student loans while serving, without interest penalty. Look into each organization specifically to find out more about how much of your debt could be forgiven by participating. , There are also public-service loan-forgiveness programs that you may be eligible for if you work as a teacher, a public servant, or in the nonprofit sector. These programs will involve your participation in an income-based repayment plan and will forgive any loans remaining after ten years of low monthly payments. See IBRinfo.org for more information about income-based repayment plans and public- service loan forgiveness.
These plans are not available to pay off private loans, nor will loan-forgiveness programs help you pay off private loans.
Some states, schools, and private organizations also offer loan-forgiveness programs related to certain forms of employment after graduation. Ask school staff, your employer, or professionals in your field about any loan-forgiveness programs they may be aware of.

, Public-service and other loan-forgiveness programs are typically subject to basic eligibility requirements. This usually includes completing a specific term of service. If you're making income-based payments during your service, you may also be generating greater interest charges. In such a case, if you fail to meet the requirements for loan forgiveness, it may take you longer to pay off your debt than you originally expected. , The U.S. military actively recruits individuals in financial hardship. By enlisting and serving in any branch of the military, you will likely be eligible for significant loan forgiveness upon completion of service. "

Apply your tax refund towards your debt.,

Control unnecessary spending.,
Get another job.",How to Pay Off Student Loans Quickly4," Next time you do your taxes, make sure to include information regarding any interest you’ve paid on your loans. This information will be provided to you by your loan servicers (on a form 1098) and will earn you a tax deduction. This will increase the likelihood of your receiving a tax refund. If you’re able, use the refund to make a payment on your debt. If you’re still paying tuition, you may be eligible for a tax credit, which could save you even more money. Similarly, use any unexpected income to pay down debt. If you win a lottery, receive an inheritance, win a lawsuit, or collect on an insurance claim, use this money to reduce your debt. , Some employers will help their employees pay off student loans. There are several different ways this is done. Ask your employer directly if a program exists and whether you may be eligible to participate. , This may help motivate you to take the steps necessary to pay off your debt quickly. In particular, calculate how long it will take to pay off your loans with different monthly payments, and how much you’ll wind up spending overall with different payment plans. Simply having this information in front of you may encourage you to make larger payments whenever you’re able. , Aside from increasing your income, the only way to be able to make higher payments and pay off your debt more quickly is by reducing your spending. Some of the easiest ways to reduce spending include canceling unused monthly services (such as cable or a gym membership), eating out less often, and reducing the amount of alcohol you drink. One great way to reduce spending is to give yourself a limited cash allowance each week and to limit discretionary spending to this amount. This will work especially well if you tend to spend a lot on snacks and drinks.
There are templates in software such as Excel, as well as free apps such as Mint that can help you keep track of your spending.

, Look for freelance work online using a skill you already have. With a little searching you may be able to find a job related to a personal interest. For instance, if you like to stay up-to-date on new tech appliances, you can probably find a job writing articles for one of the websites you frequently read. Similarly, if you have graphic design or other software-specific skills, you can likely channel this into a part-time or occasional job. You can work a few nights a week in the service industry or participate in the sharing economy by driving for a rideshare company at whatever times suit your schedule.

Determine cash value.,
Determine interest.,
Be sure to make payments or face major penalties.",How to Get Alternative Student Loans2," All permanent life insurance policies (anything that isn’t term life insurance) accumulate a cash value the longer you pay into it. If you’ve held onto the policy long enough, , usually ten years or longer, you can borrow against the accumulated cash value of the policy.A level premium has more going for cash value in earlier years since the likelihood of death increases as one ages. As the cash value grows, it offsets the rise in mortality rates.
Each insurer has different rules about how fast the policy accumulates cash value, how much can be borrowed against, and when the policyholder can borrow against it. Check with your insurer to find out the details of your own policy.
Loans taken out against life insurance don't have to be paid back. However, any outstanding loans at death of policyholder will reduce the payout made to beneficiaries.

, Compared to many types of loans, the interest on policy loans can be low, because the policy itself is used as collateral. However, the interest rate is only one factor to consider on a policy loan, and costs can arise elsewhere.This is subject to change depending on the insurer, the creditworthiness of the borrower, and the length of time the policyholder has had the policy.

, While policy loans can have attractive interest rates, the penalties for not paying sufficient amounts can be severe.Failing to make payments on a policy loan is going to make interest add up. Unpaid interest is added to the value of the loan, and if the value of the loan equals the amount you’ve paid on the policy, your insurer will surrender the policy. Policies terminate when the amount borrowed exceeds the cash value of the policy.So, if you have paid $100k on the policy and borrowed $70k, when the interest on the loan accrues enough to reach a value of $100k, your insurance company surrenders the policy and keeps what you paid into it, making a $30k loss for the policyholder.
If a policy is terminated and the owner has received cash payments greater than the premiums paid, the difference is taxed as ordinary income.

No matter what, withdrawing money from a 401(k) counts as income, and it is subject to taxation.

, For the purposes of paying for higher education, withdrawing money from an IRA is a better deal for the owner of the account than withdrawing from a 401(k). No penalties are assessed for higher education costs.Withdrawals still count as income, however. They will be taxed.

, This can be an attractive option, because Roth IRAs are more flexible than other types of retirement accounts. There are fewer associated withdrawal penalties and withdrawals are always untaxed.

, Student loans are one of the only types of debts that cannot be discharged in bankruptcy, which means that they are an obligation that can follow you around in spite of major financial reversals.When the permanency of all student loans is combined with the near usurious interest rates charged by many private lenders, you need to make sure than you have exhausted all other options before you take out a private student loan.
For example, you may also be eligible for other public loans or government and private grants. For more, see how to apply for federal grants.

, Be very diligent in searching for a private student lender, as it can affect your financial future for years to come. There are a variety of websites that offer comparisons in rates for student loans, but https://www.credible.com/student-loans and http://www.simpletuition.com/ are both well-regarded.

, If you are a parent, then consider co-signing on your child’s loan rather than taking one out in your name. Although you will be on the hook if things go south in either case, cosigning on the loan will allow you to release it to your child when they are able to pay, freeing you of liability.However, a parent might be better off taking on a personal loan then funding the student, since personal loans can be discharged or negotiated more easily than student loans in the event of financial hardship.

, All universities must issue information that documents the costs of attendance, and it's fine to use that. It is usually included with the financial aid award letter.

, You should gather information for the student and the borrower, if they are two different people, or the student and the cosigner, if there is one.You will need:


School information, including school name, major, grade, and school term for which you need the loan
Social Security number
Telephone numbers
Current addresses, both for your home and your school
Gross income information
Residence information, including whether you own or rent, and the monthly housing payment
Requested loan amount

, It's best to get on this as early as possible, right after you get your financial aid award. It can take nearly a month to get approved for a private loan, which could push back your enrollment."

Commit to resolving the problem.,
Figure out what you owe.,
Take a careful look at your finances.,
Determine who to contact about your defaulted student loans.,
Decide whether you prefer rehabilitation or consolidation.",How to Get Student Loans out of Default1," Fortunately, the federal government offers a variety of options for repaying your student loans, even after you’ve been in default. Ignoring the problem won’t make it go away, and if you do not take action to get your loans out of default, you could wind up facing serious consequences. For example:


Your credit rating will plummet, making it difficult for you to rent an apartment, secure a car loan, or qualify for a mortgage.
You will not have access to any further federal financial aid or to the government’s deferment, forbearance, and forgiveness plans.
Any income tax refund you have coming could be garnished.
Your wages could be garnished.
You could face “acceleration” – in other words, the entire balance of your student loan debt, plus any collections fees, will become due immediately.;
, Because student loans come in a variety of forms – Stafford, Perkins, PLUS, etc. – and are distributed in increments over a period of years, many borrowers lose track of exactly what they owe. This is completely understandable, but if you are in default, it’s imperative to get a clear picture of your debt so that you can address the problem effectively.


If your records aren’t clear or you aren’t sure how much federal student loan debt you have, visit the National Student Loan Data System at https://www.nslds.ed.gov/npas/index.htm. You’ll be able to see all of your federal student loans, including those in default, even if they are serviced by multiple lenders.

, When you discuss your defaulted loans with the Department of Education or a collection agency, you’ll need to know how much you can realistically afford to pay. Before you call, get a sense of:


what your monthly income is.
what your financial obligations are.
what your “discretionary income” is. The Department of Education bases many of its repayment procedures on the idea of discretionary income. To figure out yours, you need to subtract your income from 150% of the poverty line, which will vary depending on your family size and where you live. Visit http://www.aspe.hhs.gov/poverty/index.cfm to determine your specific poverty line.

As an example, say that you live in California, have no dependents, and make $26,000 a year. The poverty line in this case is $11,670. 150% of that is $17,505. Subtract that amount from your income of 26,000 to get $8495. That amount is your annual discretionary income. Most federal repayment plans will require you to make monthly payments that add up, in a year, to a certain percentage (usually 15% or 20%) of that amount.



, Once your loans are officially in default status, the Department of Education will assign them to a collections agency. You will probably receive snail mail, email, and/or phone calls from this collections agency, so determining who to contact should be simple. If, however, you do not know who to call, the government keeps a list of its collection agencies and their contact information at https://www.myeddebt.com/borrower/myoptions_collectionAgencies.If you have Perkins loans, you will need to speak to someone in your school’s financial aid office in addition to someone from your assigned collections agency. Perkins loans are administered through individual programs, so contact a local representative to ask about getting those loans out of default.

, Both methods will get your loans out of default, but the processes and ultimate benefits are a bit different.


Rehabilitating your loans will mean that you negotiate new payment terms with the collections agency and make those new payments regularly. The process will take almost a year, but ultimately, all references to the default will be removed from your credit.
Consolidating your loans with the federal government will mean that you get a new loan with a new interest rate, and you'll make regular payments on that. The reference to default won't be removed from your credit, but you'll be out of default status immediately. If you plan to go back to school and need access to further financial aid, consolidating might therefore be a better plan for you.

Apply for student aid.,
Learn the basic eligibility requirements.,
Take advantage of your independent status if possible.",How to Get a Student Loan With Bad Credit1," You can qualify for financial aid regardless of your credit score, and you can still get student loans from the federal government. Most federal financial aid is based on need alone; your credit is not taken into consideration. However, a bad credit history due to bankruptcy, default, foreclosure, etc., may affect you, especially on Parent and Graduate PLUS loans, but it doesn't automatically disqualify you. If you have bad credit, you should make the most of your federal financial aid opportunities before you move on to private funding, which can be much more difficult to secure.;
, To get federal financial aid, you need to be a U.S. citizen, a U.S. national, or a U.S. permanent resident. Your school of choice must be an accredited one, and you must be attending at least half time.


There are exceptions to the citizenship requirements, so check with the financial aid offices at any schools you are considering. Documented refugees and victims of human trafficking, for example, may qualify for financial aid., Depending on your circumstances, you may qualify for more federal financial aid if you are considered an independent student. If you will be at least 24 years old by the end of the year, you can fill out your financial aid paperwork as an independent student. This means that your parents’ income will not be considered, and you may get more aid.In certain cases, students under the age of 24 can qualify as independent. Talk to your financial aid office if you are an orphan, a former foster child, a ward of the court, homeless, a veteran, in graduate school or professional school, or married or have children.

Understand the loan rehabilitation process.,
Contact the appropriate collections agency to ask about your options.,
Explain your financial situation to your representative.,
Determine your monthly payment.,
Expect additional fees.,
Make your payments consistently for ten months.,
Be patient.,
Get your Rehabilitation Approval Notice.,
Continue making payments faithfully.",How to Get Student Loans out of Default2," In loan rehabilitation, you agree on a new monthly payment and make those payments consistently for ten months. At that point, the “default” status will be removed, and you can continue making payments as all borrowers do.


A major benefit of rehabilitation, as compared to consolidation, is that once you complete the process, the “default” note can be removed from your credit report. This makes rehabilitation the best option, long-term, for many borrowers. If you need to get your loans out of default as quickly as possible, though, you may want to consider consolidation instead.

, Speak to a representative, and explain that you want to get your student loans out of default.


Be polite but persistent. Some collections agents will tell you that your only option is to pay the debt in full, but this isn’t necessarily true. If you ask specifically about your options for rehabilitation, you should be able to find out more about possible payment plans.

, Give an accurate description of your income, your financial obligations, and your understanding of what your annual “discretionary income” is. Be clear about any obstacles you may be facing in terms of repaying your loans, including:


unemployment, underemployment, or irregular employment
medical conditions or disabilities (yours or your dependents’)
any other circumstances that have contributed to a financial hardship

, Loan rehabilitation payments are not based on any one uniform formula, so you’ll have to negotiate these terms with your individual collections agency. Aim to pay no more than 20% of your discretionary income, as anything more may jeopardize your ability to make your payments on time – keeping you in default status indefinitely.


Again, the best approach when negotiating with your collections agent is to be polite but persistent. Explain that you will commit a significant percentage of your discretionary income, but insist that an amount above 20% is prohibitively high. Emphasize the fact that you do not want to miss any more payments.

, When you rehabilitate a loan, the agency can add a collection fee of up to 16% of your total loan balance to your principal. You will therefore see a significant increase in your total debt.

, If you miss a payment, you will have to start the process over, so make your student loans a priority. Keep in mind that payments must not be more than 20 days late to qualify.


Note that any payments that the collections agency pulled from you through garnishment do not count toward the rehabilitation process. You need to pay voluntarily for ten months to get your loans out of default.

, Your loans will not be removed from default status until they are sold to a lender. This can take anywhere from a few weeks to a few months.

, After you have made ten regular payments and your loans are sold to a lender, you will receive a Rehabilitation Approval Notice informing you that your student loans are rehabilitated. The “default” status will be removed.

, Don’t neglect your obligations once your loans are out of default. Make your payments each month to avoid future defaults.

"
"
Understand the consolidation process.,
Apply for a consolidation loan through the federal government.,
Review your summary sheet.,
Make arrangements for repayment.,
Expect additional fees.,
Inform the appropriate collections agency.,
Make your payments faithfully.",How to Get Student Loans out of Default3," If you choose to get your student loans out of default by consolidating them, you’ll be taking all of your debt and combining it into one new loan.


Consolidation is not as good for your credit as rehabilitation is. The fact that you were in default will remain on your credit report. However, you’ll get to deal with the federal government instead of a collections agency, which many borrowers prefer, and you’ll get out of default faster.

, To apply, go to https://studentloans.gov/myDirectLoan/index.action. The process is simple, since this site will already have all of your information – including your loan amounts – on hand.


Avoid private consolidation loans. You are almost always better off consolidating through the Department of Education. If you go with a private lender instead, you will no longer have access to federal programs like income-based repayment, deferment, forbearance, and forgiveness. In addition, you may have to pay additional fees.

, After you apply, the Department of Education will send you a summary sheet, which will list all of the loans – including those in default – that will be included in your consolidation loan. Review this information.


If everything looks correct, do nothing. After fifteen days, the government will process your consolidation loan.
If anything looks inaccurate, or if you have questions, contact the Department of Education within fifteen days of the letter’s date.

, Once your consolidation loan is approved, you will need to sign up for a repayment plan. At this point, you’ll have three options:


Income-Based Repayment (IBR). Under this plan, you’ll make payments for twenty-five years, and after that, any remaining debt will be forgiven. Your payments will not exceed 15% of your discretionary income.
Pay-As-You-Earn Repayment. Under this plan, you’ll make payments for twenty years, and after that, any remaining debt will be forgiven. As with IBR, your payments will not exceed 15% of your discretionary income.
Income-Contingent Repayment (ICR). Under this plan, you’ll make payments for twenty-five years, and after that, any remaining debt will be forgiven. Your payments will not exceed 20% of your discretionary income.

, As with rehabilitation, there are fees associated with the consolidation process. Up to 18.5% of your loan balance may be added to your principal. You will therefore notice a significant increase in your total debt., Speak to your collections agent, and explain that you have applied for consolidation through the Department of Education. Different collections agencies will handle this situation in different ways, so be sure to ask what kind of proof you need to provide that your loans will no longer be in default.


Note that collections agencies may try to convince you that you must pay your loan in full or that you should make plans for rehabilitation through their service instead. This isn't true. If you've decided that consolidation is best for you, stay the course.

, Once your consolidation loan is processed, your loans will be out of default, but don’t neglect your obligations! Make your payments each month to avoid future defaults.


If you default on your consolidation loan, your will have a much harder time making arrangements to rehabilitate or consolidate again.

Tie your monthly payment to your income.,
Visit the United States Department of Education's Direct Loan Program online.",How to Refinance Student Loans1," Federally-guaranteed student loans are funded by the government and have a number of benefits. Private student loans can come from a variety of lenders including banks, credit unions, state agencies, or schools. Generally federal student loans have lower interest rates than private loans. Some federal loans also allow for a grace period upon graduation. For example, a Stafford Loan has a six month grace period so that you don’t need to begin repaying the loan immediately after graduating. Most private loans do not offer a grace period and you need to begin to pay them back as soon as you graduate.If you have multiple loans, pay off loans with a higher interest rate first so that you don’t accumulate more debt.;
, Some federal student loans will allow you to create a repayment plan that is based on your income. For example, your monthly repayments will directly reflect the amount of money that you make which will ensure that you can afford to pay off your student debt. If you have a private loan you will need to talk to your lender to determine if they can create an income based repayment plan., Direct Loans are funded by the U.S. Department of Education through your school and are managed by a loan servicer, under the supervision of the department. The Direct Loan Program allows you to choose your repayment plan and to switch your plan if your needs change.Take advantage of your public service career. The College Cost Reduction and Access Act of 2007 established a public service loan forgiveness program that discharges any remaining debt after 10 years of full-time employment in public service.
You must have made 120 payments as part of the direct loan program in order to obtain this benefit.
Only payments made on or after October 1, 2007 count toward the required 120 monthly payments.
Borrowers may consolidate into Direct Lending in order to qualify for this loan forgiveness program starting July 1, 2008.

Submit your Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) form early.,
Receive your Expected Family Contribution (EFC).,
Determine what attending your program will cost.,
Compare your cost of attendance with your EFC.,
Read the fine print.",How to Get a Student Loan With Bad Credit2," The FAFSA is the only way to apply for federal financial aid. Fill out the FAFSA online at www.fafsa.gov, or, if you know what school you will attend, request a form from the financial aid office. If you are trying to maximize your aid it’s to your benefit to submit the FAFSA. You should submit the form as early as possible, ideally during the January before your first fall term. This is because some loans are given on a first-come, first-served basis.The FAFSA asks about your tax information, including your social security number, your number of dependents, and your annual income. If you are not an independent adult over age 24, you will also have to provide your family’s tax information. However, do not make the mistake of waiting until you’ve filed your taxes to submit the FAFSA – you can submit the form using estimates.
Similarly, you don’t have to wait until you know which school you’ll be attending or how much it will cost. Get the form submitted as early as possible.

, Once you’ve submitted your FAFSA, you will receive a confirmation and an estimated EFC. The federal government determines your EFC with a formula, using the information from your FAFSA. This number represents the amount of money that the government expects you and your family to contribute to your education each year. The lower the EFC, the more financial aid you are likely to receive.Many students find that the EFC is higher than what they can actually afford to pay. If this is the case, don’t give up. You are also eligible for non-need-based federal aid, such as unsubsidized loans. By cutting costs and investigating other sources of support, you may still be able to attend your school of choice.

, Whether you’ve decided on a program or are debating the merits of multiple programs, you’ll need to determine what your annual expenses will actually be. Check with the school or schools for an estimated cost of attendance.


This cost should include not only tuition and fees but also room and board (unless you will live with parents or relatives for free), groceries and/or meal plan costs, textbooks, supplies, laboratory fees, transportation costs, day-care costs if you have young children, and miscellaneous personal expenses.

, In most cases, once you add up all your costs, you will have a number much higher than your EFC. You can get a rough estimate of what your federal financial aid will be by subtracting your EFC from the cost of attendance.As an example, consider a university with an annual cost of attendance of $27,000. If you have an EFC of $10,000, you would subtract that from the cost and see that you are likely to be offered $17,000 a year in financial aid. A significant portion of that amount will be in the form of student loans. If you cannot afford the $10,000 EFC, you can obtain unsubsidized loans to cover this amount.

, When your official financial aid offers arrive, read them carefully. Your financial aid package will typically consist of:


Grants. Grants are funded by the government and do not need to be paid back.
Loans. There are various types of loans, some subsidized and some unsubsidized, but all of them will eventually need to be paid back. It is extremely difficult to discharge student loans, even in bankruptcy.
Work-study offers. If you are awarded work study, you’ll spend a predetermined number of hours working somewhere on campus to earn that extra funding.

"
"
Familiarize yourself with your loans.,
Request additional funding for education-related expenses.,
Discuss other options with your parents.",How to Get a Student Loan With Bad Credit3," Accepting a student loan is a major responsibility: you are agreeing to use the money for your education and begin paying it back as soon as you graduate. If your credit is bad, having this additional debt may place a considerable financial burden on you, possibly for decades to come. Take the time to distinguish between the different types of loans and understand how they work.


Direct Subsidized Stafford Loans are awarded based on financial need. These are the least risky, especially for someone with bad credit. The government will pay the interest on subsidized loans while you are in school, and for six months following your graduation. From that point on, you will be responsible for making payments, and interest will accumulate.Direct Unsubsidized Stafford Loans can be awarded through your school regardless of your financial need. These will make a bigger impact on your overall debt because, unlike Direct Subsidized Loans, you will be responsible for all of the interest and payments.Federal Perkins Loans are an additional form of funding earmarked for students with the most need. They have a low interest rate of 5% and do not need to be repaid until after you graduate., Depending on your school, you may be able to petition your financial aid office to adjust your offer. Pertinent expenses might include: costs associated with child care, if you have children, costs associated with a disability, or medical costs not covered by insurance.

, If your funding is still inadequate, and you have supportive parents who are willing to help, consider having them apply for a federal PLUS (Parent Loan for Undergraduate Student). These loans have the downside that interest rates are higher than other student loans but they are still much cheaper than a private loan from a bank.


Note that these Parent loans cannot be used for graduate or professional school. There is a separate graduate/professional school PLUS loan that the student applies for.
Parent loans are also very difficult to discharge, even with bankruptcy, so only consider this option once you have exhausted other financial aid sources.

"
"
Consider your other options first.,
Make sure you meet the basic eligibility requirements.,
Request credit reports from the three major credit reporting agencies.,
Review your credit reports.,
Check your credit score.,
Plan to borrow as little as possible.,
Research your options.,
Get a cosigner.,
Apply for your loan.,
Read the terms and conditions carefully.",How to Get a Student Loan With Bad Credit4," Federal financial aid is almost always a better option than private lending, and this is especially true if you have a bad credit. The government does not consider your credit score for most forms of aid; rather, they award you grants and loans based on need alone. They do look at your credit history, but are much more forgiving than a private lender. If you have already borrowed as much as you can from the federal government, and you cannot cut your costs, you may have to look into private funding.


Some programs, such as study abroad, may need to be paid for partially through private loans if they cost significantly more than a semester's tuition at your college.

, Although requirements may vary from lender to lender, most institutions require you to be a U.S. citizen, a U.S. national, or a U.S. permanent resident. Additionally, you typically need to attend an accredited institution at least half time; lenders won’t usually loan you money to take only a course or two each term.

, Under federal law, you are entitled to request one free credit report every year from each of the three main agencies: Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion. Rather than contacting these agencies directly, you’ll need to go to annualcreditreport.com and submit the Annual Credit Report Request Form.If you want to review your credit reports from these agencies more than once per year, you’ll have to go to each individual agency’s website and purchase the extra reports.

, As long as you submitted the Annual Credit Report Request Form online, you’ll be able to view your reports right away (you may have to wait up to 15 days if you ordered by mail or phone). Read your reports carefully; if you notice any errors, you can dispute them by contacting the appropriate agency or even better, the store or bank you originally did business with., The free credit reports you get from annualcreditreport.com do not include your credit score, but it's important that you have this information before applying for a private loan. If you want to obtain your credit score, your bank may offer this service or for other sources visit Check Your Credit Score.


Credit scores range from 300 to 850. In general, a credit score over 750 is excellent and will qualify you for loans and lines of credit with the best terms. If your score is under 620, you are considered a high-risk borrower, and you may have trouble securing private student loans without help.
If your score is lower than you expected it to be, check your credit reports. Sometimes errors are made that unfairly impact your credit score. You can contact the credit bureaus to resolve these errors.

, Private loans are, in the long term, more expensive than federal financial aid, and you’ll have fewer options for deferring or consolidating your payments after you graduate. You don’t want to risk further damage to your credit by borrowing money you will never be able to pay back. Resist the urge to apply for more than you need.

, There are a variety of private student loans available from banks, credit unions, and other lenders, but you don’t want to start applying without doing some research. Consider using websites like Student Loan Analytics to compare products, and beware of advertisements telling you that you can qualify for lots of money regardless of your credit – these tend to be scams or, at best, loans with terrible interest rates.As you shop around, pay particular attention to interest rates, repayment terms, credit requirements, the amount of money you can borrow, and regulations concerning how the money can be used.

, If your credit is less than stellar, it will be very difficult to get a private student loan in your own name – and almost impossible to get one with decent terms and a moderate interest rate. Therefore, consider finding someone with better credit (a parent, perhaps, or another relative) to cosign the loan with you.


Make sure that your cosigner is fully aware of his or her obligations. Cosigning involves a very high level of responsibility. If you don’t make your payments after graduation, the cosigner could wind up having to pay or damage his or her credit.
Private student loans are almost never discharged by bankruptcy. Borrowing more than you need could mean your elderly parents are paying the loans well into their retirement. Exhaust all other sources of financial aid before borrowing private student loans, and then, borrow only what you truly need.

, Once you’ve found a lender who seems promising, apply for the loan. In most cases, you can fill out all the necessary paperwork online.


Be sure you are applying for a designated student loan, not simply a personal loan. In most cases, you can wait to make payments on a student loan until after you are finished with school. This isn’t the case with personal loans – you’ll have to make payments right away. If your budget won’t allow for that, stick to loans for students.

, If you qualify for the loan, don’t accept it until you have read the fine print. Know what the interest rate is, when you’ll have to start making payments, and how the money can be used.

Know the eligibility requirements for federal financial aid.,
Complete your FAFSA as early as possible.,
Get your EFC.,
Determine the cost of your program.,
Compare your estimated costs with your EFC.,
Read your financial aid offers carefully.,
Know what kinds of loans you are accepting.,
Weigh your options carefully before accepting a federal loan.,
Consider making interest payments while you are in school.",How to Get a Student Loan1," In order to receive financial aid from the federal government, you must be a U.S. citizen, a U.S. national, or a U.S. permanent resident. You must also enroll at least half-time at an accredited college or university.


Certain non-citizens can be granted exceptions to the requirement to be a citizen, national, or permanent resident. If you are a documented refugee, or you hold a T-visa (a visa granted to victims of human trafficking), for example, you may be eligible for federal financial aid. Check in with financial aid officers at schools you are considering to be sure.;
, You can fill out the FAFSA (Free Application for Federal Student Aid) during the January preceding the school year for which you will need a student loan. The FAFSA is the most important financial aid form; it gives you access to a wide variety of government grants and loans. Because some kinds of aid are awarded on a first-come, first-served basis, it’s important to get this crucial piece of paperwork filed as soon as you can. There’s no need to wait until you know what program you’ll be attending or even until you know that you’ll need a loan – submit the form regardless.


You can fill out the FAFSA online at www.fafsa.gov. If you prefer a paper version, you can download one from the website or, if you know which college you will be attending, you can request one from the financial aid office.The FAFSA will require your family’s tax information (or, if you are an independent adult, your own tax information). This will include social security numbers, numbers of dependents, and annual income. However, you can submit your FAFSA using projected estimates, so do not feel that you need to wait until you’ve completed your taxes., Within a few days of submitting your FAFSA, you will receive a report that confirms your application and informs you of your EFC (Expected Family Contribution). The EFC is determined by a formula from the information on your FAFSA; it represents the theoretical amount of money your family will be expected to contribute to your education. This number will determine how much financial aid you’ll ultimately be offered by programs that accept you.Note that the EFC is simply a number determined by a formula. It may not be an accurate representation of what you and your family feel you can actually afford, and it may not be the amount you wind up paying. Try not to get discouraged if the number is much higher than you’d like; you may be able to find funding sources that will help reduce your costs.

, Once you know where you’ll be going to school – or, at least, once you’ve narrowed your choices down to a few programs that have accepted you – calculate your costs. Virtually every school will provide a breakdown of costs for you, so check websites or call the financial aid offices for more information. And don’t make the mistake of looking only at tuition! Depending on your program, major, and personal circumstances, you’ll also need to consider:


housing costs (unless you will be living for free with your parents or elsewhere)
meals (whether you sign up for a school meal plan or not)
student fees
textbooks, supplies, and laboratory fees
transportation expenses
miscellaneous personal expenses

, For most students, the estimated cost of attending your program of choice will be significantly more than your EFC. If you subtract your EFC from the annual cost, you’ll have a basic estimate of how much financial aid you’ll likely be offered. Although it isn’t official, this estimate should help you start planning a budget.Say, for example, that the annual cost of attendance at your university of choice is $24,000. If your EFC is $9,000, that means that the federal government assumes, from your FAFSA, that your family can contribute $9,000 a year. The difference between $24,000 and $9,000 -- $15,000 -- is what you are likely to be offered in financial aid.

, When the official financial aid offers come through from the schools that have accepted you, read them. In most cases, they represent the maximum amount you will be able to get from the federal government and from the school itself. Financial aid packages typically consist of:


Grants. These do not need to be paid back, so you should simply be able to accept them and apply them to your education-related expenses.
Loans. These are the federal loans you are being offered based on your FAFSA. You may choose to accept some or all of this money depending on your needs.
Work-study offers. Work-study money has to be earned by working a certain number of hours on campus.

, When you accept a student loan, you become responsible for that debt. Take the time to understand what these loans are and how they work.


Direct Subsidized Stafford Loans are awarded based on financial need. While you are in school, and for six months following your graduation, the government will pay the interest for you. After that, you will be responsible for making payments, and interest will begin to accumulate.Direct Unsubsidized Stafford Loans can be awarded through your school regardless of your financial need. Unlike Direct Subsidized Loans, all of the interest is your responsibility. You don’t have to make payments while you are in school, but interest will accumulate during that time.Federal Perkins Loans are awarded in addition to other loans for students with significant demonstrable need. They have a low interest rate of 5% and do not need to be repaid until after you graduate., Unfortunately, many students graduate from college with tremendous amounts of debt and no clear means to pay it off. The federal government is somewhat flexible about repayment plans, and in some circumstances, you may be able to postpone or reduce your payments, but the fact remains that student loan debt can be a financial burden that follows you for decades. If you can pay for more of your education yourself – by attending a cheaper program, completing your first two years at a community college, working while you go to school, and/or accepting more help from parents and other family members – consider doing so.


Although education is valuable in and of itself, one thing to consider is whether your program of study is likely to lead to a secure, well-paying job. If you are studying drama or philosophy or another field that is famous for its unemployment rates, you should approach student loan debt with extra caution.

, To minimize your overall debt upon graduation, consider making payments during the school year. Even if you can only manage small interest payments on your unsubsidized loans, you will make repayment during the years after graduation much easier.

Contact your current lender.,
Contact a local bank.,
Choose the repayment option with the shortest term length.,
Compare borrower protections between lenders.,
Consider loan consolidation.,
Choose the best consolidation offer for you.",How to Refinance Student Loans2," The market for loans is very competitive these days, and after years of high unemployment, a borrower with a good credit history is a valuable asset. If your credit is good, your lender may find value in either lowering your interest rate, or extending your loan period in order to retain your business.You will likely need to provide your lender with proof of employment in order to assure them that you will be able to pay your loan.
You will also need to give the lender your credit score so that they can evaluate how well you have managed debt in the past.

, More and more people are moving away from the big banks, and finding a great deal of satisfaction in community banks and local credit unions. Talk to the loan officers there about the potential for refinancing your loans locally. They may be able to help you, or at the very least offer further guidance or a referral., If you are refinancing your loan in order to decrease the amount of interest you are paying then you should choose the option with the shortest term length. This will likely increase your monthly payments, but if you can afford to pay more it is an excellent idea to shorten the length of your loan so that you pay less interest.You can also pay off more than the monthly minimums as a way to speed up the repayment process.

, One thing to look for when comparing refinancing options between lenders is different types of borrower protection. For example, look for lenders that have deferment, forbearance, or flexible repayment options. Even if you don’t currently need those options, because you can easily make the monthly payments, they are always a good idea to have. You never know if you will encounter a financial pitfall at some point.Divorce, job loss, a mortgage, or additional children can all impact your ability to pay off your student loan.

, If you have multiple different loans try consolidating them. This makes it easier to pay off because all of your loans are combined into one monthly payment. Balance the difference in the costs between consolidating all loans together versus consolidating only the private loans and keeping federally-funded loans separate.Consolidating loans can also help to lower the payment and interest rates.
Keep in mind that when you consolidate your loans this will typically make the payment period longer, which will cost more money overall.

, When comparing offers of consolidation you should look for the lowest interest rate possible. You may also need to decide between a fixed or variable interest rate. This is typically left up to personal preference. A fixed rate will stay the same throughout the entire term and is usually higher and a variable interest rate will often start lower, but may raise throughout the term of the loan."

Determine why you need to refinance your student loan.,
Create a balance sheet totalling all of your sources of income, and all of your expenses.,
Request a current credit report.,
Evaluate your student loan at different stages in your life.",How to Refinance Student Loans3," It's a good idea to have a clear understanding of how much student debt you have and what some of the possible solutions are prior to refinancing your loans. You may be refinancing simply to reduce your debt or interest payments, or you may be refinancing because you want to consolidate multiple loans into a single debt and payment structure.While it's important to have a goal in either case, knowing how much you can actually afford will make all the difference when shopping for an refinancing solution.

, Track your income and expenses in great detail for an entire month, so that you have an accurate gauge of how much you're spending versus how much you are bringing in. This will help you determine how much you can afford to pay monthly in student loans. Test out these budget applications to help track your monthly budget:You Need a Budget

, Before you go shopping for any sort of loan, know your credit score. The higher it is, the more bargaining power you have with lenders, so it's important to maintain good credit.


If your credit is not as good as it could be, devote a few months to bringing it back up. The money you save in interest and fees, in the long run, will be well worth the effort.

, Once you have settled on a repayment plan it is important to reassess that plan periodically. For example, as you begin to earn more money you may want to start paying off your loan at a faster rate. Similarly marriage, buying a home, and having children may change the amount that you can afford to pay towards your student debt on a monthly bases. It is important that you constantly assess your financial situation and adjust your payment structure accordingly.Typically you can not make changes to your repayment structure more than once per year.

Shop around for the best mortgage rates.,
Look into SoFi’s student loan payoff refinance.,
Crunch your student loan numbers.,
Estimate the costs of taking out a mortgage.,
Understand the risks of taking out a mortgage.",How to Pay Off Student Loans with a Mortgage1," You can typically get either a home equity loan or a home equity line of credit. Consider the differences:


Home equity loan. You borrow against the equity in your home. You’ll repay the loan in installments, just as you did your original mortgage. Generally, your home equity loan will have a fixed interest rate.
Home equity line of credit (HELOC). Tap the equity in your home like you would a credit card. You don’t pay back in installments. Instead, the amount varies, much like a credit card payment.A HELOC might start off with a lower interest rate, but the rate usually fluctuates and can go higher over time.;
, You’ll only really save if the interest rate on the mortgage is lower than the rate on your student loans. Accordingly, research the current interest rates available from lenders. Stop at local banks and tell them you are interested in getting a second mortgage.Check interest rates online. Website aggregators, such as LendingTree and Bankrate.com, let you compare many lenders at once.
Also consider fees and closing costs, which will increase the cost of the loan. If you can’t find this information online, ask the lender.
Interest rates are different for home equity loans and HELOCs, so decide which one you want to pursue. If you’re undecided, then collect rate information for both types of loans.

, Generally, interest rates on a second mortgage will be higher than they were on your original mortgage. Accordingly, getting a home equity loan or HELOC on your own might not be beneficial. However, the non-bank lender SoFi will roll your student loans into your mortgage at current, low interest rates., Before applying, you need to calculate how much you’ll save, if anything. Use an online calculator to estimate how much you will pay over the life of your student loans.Enter the total amount you owe, the interest rate, and the number of payments you have left.


For example, you might owe $50,000 in student loans at 6.8% interest. Over 10 years, you’ll pay about $69,000 in total, of which $19,000 is interest.

, Interest rates are only one part of the overall cost of your student loans. You also need to consider the repayment period. Generally, student loans are paid back over 10 years. However, your mortgage might last for up to 30 years. Use a debt repayment calculator to estimate the total cost of repaying the student loans using the terms of a home mortgage.For example, you might have $50,000 in loans. Your mortgage will have a 4% interest rate over 30 years. In total, you will pay about $85,000, of which $35,000 is interest. This is much more expensive than simply paying your student loans.
If you took a 15-year mortgage at 4%, then you will pay about $66,600 in total, of which $16,000 is interest. You can save about $3,000 by using a mortgage to repay your student loans.

, By taking out a mortgage on your home, you can lose the house if you run into financial trouble down the road. This happens because your home acts as collateral for the loan. When you default, the lender can seize the collateral—your house.By contrast, a student loan lender can garnish your wages, but they can’t seize your home.You only put your home at risk by taking out a mortgage.
Think twice before taking out a mortgage to pay off your children’s student loans. They probably have a lower income, so the lender can’t even garnish that much to pay off the loans.

Consider a “grad loan.” Some lenders will have special loans available for graduating or recently graduated students.These loans might be available for students who have little or not credit history, and they might offer beneficial terms.,
Avoid using a student loan to purchase a car.Students often have easier access to student loans than other sources of financing, which can make one seem like a good option for paying for a car.,
Consider getting a cosigner.",How to Get a Student Car Loan," In order to qualify for a student auto loan in many cases, you must be currently enrolled in an educational program (undergraduate, graduate, technical, high school, etc.).If you are taking a semester off from your program, for instance, you may not be permitted to apply for a student auto loan.


You may be asked to show proof of your enrollment, such as a student ID or enrollment certificate.Some lenders have age restrictions on who can apply for a student auto loan (such as only students between the ages of 18 and 24), while others have no such restrictions.;
, Some lenders will offer student discounts if an applicant has a high GPA.If your GPA is not high enough, you can consider working to raise it before applying for an auto loan, or look for other discounts instead.

, Many lenders will only provide an auto loan if the applicant has income, even if the applicant is a current student.If your lender has this requirement, your income must typically meet certain criteria. Normally, your income must be high enough to cover the loan payments and any other major obligations you have (such as rent). In many cases, student loans and other financial aid cannot be counted as income.


Whether or not your lender requires you to report income, you will want to create a budget to help determine what kind of auto loan you will ultimately be able to afford. There are online tools available that can help you determine the total cost of owning a particular car, including payments, fuel, maintenance, insurance, etc., The primary consideration many lenders use to decide whether or not to qualify you for a loan is not your student status, but your credit score.If you have a high credit score, you have better chances of being approved for an auto loan. A good credit score also increases your chances of getting favorable loan terms. You can check your credit score by requesting a report from a credit reporting agency.


Credit scores above 700 have a good chance of getting the most favorable interest rates, scores of 600-700 are likely to get reasonable interest rates, and scores lower than 600 are likely to lead to higher interest rates.The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) permits each consumer to receive a free credit report from each of the major credit reporting agencies (Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion) once per year.These free reports do not include your credit score, however. If you want your credit score included with your report, there will be an associated fee.
Even if your credit score is lower than you might like it to be, you may still be approved for a loan, though it will probably have higher financing fees.
Many lenders require you to have a certain amount of credit history (such as two years) in order to qualify for an auto loan.If you do not have any credit history, you will most likely need a cosigner for the loan.

, In any case, you will want to find a balance between finding a car that you want and one that you can afford.


Consider all potential costs when deciding which car to purchase, including fuel, maintenance, and insurance costs.
You can purchase a used car or a new car. Interest rates, down payments, and other financial considerations can vary widely. You can likely find a used car for less than the price of a new car of the same model. However, some new cars are more affordable than some used cars. New cars may also come with maintenance plans or other benefits that can lower your overall costs of owning the vehicle.

, Many banks offer auto loans, and you can ask them about what they can offer you. Make sure to mention that you are student, to see what special options might be available to you.


One advantage of visiting a bank before shopping for a car is that you can be pre-approved for a loan up to a certain amount.This can make the buying process easier because you will have an idea of what you can spend, and the dealer will know that the bank as already agreed to offer a loan.Banks will need certain information from you so that you can apply for a loan, such as your Social Security Number, employer’s name, your monthly income, etc., You can go shopping for a car before or after you have applied for an auto loan. Many car dealers have existing relationships with lenders, and can help you through the application process.

, Whether you are looking at getting an auto loan through a bank or through a car dealer, it can be a good idea to ask several different locations for information about loans. Banks and car dealers compete with each other, so shopping around can help you get a good deal.

, Some student auto loans have upper or lower limits on the amount you can be approved for.If the cost of the car you are thinking about purchasing is outside the limits (if any) of a particular loan, you will need to look for either a different car or a different loan.

, In some cases, as a student applicant, you may be able to get a loan that will finance up to 100% of the value of the car (or an upper loan limit, if the loan has one).In other cases, you may have to provide a down payment that may vary based on the terms of the loan and/or the value of the car.


The size of your down payment, if any, can effect the cost of your auto loan: paying a larger down payment can lower your monthly payments and perhaps the interest on the loan, while a lower down payment will decrease your up front costs for getting the car.
You may be able to get a lower interest rate on your loan if you agree to make a larger down payment., As a student applicant for a loan, you may be able to get a reduction in the loan’s interest rate, which can save you money.Even if an auto loan is not specifically advertised as a “student” loan, you might still be able to get a discount like this if you ask about one.


Remember to ask about student auto loan interest rate reductions based on GPA.

, If you are a customer of the bank you are thinking getting an auto loan from, ask if there are any special discounts on interest rates or fees for current customers.Even small savings can add up over the term of the loan.


Some banks have special relationships with particular educational institutions.Tell the lender which school you are attending, and ask if there are any associated discounts or special offers.

, The length of some loans can be extended, lowering the amount of each payment.For example, if an auto loan normally has payments of $300 a month for 60 months, you might be able to extend the terms to 72 months and pay $260 month. Choosing this option means it will take longer to pay off the car, but the monthly payments might be more affordable. Some lenders will offer this option to student applicants.


Extending the loan term will in most cases increase your finance charges, so that the total amount you will end up paying for the car is more than with a standard term loan for the same car.If you choose a loan term extension option, try to get the lowest interest rate you can.

, Many lenders now offer a small reduction (such as 0.50%) in the interest rate of an auto loan if the applicant agrees to have the loan payments automatically deducted from an account.While the interest rate reduction might not seem like much, it can save you money over the entire loan term.

, If you are not approved for another student auto loan, cannot find one with good terms, or just want to take advantage of a good deal, you might consider delaying getting an auto loan until you are able to qualify for a grad loan.

, However, student loans often have substantially higher interest rates than auto loans. Many student loans only allow you to use the funds for qualified educational expenses such as tuition, textbooks, and room and board, so these cannot be used to purchase a car anyway.


If you are seeking other options for paying for an auto loan, talk to your school’s financial aid officer for advice. He or she may know of good offers that are available in your community.

, If you have no credit or are having difficulty finding an auto loan with favorable terms, you can ask someone (such as a parent) with established credit to cosign a loan with you.A cosigner agrees to share with you the legal responsibility for paying back the loan. This support can convince the lender to give you a more favorable loan, or a loan at all.


A cosigner is legally obligated in most cases to pay back the loan if you are unable to, so think of a potential cosigner who is someone you trust and have a good relationship with.
Taking out a cosigned loan will affect your credit and your cosigner’s.
If you get a loan with a cosigner’s help, be diligent about paying back the loan. Defaulting on it will harm your credit and the cosigner’s, and potentially damage your relationship.

Look to federal financial aid first.,
Know the eligibility requirements for private loans.,
Decide how much money you need to borrow.,
Do your research.,
Find a cosigner.,
Apply with the lender of your choice.,
Read the fine print.,
Consider making interest payments while you are in school.",How to Get a Student Loan2," In general, you are much better off accepting student loans from the government than you are applying for loans from banks and other lenders. Fees and interest rates for private loans almost always exceed those associated with federal aid. Therefore, apply for private student loans only if you have borrowed the maximum in federal financial aid and still need more money for your education.


Keep in mind that even if interest rates seem similar when you compare federal and private student loans, most federal loans are fixed – that is, the interest rate will remain the same. Private loans, on the other hand, do not typically offer that security. Your interest rate could increase over time.
In addition, private student loans are not usually eligible for the deferment and forgiveness plans that apply to many federal loans.

, Many of the same eligibility requirements that apply to federal financial aid apply to private loans. In general, you must be a U.S. citizen, national, or permanent resident, and you must be attending an accredited college or university at least half time. Check with individual lenders to see what other criteria may apply.

, Again, remember that private loans can be more expensive than federal loans, and you’ll have fewer options for deferring your payments down the road. Therefore, when you calculate how much you’ll need to borrow, take care to cover your costs without taking on any unnecessary debt.

, Applying for private loans can be overwhelming because there are so many different potential lenders with such a wide variety of loans on offer. Take the time to compare these products. Websites such as Student Lending Analytics can help you do so efficiently.As you shop around, consider, first and foremost:


interest rates
repayment terms
the amount of money you can borrow
any regulations concerning how the money can be used

, If you don’t have a good credit history in your own name – and most students who apply for private student loans do not – you will need someone to cosign for you. Parents and other relatives often make good cosigners.


As tempting as it might be to gloss over the potential consequences of cosigning for you, it’s important to be responsible and let your cosigners know what they are getting into. Cosigning is not simply vouching for you; it’s assuming responsibility for your debt. If you don’t make your payments – or if, due to financial hardship, you can’t make your payments – your cosigner will be responsible. Your loan could therefore negatively affect his or her credit and financial circumstances.

, When you’ve weighed your options and, if necessary, found a cosigner, you can go ahead and apply for a loan with a bank or other lender. Application procedures vary depending on the institution, but in general, you’ll simply have to fill out some paperwork and agree to a credit check for you and your cosigner. Many lenders have simple online application forms.

, If your application is successful and you are offered a loan, read all of the terms and conditions before you accept it. Make sure, especially, that you understand your interest rate and the terms of repayment.

, To minimize your overall debt upon graduation, consider making payments during the school year. Even if you can only manage small interest payments, you will make repayment during the years after graduation much easier.

Realize the disadvantages of consolidation.",How to Get a Rebate on Consolidated Student Loans," To decide on consolidating private loans, you’ll have to shop around. Compare loan servicing agents like Chase, NextStudent, Student Loan Network, and Wells Fargo, which are highly rated by Forbes.As you compare consolidation loans with various private companies, pay particular attention to the interest rate – this will make a huge difference in how much you wind up paying overall.
For federal student loans, there’s no question – you are better off consolidating with the Department of Education, where interest rates are capped and you keep your access to programs like deferment, forbearance, and forgiveness.;
, After you shop around and find out the deals that other lenders are offering, then contact the bank or servicing agent that handles each of your current loans. Find out if they will match or beat the deals that you have found. Your own bank has an incentive to keep your business, so if the offers you have found are reasonable, then your own lender may be willing to offer you something a bit better.

, Lenders will generally advertise the incentives that they offer, in order to get your attention and get your business. However, you still may have to ask. When you find a lender that you think looks promising, and you find an interest rate that you believe you can afford, find out if they offer a rebate program for consolidating. Ask the following questions:Do they offer a rebate for consolidating student loans?
Do your particular loans qualify for the rebate?
Is the rebate a fixed amount, or is it a percentage of the amount of your loans?
How much can you receive?
Is the rebate issued to you in cash, or is it only available to deduct the loan amount? (Some lenders will advertise a rebate program, but the rebate is only available as a loan deduction.)

, As you speak with various lenders, keep notes of the programs that you find. You should compare the interest rates, length of the consolidated loan, and the details of any incentives that they offer. There is no single formula to determine the best offer. You will have to decide what your primary goal is with consolidating. If you mainly want to lower your monthly payments, then you may not be as concerned with the overall length of the loan. However, if you want to reduce your total payment, then you need to compare both the rate and the total length. Finally, if you are focused on getting a rebate to “earn” some immediate cash in your pocket, you will have to consider the amount that each lender is offering.The agent for each lender should be able to help you with the comparisons. You should be able to ask, “What would the total cost of the consolidated loan be?” and the agent should be able to calculate that for you very quickly.

, After comparing all the data, you just need to make a choice. Choose the consolidation program that best fits your needs. This will be the loan that creates a monthly payment that you can afford, while keeping the total cost in a range that you are satisfied with. If the rebate is important to you, then choose the lender with the best rebate offer.


Understand that some rebate offers appear attractive at the time, but over the length of the loan an offer of a lower interest rate may wind up saving you much more money. The choice is yours., Once a lender gets your signature on the loan contract, then the lender’s incentive to help you may vanish. You will need to read the contract very carefully and follow through with the detailed instructions to complete your rebate. You often have some forms to complete and submit to an office, in order to claim your rebate.If you do not submit the paperwork on time, you may be disqualified from receiving your rebate. Your loan consolidation will still be complete, but the rebate will be gone.

, If the contract does not provide clear enough instructions, or if you have any questions at all, you should be able to call the agent and ask about claiming your rebate. You may have to submit a form, or you may need to register an account online., Some programs will issue a rebate only after you satisfy some specific condition. Usually this is tied to making payments on the loan. Whatever the condition, you need to understand it and then meet it. Even a small, seemingly technical omission can cost you the full rebate.


For example, one loan program offers a cash rebate, at the time you enter into the loan, of 1.5% of the amount of the loan. However, the condition is that you must then make the first twelve monthly payments in full and on time. If you miss even one payment, or are late at all, the amount of the rebate is added back into the loan.Working with that example, suppose you borrow $40,000. You would receive $600 cash at the time of the loan. But you would then be required to make your monthly payments all on time. If you miss one, the $600 would be added back into the loan amount. In effect, your rebate would be lost.

, You may have any combination of Stafford, Perkins, PLUS, and other federal loans. In addition, you may owe on some private loans as well. Many borrowers don’t have an accurate sense of what they owe. Gather all your records and make a list of all your loans. Write down the names of the lenders and your monthly payments, whether or not you have actually been making those payments.


You can get data about your federal loans from the National Student Loan Data System at https://www.nslds.ed.gov/npas/index.htm. This site will allow you to see all of your federal financial aid records.
If you are unsure about your private loans, contact the lender directly. Ask for information about your outstanding balance and documentation about the terms and conditions of your loans.

, Once you have an accurate and complete list of the loans, review the information to determine whether consolidation would be helpful. Ask yourself honestly if you are able to make your payments on time and whether you can afford them. If any of your payments are delinquent, then consolidation may be a good idea. You may need to consolidate your loans if any of the following situations apply:Your federal loans are in default. This means you have not paid for 270 days. Consolidation will move them out of default status and reduce the effect on your credit rating.
You are behind in paying on your private loans, and you cannot get caught up. Consolidation will help you get the debt under control and minimize the long-term damage to your credit.
You are making payments, but you do not believe that you can continue to afford them. If you worry that you will become delinquent or default in the future, then consolidating your loans may help you get a lower monthly payment so that you can keep your loans current.
You are making multiple monthly payments on different loans and want to simplify the process. Consolidating your loans will simplify the process, because you will make only one payment to one lender, rather than multiple payments. You cannot consolidate private loans and federal loans together, so if you have a combination, you would then have two payments. But this still may be an improvement.

, Consolidation is not a perfect solution for everyone. If you consolidate to lower the monthly payments, you could wind up making those payments for more years. In the end, you may wind up paying more in total.In addition, you need to consider the following:


For private loans, a fee of up to 18.5% of your loan balance may be added to your principal as a service for the consolidation. If you owe $20,000, for example, this would amount to a service fee of $3,700.
Your interest rate could increase. Federal interest rates are capped by law, but even the cap is fairly high, especially when you consider that you may be paying for decades.
You may lose benefits associated with specific loans. If you are consolidating with a plan of receiving a rebate, you need to read the loan carefully. Consolidating creates new loans in place of the original ones. Any benefits or special terms that you had under the original loans may disappear. You need to ask the lender very carefully if you might still be eligible for a rebate after consolidation."

Estimate your home’s value.,
Calculate how much you can borrow.,
Check that you satisfy loan requirements.,
Apply.,
Pay off your student loans.",How to Pay Off Student Loans with a Mortgage2," You can’t borrow more than your home is worth, so you need some idea of its current value. Estimate the value in the following ways:


Look at your tax bill, which should contain the assessed value. Contact your county assessor if you’ve lost your bill.
Research how much comparable homes have sold for in your area. Visit the Zillow or Trulia websites. Make sure the homes are similar in size, with the same number of bedrooms and bathrooms.
Have your home appraised. You’ll probably have to pay a few hundred dollars to get a professional appraisal. Obtain referrals to an appraiser from a real estate agent or your lawyer.

, Let’s say your home is worth $200,000, but you still owe $100,000 on the mortgage. In this situation, you only have $100,000 in equity. Generally, lenders let you borrow up to 85% of your home’s equity.In this situation, you can borrow up to $85,000 to repay student loans.

, In addition to having equity in your home, you’ll need to satisfy other requirements—just as you did when you applied for your initial mortgage. Review the following:Credit score. Generally, you need good credit to get a second mortgage. However, if you have substantial equity, you might still qualify if you have a lower score.
Income. You need to prove that you can repay the loan.
Debt-to-income ratio. Add up all debt, including credit card debt, and compare it to your income. For example, you might make $4,000 a month but have $1,000 a month in debt payments. In this situation, your ratio is 25%. Generally, your ratio must be 45% or lower to qualify for a loan.

, If you’re comfortable with the risks, then contact a loan officer and ask for an application. Remember to provide all information requested and double check it for accuracy. If you have a question about the application, contact the loan officer for help.

, Once you get the mortgage, you need to use the proceeds to pay off your student loans. If you go with SoFi, they pay your student loan lenders directly. You won’t receive a check, and can instead sit back and relax.However, if you get your own mortgage, you’ll receive a check from your lender. You need to deposit it into your bank account and then pay off your student loans.

The standard repayment plan for student loans is 10 years. You’ll pay an equal amount each month for 120 months.There are many ways to lower the amount you pay each month, either temporarily or permanently. Reduce your discretionary spending as much as possible, which will give you more repayment options.

, This is usually a better option than refinancing a mortgage to pay off your student loans. You can roll all of your student loans into one loan with a lower interest rate. Consolidating makes repayment easier, and it can lower your monthly payment.


You can consolidate federal loans using a Direct Consolidation Loan, which you apply for through the StudentLoans.gov website. However, this new loan’s APR will be the weighted average of APRs for all of your current loans, so you won’t save money.To save money, consolidate with a private loan. You can use a private loan to consolidate either federal or private student loans. Generally, you need a credit score in the mid-600s. Interest rates range from two to nine percent.

, Federal loans will let you pay a lower amount each month if your income is low. Contact your lender and ask about any of the following:REPAYE Plan. Pay 10% of your discretionary income. Any borrower is eligible.
PAYE plan. Pay 10% of your discretionary income and never more than the 10-year Standard Repayment Plan amount. This plan has income eligibility requirements.
IBR Plan. Pay 10% or 15% of your discretionary income, depending on when you borrowed the loans. This plan has income-eligibility requirements.
ICR Plan. Pay either 20% of your discretionary income or what you would pay over the course of a 12-year fixed repayment plan. If you have PLUS loans, this is your only option.

, You can lower your monthly payment by extending the repayment period for up to 25 years.You’ll end up paying more in interest over the life of the loan, but you won’t put your home at risk like you will by paying the loans off with a mortgage.


Use the Repayment Estimator to check how much you’ll end up paying., Federal loans qualify for this option. The details will differ depending on your circumstances, but you typically pay a lower amount the first couple of years. The amount increases in subsequent years. Graduated payment is a good option if you anticipate your income rising in the future.You can combine a graduated repayment plan with an extended repayment plan.

, You can temporarily lower your monthly payments or stop making them altogether by seeking a forbearance or deferment. With forbearance, interest continues to accrue on your loans. However, it generally doesn’t accrue with deferment., Your private loans have fewer repayment options than federal loans.To find out exactly what is offered, call up the lender and ask. Don’t delay.


Generally, your best option is to consolidate with a lower interest rate.
However, some lenders might offer short-term forbearance.

Understand the potential disadvantages of consolidation.,
Decide who to contact.",How to Consolidate Student Loans1," Student loans can be confusing (you might have any combination of Stafford, Perkins, PLUS, and other federal loans, and you might also have private loans), and many borrowers don’t have an accurate sense of what they owe and to whom they owe it. Check your records, and make sure you have a complete list of all your loans, who services them, and what your current monthly payments are – whether you have actually been making those payments or not.


If you are unsure about your federal loans, visit the National Student Loan Data System at https://www.nslds.ed.gov/npas/index.htm. This site will allow you to see all of your federal financial aid records.
If you are unsure about your private loans, follow up with the appropriate lender or lenders. They will provide documentation about what you owe and what the terms and conditions of your loans are.;
, Once you have accurate, complete records, ask yourself whether you need to consider consolidation. Are you currently making your payments on time? Can you afford those payments? Are any of your payments delinquent? Are any of your federal loans in default status (meaning that you have not paid for 270 days)? If any of the following situations apply, you may be a good candidate for consolidation:


Your federal loans are in default. Consolidation will move them out of default status and minimize the effect on your credit rating.
Your private loans are delinquent, and you are unable to get caught up. Consolidation will help you get the debt under control and minimize the long-term damage to your credit.
You are making payments that you cannot afford, and you are worried that you will wind up delinquent or in default. Consolidation may help you get a lower monthly payment so that you can keep your loans current.
You are making multiple monthly payments on different loans and want to simplify the process. Consolidation will allow you to make just one payment, if your loans are either all federal or all private. If you have both, you’ll have two payments, as you can’t consolidate them together.

, Consolidation does have a downside. Lower monthly payments mean that you’ll likely wind up making those payments for more years, and you’ll pay more in total. In addition:


For private loans, a fee of up to 18.5% of your loan balance may be added to your principal.
Your interest rate may increase. Federal interest rates are capped at 8.25%, but that’s still quite high, especially when you consider that you may be paying for decades. Private lenders’ rates vary, but in general, consolidating your loans may entail a rate increase.
You may lose benefits associated with specific loans. Consolidating eliminates your previously existing loans completely and merges them together under a new loan with different terms and conditions. Certain benefits, including principal rebates or interest rate discounts, will not carry over.You won’t be able to “unconsolidate” your loan. Once you’ve completed the consolidation process, you can’t go back to your previous situation. You could find yourself stuck with less-than-ideal terms and conditions.

, For federal student loans, there’s no question – you are better off consolidating with the Department of Education, where interest rates are capped and you keep your access to programs like deferment, forbearance, and forgiveness. For private loans, you’ll have to shop around, comparing servicers like Chase, NextStudent, Student Loan Network, and Wells Fargo, which are highly rated by Forbes.As you compare consolidation loans with various private companies, pay particular attention to the interest rate – this will make a huge difference in how much you wind up paying overall.

Discharge your loans through bankruptcy.",How to Defer Student Loans," If you are struggling to make payments on your student loans, you need to recognize that deferment is only a short-term solution. Your loans are not “forgiven,” and you will have to resume making your payments once your designated deferment period is over.Deferment is best for temporary hardships, like losing a job or working through graduate school. If your financial situation is more long-term, you may want to apply for an income-based repayment plan instead.;
, During a deferment, the government will cover (not charge) interest on your subsidized loans, but if you have unsubsidized loans (including PLUS loans) interest will be calculated and added to your loan balance. You don’t have to pay that interest during the deferment period, but ultimately, you’ll pay it and more over time. Any interest unpaid during the deferment period will be capitalized (added to your balance), which will result in higher interest payments in the future.


You may not be required to pay interest on your loan if you have one of the following loan types:

Federal Perkins Loan.
Direct Subsidized Loan
Subsidized Federal Stafford Loan.If you are unsure how much of your loan balance is unsubsidized, visit the National Student Loan Data System.. This site will give you a complete breakdown of all your federal student loans, and you’ll be able to see which are subsidized and which are unsubsidized.

, While you are enrolled at least half time in college, graduate school, or professional school, you qualify for a deferment. This deferment will last until you graduate, quit the program, or drop below half-time enrollment.


Half-time enrollment requirements vary by institution. Check with your school to make sure that you qualify.Inquire about graduate fellowship, internship, and training programs that may also meet the requirements for a deferment. Check with your loan servicer for details., If you are unemployed or have a part-time job but cannot find full-time work, you can apply to defer your student loan payments until you find adequate employment. If you are experiencing serious financial hardship for other reasons, you may also qualify – check with your lender for specific details. In general, you will be required to show some kind of documentation to qualify for this kind of deferment.


The maximum deferment time period is three years. After that, you will again be required to make payments – whether your financial picture has improved or not., The Department of Education offers deferments to borrowers in a few other specific situations. These include:Active-duty military service during a war or national emergency.
National Guard service, if you are called to active duty during a war or national emergency.
Peace Corps service.
Admission to a full-time rehabilitation program for the disabled., You are required to make payments until your application is approved; so do not stop just because you think you meet the eligibility requirements. When you receive notice that your deferment has been approved, you can stop making payments for the time period specified.If you are planning to apply for a deferment, contact your loan servicer immediately. This way, if you have to miss payments before your application is accepted, the servicer will know why., Deferment requests must be directed to your loan servicer, not to the Department of Education. It’s a good idea to start by contacting the servicer, talking to a representative, and determining:


Whether you actually meet the eligibility criteria for a deferment.
What documentation you are required to provide as proof.
How long the approval process will take.
How long your deferment will last., In addition to calling your loan servicer, it is sometimes necessary to communicate with your financial aid office.


If you need a deferment because you are going back to school, your program’s financial aid office will need to confirm your enrollment with your loan servicer, so it’s important to check in and find out what forms you may need to submit.Perkins loans are administered by individual schools; so if you are trying to defer a Perkins loan for any reason, you’ll need to contact your financial aid office to find out what your school’s requirements are.

, Depending on your particular loan servicer and your specific circumstances, you may need to prove your eligibility for a deferment.This may include the following:


If you are claiming unemployment, you may either need to show that you are being paid for a part-time job (show a paycheck, for example) or that you are receiving unemployment checks from the government.
If you are claiming financial hardship, you will need to document your low income (you might show proof that you are receiving public assistance).
If you are serving in the military or the Peace Corps, you will need to show proof of service.

, Your loan servicer may want you to complete application forms and sign them. Make sure you complete whatever process the servicer has in place for deferments., In general, lenders do not want you to go into default. If you inform them of your situation, you may be able to get some help. For example, you may qualify for a consolidation loan, which could reduce your payments by combining two are more loans into one.


Contact your loan servicer immediately if you will be late or are unable to make your payments. The more payments you miss before contacting the servicer, the more difficult the problem will become. Don’t let the situation get out of hand if you can possibly help it.

, If you do not qualify for a deferment, you may be able to get a forbearance instead. Like deferment, forbearance allows you to stop making payments temporarily; however, it’s less advantageous because interest continues to accrue whether your loans are subsidized or not and because forbearance lasts for a maximum of one year. Check with your loan servicer if you meet any of the following criteria:Serving a full-time medical or dental internship.
20% or more of your monthly income is the lowest payment for which you qualify.
You teach in a school and subject that qualifies for the teacher loan forgiveness program.
You are serving in AmeriCorps or a similar volunteer service organization.Always look into getting a deferment before trying to get forbearance., If you don’t qualify for deferment or forbearance, you may, at least, be able to lower your payments. Contact your loan servicer to make sure that you are enrolled in the best payment plan for your needs.


Persist to find out about applying for any income-based payment plan. Be sure to ask your loan servicer specifically for any repayment plans you hope you might qualify to receive. Get detailed information and how to apply, since some lenders will not tell you about these benefits otherwise.

, Your final option, if you really can't make your student loan payments, is to file for bankruptcy. However, there is no guarantee that your student loans will be discharged during these proceedings. It is very difficult to prove in court that your student loans are imposing enough of a hardship that they need to be forgiven. You may have a better chance of succeeding in this if you hire a good bankruptcy lawyer.


Your chances of success improve if you have excessively high medical bills or a condition that will prevent you from earning income for the foreseeable future."
"
Set a goal There are a number of ways to approach paying off your student loans.,
Research your options.,
Check eligibility for income-driven plans.,
Identify any private loans.,
Consolidate your loans.,
Calculate repayment amounts.,
Develop a budget.,
Prioritize your loans.,
Consider forgiveness options.,
Enroll in automatic repayment.,
Put unexpected money toward loans.,
Avoid default at all costs.",How to Develop an Action Plan for Student Loans," Decide whether you are looking for a way to afford each loan's minimum payment, a way to pay down large loans quickly, a way to pay off your loans in full quickly, or something else.


Knowing your goal can help you decide what payment plan is right for you, since some help you pay down debts faster while some take longer to pay, but make individual payments more manageable.;
, Federal student aid offers a number of repayment plans for different income levels and abilities to repay. Carefully review the payment options and criteria for each student loan repayment program to see if it could meet your needs.


The Standard Repayment Plan can be used for most Federal Student Loans, and has the borrower paying a fixed amount over the repayment period, which can be up to 30 years.The Graduated Repayment Plan can be applied to most Federal Student Loans, with payments starting at lower amounts and gradually increasing every two years for up to 30 years., Some student loan repayment plans are contingent upon your discretionary income and/or your debt-to-income ratio. Use the Federal Student Aid website to read about income-driven plans and necessary qualifications for each plan.The Pay As You Earn Plan and Revised Pay As You Earn Plan can be used on direct subsidized, unsubsidized, and PLUS loans, and has monthly payments equal to 10% of your discretionary income with forgiveness after 20 to 25 years.
Income-based repayment plans are offered to those with a high debt-to-income ratio, and offer payments fixed at 10% or 15% of your discretionary income, with full loan forgiveness after 20 to 25 years.
Income-contingent plans are open to any borrowers with direct Federal Student Loans, and call for fixed payments at 20% of your discretionary income with forgiveness after 25 years.

, Non-federal loans will not qualify for a federal repayment plan. Check your credit report at AnnualCreditReport.com to see if you have any private loans, and if so to get the exact amounts and the loan providers for each.Private loans are much more difficult to consolidate and often do not have multiple repayment options. If you have a private student loan, contact the servicer immediately to ask about loan due dates and payment amounts.
If you have a large sum in private loans, it may help to speak to a financial planner about your options for repayment.

, If you are more than a few years or a few thousand dollars out from repaying your loans, look at consolidation. Federal student loan consolidation can be applied for directly online, while some private student loans can be consolidated through a private bank.Consolidation brings together all of your loans, allowing you to make one payment and keep a single fixed interest rate, rather than paying a variable rate. It also pushes the repayment period up to 30 years.
Consolidating loans may mean paying more in interest over time, and so is not advisable for those with a small amount of debt or those who are within two to three years of complete repayment.Consolidating loans is necessary for some federal repayment programs.

, Look through your student loan statements or use an online payment calculator figure out how much you will pay per month on your loans.If you have not already chosen a repayment plan, look at different plans to see how your payments could work out over time.


Even if you are on a federal repayment plan, you can often change your plan as you repay. Look over different plans to see what is manageable for you.
Look at current loan statements to see how much you currently pay and compare this with other repayment programs to see if you are on the right repayment plan for you.

, Your repayment plans will dictate the minimum amount you need to pay for each loan, but it is advisable to pay more than the minimum payments when possible. Take a look at your current earnings and see where you can save to put money toward your loans. Look at areas like spending on dining out, clothing, and household purchases to find places in your budget to make room for loans.Ideally, around 20% of your total income should go to paying off your debts, including student loans and credit cards.
Add up the cost of paying all your current minimum debt payments. Then calculate 20% of your income. If you are able, start paying any difference in those amounts toward your loan debt.
Try to reduce spending in unnecessary areas. If you go out to eat twice a week for example, try going out once a week and putting the money you would have spent on the other meal toward your loans.

, You will need to make payments on all of your student loans, but you should prioritize payment for larger loans or ones with higher interest rates. If you are capable of making above the minimum payment on any of your loans, put your extra money toward your bigger loans.Smaller loans, even if they have slightly higher interest rates, will ultimately accrue less interest overall. Put anything above your minimum payments toward your largest loan or your loans with above average interest rates first.

, Payments made under certain plans while working in public service or as a teacher may qualify you for forgiveness on your loans after a reduced period of time. Consider whether you want a public service career as a part of your loan repayment plan.Public service loan forgiveness is applicable for those who work for the government or in a non-profit position.
Forgiveness is offered after 10 years of making eligible payments or 120 qualifying payments.

, Not only does setting up autopay for federal loans ensure that you pay on time every time, it could also help you qualify for a 0.25 percent interest rate reduction. Check directly with your loan servicer to see if autopay is available and for enrollment instructions.If you do not know who your loan servicer is, you can call the Federal Student Aid office or log into your Federal Student Aid account online.

, If you happen to receive a cash windfall, be it lottery winnings, a tax refund, or a few extra dollars as a birthday gift, apply it directly toward your student loans. This allows you to contribute more than you typically would toward your debt without straining your budget.If you don’t want to put all your extra money toward your loans, try to put at least some of it into repayment. If you cannot manage to contribute 100%, try to contribute at least 50%.

, Defaulting on a loan can result in severe penalties, with the government being able to garnish up to 15% of your wages and taking chunks out of any collections fees. If you are struggling to make a payment, contact your loan servicer immediately to let them know.Federal loan servicers are generally quite forgiving and willing to work with you if you are going through a difficult time such as underemployment or unemployment.
Call your loan servicer directly to let them know you’re struggling to repay before your payment due date. Ask them, “What options do I have to help keep me from defaulting while I work on getting the money together?”

In some cases, a stepparent may also be eligible to take out a federal PLUS loan.The applicant also must be a U.S. citizen or permanent resident.;
, For most federal PLUS loans, the applicant is required to undergo a simple credit check in order to assess their credit worthiness. If you have an adverse credit score you may still be eligible to receive a PLUS loan.For instance, you could obtain an endorser with a good credit rating who will agree to repay the loan in the event that you default on your payments.
Alternatively, if you can explain any extenuating circumstances, such as a foreclosure or bankruptcy discharge, you may still be able to get the loan. This will be determined on a case-by-case basis by the administrator of the loan., Before you can receive a PLUS loan you (or your child, if you are a parent borrower) must fill out the Free Application for Federal Student Aid forms. These forms will give you access to a number of different loan programs, both federal and state. These forms need to be completed each year that you (or your child) are enrolled in postsecondary education in order to be eligible for funding.Typically forms become available in October for the following school year.
These forms are available from the following website: https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/fafsa


, Visit the website studentloans.gov to find the forms to request a PLUS loan. The request forms will have a list of schools that participate in the direct loan program. If your school is not listed, you will need to speak with your school’s financial aid office to determine how to request a loan. The PLUS loan request application must be completed in a single session and will take approximately 20 minutes. The forms will ask you to provide the following information:The name of school you (or your child) attends.
Your child’s name, social security number, date of birth, address, and phone number.
Your name, mailing address, telephone number, and email address.
Your employer’s name, address, and telephone number.

, This is a legally binding document that sets up the terms of your loan repayment. For example, you may decide to defer the repayment of the loan until your child has completed their schooling. It is important that you carefully read and keep this form in your records because you will need to refer to it once you begin repaying your loan, Before your loan is paid out, your school may require you to complete some form of entrance counseling. This is quite common if you have never received a federal PLUS loan before. Talk with the financial aid office at your school to find out how the counseling is delivered. This will vary depending on the school, but could include in-class or online counseling.Typically online counselling takes approximately 30 minutes to complete.

, Your interest rate will determine how much you pay on your federal PLUS loan over time. Be sure to inspect this aspect of the loan carefully before accepting the loan. You can find the current interest rate online on the government student aid website., All federal PLUS loans include a loan fee that is applied each time your loan is disbursed. This fee is a percentage of the total loan and is removed automatically upon disbursement. The fee will vary from year to year., In many instances, these loans will be applied directly to your tuition, fees, and room and board. In some instances there may be left over money available after all school fees have been paid. In this instance the school may make a payment directly to the borrower. Check to make sure that the administration correctly applies your loan to your student fees.


Federal PLUS loans are usually disbursed over the various quarters of a student's education.
Talk with the financial aid office at your school to determine when the loan will be paid out.

, If you are a graduate or professional student, you will not have to repay your loans while you are still enrolled in school. You will begin repaying the loan six months after you have stopped attending the school. As a parent borrower, you will begin paying the loan as soon as the complete loan has been paid out.You can work with your loan servicer to defer repayment until after your child completes their schooling.

, There are a variety of different payment options available. For example, you could choose a standard repayment option with fixed payment rates. If you choose this option, you will likely pay less in the long run, but your payments may be more expensive.Alternatively, you could choose a graduated payment plan. Typically the payments will be lower to begin with and then increase every two years as you become more financially established after school.

, If you are unable to make your monthly payments, you should talk with your loan servicer immediately to come up with alternative payment options. For instance, you may be able to change plans in order to make lower monthly payments. Alternatively, you may be able to defer your payments temporarily."

Confirm your eligibility.,
Determine your status.,
Submit your FAFSA.,
Use your Student Aid Report to estimate your probable financial aid.,
Read your official financial aid offers.,
Read the fine print.,
Distinguish between subsidized and unsubsidized Stafford loans.,
Be aware of the limitations on Stafford loans.,
Consider the benefits of Stafford loans.,
Submit a Master Promissory Note.",How to Apply for a Stafford Loan," If you will be attending an accredited program at least half time, and you are a U.S. citizen, U.S. national, or U.S. permanent resident, you are probably eligible for Stafford loans.


If you do not meet the citizenship requirements, take the time to check with a representative at your school’s financial aid office anyway. Certain exceptions can sometimes apply. If, for example, you are a documented refugee or human trafficking victim, you may be able to get Stafford loans regardless of your citizenship status.;
, Before you fill out your financial aid paperwork, you should figure out whether you qualify as an independent student or not. Generally speaking, if you are not married, have no children, and are under 24 years old, and you will be an undergraduate, you are considered dependent. This means that your financial aid package will be based on your parents’ tax information – whether they actually help you pay for school or not.If you do not fall into this category, it is likely to your advantage to file your paperwork as an independent student, as you will probably qualify for more aid – including the maximum in Stafford loans.


Certain exceptions are made to allow some undergraduate students to claim independent status even if they are under 24 and have no dependents. If you are an orphan, foster child, or ward of the court, or if you are a veteran, talk to a financial aid representative about an exception.

, The FAFSA (Free Application for Federal Student Aid) is available online at www.fafsa.gov. This form serves as your application for all forms of federal financial aid, including Stafford loans. Fill it out as accurately as possible, using your family’s tax information if you fall into the dependent category or your own tax information if you qualify as an independent student. It’s advisable to submit the FAFSA as early as possible, so if you want to do so before you have your official tax information completed, it’s fine to estimate.You’ll need to provide:


Social security numbers
Information about dependents, including how many household members are in school
Annual income
Information about savings and other assets

, If you completed your FAFSA online, you will receive a Student Aid Report within a few days (it may take up to a few weeks if you submitted your FAFSA on paper). This report will include your EFC (Expected Family Contribution). The EFC is calculated using the information you provided on your FAFSA. Basically, it is the amount that the government theoretically expects you and your family to contribute to your education. In general, you will be offered financial aid packages that cover the difference between your EFC and the actual annual cost of your education. A significant portion of this financial aid will come in the form of Stafford loans.Many students find that their families cannot actually afford to pay the EFC annually. If that’s the case for you, don’t despair. You can take steps to reduce the cost of your education and to make up some of the difference with scholarships, program-specific financial aid, and private loans.

, Schools that accept you will send you official offers of financial aid. These packages will include both federal financial aid and any institutional aid that the school is awarding you. Your Stafford loans will be included in these offers.


Note that Stafford loans are usually only one part of a larger financial aid package. You may also qualify for grants (which are wonderful, since they do not need to be paid back), work-study opportunities, and other federal loans (such as the Perkins loan).

, Resist the urge to simply accept all the aid you are offered without taking the time to understand all of the terms and conditions. Accepting financial aid will mean that you are likely to graduate with a considerable amount of debt, which you may or may not be in a position to pay back. It’s crucial to know exactly what you are getting into.

, Most students will receive a combination of Stafford loans:


Subsidized Stafford loans are awarded based on financial need alone. They are “subsidized” in the sense that the government will pay all of the interest for you while you are in school, and then for six months after your graduation. In other words, the interest will begin to accumulate only after you finish school.Unsubsidized Stafford loans can be awarded through your school of choice regardless of your financial need. However, these loans are not as attractive as subsidized ones because the interest begins to accumulate immediately. If you don’t make payments during school, then by graduation, you will owe much more than you borrowed., Stafford loans are not unlimited. There are both annual and cumulative caps on how much you can borrow through these programs, so it’s important to know the limitations and plan accordingly. Annual caps begin at $5,500 for dependent freshmen ($9,500 for independent freshmen) and go up to $7,500 for dependent seniors ($12,500 for independent seniors) and $20,500 for graduate and professional students ($40,500 for medical school students).In addition:


Dependent undergraduates cannot borrow more than $31,000 total over the course of their programs.
Independent undergraduates cannot borrow more than $57,000 total over the course of their programs.
Graduate and professional school students cannot borrow more than $138,500 in total.
Medical school students cannot borrow more than $224,000 in total.

, Taking on student loan debt can be stressful and scary, but if you must borrow to pay for college, Stafford loans are the best available way for you to do so.Keep in mind that:


Stafford loan rates tend to be lower than rates associated with other types of loans.
Stafford loans are eligible for all the repayment and forgiveness plans offered by the federal government, whereas private loans often are not.
Subsidized Stafford loans, especially, offer you the best possible deal on funding, since the government pays your interest while you are in school.

, If you've read the fine print and want to accept your loans, you’ll need to sign and submit a Master Promissory Note through your financial aid office. This document represents a promise to repay your loans after you graduate.


You only have to sign one Master Promissory Note, unless you transfer schools. If you want to attend a different program, you’ll have to resubmit the paperwork.

Continue making your payments.,
Determine whether your loans qualify for consolidation.,
Apply online.,
Read your summary sheet carefully.,
Make arrangements for repayment.,
Make your payments as required.",How to Consolidate Student Loans2," It’s important that you continue making your existing payments as you complete the consolidation process. Until you’ve been informed that your loans have been paid off and your consolidation loan has taken effect, you are legally required to make those payments.

, Most federal student loans do qualify, but it’s important to make sure that all of your individual loans will be included. The following loans qualify:


Direct Subsidized Stafford Loans
Direct Unsubsidized Stafford Loans
Direct PLUS Loans
PLUS loans from the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) Program
Supplemental Loans for Students
Federal Perkins Loans
Federal Nursing Loans
Health Education Assistance Loans

, Go to https://studentloans.gov/myDirectLoan/index.action. The application process is simple, since the Department of Education will already have all of your personal information and records of all your federal loans.


Again, you should avoid consolidating your federal loans through private lenders. If you do not stay with the Department of Education, you’ll lose access to many resources and benefits, and you will probably pay more.

, Once you’ve completed the application process, the Department of Education will provide you with a summary sheet, which lists all of the loans you are consolidating. Review this document carefully.


If everything looks correct, you don’t need to do anything. After fifteen days, the Department of Education will process your loan.
If anything looks amiss – if the numbers are off, or if any of your federal loans aren’t included – contact the Department of Education within fifteen days of the date on the summary sheet.

, Once your consolidation loan is approved, you must choose a repayment plan. If any of your loans were in default, you’ll choose one of the three income-based options – either IBR, Pay-As-You-Earn, or ICR. If none of your loans were in default, you can choose any of these six plans:Standard Repayment. You’ll make regular payments that are calculated so that your loan will be paid off within ten years. Many people who consolidate find that they cannot afford the standard plan, but if you can, it’s the most cost-effective option.
Graduated Repayment. You’ll make payments that start out low and increase every two years, so that you pay the entire balance in ten years. If you don’t make much money but expect your income to increase regularly with time, this is a solid, cost-effective option.
Extended Repayment Plan. You’ll make lower payments, but you’ll continue making them for 25 years. This option is only available if your loan amounts to more than $30,000.
Income-Based Repayment (IBR). You’ll make payments for twenty-five years, and after that, any remaining debt will be forgiven. Your payments will not exceed 15% of your discretionary income.
Pay-As-You-Earn Repayment. You’ll make payments for twenty years, and after that, any remaining debt will be forgiven. As with IBR, your payments will not exceed 15% of your discretionary income.

, Now that your federal loans have been consolidated, it’s important not to neglect your payments. If you go into default, your credit rating will suffer, and you’ll lose your access to further federal student aid – in short, you’ll reverse the positive effects of your consolidation.

Continue paying your current lenders.,
Contact your preferred lender.,
Apply for the consolidation loan.,
Repeat the process if necessary.,
Read the fine print.,
Make your payments faithfully.",How to Consolidate Student Loans3," It’s important that you continue making your existing payments as you complete the consolidation process. Until you’ve been informed that your loans have been paid off and your consolidation loan has taken effect, you are legally required to make those payments.

, If you’ve done your research and compared terms and interest rates from various companies, you should have a sense of which lender you would like to use. Call or email that lender to get the process started.


This is a good time to ask any questions you may have about the terms and conditions associated with a consolidation loan. Keep in mind, though, that you can only trust information that’s given to you in writing – don’t assume that lenders have your best interests at heart.

, Most companies will allow you to apply either in person or online. Either way, you’ll need to have the following information handy:


Your current address
Your Social Security number
The names, addresses, and phone numbers of at least two personal references
Proof of your monthly income
Information about your monthly expenses
The estimated amounts of all your loans to be consolidated. You may be asked for a “pay-off amount” for each loan. Contact your servicers to determine this amount.
All relevant loan account numbers
The names and addresses of your loan servicers. This information should be on your monthly statements.

, If your company of choice turns you down, you may have to try again with another company.


If you have poor credit, or if your income suggests that you will struggle to make your payments, you may have difficulty getting a consolidation loan with relatively favorable terms. If you are sure that consolidation is the best route for you, you may, unfortunately, have to apply for a loan with a company that offers you less favorable terms, including a higher interest rate.

, Once your application for a consolidation loan is accepted, read all the terms and conditions carefully before signing. It’s crucial to understand how much you’ll pay each month, how much you’ll pay over time, and what the other conditions associated with your loan might be.

, Don’t neglect your payments once your private loans have been consolidated. Delinquencies will have a negative impact on your credit, and you’ll probably have to pay additional fees as well.

",How to Extend Payments on Student Loans1,";
, Typically, there are 4 options for extending payments: graduated repayment, income-sensitive repayment, extended repayment and loan consolidation. Graduated repayment allows you to make low payments that increase gradually over time. Income-sensitive repayment bases your student loan payments upon your income. Extended repayment allows you to make payments over a longer period of time, which makes each monthly payment lower. Loan consolidation lumps together all of your federal student loans into 1 loan with a manageable interest rate.

With a subsidized student loan, interest is not charged until you graduate. Interest is considered deferred and is subsidized by the federal government. You start paying the principal amount and the interest after you graduate. With an unsubsidized student loan the interest is charged from the time that the funds are first disbursed to you.
Both types of loan will allow you to defer your principal and interest payments until after you graduate. However, an unsubsidized loan will accrue interest beginning from disbursement of funds.

, The amount that you need to borrow may influence which loan you choose. The cost differences at various colleges may weigh into your decision.


Subsidized loans carry a specific cap on how much you can borrow. Unsubsidized loans also have a cap, but it is typically about $4,000 more per year than with subsidized loans. , Your personal financial circumstances may not permit you to qualify for a subsidized loan.


Subsidized loans are offered according to financial status and specific need. Each college determines how much money their students qualify for in unsubsidized or subsidized loans. Many students use subsidized-loan money first and then piggyback it with an unsubsidized loan.

, Unsubsidized and subsidized student loans both give you ten years to pay them back. Depending on your circumstances, there are other programs that allow you to make payments for 20 or 25 years. They both feature fixed interest rates.Unsubsidized loans start charging interest from the moment the money is given to you. However, sometimes the lender will give you the option of making “interest-only” payments while you are still in school. You might also make arrangements to postpone paying the interest and the principal until you leave school and the repayment period starts. "

If you want to go to graduate or medical school, a subsidized loan will not be an option for you., This loan is made available through schools and is funded by the federal government for low-income students.

You do not have to start paying it back until nine months after you graduate or when your enrollment is less than half-time. , Ask that their financial-aid offer be increased by explaining, for example, that your financial situation has changed, such as the loss of a parent's job.

, It takes at least five years to qualify for teacher loan forgiveness, and it’s important not to fall into default during that time. Sign up for a repayment plan that works for you, and stay current on your loans.


Document your payments. In general, it’s best not to trust your loan servicer or the Department of Education to keep accurate records; make sure you log this information independently as well.

, To apply for teacher loan forgiveness, you must teach full time for five consecutive years in a school (either elementary or secondary) that the government has identified as serving an especially low-income population. A school qualifies if:it is in a district that meets the requirements for Title I funding under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965.
30% of its enrolled students qualify for Title I services.
it appears in the Annual Directory of Designated Low-Income Schools for Teacher Cancellation Benefits, which you can find at https://www.tcli.ed.gov/CBSWebApp/tcli/TCLIPubSchoolSearch.jsp.
it is run by the Bureau of Indian Education or on an Indian reservation.

, Teachers who meet the criteria for the “highly qualified” designation can get more of their loans forgiven – up to $17,500 total. These criteria are subject to change and can be dependent on your state and on how long you’ve been teaching. In general, though:


If you are an elementary school teacher, you are considered “highly qualified” if you hold a bachelor’s degree, pass designated state tests, and obtain full teacher certification (not emergency or temporary certification).
If you are a secondary school teacher, you are considered “highly qualified” if you hold a bachelor’s degree and show expertise in your academic subject matter, either through state testing or through a graduate degree program.

, Once you’ve met the requirements, you can simply download and print the application here. Fill out the first two sections. You’ll need to provide:


your name, address, and other identifying information
affirmation that you meet the eligibility criteria
information about whether you are “highly qualified”

, In order to qualify, your school’s chief administration officer must confirm your eligibility.


Note that if you have fulfilled the requirements by working at more than one school, you’ll need to get additional chief administration officers to provide information. You can have them do so on a separate piece of paper and attach it to your application.

, The application form should not be sent to the Department of Education; instead, you should send it to your loan servicer – the company to which you’ve been making your payments.


If you’ve been making payments on multiple loans to different companies, and you want more than one of them to be considered for forgiveness, you’ll need to send separate forms to each servicer.

, Until you know for sure that you’ve been granted forgiveness, you must keep making your regular payments. Once you know how much of your loan has been forgiven, you can adjust your payments as permitted by your loan servicer.

, If you qualify for teacher loan forgiveness, you may also qualify for teacher cancellation. Under this program, you can have your Perkins loans discharged if you teach full-time for at least a year in a low-income school."

Direct Consolidation Loans do qualify.

, You must make at least 120 regular monthly payments, on time, to qualify for public service loan forgiveness.


Document your payments. In general, it’s best not to trust your loan servicer or the Department of Education to keep accurate records; make sure you log this information independently as well.

, While you make your 120 monthly payments, you’ll need to work full time at a non-profit organization or a government agency that the IRS considers tax-exempt. It does not matter what your job title is or what specific services the organization provides, so long as it is tax-exempt.


Alternatively, you can work for certain non-tax-exempt organizations that the Department of Education deems qualifying. These include:the military
public health and safety organizations
law enforcement
early childhood education
disability services



, Every year, you should submit an Employment Certification form (you can download and print it here: https://studentaid.ed.gov/sites/default/files/public-service-employment-certification-form.pdf) to update the Department of Education about your qualifying employment. You should also submit a new one whenever you change jobs.


This bit of bureaucratic red tape may seem like an unnecessary pain, but ultimately, it will help you get your loans forgiven as expeditiously as possible. It will take at least ten years to make the 120 qualifying monthly payments, and most people will change jobs at least once or twice during that time. Submitting annual forms prevents you having to track down former employers when it’s time to apply for forgiveness. It also alerts you immediately if your current job does not actually qualify for the program.

, After you have made 120 payments, you will complete an official application for forgiveness, and, as long as you’ve met all the requirements, your remaining qualifying loans will be forgiven.

, Until you know for sure that you’ve been granted forgiveness, you are required to continue paying.

, Teach for America is a selective program that places recent graduates in teaching positions in low-income communities. For each year that you work for Teach for America, you’ll qualify for $4,725 to pay down your student loans.

, Many employers offer help with student loan debt for new employees, so remember to ask about these programs and take advantage of them when available.

, If you become permanently disabled, you may qualify for a Total and Permanent Disability Discharge (TPD).In general, you can only qualify for TPI if you can prove that you have a medical disability that will last for at least five years or will likely result in death.

, If you took out a PLUS loan so that your child could attend school, and he or she dies, you may be able to have that debt discharged.

Let the buckeyes cool in the refrigerator.",How to Make Buckeyes," Soften the butter to room temperature so that it blends easily with the other ingredients. The quickest way to blend everything is to use an electric mixer, but stirring your mixture with a spoon can be just as effective, though slower. Continue mixing until everything blends together into smooth dough.





;
, Scoop about 2 tablespoons of dough out at a time. Roll the peanut butter in your palms until you've created small, smooth balls. For reference, your peanut butter balls should be no larger than a ping pong ball.








, Line a cookie sheet with wax paper. After you've rolled all of the peanut butter dough into balls, place them in rows on the wax paper. Pop that into your fridge and let them chill for at least 30 minutes.By chilling the peanut butter balls, they'll maintain their shape better while you add the chocolate coating., Place the chocolate in a double-boiler and heat the water so that it is simmering, but not boiling.Continue to stir as the chocolate chips begin to melt from the heat. Once the chocolate is smooth and creamy, add the shortening. Continue to stir frequently so that your chocolate mixture doesn't burn.









If you do not have a double boiler, you can simply nestle a heat-safe bowl inside a pan of water. You can see how to do that here!
You can also very carefully melt your chocolate in the microwave. Put your chocolate in a shallow bowl, and heat it for one minute on medium high heat. Stir it thoroughly, and put it back in the microwave. Continue cooking the chocolate for 15-20 seconds at a time, stirring after each interval. Do this until your chocolate is completely melted., Once the peanut butter balls are thoroughly chilled, poke a toothpick into the center. Make sure that the toothpick can support the weight of the peanut butter ball without breaking. You will need to be able to hold the peanut butter ball with the toothpick while you dip it into the chocolate.

If you created larger balls or simply can't hold it with a toothpick, you can use a fork to hold the balls. Because they'll create multiple holes in the dough, smooth the holes over with your finger after you remove the fork.

, Dip the balls about halfway into the chocolate, so that they aren't completely coated in the chocolate. This will leave a bit of the brown peanut butter exposed, giving it the appearance of a buckeye.After coating the peanut butter, place the buckeye on wax paper, chocolate-side down. Don't forget to remove the toothpick.








, This will allow the chocolate to harden.It can be difficult to wait for them to firm up, but it's worth it! Remove your buckeyes from the refrigerator, and enjoy!









You can keep your buckeyes for about two weeks at room temperature, or a bit longer in the refrigerator. If you pop them in your freezer, you can save them for several months!"

Different schools may handle exit counseling differently, but whether you have to handle it in person, by mail, or online, it’s an important step in understanding your debt. During exit counseling, you should receive information about:


your legal rights and responsibilities as a borrower
various available repayment plans
procedures for making payments
conditions that must be met for deferment, forbearance, and forgiveness
resources available if you have questions or concerns regarding your debt;
, Some borrowers believe – erroneously – that they do not have to repay their student loans if they do not graduate. Unfortunately, that’s not the case, and you’ll need to repay your debt whether you completed your degree or not.

, Depending on how long you’ve been in school, how many loans you’ve gotten, and whether your debt is federal, private, or both, you may not have a clear picture of how much student loan debt you’ve accumulated. That’s completely understandable, but you can’t address the issue effectively without figuring out what, exactly, you owe – and to whom.


You may be receiving notices, either by email or by snail mail, from your lenders or your school’s financial aid office. If that’s the case, keep careful records of these notices, noting what kinds of loans you have (Stafford, Perkins, PLUS, etc.) and who is servicing those loans.
Whether you’re receiving notices or not, it’s a good idea to do some research on your own to ensure that you’re fully aware of every loan. Start by visiting the National Student Loan Data System at https://www.nslds.ed.gov/nslds/nslds_SA/. This website will have information about all your federal loans, even if they were taken out at different times and are being serviced by different companies. If you’ve borrowed through the federal government only, then you don’t need to look anywhere else. If you have private loans, you’ll have to check your records and follow up with those lenders as necessary.

, If this information was not made clear to you during exit counseling, visit the National Student Loan Data System or inquire with your financial aid office.


In some circumstances, you may have multiple servicers for different loans. For example, you may find that your Stafford Loans are serviced through one company, but your Perkins loans are serviced through another.

, For most forms of federal student aid, you will need to start making monthly payments six months after your graduation date (or after you stop attending). Private lenders may set other deadlines for payments to begin – in fact, they may even require payments while you are still in school.


For any subsidized federal loans, the government will continue to cover the accumulating interest during this six-month grace period, as it did when you were in school. If you have unsubsidized loans, though, interest will accrue during this time. Be aware that if you do not make payments, you will owe more six months after graduation than you did on graduation day.

, Although federal student aid is awarded regardless of your credit score, understand that if you do not pay, your credit will absolutely suffer – whether your loans are federal, private, or both.


If you do not make your payments and wind up with bad credit, you will have a much harder time qualifying for other kinds of loans (including mortgages and car loans) later on.
Bad credit may also make it more difficult to rent an apartment or sign up for certain utilities. You may even have difficulty getting a cell phone plan.

, Many borrowers look, understandably, for the repayment plan with the lowest monthly payments. Know that if you take this route, you’ll be paying significantly more in the long run. For example, say you have $26,946 in federal student loan debt – the average for borrowers who attended a four-year public university:If you pay a standard monthly payment of $272 a month, you will ultimately pay $32,585 on your loans.
If you pay on a graduated plan, starting with $152 a month and increasing to $455 a month over time, you’ll ultimately pay $33,979 on your loans.
If you pay on a lower “pay as you earn plan,” starting with $104 a month and increasing to $272 a month, you will ultimately pay $39,509 on your loans.

, Because making smaller payments will increase your overall cost, you should make the standard, recommended payments if possible. Under this plan, you will pay off your student loans completely in ten years.


In general, unless you request otherwise, your student loan servicer will start you off with the standard repayment plan.

, If you are employed in a steady but somewhat low-paying job, but you can reasonably anticipate periodic promotions and raises, the graduated payment plan might work better for you. You’ll start off with a lower monthly payment, which will go up over time.


In general, the graduated payment plan will also enable you to pay your loans off in ten years. Check with your loan servicer to see what you individual numbers will look like.

, If your budget is restricted and you don’t anticipate a significant increase in your income, the extended repayment plan may be your best option. Under this plan, you pay off your student loans over the course of twenty-five years.


Remember that there’s a significant overall cost associated with these lower monthly payments. You will have this debt for much longer, and you’ll pay much more overall.

, Depending on your individual circumstances, you may be eligible for an income-based repayment plan. You must apply for this plan by submitting proof of a low income and showing that other repayment plans would constitute a financial hardship. Individual eligibility varies, so talk to your loan servicer for details. These plans include:


Income-Based Repayment (IBR). Under this plan, you’ll make payments for twenty-five years, and after that, any remaining debt will be forgiven. Your payments will not exceed 15% of your discretionary income.
Pay-As-You-Earn Repayment. This is a newer program, which is only available to people who had no student loans prior to October 1, 2007, and received student loans after October 1, 2011. If you qualify, it's a better deal than IBR. Under this plan, you’ll make payments for twenty years, and after that, any remaining debt will be forgiven. As with IBR, your payments will not exceed 15% of your discretionary income.
Income-Contingent Repayment (ICR). Under this plan, you’ll make payments for twenty-five years, and after that, any remaining debt will be forgiven. Your payments will not exceed 20% of your discretionary income.

, Forbearance allows qualifying borrows to hit the “pause” button on their payments. Be aware that your interest will continue to accumulate during this time. Consider applying for a forbearance if:


you have a sudden financial hardship.
you develop a serious medical problem that affects your income or your budget.
you start a medical or dental internship or residency program and cannot make your payments.
you accept a position with AmeriCorps.
you begin active duty in the U.S. military.

, You may qualify for a deferment (a period during which you do not have to make payments) for a variety of reasons, but remember that deferments do have costs. In most cases, your loans will continue to accumulate interest, and you’ll pay more over time. Deferments are available for borrowers who:


attend graduate or professional school.
are unemployed.
are experiencing severe economic hardship.
are serving in the military.

, One of the reasons that federal financial aid is so much more attractive than private student lending is that the government offers all of these possible repayment plans. If you have private debt, you will have to negotiate directly with your lenders, and they may be much less inclined to grant you lower payments or a deferment.

, For federal loans, at least, the variety of payment, forbearance, and deferment options should allow you to avoid defaulting (failing to pay). Don’t ignore your debt. A default will have significant, long-term implications for your credit, and you won’t be able to get any additional financial aid, either. If you do wind up in default, it’s not too late to repair the damage. Talk to your loan servicer, as individual circumstances may vary. In general, though:


You can get out of default by consolidating your loans with the federal government and making three consecutive monthly payments. Consolidation combines all your loans and revises your payment plan to make your monthly payments as affordable as possible. Of course, this does mean paying more interest in the long run.
Alternatively, you can simply start making your payments again. Once you have made nine consecutive monthly payments, you will get out of default. This process is called rehabilitation.

, Think of your designated monthly payment as the bare minimum. If you can afford it, you can pay extra without penalty. Doing so will mean that you pay your loan off faster and pay less interest over time.


For the best results, ask your loan servicer to apply any additional amount to your principal (rather than to future payments). This will ensure that your money makes more of a dent in your loan balance.

, Track all of your income and spending for a few months, and then identify expenses that can be cut. You can then funnel this money into student loan payments, including extra principal payments. Depending on your individual circumstances, this might mean:


renting a cheaper apartment or living with a roommate
eating out less frequently
doing without a car and walking, biking, or taking public transportation instead
cutting entertainment expenses like movie and concert tickets
avoiding small extra expenditures at coffee shops and bars

, It may sound obvious, but excelling at your job, earning promotions, and working overtime when possible will improve your overall financial picture and allow you to pay off your student loans faster.


When you do find yourself earning more, resist the urge to spend that extra money. If you continue to live as if you were receiving a lower paycheck and funnel the extra cash into extra student loan payments, you could save thousands and thousands of dollars and get rid of your debt much more efficiently.

, Depending on your profession and your other circumstances, you may be able to get some of your debt forgiven. Talk to your loan servicer for specific details on the various forgiveness plans and a complete list of restrictions and eligibility criteria. In general, though, you may qualify for at least partial forgiveness if:you teach for five consecutive years in a high need area
you join AmeriCorps or the Peace Corps
you join the Army Reserve or the National Guard after graduation
you are accepted into Teach for America
you work full-time as a provider of early intervention services for the disabled

Consider balancing your quinoa breakfast with other toppings.",How to Make Healthier Breakfasts Using Quinoa1," Like oatmeal, quinoa can be made into a delicious and warm breakfast meal. You'll need to get out the right equipment to make warm quinoa porridge for breakfast.

Start by setting out a heavy-bottomed pot.Unlike instant oatmeal, there is no instant quinoa that you can make in the microwave. You'll need to cook this over the stop top like traditional oatmeal.
You will not need a pot with a lid to make quinoa porridge. You need to continually stir without the lid to get the proper consistency of this dish.
You'll also need to keep an eye on your quinoa and stir consistently as it cooks. Use a wooden spoon or spatula to keep it from sticking to the bottom of the pot.;
, You'll need to choose what type of liquid you want to use to make your hot quinoa porridge. Depending on your diet, there are a variety of options to choose from.

Try regular milk. Whether you do skim or whole milk, adding milk to your warm quinoa can help make your porridge creamy and rich. Plus, it'll add a hit of calcium and protein.If you don't want to use cow's milk, you can also do dairy substitutes. Try almond, soy or even rice milk if you'd like. They all work well in this recipe.
If you don't want to use any milk at all, you can also make your porridge with water. It won't add any creaminess to your porridge, but still gets it to the right consistency.

, Like oatmeal and other hot breakfast cereals, you can add a variety of different spices or flavorings to your quinoa porridge. Follow a recipe or consider adding your favorite flavors.

If you like you can add some extracts to your hot quinoa to add flavor. Try adding vanilla, almond or even coconut extract to your quinoa.
If you like a natural source of vanilla, consider cooking your quinoa with a split vanilla bean for flavor.
Spices like cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger or clove are also quite tasty in a warm quinoa porridge.

, Quinoa is not naturally sweet. In fact, it can sometimes have a more savory or even slightly bitter flavor. If you're looking for a sweet porridge, you'll need to add a source of sweetness to your porridge.

If you want to add a natural sweetener that isn't as processed as white sugar, consider drizzling in some honey, agave syrup, molasses or maple syrup.If you're watching your total calorie or sugar intake, you may opt for a no-calorie sweetener like sucralose or truvia.
You can also consider leaving out sweeteners altogether. If you make your porridge with milk and add spices or fruit, there might be enough natural sweetness for your tastes.

, Once your quinoa porridge is made, there are a lot of different toppings you can add on. Whether you like Chia seeds, nuts, dried fruit or fresh fruit, you can add an additional hit of nutrition with some toppings.Try fresh fruit on your quinoa. You can add any type of fruit you'd like. Apples would go well with cinnamon and nutmeg or sliced peaches may go well with vanilla extract.
You can also add dried fruit to your porridge as well. It's little chewier and sometimes tart which can be a nice addition to your breakfast meal.
You can also add some healthy fats and protein by adding nuts to quinoa. Whether it's almonds, cashews or pistachios, these are other great toppings."

Make a quinoa granola.,
Add cooked quinoa to a breakfast burrito.,
Make a quinoa breakfast hash.,
Bake quinoa muffins.",How to Make Healthier Breakfasts Using Quinoa2," If you like a little crunch on your morning yogurt, consider making a quinoa granola. Using a high-protein grain like quinoa can boost the nutrition of a traditional granola recipe.

Start this recipe by preheating your oven to 350 degrees.
In a large bowl, mix together 1 cup of rolled oats, 1/2 cup uncooked quinoa, 2 cups of nuts, 1 tablespoon of honey and a pinch of salt. Stir to combine.
In the microwave, melt 3 1/2 tablespoons of coconut oil together with 1/4 cup of maple syrup. Stir frequently until the liquids are completely combined. Pour immediately over the dry ingredients.
Pour the granola onto a rimmed baking sheet and press into an even layer. Bake for about 30 minutes. Half way through the baking process, stir the granola to ensure even browning. Allow to cool thoroughly and serve at room temperature.

, For a Mexican spin on your breakfast, make breakfast burritos. Adding quinoa will provide an additional source of protein and fiber to your burrito.

Start by scrambling 1 egg over medium heat in a nonstick skillet. Once cooked, place in a small bowl.
Add in 1/3 cup of cooked quinoa and 1/4 cup of thawed chopped frozen or baby spinach to your scrambled egg along with a generous sprinkling of shredded low-fat sharp cheddar cheese.
Place your burrito filling into the center of a 8"" whole wheat tortilla. Roll up tightly and serve immediately or wrap in plastic wrap and stick in the freezer for another day.

, If you're in the mood for a savory and filling breakfast, try making quinoa hash. Substitute quinoa for shredded potatoes in this tasty recipe.Heat a large skillet over medium heat and add four strips of bacon (or skip this step if you don't eat meat or like bacon). Cook until the bacon is crunchy and the fat has rendered out. Remove bacon from pan and roughly chop.
To the still hot pan, add in 1 cup of cooked quinoa, 1/2 cup of diced peppers, 1/2 cup of diced onions and 1 cup of sliced mushrooms. Sauté for about five to six minutes or until vegetables are soft and quinoa is heated through.
Turn up the heat slightly. Press the quinoa mixture down into the bottom of the pan. Allow to crisp up and brown for about one to two minutes. Serve immediately with eggs if you'd like.
An alternate recipe is to make a mixture of cooked quinoa, peeled and grated raw potato then add to eggs and spices to taste. Cook on a large skillet for about seven minutes on each side until golden brown.

, If you're in a rush in the mornings, you can try making quinoa muffins ahead of time for a quick, protein and fiber filled breakfast. Freeze leftovers so you'll have a stock of these tasty muffins.Start by preheating an oven to 375 degrees. Lightly grease a muffin tin with cooking spray.
In a large bowl, mix together 1 cup of cooked quinoa, 1/2 cup of applesauce, 1 mashed banana, 1/2 cup of milk, 1 teaspoon of vanilla and 1/4 cup of honey. Mix until thoroughly combined.
Peel and roughly chop 1 apple or pear and stir into the quinoa mixture as well.
Fill each muffin tin to the top with the quinoa mixture. Bake for about 20 – 25 minutes. Remove from the oven and allow to cool for five minutes before enjoying.

Choose the type of quinoa.,
Purchase dry or pre-cooked quinoa.,
Rinse quinoa before using.,
Store cooked quinoa correctly.",How to Make Healthier Breakfasts Using Quinoa3," Quinoa is now available in most local supermarkets. You don't have to go to a specialty store or health foods store to find this nutritious grain.

When you're looking for quinoa, it will be found in the grain aisle along with rice, couscous and pasta.
There may be more than one type of quinoa available. You may see white, black, red or even tri-colored quinoa.Of all the quinoa colors, white or tan quinoa has the lightest texture and it cooks up slightly fluffier than other types and has the most delicate taste. Black quinoa has a slight earthy flavor while the red quinoa has a richer taste and a bit chewier texture and nutty. These two take slightly longer to cook than the white quinoa.
If you're using quinoa in a breakfast recipe, especially if kids are eating it, you may want to stick with white as it's most similar in color to oats.

, Most of the time, you'll be able to find uncooked quinoa in the grain aisle of the grocery store; however, some stores may have pre-cooked quinoa for you.

Quinoa only takes about 15 minutes to cook from scratch. If you can only find uncooked quinoa, that will work perfectly in many breakfast recipes. Plus its not hard to cook from scratch.
If you are lacking in time or are unsure of how to cook quinoa, some stores sell precooked quinoa. You might find this in the grain aisle, refrigerated section, on the salad bar or even in the frozen section.
Pre-cooked quinoa may be a little bit more convenient and make for a faster breakfast recipe.

, If you haven't cooked quinoa before, there is a little secret trick to make it correctly. You'll need to rinse it first before cooking it.Quinoa has a coating on the outside of the seed that acts as a natural pest repellent. It's called saponin. This is a natural compound that tastes bitter and soapy if not removed from the quinoa.
Place quinoa in a fine mesh strainer or a sieve. Run it under cold water, stirring or shaking it to help get all the seeds washed thoroughly.
Transfer your washed quinoa directly to your pot or pan and begin to cook it.
Note that some boxed quinoa or quinoa mixes are already washed or rinsed. You do not need to repeat this step. Make sure to read the instructions on boxes or packages first.

, Many of the breakfast recipes that do use quinoa, call for cooked quinoa. Making it in advance can help cut down on an extra step and cooking time in the mornings.

Consider taking time on the weekend or a free weeknight to go ahead and cook up a batch of quinoa.
Make sure to review what recipes you'll be making for breakfast and note how much cooked quinoa you'll need for the week.
Dry quinoa usually doubles in volume after cooking. 1/2 cup of uncooked or dry quinoa results in about 1 cup of cooked quinoa.
Store quinoa in a airtight container in the refrigerator for about five to seven days. You can also store it in a freezer container for up to three months.

Drain excess water.,
Serve warm.,
Cook the farro in a rice cooker.,
Prepare the farro in a pressure cooker.,
Serve farro in antipasto.,
Prepare farro with pasta.,
Add beans and cheese.,
Sweeten the farro.,
Toss with sauteed mushrooms.",How to Cook Farro," This grain can be purchased in whole, semi-pearled, and pearled forms.Whole-grain farro is the healthiest and contains the most fiber, but it takes longer to cook (about 3 hours) than semi-pearled or pearled farro. It can be rougher on sensitive digestive systems and has an earthier, nuttier flavor than the more processed versions.
Semi-pearled farro cooks in about half the time as whole-grain farro because the bran has been scored, allowing heat to reach the center more quickly. It has less nutrition than whole-grain farro, however.
Pearled farro has had its bran completely removed. It is the quickest yet least nutritious form to consume.;
, Soaking is not necessary for semi-pearled and pearled farro, but it can greatly reduce the overall cooking time for whole farro.


Place the farro in a bowl and cover it with cool water for 8 to 16 hours in the refrigerator., Place the farro in a fine-gap mesh colander and rinse with cool, running water until the water runs clear.


This step should be performed regardless of whether or not you soaked the farro.

,, Make sure that the farro is completely submerged in the water and reduce heat to low or medium-low.


The water should slow to a gentle simmer.
You can also add the farro and water at the same time.Simply allow the water to reach a boil with the farro in it and reduce the heat after a rolling boil is reached, stirring the farro to prevent it from sticking to the side or bottom of the saucepan.

, Exact cooking time can vary from 15 to 40 minutes, depending on the type of farro you use and the texture you prefer.


If you are cooking whole farro and it has not been soaked beforehand, allow for up to 3 hours of boiling to make it digestible.
For a chewy texture, allow dry whole farro to cook for 30 minutes. Allow pre-soaked whole farro to cook for 15 minutes and semi-pearled or pearled farro to cook for 20 minutes.
For a tender texture, allow dry whole farro to cook for 40 minutes. Allow pre-soaked whole farro to cook for roughly 25 to 30 minutes and semi-pearled or pearled farro to cook for roughly 30 minutes.
For a mushy texture, allow dry whole farro to cook for 60 minutes. Allow pre-soaked whole farro to cook for roughly 40 minutes. Semi-pearled and pearled farro should go for 35 to 45 minutes.
Check the texture every 5 to 10 minutes after the first 20 minutes.

, The farro will absorb most of the water, but there may be extra water sitting in the bottom of the saucepan depending on how long you cooked the farro.

, Allow the farro to cool for a few minutes before consumption.

, Add 1 cup (225 ml) farro and 3 cups (750 ml) water to the rice cooker and cook for roughly 45 minutes.


Use soaked whole-grain farro. The farro should be soaked overnight for at least 8 hours.
Set the time manually to 45 minutes. If your rice cooker has optimized settings for various types of grains or rice, use the ""Brown Rice"" setting.

, Use 1 cup (225 ml) farro and 3 cups (750 ml) water and cook for 10 to 15 minutes.


You do not need to soak the farro for this method since it will cook in roughly the same amount of time either way.
Cook the farro for two to three whistles.

, Cook the farro and other ingredients separately before tossing them together and serving.


Toss the cooked farro with 1/4 cup (60 ml) minced red onion, 1/4 cup (60 ml) diced tomatoes, 2 Tbsp (30 ml) extra virgin olive oil and wine vinegar to taste.
Let stand for 30 minutes to 1 hour as the flavors lend.
Fold in fresh parsley and fresh basil before serving.
If desired, you could also add diced peppers, black olives, steamed greens, or cold poached seafood.

, Cook the two separately and toss together just before serving.


Small pasta, like orzo, tends to work best, but any type of pasta can be used.
You can serve the dish warm or cold.
Tomato-based sauces complement the flavor especially well.

, There are a number of dishes you can prepare with farro, beans, and cheese.


Make a type of risotto by sauteing diced onion, diced sweet peppers, minced garlic, and pinto beans. Add cooked farro and pour 2 cups (500 ml) of vegetable or chicken broth into the mixture, 1/2 cup (125 ml) at a time. Cook off each addition and served with Parmesan or Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese.
Add 2 cups (500 ml) of drained, rinsed pinto beans to cooked farro or to farro antipasto. You can also add a small amount of Parmesan cheese or toasted walnuts to the mix.

, Toss room-temperature cooked farro with ricotta cheese and honey to taste. If desired, sprinkle with cinnamon as a garnish.

, Portobello and wild mushrooms can be tossed with warm cooked farro.
